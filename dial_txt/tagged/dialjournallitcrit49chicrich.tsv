		20 20 A FRIEND OF
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		The last will and testament of
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	, bequeathing to
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	an estate amounting to about a
million dollars	MONEY	, only adds another link to the long chain which during his life attached Americans to that great scholar and sage counsellor , and which holds him fast in our affections now that he is dead .

		The mag - nitude of this gift to American education makes it a close second to the benefaction of
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	, and again emphatically symbolizes the bond of unity between the two great branches of our race , a bond that will , we trust , grow ever stronger as the years pass .

		The contribution to mutual esteem made by such evidences of the close relation between
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	is greater than the mere monetary measurement can indicate ; the moral significance far exceeds the material , for behind the gift we recognize the spirit of the giver , and the friendship which it denotes is the more precious part of the gracious act .


Goldwin Smith	PERSON	was forty-one years of age when , in the
summer of 1864	DATE	, he first came to this country .

		The campaign which was to result in
Lincoln	LOCATION	's reelection was then warming up , and our visitor remained until after the crisis was past , and the end of the war clearly in sight .

		From oversea he had followed with deep interest the epic struggle , and had aligned himself with Mill , Bright , and
Cobden	PERSON	, when he espoused the
Union	ORGANIZATION	cause in the face of the sympathy extended toward the Confederacy by the most influential section of English society , and even by such political philosophers as
Gladstone	PERSON	and
Acton	ORGANIZATION	.

		He had the clearness of vision to perceive that the war in its essence was a war against slavery and its intolerably arrogant pretensions ; no academic theorizing about State rights , no superficial sentimentaliz - ing about a brave people rising in defence of their liberties , could befog the issue for his keen analytical judgment ; and even before he became an eye-witness of
America	LOCATION	in action , he did the Federal cause good service by pleading for British neutrality with both tongue and pen , and by such effective pamphleteering as was found in '' Does the Bible Sanction American Slavery ? ''

		and the ' * Letter to a
Whig Member of the Southern Independence Association	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, These were the credentials with which he first landed upon our shores , and which earned for him a warm welcome during a five months ' sojourn which took him to the
Mississippi	LOCATION	and to the seat of war .

		At this time he was no more than a sympathetic English student of American affairs , deeply interested in the his - torical development of our institutions and in the reactions of our political crucible .

		Four years later he cast in his lot with
America	LOCATION	, and for the remaining forty-two years of his life was a denizen of the New World .

		The death of his father and the breaking up of his home , the expiration of his college fellowship and a sense of impaired health , were among the causes that left him free to make a change in his scheme of life ; and he was thinking , he tells us , '' of settling at
Providence	LOCATION	, where I should have had some special facilities for the study of
New England	LOCATION	history . ''

		It was just at this time that Mr.
Andrew Dickson White	PERSON	had undertaken the task of administering the gift of
Ezra Cornell	PERSON	, and of founding a school in central
New York	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
White	PERSON	was then in
Europe	LOCATION	, and , learning one evening at dinner of
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's intentions , at once sought him out , and persuaded him to accept the chair of English history in the new university .

		Thus it was that
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	gained the most dis - tinguished member of its faculty ; and thus it was that Gold win
Smith	PERSON	, taking up his residence in
Ithaca	LOCATION	in
1868	DATE	, when the new institution opened its doors for students , found himself an active worker in a university which had practi - cally none of the attributes suggested by the Old World connotation of that term .

		Cornell opened with a single building of its own , and the use of a huge structure that had been built for hydropathic purposes , and was opportunely left vacant by the failure of that experiment .

		The university was * land poor , '' and its equip - ment was meagre in the extreme .

		Smith refused to accept any salary for his services , and sent to
England	LOCATION	for his private library in order that his students might have the tools indispensable for historical work .

		He also brought stone-carvers from
England	LOCATION	to orna - ment the new buildings as they arose , and ivy from
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	for their walls .

		He had a stone seat placed in the campus , and above it inscribed the motto , '' Above all nations is humanity . ''

		No wonder that
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	has ever since held him in grateful remembrance as its patron saint .

		His reward was found in the welcome accorded him , and in the improvement in health that resulted from this pioneer university life , with its open-air allurements .

		Three years later , his founder 's work for
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	was measurably completed , and he went to
Toronto	LOCATION	, where he established `` The
Cana	LOCATION	- dian Monthly . ''

		From this time on , he made
Toronto	LOCATION	his home , marrying in
1875	DATE	, and establishing his permanent residence in '' The Grange , '' that fine old estate which has been for the past thirty-five years a place of pilgrimage for English and American scholars .

		His con - nection with
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	was by no means severed by the change of residence , however , and he con - tinued , until advancing age made it no longer possible , to return to
Ithaca	LOCATION	every year for a course of lectures .

		As a Canadian , he plunged into the thick of the public life of the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	, and made himself an active force for good in politics .

		His journalistic activities were multi - farious and unceasing , he was a frequent speaker from the platform , and he was a worker upon innumerable boards and commissions affected with a public interest .

		A stout fighter wherever fundamental principles were concerned , he made enemies as well as friends , and became persona non grata to the aristocratic and imperialistic elements in Canadian society through his un - swerving championship of democracy and his persistent advocacy of the opinion that the beat interests of
Canada	LOCATION	were to be furthered by the closest possible union with the republic south of the border .

		But if his name came to be anathema in tory circles , his arguments re - mained unanswered and unanswerable .

		Econ - omic forces always have the last word in political discussion .

		There is in
Canada	LOCATION	, he once said , `` a violently anti-American party which deems itself the patentee of loyalty ... The core of this party consists of descendants of
United Empire Loyal	ORGANIZATION	- ists , who , partly perhaps because it invests them with social interest , devote themselves to blow - ing the embers of that feud .

		But anti-American sentiment is hollow , and easily yields to calls of interest . ''

		He was often called an annexationist by his opponents , but himself repudiated the word as '' something humiliating to
Canada	LOCATION	. ''

		Yet his belief remained firm that '' continental union in a free and honorable way will come .

		It will probably not come in the time of any - one as old as I am ; but it will come . '' ''

		No schemes of Imperial Federationists will defeat nature , whose forces draw toward union .

		Race , language , literature , religion , political institu - tions , social sentiments , and habits are the same on both sides of the line ... It may safely bo said that the connection of each of the
Cana	LOCATION	- dian provinces with the States to the south of it
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL is stronger than that of the Maritime provinces with
Ontario	LOCATION	, or of French Quebec , with either .

		The populations , in short , are rapidly fusing .

		There will soon be nothing to divide them but a political and fiscal line . ''

		Such opinions as these made the heathen rage in many quarters , but it is a vain thing to imagine that nature will be thwarted forever in
North America	LOCATION	by any political or social contrivance .


Goldwin Smith	PERSON	lived and died in the best sense a friend of our own country .

		He was not blind to the evils with which we have to contend , and thus enumerated some of the worst of them : '' The negro difficulty , the spread of lawlessness , the weakness of American states - manship and government , the municipal cor - ruption , the pension list , but , above all , the renunciation of the fundamental principles of the American commonwealth , consequent on the annexation of
the Philippines	LOCATION	, and the entan - glement of the
American Department of State	ORGANIZATION	with the un-American councils and designs of European powers . ''

		This is a list to give the most patriotic of us pause ; and it might be con - siderably extended .

		But in pointing out such failings , a friend like
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	proves himself most faithful , and the fact that , seeing all these evil things , and many others , he could still believe that the soul of good in our nation would ultimately triumph , offers the best possible evidence of the depth of his attachment .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THEODORE
PARKER	PERSON	AS A POLITICAL PHILOSO - PHER was the theme of Mr.
Frank B. Sanborn	PERSON	's centennial address on his old-time friend at the recent celebration held at
West Roxbury	LOCATION	. ''

		I choose for my topic to-day , ' Parker the Political Philoso - pher , ' '' said Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	, '' and I point to
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	and the emancipation of millions of negro slaves as the result of his philosophy in its steady and natural development . ''

		To call
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	the result of anybody 's philosophy , even of Theo - dore
Parker	PERSON	's , is , to put it mildly , a slight misplac - ing of emphasis .

		Lincoln had a plenty of philosophy and of philanthropy of his own , even though we like to recall his undoubted debt to the
New England	LOCATION	free-thinker , whom he greatly admired .

		u The doctrine of
Jefferson	PERSON	and of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	a theory of government of the people , by the people , and for the good of the people was not , '' declared the speaker , '' the original invention of any of these men ; but
Parker	PERSON	did more to formulate it than any American , until
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, after
Parker	PERSON	's death , took up his testimony in the same behalf . ''

		And later he said , in a somewhat different connec - tion : '' I have some right to speak on this point , for I was perhaps more intimate with
Parker	PERSON	in his last four years than any of his other political friends .

		I was in his confidence ; introduced
John Brown	PERSON	to his acquaintance in
1857	DATE	, brought them together again in
March , 1858	DATE	, and had their correspondence pass through my hands in the years of the
Virginia	LOCATION	conspiracy .


Parker	PERSON	was one of the few men in
America	LOCATION	who ventured to predict the downfall of slavery in the nineteenth century , though he did not see how rapid would be its destruction after
Lincoln	PERSON	came to the height of political power . ''

		THE ENDLESS EVOLUTION OF THE WORK OF FICTION , from folk-tale and epic lay to the modern prose romance and the -LRB- sometimes prosy -RRB- essay in psychological analysis , is a thing to contemplate with wonder and with all sorts of interesting conjecture and speculation as to the shape and character of the twenty-fifth-century or the thirtieth-century novel .

		A questionnaire lately sent out to authors and critics by the
London	LOCATION	'' Book Monthly '' elicited various kinds of answers as to '' the chief changes in the English-written novel within recent years , '' and as to the upward or downward tendency of these changes in respect to '' human interest and literary quality . ''

		The replies , so far as published , indicate consider - able difference of opinion , but leave us by no means in despair of the modern novel .

		The decay of sen - timent , or of kid-glove sentimentality , is noted , and the rise of realism and of cool and critical analysis .

		Of Messrs.
Wells	PERSON	and
Galsworthy	PERSON	one reply says : '' They are painting life as it is .

		The old school of amorists and glamorists is dead .

		The defect of the new school is that it lacks imagination and humour .

		It is photographically hard and harsh and brutal , like the daily paper snapshots .

		But sooner or later it will throw up a man of a genius who can fuse sympathy with sincerity and tenderness with truth . ''

		This fusion is not so very hard to find even now , but there is always the delightful possibility of still greater triumphs of genius in any and every quality that makes for excellence .

		THE COLLEGE STUDENT OF A CENTURY AGO would seem a queer creature to the typical collegian of to-day .

		Instead of a maximum of athletics and a minimum of study , the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	or
Yale	ORGANIZATION	or Prince - ton youth of
1810	DATE	was nurtured on copious draughts of learning , of an undeniably bookish sort , and a very meagre or altogether wanting dose of physical culture .

		In some century-old letters written by one
Stephen Salisbury	PERSON	,
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	student , to his parents in
Worcester	LOCATION	, and lately unearthed for the purposes of a paper read before the
American Antiquarian Society	ORGANIZATION	, there are revealed some curious customs of the collegians of that day .

		Culture was valued at its true worth by young
Salisbury	PERSON	's father , who counselled his son to regard his studies not as a task , but as an entertainment .

		His mother advised 6 THE DIAL , -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, him to exercise with the skipping-rope in his room when hindered by rain from taking his customary walk or ride , and she also felt obliged to refuse his request for curtains to his windows , as an extrava - gance .

		Both father and mother exercised a super - vision over their son 's dress and diet and behavior , and even prescribed the times and seasons for having his hair cut .

		But of course the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	student of that day was much younger than the average col - legian of our time .

		The '' liberal education '' of a century ago was imparted at
Cambridge	LOCATION	by a faculty of thirteen professors and four tutors , and the whole body of undergraduates was smaller than the present - day corps of instructors .

		A MUNICIPAL BLUNDER AND A LOST LIBRARY form the theme of an interesting true story .

		The late Judge
John Handley	PERSON	, proprietor of the
Wyoming	LOCATION	Hotel in
Scranton	LOCATION	,
Pa.	LOCATION	, cherished kindly feelings toward his city and intended to leave it the bulk of his large estate .

		But when the city council , against his advice and wishes , permitted the location of cer - tain unsightly stock-yards in front of his hotel , the Judge changed his mind .

		A visit at about this time to
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	,
Va.	LOCATION	, to view certain historic battle - fields , aroused his interest in that city ; and when the time came , soon afterward , for him to pay the debt to
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, it was
Winchester	PERSON	and not
Scranton	LOCATION	that profited by his benevolence to the extent of more than
a million dollars	MONEY	, including a quarter-million - dollar library building , the finest structure of the kind in the South erected by one man .

		The recent completion of this handsome monument to Judge
Handley	PERSON	's memory shows it to be in the French Renaissance style , executed in a buff shade of
Indiana	LOCATION	limestone , with terra cotta roofing and a noble dome sheathed in copper a fireproof building throughout .

		As soon as funds are available for the purpose , the interior equipment will be completed , the bookshelves stocked , the successful applicants for positions in this palace of literature will be placed in charge of its treasures , and the
Handley Memorial Library	ORGANIZATION	will take its place on the firing line against the forces of ignorance and materialism and low ideals and sordid interests .

		THE PERSISTENCE OF A MINOR ANGLICISM that seems to be growing in favor , in defiance of gram - mar and logic , claims a word of comment .

		In the letter of an English correspondent at
Rome	LOCATION	we note three occurrences of the peculiar idiom within a space of fourteen lines .

		The letter has to do with a certain distinguished American traveller , of whom we read : '' ... two keen , blue eyes , now wide open behind the gold pince-nez , are looking searchingly into yours , as though the owner is weighing your worth in a single glance .

		Then he talks .

		His voice is a little hoarse ... as though he is addressing a public meeting ... The muscles of his face con - tract and relax and contract again as though he is in acute pain . ''

		Three instances we have here of '' as though '' -LRB- which , by the way , were better a.s if '' -RRB- introducing a supposition contrary to fact and fol - lowed by the indicative , the mood of positive asser - tion .

		`` As though he were '' -LRB- or , better , `` as if he were '' -RRB- would be used , and correctly usi-l , l.v ninety - nine out of every hundred American writers , and not improbably by the hundredth writer also .

		What is the peculiar construction of the English ear , that it should not feel the jar of this solecism ?

		THE CIRCULATION OF HUMANE LITERATURE 18 becoming a prominent factor in the general move - ment for the better treatment of animals .

		The
American Humane Education Society	ORGANIZATION	, the pioneer organization in this important work , has developed a plan for sending out travelling libraries through our rural districts , the books to be circulated chiefly under the direction of local school boards , ami with no charge to readers .

		Thirty books have been chosen by a committee composed of Dr.
Francis H. Rowley	PERSON	, of
Boston	LOCATION	, the society 's president ; Dr.
Albert Leffingwell	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	; Miss
Sarah J. Eddy	PERSON	of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	; and Mrs.
Mary F. Lowell	PERSON	of

		The movement is a good one , and if systematically followed up can hardly fail of a wholesome effect upon the younger genera - tion ... THE EXHILARATING TILT OF THE LITERARY FREE-LANCE is surely , thinks the novice , a pleasant and a pulse-quickening exercise .

		In a volume entitled '' Vocations for the Trained Woman , '' published by the Women 's
Educational and Industrial Union of Boston	ORGANIZATION	, occurs this alluring passage : '' It may be said in general that it is a comparatively easy thing for a very ordinary writer , with very ordinary indus - try , to make

		It is a very easy and a very speedy matter to write a thousand words .

		It is not a matter of time or difficulty to get the material to fill a thousand words .

		Such a club would be some - thing of a novelty with us .

		A WORD ABOUT THE THEATRE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB- ''

		To make us pity his characters when they are vile or love them when they are noxious , to invent excuses for them in situations when they can not be excused , in a word , to lie about his characters , this is for the dramatist the one unpardonable sin .

		To it must be added a second , almost equally great to allure the audience to generalize falsely in regard to life at large , from the specific circumstances of his play . ''

		These wise words were printed in THE DIAL of
June 16	DATE	.

		I wish they might be inscribed in large letters above every stage .

		On the page before , however , the same writer repeats a common saying , that `` there is no such thing per se as an immoral subject for a play '' ; and here I must dissent .

		Yesterday I saw Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	play ''
Becky	PERSON	Sharp '' in
Denver	LOCATION	.

		She acted , I thought , with consummate skill .

		The piece is '' orthodox '' enough , taken straight out of '' classic '' fiction , and the house was filled with young and old , men and women , who seemed to approve .

		Nevertheless , were I the only living person who thought it , I should maintain that the play in general , and some of its situations in particular , are absolutely offensive .

		I have never seen ''
Monna Vanna	PERSON	'' on the stage , but am heartily in accord with the English authorities who excluded it therefrom .

		We are sometimes told about the high moral purpose of such productions ; I do not believe that they have any .

		We are told that it is necessary to know all phases of life .

		It is necessary for the chemist to know a certain ill-smelling phosphorus compound ; but even his brother chemists would be outraged if he called them together for entertainment and then turned loose a quantity of this substance .

		The opinion I have expressed may be that of a small and relatively insignificant minority .

		Nevertheless it may be worth expressing .

		Regard it , if you like , as a matter of psychology .

		I go to see
Maude Adams	PERSON	in ''
Peter	PERSON	Pan '' and What Every Woman Knows , '' and come away delighted ; I go to see Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	, and in spite of her great skill am disgusted and depressed .

		Is it not possible that the nawe reactions of one who is no expert in the drama have a certain meaning and value ?

		THE INACCURACY OF `` SUFFRAGETTE . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your issue of
June 16	DATE	occurs an article by Mr.
Paul Shorey	PERSON	, entitled '' Mill Revealed in His Letters . ''

		On page 418 this writer allows himself to be betrayed into the inaccuracy of using the term '' suffragette '' with reference to the woman 's movement of Mill 's day .

		This should not be suffered to pass without a protest .

		The term , belittling and derisive in its origin and philo - logical connotation , is an unfortunate neologism of Hooligan antecedents , and has no application to any person of Mill 's time , nor to the majority of the advo - cates of woman suffrage to-day .

		It is an expression which was hurled by
London	LOCATION	rowdies at Mrs.
Pankhurst	PERSON	and her group of so-called '' millitant suffragists '' in
England	LOCATION	, and belongs to no others whatsoever .

		That this militant group , in a spirit of bravado , chose to accept a title insultingly applied to them , does not bind other woman suffragists .

		The movement in behalf of a full recognition of civil and political equality between men and women is as serious and free from hysteria as any other of the political movements of our day , and is entitled to the same decency in methods of con - troversy . ''

		Suffragette , '' as a general term for women who are identified with this movement , is as inaccurate as it is unwarranted .

		THE L.IFE OP A STRENUOUS PEACE.M \ K i i : .

		* '' A pugnacious pacificist '' was the phrase sometimes applied to Sir
Randal Cremer	PERSON	, the life-long laborer in the cause of international peace whose lamented death in
1908	DATE	has been followed now by a careful summary of his pub - lic services from the pen of his old friend and associate , Mr.
Howard Evans	PERSON	. ''

		Sir
Randal Cremer	PERSON	: His Life and Work '' presents , in three hundred and fifty pages , an enviable record of good works in many departments of philanthropy , but especially in those that relate to the pro- motion of harmony in the transaction of the world 's affairs .

		That he was , however , by no means a man of one idea is plain from the wide range of public questions to which he turned his attention , compulsory and free education , public libraries , commons preservation , registra - tion reform , taxation of ground values , nation - alization of the land , religious equality , the right of free speech , the deliverance of trade unions from judge-made law , the protection of weaker races , and the emancipation of oppressed peo - ples .

		But it is , of course , as the founder and for many years the head of the
International Arbitration League	ORGANIZATION	that
Cremer	PERSON	will be best remembered .

		From the ranks of the lowly and oppressed , as might have been expected , this champion of the cause of right against might fought his way upward .

		From an early page of the biography we copy the following :
Cremer	PERSON	once gave the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	some graphic reminiscences of the home of poverty in which he was brought up , when he opposed the proposal of Sir
Michael Hicks-Beach	PERSON	to levy a shilling duty on corn .

		He said that when his mother , who kept a dame school , had only five or
six shillings	MONEY	a week on which to keep herself , him , and his two sisters , a two-pound loaf cost eightpence .

		For breakfast the children had three thin slices of bread with a very thin scraping of butter , and a cup of weak tea without milk or sugar .

		Dinner con - sisted of boiled duff flour and water stewed together and boiled like a pudding with potatoes , and perhaps once a week an ounce or two of meat .

		The tea was like the breakfast , and usually the children had to go to bed without supper , hungry as wolves . ''

		The eighty years of
Cremer	PERSON	's life were so largely filled with public and philanthropic labors that it is difficult to think of him as hav - ing any private and domestic life of his own .

		He became a buil < let - by trade , and was twice married , though it does not apjM ` ar that he allowed himself many minutes out of the day for the enjoyment of his home .

		In fact , we read of him : '' Few political men have lived so lonely a life as
Cremer	PERSON	in his later years .

		His large office was in reality his sleeping chamber .

		At the back of a book-case was a turn-down bed , which apparently he made himself ; a small gas-stove enabled him to prepare his own break - fast .

		For the rest of the day he obtained his meals at the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	or elsewhere .

		This , however , was by no means an unpleasant hermitage .

		The rich foliage of the extensive gardens altogether hid the houses on the opposite side of the square .

		Only from his third floor front was it possible to get a glimpse of the dome of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	's , and the graceful fieche of the Law Courts in the Strand . ''

		Though he failed to secure a seat in
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment until he was fifty-seven years old , he had from early manhood been interested in public questions and had early conceived the project of international arbitration as a means of adjust - ing international differences .

		In some scanty notes on his personal history ,
Cremer	PERSON	himself has written , referring to the time of his young manhood : '' One evening there was a lecture on ' Peace , ' prob - ably given by a lecturer of the original
Peace Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		The speaker advocated the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means instead of war .

		I listened with rapt attention , and next day I discussed the matter with two or three shop-mates who had been present .

		They pooh-poohed the idea , and declared that the world had always settled its disputes by force and would con - tinue to do so .

		That lecture sowed the seed of
Inter	LOCATION	- national Arbitration in my mind , though the word arbitration ' had hardly been heard . ''

		Soon after the young apprentice had listened to that lecture , which seems to have been an epoch-making event in his life , he took up his residence in
Brighton	LOCATION	, where he joined a work - men 's institute in which
Frederick Robertson	PERSON	, the eloquent
Brighton	LOCATION	preacher , was warmly interested , and he frequently attended
Robert	PERSON	- son 's church .

		At
Brighton	LOCATION	it was , too , that he made his first political speech , on the occasion of a parliamentary election .

		In
1852	DATE	he removed to
London	LOCATION	, where he soon became active in the cause of shorter hours for labor an activity that lost him his position , but did not prevent his securing another .

		It was in
1870	DATE	, when
England	LOCATION	and the world were stirred by the outbreak of war between
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, that
Creraer	PERSON	formed his Workmen 's
Peace Committee	ORGANIZATION	which afterward developed into the
International Arbitration League	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its first important work was the draft -
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 9 ing of an '' Outline of a Plan for the Establish - ment of a
High Court of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, '' which largely anticipated the work of the
Hague Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of
Cremer	PERSON	's self-imposed missions to various countries in the cause of universal peace , of his three visits to
Washington	LOCATION	, and of his life-long zeal and industry in the work to which he had put his hand , Mr.
Evans	PERSON	's pages give a detailed account and are likely to find many appreciative readers at this time .

		Concerning the peace party 's attitude toward the Boer War , the fol - lowing from our author 's pen is of interest . ''

		Throughout
Europe	LOCATION	the British people were re - garded as a nation of sanctimonious hypocrites .

		At that time a Briton travelling abroad found it desirable to hide his origin as far as he could , which was not always easy .

		With the solitary exception of
Yves Guyot	PERSON	, no man in all
France	LOCATION	whose opinion was worth having had a word to say in our favour .

		One of my most bitter recollections is that in
Geneva	LOCATION	, that ancient fastness of freedom , I sat in the English Garden , on an Easter holi - day , watching a grand procession of the trades , and was suddenly confronted with the collection-box in aid of the Boer women and children .

		I gave my contribution with tears of shame .

		For the men whose pride and obstinacy brought us to such humiliation there can be no forgive - ness , for they trailed the fair fame of our own dear land in the dust before all
Europe	LOCATION	at the instigation of polyglot devotees of Mammon , who had degraded and debauched the Press alike in
England	LOCATION	and
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		The British nation which went trafficking in the crisis of the war fever has since learned by bitter experience that it can not make war on the cheap , and to this day it is suffering from the consequences of its folly . ''

		The award of the
Nobel Peace Prize	ORGANIZATION	to
Cremer	PERSON	in
1903	DATE	, and his bestowal of it upon the Arbitration League as an endowment fund , are matters of recent history .

		His hesitating acceptance of the knighthood twice offered him by Sir
Henry Campbell-Bannerman	PERSON	, in the lat - ter 's term as prime minister , was a sign on
Cre	ORGANIZATION	- mer 's part that , though he doubted the propriety of all such titular distinctions , he appreciated the offer as an indirect recognition , in the highest quarters , of the value of the work accomplished by the advocates of peace .

		Rather surprising to many , in view of woman 's influence in the cause he had most at heart , was his vehement opposition to woman suffrage .

		He even issued a tract , entitled '' Shall Men or Women Rule the World , '' which gave thirty - three reasons why women should not vote ; and in another called '' Some of the Legal Privileges of Women '' he argued that , instead of being treated unjustly by the laws of the land , English women enjoyed certain important legal rights and immunities denied to men .

		Another characteristic aversion of his was , as his biographer tells us , '' his dislike to the tip system by which waiters were paid , which he regarded as degrading and demoralizing to the recipients .

		Of course , he did not object to a fair wage for any class of men , but he held that the employer should pay his own servants .

		More than once when arranging a social function he stipulated for the payment of a fixed sum to waiters , and nothing roused his resentment more than to find the men who had been thus paid already cadging for further payment by the guests . ''

		Mr.
Evans	PERSON	's long association with
Cremer	PERSON	he has been chairman of the Council of the Arbi - tration League since
1877	DATE	makes him the best possible historian of his friend 's public services .

		The book , published for the
International School of Peace	ORGANIZATION	, is well calculated to further its cause .

		A good portrait of
Cremer	PERSON	, and other illustra - tions , are to be found within its covers .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		THE NAVAL , CONQUEST OF
CANADA	LOCATION	.

		* Since its organization , three or four years ago , the
Chainplain Society of Toronto	ORGANIZATION	has fully justified its existence .

		Its publications re - prints and original documents have come out more slowly than was anticipated ; but this has not been an unmixed evil , as it has made for fuller and more careful editorial treat - ment .

		The Society has so far been most for - tunate in the men selected to edit its volumes , and never more so than in its latest publication .

		No one could have been found better equipped to edit the '' Logs of the Conquest of
Canada	LOCATION	'' than the author of '' The Fight for
Canada	LOCATION	. ''

		Colonel Wood admirably combines a clear , crisp , and attractive style with scholarly balance and clear-headedness , and a genius for extracting marrow from the most unpromising bones of history .

		This genius was never more happily applied than in the present case , for , as he justly says , '' nothing is drier than a ship 's log ; not even Statutes at Large or the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle . ''

		That these logs have been made to yield an attractive as well as most valuable story of the naval side of the campaigns in
Canada	LOCATION	, is no mean tribute to the skill of the author .

		The book is divided into two equal parts , the latter consisting of selections from the logs of His Majesty 's ships in the
Louisburg	LOCATION	,
Quebec	LOCATION	, and
Montreal	LOCATION	campaigns of
1758	DATE	,
1759	DATE	, and
1760	DATE	; and the former of editorial equipment , embracing a very full introduction , bibliog - * THE Loos OF THE CONQUEST OF

William Wood	PERSON	.

The Champlain Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		10 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, raphy , and cartography .

		Three charts , and a plan to illustrate the logs , are placed in a pocket at the end of the volume .

		Why , asks Colonel Wood , is it worth while , and very well worth while , to edit a selection from the logs of the ships engaged in the cam - paigns that determined the British conquest of
Canada	LOCATION	?

		And he gives this answer : '' These logs are the simplest and least self-conscious of all records ; because they are the record of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	's work there ; because the fleets were relatively stronger forces than the armies ; because , in addition to their own work , they gave their armies enormous advantages over the enemy in every detail of ordnance , commissariat , transport , mobility , scouting , and military intelligence ; because , as all the seas in the world are interdependent , every squadron of the
British Navy	ORGANIZATION	was an integral part of the single overwhelming force which was then the prime deciding factor in the greatest of all imperial wan waged for oversea dominion ; and , finally , because the public , and the Canadian public in particular , have not yet found out the one true point of view .

		They all admit that the conquest was effected by the joint forces of the
United Service	ORGANIZATION	, and not by either the
Army	ORGANIZATION	or
Navy	ORGANIZATION	alone .

		But the stock saying , that
Wolfe	PERSON	was supported by a fleet , ' completely inverts the nature and functions of the two constituent parts of this
United Service	ORGANIZATION	.

		What really happened was that
Saunders	PERSON	, whose great fleet was working out one phase of a world - wide amphibious war , was supported by
Wolfe	PERSON	, whose small army was used as a local landing party at
Quebec	LOCATION	. ''

		The primary object of Colonel Wood 's scholarly Introduction is , therefore , to establish his contention that the conquest of
Canada	LOCATION	was the work of the army and the
navy	ORGANIZATION	in coopera - tion , and that the dominating force was the fleet .

		To this argument he brings an imposing array of proof , and incidentally affords us many graphic pictures of life on board His Majesty 's ships of war in the middle of the eighteenth century .

		Men were recruited by '' pressing '' and by `` presting . ''

		Pressing was taking a man whether he liked it or not ; presting was giving him a shilling as a '' prest , '' by accepting which he bound himself to be '' prest '' or '' ready '' to serve .

		The press-gang , under an officer , attended to both forms of recruiting .

		Sanitation on board ship was almost unknown .

		An official return of the period gives the following startling results : Of 184,893 seamen and marines employed dur - ing the war ,
1512	DATE	were killed in action or by accident , and 133,708 died by sickness or were missing !

		There was , as
Colonel Wood	ORGANIZATION	says , `` nothing new in the sickness and discomfort induced by bilge-water .

		The oldest genuine sea - song known in the English tongue describes exactly what happened during the Canadian campaigns on board ships whose logs contained no entries of 4 Employed starting salt water , ' or * Ventulater keept working . ' '

		A sak of strawe were there ryght good , For some must lyg them in theyr hood ; I had as lefe be in the wood , Without or meat or drynk : For when that we shall go to bedde , The pumpe was nygh our beddes hede ; A man were as good be ded , As smell thereof the stynk . '

		The strange thing is that when ships and crews were so manifestly better with a clean bilge , boiled drinking-water , and a working ventilator , such simple precautions were so much neglected . ''

		The following account of the '' fore-bitter '' -LRB- corresponding to the sing-song of the present day -RRB- will be of general interest . ''

		The singer took his stand on the fore-bitts , which were massive ends of timber , rising to a convenient height from the deck close to the fore-mast He had no instrumental accompaniment .

		He sang his hatchet - made verses to monotonous airs , and he nearly always wound up with a rather obvious moral .

		But he and his audience knew nothing of self-conscious pose .

		Singer , song , and audience were all intent on the direct expres - sion of a seaman 's idea of his own life , its dangers and troubles , its aspiration and achievement , and its ideal of a home .


Dibdin	PERSON	's songs , of course , were never popular at sea -LRB- as
Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's have never been in the army -RRB- ; though they have taught innumerable landsmen more tilings in heaven and earth than were dreamt of in the seaman 's own philosophy .

		The really popular airs and verses were , like all other folklore , the variants of compositions by unknown singers , who received and handed down by oral tradition whatever best suited them and their audience . ''

		One more quotation , from a letter written in
1756	DATE	by a naval officer to a young cousin about to enter the service , is eloquent of the condi - tions which gently-nurtured midshipmen had to face a century and a half ago . ''

		Your light for day and night is a small candle , which is often stuck at the side of your platter for meals , for want of a better convenience .

		Your victuals are salt and often bad ; and if you would vary the mode of dressing them you must cook yourself .

		I would recommend you always to have tea and sugar ; the rest you must trust to , for you 'll scarce find room for any more than your chest and hammock , and the latter at times you must carry upon deck to defend you from small shot , unless you keep one of the sailors in fee with a little brandy .

		Low company is the bane of all young men ; but in a man-of-war you have the collected filth of jails ... You will find some little outward appearance of religion ... and
Sunday	DATE	prayers , but the congregation is generally drove together by the boatswain , who neither spares oaths nor blows . ''

		Altogether , these '' Logs of the Conquest of
Canada	LOCATION	, '' with the double light they throw on the operations of the fleet at
Louisburg	LOCATION	,
Quebec	LOCATION	, and
Montreal	LOCATION	, on the one hand , and on the his - tory , character , and personnel of tin -
navy	ORGANIZATION	, on the other , form a most important contrilmtimi to American historical literature .

		THE DIAL 11 GOING TO THE ANT .

		* High-water mark in American biological scholarship has certainly been attained in Pro- fessor
William Morton Wheeler	PERSON	's extensive and scholarly work upon `` Ants , their Structure , Development , and Behavior '' -LRB- The
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the result of a decade of uninterrupted study of these most interesting of all the so-called lower forms of life .

		The voluminous world-literature of the subject the extent of which may be judged by the fact that the author lists seventy pages of titles has also been ransacked to bring together all avail - able information supplementary to the author 's own intensive and thoroughgoing investigations .

		The work appeals to a wide range of readers .

		The zoologists and entomologists will find all of its pages replete with learning , and invaluable as an authoritative source of trustworthy informa - tion on all phases of myrmecology .

		The general reader interested in natural science will discover that the larger part of the book is devoted to sub - jects of unusual interest , written with clearness and remarkable freedom from special pleading for pet evolutionary hypotheses or bias toward unproved theories , and from sensationalism .

		While it is strictly scientific in its search for the truth , the reader can not fail to be infected by the author 's warm enthusiasm for his subject .

		The ants are a dominant group among insects , as a result of their unusual variability , wide distribution , numerical ascendency , longevity , abandonment of detrimental specialization , and great versatility in their relations to plants and other animals .

		They exhibit a high degree of social organization , based upon a remarkable structural and functional differentiation among the members of the colony .

		They thus exhibit , among still existing types of colonies , many phases in the probable course of evolution of the complicated polymorphisms and unique diversi - ties of instinct .

		The author discusses , among other interesting topics , the development of ants and the remarkable maternal instincts found in queens and workers , the light thrown upon the past history of ants by forms found fossil in amber , and the structure and construction of ants ' nests .

		Other chapters are devoted to those rare and primitive groups of ants which repre - sent the oldest existing expression of social life , the stage in which to use
Maeterlinck	ORGANIZATION	's words we have passed from the '' precarious and incomplete egoistic to a social life with its * ANTS .

		The philoprogenitive instincts and social habits of ants have made possible intimate rela - tions between themselves and other animals , resulting in a perplexing assemblage of assasins , scavengers , satellites , guests , commensals , and parasites , which are found in their nests .

		In - deed , nearly four hundred species of beetles and other insects are amicably treated , licked , fondled , fed , and even reared , by ants !

		The instincts of ants form a fascinating subject for the naturalist , the physiologist , the psychologist , and surely also for the sociologist of biological sympathies .

		This subject is treated at length from an objective standpoint .

		The encyclopaedic nature of the work is enhanced by appendices dealing with the methods of collecting ants and of keeping them under observation in formi - caries .

		A key to the genera and sub-genera of North American ants , and a list of described North American species , with their distribution , are also given .

		Practical methods of extermin - ating noxious ants are also discussed .

		The work is authoritative , encyclopaedic , intensely interest - ing to the biologist and naturalist , and exception - ally attractive to all who are interested in natural history .

THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
July 1	DATE	, in big account of '' The Short Story in English , '' traee - tin - progress < > -LRB- this type through tin - his - tory of its changing fashions , beginning with the religious tales of Anglo-Saxon times and con - tinuing through the products of the centuries , moulded by various influences , to the result of these shaping forces seen in '' the powerful en - gine for the expression of life '' the extremely technicalized short story of to-day .

		The stages in this development are interestingly marked .

		The Roman Church influence is succeeded by the influence of mediaeval
France	LOCATION	, with its fab - liaux , lais , and contes devots .

		Then Chaucer , renascent
Italy	LOCATION	, and
France	LOCATION	, in a new wave of tendency , exert their sway .

		The English essay - ists next take a hand in the shaping of the form , until writers in the sweep of the romantic move - ment prepare the way for Poe the first indi - vidual of commanding importance in the history of short-story writing .

		After
Poe	PERSON	, the emphasis on technique , though intensifying the effect , artificializes the form , as is well recognized in the typical work of the day .

		What the present tendencies are , and what the future will bring forth , seem not too difficult to judge . ''

		Our modern short story began as technique for a worthy effect .

		In lesser hands , at least , it is degenerat - ing into a technique whose effect is merely technical .

		The specific word , the rapid introduction , the stressed climax , the careful focus and the studied tone , are too often the masters , not the servants , of the story .

		Facil - ity is widespread , artificiality rampant .

		Scores of well - known short-story writers prepare to ascend their little peaklet of narrative accoutered like
Tartarin	PERSON	in his Alpine regalia , equipped not for their Rigi but Mont Blanc .

		In so recent a collection as ' Plain Tales from the Hill .

		- , ' the effort is already as patent as the success .

		When our tastes are a little more jaded by the nervous endeavor of the modern short-story , many and many a successful tale will seem as false in taste as the vapidities of the Euphuists .

		A less labored story must come back .

		The movement will be towards the ideal of Chaucer and away from the strenuosity of
Poe	PERSON	. ''

		It is a far cry , in Professor
Canby	PERSON	's narrative , from Aelfric to ''
O. Henry	PERSON	. ''

		A wide gap of centuries has to be spanned .

		It is no easy task to pioneer in the detailed and careful tracing of his type through such a period , and the writer in several instances lays himself open to criticism : but he has dared and done , and done well .

		He has written seriously yet interestingly of our most significant modern literary type and of its development from its origins ; and he has accom - plished a praiseworthy feat in linking its vital present with its instructive past .

		Like Professor
Canby	PERSON	,
Miss Clara Whitmore	PERSON	has devoted herself to the study of a special class of fiction .

		He , however , interests us chiefly by tracing the evolution of a type ; she , by the endeavor in empliasi/e a < vrtain point of view .

		Many women writers have sunk into an oblivion from which , she claims , their intrinsic merit should have preserved them : and she believes this misfortune due to the fact that most books on literature have been written from the man 's standpoint .

		Her book has been written from the woman 's point of view .

		To portray women writ - ers , and women 's and the woman 's outlook upon life and its interpretation , is her aim .

		Just what the feminine viewpoint is , however , seems as difficult to state definitely in a treatise on fiction as in a study of life .

		The task , perhaps , belongs more properly to the psychologist than to the literary historian ; and our author for the most part leaves it to the psychologist or to someone else , and in this respect piques without satisfying our interest .

		Once or twice she comes boldly out to emphasize certain char - acteristically feminine qualities , as introspection and quickness in grasping motives and passions underlying action .

		Woman 's view of life as represented in fiction is shown , however , to be largely objective .

		Women have developed the historical novel ; have brought the novel of mys - tery to a high state of perfection , but have left the most enduring stamp on literature as realists .

		All of which goes , perhaps , to suggest a not uncharacteristic inconsistency .

		It should be noted that this book portrays a succession of personalities , and that the author 's intention is evidently to reveal or suggest the type through them , rather than to regard the type as the main thing and them as incidental or merely illustra - tive .

		The method of the writer here , then , is just the reverse of that of Professor
Canby	PERSON	; and hers is a far simpler task .

		Miss
Whitmore	PERSON	's book is an enlarged master 's thesis ; and it has some of the defects of its qualities .

		It suggests the student rather than the real critic in its frequent and lengthy citations of the opinions of others .

		An irritating rather than a serious fault is the overlooking of several misprints like '' Maria Edgewood '' -LRB- p. 102 -RRB- and ''
Rodney Crawley	PERSON	'' -LRB- p. 164 -RRB- .

		A matter of greater im - portance is the allotting of so little space as a couple of pages to so great a figure as
George Eliot	PERSON	.

		Generally , the strength of the work does not lie in the treatment of the jrreatM writers .

		Perhaps the chief value of the book lies in its bringing to light again forgotten or half - forgot - ten names such as Margaret of
Newcastle	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Haywood	PERSON	, and the ''
Sidney Biddulph	PERSON	'' of Mrs.
Sin	PERSON	- ridan : in its suggesting the real importance of time-dimmed figures in their contribution to the history and development of
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 13 fiction ; and its emphasizing frequently both the salient characteristics of a writer 's work and her relation to the general scheme .

		As a handy reference-book , and a chart of the woman-novelist field previous to
1865	DATE	, it has its useful place .

		Characteristics of the work of Professor
Burton	PERSON	are generally recognized .

		In his study of the '' Masters of the English Novel '' it is not his object primarily to grub for the origin of a type and laboriously to track its evolution ; nor does he attempt to force a way into brambly and neglected by-paths of literature seeking for modest merit lowly laid .

		His course stretches over literary heights .

		There he paces with the practised tread and assured step of one on con - genial ground and at home in high places , yet not unmindful of the world below and of an author 's relation to it .

		He treats the greatest novelists
Richardson	PERSON	through
Hardy	PERSON	show - ing what part they played in the development of the novel , and what part the novel played as a depicter of the spirit of the times .

		One feels that the writer is no novice at his task .

		At times , however , one pauses long before accepting some of his critical dicta .

		Remembering some of the most famous or notorious novels of the century , one may question , for instance , such a generalization as this : '' The novel seems to have been the special literary instrument in the eighteenth century for the propaga - tion of altruism ; here lies its deepest significance . ''

		Also , one may think Fielding too much depre - ciated in comparison with
Smollett	PERSON	.

		Condem - nation of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's opinion of the plot of ``
Tom Jones	PERSON	, '' and invidious praise of
Smollett	PERSON	's characterization , are judgments in which not all would care to coincide .

		They do , however , prepare us for Professor
Burton	PERSON	's appreciation of
Dickens	PERSON	, and for his mention of ''
Henry Esmond	PERSON	'' and The Tale of Two Cities '' in the same breath , naming the latter first .

		The book is excellently appreciative of
Hardy	LOCATION	, and fairly so of
Scott	PERSON	and
Stevenson	PERSON	; and if it lauds
Dickens	PERSON	in accordance with the grow ing fashion of our day , it also does justice to
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		One finds in the book the reflective work of a class-room lecturer , vivifying familiar names and writing stimulating criticism with depth of purpose and an attractive style . ''

		Leading American Novelists , '' by Professor
John Erskine	PERSON	, is a needed book in a promising field .

		The value of American fiction , in its scope , development , and significance , has been so inadequately recognized that a worthy con - tribution to the subject is deserving of especial note .

		Professor
Erskine	PERSON	has focused his atten - tion on six figures :
Brown	PERSON	,
Cooper	PERSON	,
Simms	PERSON	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	,
Bret Harte	PERSON	.

		To each of these he allots a chapter , headed by a full-page illustration of the author dealt with .

		Such an arrangement , with its suggestion of emphasized mechanical divisions of the subject into just so many or just so few parts , has this disadvan - tage that it may recall to mind the method of the grade-school text-book ; also , where only few authors are chosen for criticism and where not all are of the highest class , it accentuates the relative unimportance of the minor figures .


William Gilmore Simms	PERSON	.

		for instance , seems hardly to deserve the height of his pedestal ; and to devote almost a seventh of one 's space to
Harriet Beecher Stowe	PERSON	appears too wanton an assertion of the poverty of our American pro- duct in fiction .

		More lives , more life , and less protracted criticism in the case of minor work , would have better covered the field and revealed a truer sense of proportion .

		In the details of his criticism , however , one follows Professor
Erskine	PERSON	with confidence .

		Although he disclaims an attempt at originality in final judgments , endeavoring to render the opinion of the best critics of to-day rather than his own individual impressions , he deserves commendation for show - ing excellent taste in choosing his sources , and , instead of tiresomely quoting , for fusing all his material into a well-rendered and generally con - vincing form .

		What is said in different parts of his book especially of
Brown	PERSON	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Cooper	PERSON	, and
Bret Harte	PERSON	is illuminating , and suggests the taste of the true critic .

		He is generally consistent in his critical attitude .

		The separate stars in his galaxy of critical opinion go together to make up a `` firmament of light . ''

		One would especially recommend the book for its well-stated and deep critical generalizations ; and its author for giving evidence of possession of the '' seeing eye , '' and for revealing himself as a worthy seeker of the light a consistent follower of the Gleam .

		14 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, dices which we hope to obliterate ?

		Perhaps such a use might be made of the works that have resulted from Mrs.
Catherine Seipp	PERSON	's prizes , offered in
1904	DATE	, for the best essays on the German Element in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		But if interest and pride in ancestry and nationality are themselves justifiable and who will doubt this ?

		then Professor
Faust	PERSON	's work on this subject is justified .

		And for the Germans , more than for other nationalities perhaps , such a summary of their worth and achievements was called for because , since the employment of German mercenaries in the British army during the Revolutionary War , there has existed more or less unreasoning prejudice against them , manifested under the ignorant application of the would-be contemptuous epithet '' Dutch '' to all persons of Teutonic origin , saving
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Saxons and Scandinavians .

		Inevitably , the task set by Mrs.
Seipp	PERSON	must ever be an incompleted one .

		But for all that , the beginning could not be put off indefinitely .

		Several earlier attempts had been made to sur - vey the German element in the
United States	LOCATION	, and a number of Germanistic societies have been engaged for twenty years in gathering materials in particular German centres nota - bly the German-American Historical Society of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Faust	PERSON	found , there - fore , much material ready to hand , while for some ten years he had been preparing for the undertaking .

		In the nature of the case , he could not visit and examine personally all the German settlements and institutions in our country , but he has shown due diligence in gathering by correspondence much first-hand material .

		In the two large volumes of his work he treats his subject first historically and then topically .

		This leads naturally to some repetition ; but with so large a mass of material it was certainly well to resort to this method of making it accessible from different points of view .

		It is not remarkable that Professor
Faust	PERSON	's work often assumes the tone of a defence and a eulogy .

		Occasionally this tone might have been subdued .

		In the opening chapter , for instance , the claim of
Mercator	ORGANIZATION	, a native of
Belgium	LOCATION	, of ~ yrker in
Ericson	PERSON	's problematic voyage to
America	LOCATION	, of Fabian , a Swiss , as representatives of the German element would justify extending he claim to include the entire Anglo-Saxon portion of the English-Scotch settlers .

		But on the whole this tendency to claim credit is not unpleasantly obvious .

		Neither does a careful inspection reveal many hooks for the little tags of detailed critic ` ism .

		The contents table is clear and full , and the illus - trative plates and maps and tables an -
IIUMIIT	PERSON	- ous and genuinely helpful as a rule .

		Firmian -LRB- p. 235 , I. -RRB- is not a principality ;
Waldo	PERSON	's son lived in

C. B. Schmidt	PERSON	,
Immigration Commissioner	ORGANIZATION	of the
A. T. & S. F. Ky.	ORGANIZATION	, in establishing German col - onies , might well have been mentioned .

		But these are very minor matters .

		Professor
Faust	PERSON	has brought his material down to date , and has furnished a work that may almost be called monumental .

		He writes simply and clearly .

		He has presented very justly a survey of the really notable contribution of
Germany	LOCATION	to the commercial , religious , and edu - cational life of the
United States	LOCATION	, a survey that may serve both for the gratification of the patriotic German here or in
Germany	LOCATION	, and for the illumination of the non-Germans who too often underestimate that contribution .

		NEW STUDIES ix FRENCH LITERATURE .

		* In view of the studies of French literature by
Saintsbury	LOCATION	and
Dowden	PERSON	to mention only two , and the translation into English of
Brune	PERSON	- tie 're 's Manual , a new work on so comprehensive and important a subject must show cause for its appearance .

		Mrs.
Anna Lemp Konta	PERSON	's '' His - tory of French Literature '' does not lack in comprehensiveness , certainly , since it extends from the oath of Strasburg to '' Chantecler '' which , by the way , is steadily misprinted '' Chanticler '' in her pages .

		Nor is it impossi - ble to say some pleasant things of the book .

		In general , and especially when dealing with the modern period , the author exhibits an intelli < : < nt grasp upon essentials and in a sketchy way makes a story that , while very readable , is not untrust - worthy because of ignorance or eccentricity .

		She is , too , keenly aware of latter-day manifestations .

		Her method admits of frequent quotation , and this , in a work for the most part frankly deriva - tive , adds to its value , and has been used in the main with discretion , although at times it makes the page a patchwork rather than one blending .

		THE DIAL 15 tions which such a work , to become first-rate , demands , would be going altogether too far .

		There is a failure in English idiom which at times gives a naive effect to the style ; and one could write a volume concerning disagreements and corrections , when it comes to details .

		In the chapter on the Modern Drama , for example , Brieux is disposed of by the remark that he `` has come to be accepted as a satirist of a sort , '' which seems peculiarly mal apropos in view of that distinguished playwright 's recent election to the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Or again , in the treatment of Zola , to declare that the trilogy of the cities '' has not enhanced his reputation '' is certainly to make a mistake in relative values .

		The chap - ter on Recent Poetry is an extreme illustration of the danger of trying to summarize important writers by a line or a phrase ; nor can one accept the sweeping statement that '' French genius does not lean to lyricism . ''

		The description of
Rostand	ORGANIZATION	's new drama has mistakes which can not but awaken suspicion as to the critic 's method ; she is wrong in saying that one of the actors steps before the curtain and announces it as a play of animals , and wrong again in saying that it is written in modern French pentameters , since it is , of course , written in
Alexandrines	LOCATION	.

		Or to go back a little in speaking of George Sand the author says that this great novelist read the principal works of
Locke	LOCATION	,
Bacon	LOCATION	,
Rous	PERSON	- seau ,
Aristotle	LOCATION	,
Pascal	PERSON	,
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	, and other masters , and then comments : '' Her literary talent proceeds from these authors ; personal inspiration has added to it a stamp of original - ity , '' to put it mildly , an odd way of expressing the thought .

		A good word should be said for the chapter on the French Press , a phase of letters too often overlooked .

		One could wish that with a book so readable , which avoids the sin of dulness , more accuracy might have been attained , and the organic rela - tions of the subject so presented as to bring the study into a truer unity .

		RICHARD
BURTON	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The diverting Mr '
Adrian Hoffman Joline	PERSON	is not reflections of only an enthusiastic autograph - a book-lover .

		collector and a true lover of books ; he is also sufficiently a man of affairs , being a
New York	LOCATION	lawyer in active practice , to be saved from the pitiable fate not uncommon to bibliophiles , of becoming possessed with the notion that the world of books is the only real world , and the outside universe its grossly imperfect imitation .

		Hence his chatty vol - ume , `` At the Library Table '' -LRB- Badger -RRB- , is agreeably sprinkled with worldly-wise observations , besides containing many of the expected praises of first edi - tions and Cobden-Sanderson bindings , and notes on other matters familiar to bibliophilosophical persons .

		The title of the book is also that of the first chapter , which has , of course , nothing to do with the public - library table , a piece of furniture evidently abhorred by Mr.
Joline	PERSON	almost as much as he dislikes a card - catalogue and sundry other appurtenances of '' the people 's university '' a frame of mind natural and permissible in one who enjoys the possession of a good library of his own .

		Chapter two contains the diverting `` Deliberations of a Dofob '' -LRB- a Dofob , we infer from the context , being a `` D d Old Fool On Books '' -RRB- .

		Then come two more chapters of mingled literary and reminiscent character , and finally two longer disquisitions on
William Harrison Ainsworth	PERSON	and
G. P. R. James	PERSON	.

		A footnote in the
James	PERSON	article questions the truth of the report that the novelist of solitary-horseman fame was sometimes called
George Prince Regent James	PERSON	, and that many even believed this to be his real name .

		On this point Mr.
George Gary Eggleston	PERSON	's lately-published '' Recollections '' has a few authoritative words , from which it appears that the curious appellation originated in
Richmond	LOCATION	, where it gained common currency and was considered peculiarly apt .

		Mr.
Joline	PERSON	shows himself a good hater of automobiles and motor-cycles , a stanch defender of General
McClellan	PERSON	, no admirer of
Charles Sumner	PERSON	, nor of '' the deified murderer and horse-thief ,
John Brown	PERSON	, '' nor , finally , of '' the mod - ern smooth-faced devotee of the safety razor , who freely permits the unattractive contour of his mouth to betray the imperfections of his character . ''

		But we all have our ingrained likes and dislikes .

		He has permitted his pen , or his printer , to speak of Mr. '' Crother '' and the poet '' Keat '' or , rather , he has used the possessives `` Crother 's '' and `` Keat 's , '' which is practically the same to the critical eye .

		On the whole , Mr.
Joline	PERSON	has given us a worthy successor to the '' Meditations of an Autograph Collector '' and `` The Diversions of a Book Lover . ''

		The beginning Mr ''
Percival Lowell	PERSON	is an artist in and the end the writing of popular books on of worlds .

		astronomy .

		While , as is well known , his chief interests lie with the planet Mars , con - cerning which he has published two interesting works , he has lately produced a volume of wider range , entitled `` The Evolution of Worlds '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		Like all his books , this one is a delight to the eye , being sumptuously printed , tastefully bound , and finely illustrated .

		The elegance of its make-up is well matched by the fascinating style in which it is written .

		The title of this latest essay on astro - nomical evolution is somewhat larger than the subject ; for the author confines himself to a con - sideration of the birth of a system like that of our sun and its attendant planets .

		The systems of double-stars , which bestrew the sky by the tens of thousands , are not studied .

		The original hypothet -
16	DATE	THE DIAL , -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, ical nebula , from which
Laplace	LOCATION	traced the develop - ment of our system , is relegated to the astronomical ash-heap .

		Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	says : ''
Darwin	PERSON	's theory dis - tinctly avers that we were not descended from monkeys ; and
Laplace	LOCATION	's fire-mist under modern examination evaporates away . ''

		To account for the origin of our system we are introduced to the more modern speculation that some dark star , feeling its way by the starlight through the darkness of infinite space , comes into collision with another star , or at best barely grazes it Titanic forces are thus brought into play .

		The encountering worlds are disintegrated , and the ruins assume the form of a spiral nebula .

		From this beginning of our family of planets , Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	leaps lightly over unmeasured aeons of time , and proceeds to describe the inner group of planets chiefly
Mercury	ORGANIZATION	and
Venus	PERSON	, as we see them to-day with special reference to the observations made at his own observatory at Flag - staff ,
Arizona	LOCATION	.

		The asteroids and the large outer planets are next described in illuminating fashion .

		The reader is then in position to understand better the ensuing discussion of the formation of the planets from the spiral nebula , and of their subsequent his - tory as the heated masses gradually become cold , and fit for the support of life analogous to that on tha earth .

		This part of the argument is beset with numerous pitfalls for even the wariest feet , which the author seems to realize , when he says : '' Attack - ing the subject in this judicial spirit , the reader can hardly expect one to satisfy him with a cosmogony entirely home-made , but at best to pursue a happy middle course between creator and critic , advocating only such portions as happen to be my own , while sternly exposing the mistakes of others . ''

		Having led us in this manner through the history of the planets down to our own day , Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	goes further and considers the death of a world .

		The moon is already dead ; Mars is going into senility .

		Even the sun itself , now so plethoric with energy , will some day lose its last spark . ''

		-LRB- Jhost-like it will travel through space , unknown , unheralded , till another collision shall cause it to take a place again among the bright company of heaven . ''

		The cycle of change is then finished , and a new cycle has begun .

		Dr.
Henry Smith Williams	PERSON	is in man y wa y 8 qualified to speak author - itatively on the rules to be followed in order to secure comfort of body and peace .

		of mind .

		His book on '' The Science of Happiness '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- forms an excellent manual of self-culture , physical and mental , and is of a literary quality that makes it pleasant reading , didactic and moralizing though its tone necessarily is .

		The problem of happi - ness he considers under four aspects the physical , the mental , the social , and the moral .

		In his gen - eral directions for bodily health , he makes right eat - ing so fine an art that `` every indigestible particle of food taken into the stomach , and every particle of any kind in excess of what is needed '' are to be regarded as dietetic blunders .

		But Dr.
Woods Hntchinson	PERSON	has with equal emphasis declared that our digestive machinery need not be and ought not to be considered as so delicately adjusted a nierlian - ism ; it calls for coarse as well as fine material , hence the reason of '' shredded doormats '' on our breakfast table .

		In treating of methods of work , the author makes regularity and method all-essential , even for literary workers , asserting that '' most suc - cessful artists and authors even learn this lesson finally , and , instead of waiting for inspiration , drive themselves to the task at a given time , and grind away regardless of desire for rest till a reasonable work is done . ''

		It is more than doubtful if the best creative work in literature has been done in this plodding fashion .

		u We can not kindle when we will the fire which in the heart resides . ''

		Among the pen - slips that have crept into the book , some imp of the ink-bottle has made the author write ''
60 dollars	MONEY	'' as the equivalent of '' eight hundred francs '' in the very chapter that inculcates the necessity of accuracy .

		`` Climatic '' occurs , intentionally or other - wise , apparently in the sense of `` climacteric . ''

		And , finally , the eminent scientist allows himself the etymologically unscientific if not downright mean - ingless phrase , '' to perpetrate senile views . ''

		But these are comparative trifles .

		As the well-pondered utterance of one speaking from ample personal knowledge even though the chapter on '' How to Die '' necessarily lacks the note of actual experience the book commands and will receive the ready attention of many readers .

		Home activity have written much , at the North in and somewhat minutely , of economic the Civil War .

		an -LRB- j c j v y con -LRB- litions in the South in the days of the Confederacy , but conditions in the North during the War have received less attention .

		With the exception of a short chapter in Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	's History , little has hitherto been done to exhibit the industrial and social side of life in the
Northern States	LOCATION
from 1861	DATE	to
1865	DATE	.

		Hence Dr.
Emerson David File	PERSON	's `` Social and Industrial Conditions in the North During the Civil War '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a needed work .

		While in the Confederacy every industry languished , in the North every industry made unprecedented progress , and at the end of the war the North was actually wealthier than in
1861	DATE	.

		This progress was due , as Dr.
Fite	PERSON	shows , not alone to the artificial stimulus of the war , but it was based on solid economic foundations .

		Of new conditions brought about by the war , one of the most interest - ing was the tendency toward consolidation .

		This was seen not only in the centralization of the government , but in the combination of transportation agencies , of capital , of manufacturing plants , of banking and telegraph systems .

		Local railway lines were com - bined to make trunk systems ; capitalists pooled their resources , and manufacturers drew together to monopolize certain fields of production .

		Popular education was stimulated by the war , though the enrolment fell off for a time in the best college * .

		THE DIAL 17 The nouveau riche flourished , but in the North as in the South the finest expression of popular feeling was in the charitable and relief work conducted mainly for the benefit of the soldiers .

		Yet while industries made progress , and capital was multiplied , the average laborer was pinched by hard times .

		Wages did not rise to correspond with the increased cost of living , and the development of labor-saving machinery prevented the laborers who remained at work from profiting by the absence of those who served in the army .

		Dr.
Fite	PERSON	's work shows a thor - ough acquaintance with the material relating to the subject ; it is interesting in itself , and valuable for reference .

		___ In a volume entitled '' Revolution , C and ther Ey '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	gathers together a baker 's dozen of brief papers written within the last ten years , and treating chiefly of the capital-and - labor question and the general iniquity of the present order of things in our society and government .

		Much is said , first and last , of the prosperous folk who go on '' prattling sweet ideals and dear moral - ities , '' blissfully unconscious of the volcano on which their prosperity rests , and which some day will burst and make havoc of all these smug prattlers of sweet ideals and dear moralities .

		The revolutionists that are to effect this righting of wrongs are counted as seven million strong , and continually increasing .

		The writer does a service in calling renewed atten - tion , in language idiomatically forceful , to some of the defects and injustice of the existing social order , and especially to the frightful hardships now suf - fered by the poorest classes among the unskilled laborers ; but his comparison of the average cave - dweller 's lot with that of the thousands of over - worked and underfed men , wome.n , and children of the present day , hardly establishes the primitive man 's greater immunity from suffering and danger , and leaves out of account his vastly lower state of civilization as compared with that of the modern world .

		We can not , even viewing the world through the socialist 's or the nihilist 's spectacles , believe that it has been retrograding through all the centuries , or that revolution , in the commonly accepted sense of the term , is to be the ultimate salvation of the race .

		Some of Mr.
London	LOCATION	's pages are personal and autobiographical in character , and hence of peculiar interest .

		The book contains food for thought , and its style is the opposite of wearisome .

		A passing apt quotation from
Erasmus	PERSON	both sur - prises and delights the bookish reader .

		imaginary Mr -
Maurice Baring	PERSON	's `` Dead Let - correspondence ters '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- must have been with the great .

		as amu sing in the writing as they are in the reading .

		Appearing first in the
London	LOCATION	`` Morning Post , '' they entertained many readers , and , incredible though it may appear , imposed upon not a few who , by the author 's confession , wrote to him requests for further details from his secret sources of information .

		As these imaginary sources have to do , in part , with
Clytaemnestra	PERSON	and thus , Cleopatra and
Antony	PERSON	,
Lear	PERSON	and his daughters ,
Romeo	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	, and various other ancient or semi-mythological personages , one must be preter - naturally credulous to take the packet of letters in sober earnest .

		The local color , too , and the inci - dental allusions are not studied with wearisome accuracy , nor were they intended to pass muster with the severely critical .

		Lighter and shorter and more colloquial than Landor 's '' Imaginary Con - versations , '' these letters are in many instances written -LRB- supposedly -RRB- by women , and are hence the ready medium of much amusing gossip and some equally amusing spitefulness .

		The author enjoys a free hand in whitewashing any historic character that may have fallen into a disrepute which he thinks unmerited .

		Messalina , for instance , he pic - tures as an angel of innocence and the unhappy victim of envy and malice .


Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	, on the other hand , appears as a tiresome pedant , wear - ing the aspect of '' a barber who catered for the aristocracy , '' as the author expresses it , with some confusion of trades .

		Among the moderns ,
Heine	PERSON	and
Goethe	PERSON	and
Peter	PERSON	the Great are familiarly introduced .

		But , on the whole , it is when dealing with personages of antiquity or mythology that Mr.
Baring	PERSON	lets himself go with most effect .

		As a pleasant reminder of our schoolday studies not a painful reminder of how much we have forgotten since then the book is excellent vacation reading .

		The laureate of the
Confederacy	ORGANIZATION	is f .

		the distinction claimed for the author of ''
Maryland	LOCATION	, My
Maryland	LOCATION	'' by Mr.
Matthew Page Andrews	PERSON	in his recent edition of '' The Poems of
James Ryder Randall	PERSON	'' -LRB- The
Tandy-Thomas Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		To this judgment , admirers of Ryan and
Timrod	ORGANIZATION	will give but tardy assent .

		Nevertheless , the editor of the present volume brings to the support of his position the alleged assertion of
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	that '' My
Maryland	LOCATION	'' was '' the greatest of all poems produced by the War '' ; and he might have urged in further support of his position that
Randall	PERSON	composed a considerably larger body of war verses than did either of his rivals .

		But in justice to all concerned , it should be said that , with the exception of his famous battle-song ,
Randall	PERSON	wrote little that can compare with the best that
Timrod	ORGANIZATION	and
Ryan	PERSON	did .

		The volume contains , besides the war-lyrics , about fifty other short pieces , the bulk of them either personal and reminiscential in nature , or of the knee-buckle variety .

		Few of these display much of freshness or of finish , and still fewer exhibit anything of power .

		In an interesting intro - duction , however , the editor makes it plain why
Randall	PERSON	did not accomplish greater things : like most of his fellow-poets of the South , he could not bring himself to look upon verse-making as a serious business , but conceived of it merely as a more or less respectable sort of diversion .

		But that
Randall	PERSON	had keen insight into things , and was capable of strong feeling and of considerable power in expressing it 18 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, Thr human ih * dog .

		is clearly shown by the account given of his life and work , chiefly in the field of journalism .

		Moreover , he possessed a large soul , and was the most modest and unselfish of men .

		^ anyone doubts that dogs have some power so nearly resembling reason that it is not worth while to hunt for another name by which to call it .

		let him read Mr.
Henry C. Merwin	PERSON	's '' Dogs and Men '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , reprinted , with illustrations and a few additions , from `` The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly . ''

		The human feeling that throbs in the canine heart and looks out of the canine eye is dwelt upon and exem - plified in a most interesting way , and the author even goes so far as to declare that '' the mission of the dog I say it with all reverence is the same as the mission of Christianity , namely , to teach mankind that the universe is ruled by love . ''

		Speak - ing of a certain familiar class of smugly self-satisfied and eminently respectable persons into whose blood there has crept `` a coldness that would chill the heart of a bronze statue , '' he thus continues : '' Such persons are really degenerates of their peculiar kind , and need to be saved , perhaps by desperate measures .

		Let them elope with the cook ; let them get religion ; or , if they can not get religion , let them get a dog , give him the run of the house , love him and spoil him , and so , by the blessing of Provi - dence , their salvation may be effected . ''

		The little book will delight all animal-lovers , and perhaps convert some animal-haters .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		`` What Pictures to See in
Europe	LOCATION	in One Summer , '' by Miss
Lorinda Munson Bryant	PERSON	, is an art guide for tourists who take the beaten track , and are fairly in - nocent of artistic cultivation when they set out .

		For such persons , books like this are no doubt useful .

		The
John Lane Company	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		The latest of Baedekers is a ''
Southern Germany	LOCATION	, '' meaning
Wurtemberg	LOCATION	and
Bavaria	LOCATION	, which now reaches its eleventh revised edition .

		Although a comparatively small volume , it has upwards of eighty maps and plans .

		Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons are the importing agents for these guide-books .

		The excellent '' Everyman 's Library '' is steadily increasing , fifty-three new titles having recently been added to the series , which now consists of four hundred and fifty-three volumes .

		This admirable series contains , as is well known , some of the choicest classics in th English language , neatly and tastefully bound , of con - venient size and good type , and procurable at a very modest cost . ''


Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	and the Later Stoics , '' by Dr.
F. W. Bussell	PERSON	, is a new volume in the series of `` The World 's Epoch-Makers , '' published by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		It is a scholarly work , and , consider - ing that it has to do with the expounders of what the author considers `` an untenable creed , '' shows nn un - expected degree of sympathy with the thought of the imperial philosopher and his followers .

		The present overflow of Roosevelt enthusiasm finds appropriate expression in Mr.
John T. McCutrheon	PERSON	's new volume , `` T R. in Cartoons , '' issued by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The cartoons , of which there are over a hundred , originally appeared in The
Chicago	LOCATION	`` Tribune , '' and are accompanied by a preface in which Mr.
McCutcheon	PERSON	cleverly describes the ex - President as '' a cornucopia of suggestions for cartoon material . ''

		From Messrs.
Frederick A. Stokes	PERSON	Company come the first two volumes in a new series of monographs to be called Garden Flowers in Colors . ''

		Each volume con - tains eight illustrations of flowers in life-like colors reproduced with unusual skill and care by the same engravers who produced the illustrations for the `` Masterpieces in Color . ''

		The text gives outlines of the histories and classifications of the flowers , practical directions for their culture , lists of varieties best suited for special purposes , and chapters on common insect pests .

		`` How Americans are Governed in
Nation	ORGANIZATION	,
State	ORGANIZATION	, and City '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Crittenden Marriott	PERSON	, is a text - book of civics marked by a strong stress upon the practical aspect of the problems of government , and presenting its array of facts in logical sequence and engaging exposition .

		The author 's reasoning is not always sound , but his matter is usually informing and interesting .

		In his deliberate exclusion of the historical side of the subject , however , he has missed giving his book the truly educational character that such a work should have to commend itself to the attention of the teaching profession . ''

		Man in Many Lands , '' by Mr.
L. W. Lyde	PERSON	-LRB-
London	LOCATION	- Black -RRB- , is described as `` an introduction to the study of geographic control . ''

		This means that it is intended to supply the information which shall answer such ques - tions as Why the Swedes invented cream separators , Why the Buddhist color should be yellow , and Why Portuguese women are so ugly .

		The author , an ex - aminer in geography for various institutions , gets ques - tions like these from many parts of the world , and thinks that the study of geography should supply the intel - ligence needed for answering them .

		This is a refresh - ing -LRB- and pedagogically sound -RRB- view to take of what is too often a humdrum subject , and teachers may well profit by the little book .

		It is a school book only in an auxiliary sense , and makes refreshing reading .

		There are many pretty illustrations in color .

		The series of plainly-worded and fully-illustrated little pamphlets , edited by Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	, on `` American Library Economy '' as practised by the
Newark	LOCATION	-LRB- N. J. -RRB- Public Library , has now advanced to its
Second Part	ORGANIZATION	, in one number , entitled '' Booklists and Other Library Publications , '' the
First Part	ORGANIZATION	being divided into four sections , or numbers , all treating of the
Lending Department	ORGANIZATION	as it is organized at
Newark	LOCATION	.

		We thus have a pamphlet on the Registration Desk , one on the Charging System , one on the Administration of the
Lending Department	ORGANIZATION	, and finally one on the Relations with the Public in this
Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		Intend - ing librarians might be dismayed at first by the apparent intricacy of library management as detailed in these successive booklets ; and they do indeed leave little to the reader 's imagination which perhaps is well .

		The
Newark	LOCATION	library 's activity in publishing numerous aids to readers is commendable .

		The series is tastefully executed at the
Elm Tree Press	ORGANIZATION	,
Woodstock	LOCATION	,
Vt.	LOCATION	, the business office of which is at 189 Broad St. ,
Newark	LOCATION	,
N. J.	ORGANIZATION

		THE DIAL 19 NOTES .

		A new two-volume edition of
Madame Blavatsky	ORGANIZATION	's '' The Secret Doctrine , '' reprinted from the original edition of
1888	DATE	, is announced by the
Theosophical Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	, at

Samuel Thurber	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Messrs.
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce that they will publish
Rostand	PERSON	's '' Chantecler '' in book form on

		Recent magazine advertisements , there - fore , stating that the play can be read in English only in its serial form , are misleading .

		Sainte-Beuve 's '' Causeries du Lundi , '' from
October , 1849	DATE	, to
March , 1851	DATE	, may now be had in an English translation by Dr.
E. J. Trechmann	PERSON	.

		The work fills five neat volumes , has notes and other editorial matter , and is published by the Messrs.
Dutton	PERSON	.

		A paragraph in THE DIAL recently having mentioned that there was no known living relative of the poet
Keats	PERSON	bearing his surname , a correspondent in
Georgia	LOCATION	writes to say that Mr.
John H. Keats	PERSON	, son of the poet 's brother
George	PERSON	who settled in this country , still resides in
Missouri	LOCATION	, or did so at a very recent date .

		Mr.
S. E. Forman	PERSON	, who is the author of the best text - book of civil government ever written for American students of high school age , now appears as the author of '' A History of the
United States	LOCATION	for Schools , '' pub - lished by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a book for the elemen - tary schools , and is amply equipped with educational aids besides being richly illustrated .

		Messrs.
Sturgis & Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce for early fall publication a book by
Miss E. Sylvia Pankhurst	PERSON	entitled '' The Suffragette . ''

		The author of the work , which is to be in a manner the official history of the English equal-suffrage movement , is a daughter of the well-known Mrs.
Pankhurst	PERSON	, the leader of the militant wing of the suffrage party , who will provide the intro - duction .

		Messrs.
Cassell & Company	ORGANIZATION	announce that they have ready for publication the first volume of '' The Life and Times of King
Edward VII	PERSON	, '' giving the story of Eng - land from the birth of
King Edward	ORGANIZATION	down to the present day .

		When completed the work will be in five large octavo volumes .

		Queen
Alexandra	PERSON	has personally given the publishers her consent to the reproduction of the photographs of the King that will appear throughout the work , and which , with the other illustrations , will form a special feature .

		Hauff 's ''
Lichtenstein	PERSON	, '' edited by Professor
James Percival King	PERSON	, is one of the most acceptable of recent German texts , and is published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		From
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	we have `` A German Grammar for Schools and Colleges , '' by Pro- fessors
W. H. Fraser	PERSON	and

C. D. Cool	PERSON	; and
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's ''
Zaire	LOCATION	, '' edited by Professor
Charles W. Cabeen	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish
Louis Enault	PERSON	's '' Le Chien In Capitaine , edited by Miss
Margaret de G. Verrall	PERSON	.


Mark Twain	PERSON	's authorized biography is already in preparation at the hands of Mr.
Albert Bigelow Paine	PERSON	, who , with the deceased humorist 's daughter , is his appointed literary executor .

		The fortunate possessors of letters from Mr.
Clemens	PERSON	are requested to commu - nicate with Mr.
Paine	PERSON	at
Redding	ORGANIZATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	.

		All epistolary matter sent to him will be copied and returned to the senders .

		Cordial cooperation in this respect is earnestly desired , to the end that a full and authorita - tive biography may be prepared .

		The new edition of
William Sharp	ORGANIZATION	's works , edited by Mrs. Sharp and published by
Messrs. Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is steadily gaming headway .

		Of the seven vol - umes which are to complete the edition , the first four are now ready , containing '' Pharais '' and '' The Mountain Lovers '' ; '' The Sin Eater '' and '' The Washer of the Ford '' ; '' The Dominion of Dreams '' and '' Un - der the Dark Star '' ; '' The Divine Adventure , '' '' lona , and '' Studies in Spiritual History . ''

		Each volume is illustrated with a frontispiece in photogravure , and both the type and paper are excellent .

		The Mikszath Jubilee in
Hungary	LOCATION	has been made memorable by that nation in a manner that does credit to those concerned in it .

		Three estates , valued at nearly
twenty-five thousand dollars	MONEY	of our money , were presented to the veteran romancer as a jubilee gift .

		A prophet not without honor in his own country ,
Mikszath	LOCATION	is also favorably known in
America	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, chiefly through the English translation of his '' St.
Peter	PERSON	's Umbrella '' a book which , according to a current story , Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	assured its author , whom he took pains to meet in his late visit to
Budapest	LOCATION	, was the very last book he had read before leaving
America	LOCATION	for the jungles of
Africa	LOCATION	.

		It is of interest to note that much of
Mikszath	LOCATION	's work has first appeared serially in Kos - suth 's old paper ,
Pesti Hirlap	PERSON	.

		Now that
Jdkai	PERSON	is gone , the author of '' St.
Peter	PERSON	's Umbrella '' is to us the most attractive figure in literary
Hungary	LOCATION	.

		The
Lummis	PERSON	collection of books , paintings , and Indian relics , lately presented to the
Southwest Museum	ORGANIZATION	at
Los Angeles	LOCATION	, is briefly described in the current issue of `` News Notes of
California	LOCATION	Libraries . ''

		An extract says : `` In celebration of his fiftieth birthday , and to round up many years ' activity in various fields pertain - ing to the history of Spanish -
America	LOCATION	, Mr.
Charles F. Lummis	PERSON	has donated to the
Southwest Museum	ORGANIZATION	his entire collection of objects gathered during his travels through

		BRIEFER MENTION 45 NOTES 45 LIST OF NEW BOOKS ... 46 THE MYSTERY OF CULTURE .

		In a recent volume of essays which he calls '' Academic Performances , '' Professor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	makes some striking observations on '' The Mystery of Education . ''

		He refers to the notion common with those who have never been to college , that the four years spent there teach something positive the command of foreign languages , for instance , the appreciation of fine arts , thorough acquaintance with litera - ture , familiarity with science , or preeminent skill in some branch of activity .

		But , alas , he confesses : '' We graduates of colleges have the sad misfortune to know better .

		Few of us , for example , who have studied French or German for years , can pretend to use a text-book in either language far less turn to the literature of either , as a matter of pleasure .

		Hardly one of us , unaided by translation , can make much sense out of a page of Latin or of Greek .

		Very few could tell you off-hand the century in which
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	wrote or
Cicero	LOCATION	, could distinguish between
St. Gregory	ORGANIZATION	and
Hildebrand	PERSON	, could give a clear account of Lady
Jane Grey	PERSON	, could name the Presidents of the
United States	LOCATION	, could explain why no one who understands Elizabethan literature has ever supposed that the author of
Bacon	LOCATION	's Essays wrote ' Hamlet ' and The Tempest , ' or could expound the principles of
Descartes	LOCATION	, of
Locke	LOCATION	, or of
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	. ''

		This failure on the part of the college to place its graduates in possession of something hard and fast seems to have made a deep impression on one of Professor
Wendell	PERSON	's students , who , on acquiring an encyclopaedia and noting within what moderate compass it claimed to have embraced all human knowledge , conceived the idea of mastering his encyclopedia , from A to Z , and of then seeking a professorship of universal knowledge and of sending forth his pupils with definite , positive , and complete acquisitions that should justify the years spent in their pursuit .

		Not less misguided than this young enthusiast for positive knowledge are those who imagine culture to be something definitely attainable by following a prescribed course .

		On the contrary , as Dr.
Furness	PERSON	assured the graduating class at the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	a few years ago , culture is not a result , but a process .

		Culture sought as an end is an odious thing .

		True culture , says
Emerson	PERSON	, avoiding the finality of precise definition , '' is the suggestion from cer - TILE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, tain best thoughts , that a man has a range of affinities , through which he can modulate the violence of any master-tones that have a dron - ing preponderance in his scale , and succor him against himself .

		Culture redresses his balance , puts him among his equals and superiors , revives the delicious sense of sympathy , and warns him of the dangers of solitude and repulsion . ''

		It is , one might add , very much like happiness , unattainable by conscious effort , and furthest from us at the very moment we exclaim that we have grasped it .

		Unmistakable to the discerning eye , however , are the marks of culture in others .

		Reference was made above to Dr.
Furness	PERSON	's commencement address at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		It was on the subject of culture , and its tone and spirit most admir - ably illustrated its theme .

		Excellent as were the thoughts expressed , the manner of their ex - pression was even better .

		Let us quote a few sentences .

		Emphasizing the truth that culture is not a profound and exhaustive thing , but in its very nature superficial , the speaker said : Wheu the whole science of electricity was comprised in the solitary fact that if amber be rubbed it attracts straws ; when all that astronomy revealed was that stars were exhalations which the rising sun dispersed ; when in all chemistry there were but four elements , earth , air , tire , and water ; and when no music was heard more ravishing than that extracted from three strings stretched across a tortoise shell , or than the breath blown through a reed , then , in that happy golden age , every man was an encyclopaedia , and culture , thorough and profound , might be acquired in an hour , - - then any child could pluck up the whole tree of knowledge by the roots .

		But we have changed all that ; we are now the heirs of forty centuries , and the heaven-high Sequoias of
Mariposa	LOCATION	only very faintly symbolize the gigantic proportions of the same present tree of knowl - edge , and the concentrated devotion of a lifetime is demanded for a thorough mastery of a single tiny twig . ''

		It should be noted , in passing , that the speaker , far from making culture to consist in a smat - tering of all knowledge , insists on the necessity of thoroughness in some one chosen department . ''

		Know everything of something , and something of everything . ''

		But in other regions , `` be - cause we can not distinguish all the varieties of Solidago , must we forego , '' he asks , '' the charm of recognizing Goldenrod when it trans - forms an autumn meadow into a field of the cloth of gold ?

		Because we can not expound the theories of the binary stars , are we to forbear to name the constellations of the
midnight	TIME	sky ?

		Shall we close our Homer because we can not name the ships that went to Troy ?

		A little knowledge is not a dangerous thing .

		If I can not , for lack of time , drink deep of the I ` i.-rian
spring	DATE	, let me , in heaven 's name , at least take ; i > i -RSB- > . ''

		The office of poetry in con - ferring culture is dwelt upon , and , of course , Shakes -RSB- > eure .

		Kmperor , by tin - -LRB- inter of -LRB- i.nl , of all Literature , '' is proj > erly commended to the seeker of culture .

		These words from Dr.
Furness	PERSON	are hero quoted , not because they make clear exactly what this mysterious thing called culture realK is which no words can make clear but be - cause they and the utterances of others on the subject throw some side-lights and help us to see at least what culture is not .

		Emerson , writing on culture
fifty years ago	DATE	, ranges far and wide , after his usual manner ; and his latitude is in entire harmony with the breadth of that culture which he sought to describe and which he him self exemplified .

		In hearty agreement , before - hand , with the sentiments expressed by our Shakespearian scholar , he says : '' I am always happy to meet persons who perceive the trans - cendent superiority of Shakespeare over all other writers '' ; and further : '' I like people who like
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, because this love does not con - sist with self-conceit . ''

		Again , with the most liberal interpretation of the meaning of culture , he speaks of it as opening the sense of beauty , and adds : '' I suffer every day from the want of perception of beauty in people .

		They do not know the charm with which all moments and objects can be embellished , the charm of man - ners , of self-command , of benevolence .

		Repose and cheerfulness are the badge of the gentleman , repose in energy . ''

		He finally sums up the whole matter by declaring that '' a cheerful and intelligent face is the end of culture , and success enough . ''


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	has a large and worthy conception of culture in asserting it to be '' the disinterested pursuit of perfection . ''

		The end here is certainly sufficiently unattainable to suit the most ardent idealist .

		Not quite so good is his other and probably better-known definition of culture as '' the acquainting ourselves with the best that has been known and said in the world , and thus with the history of the human spirit . ''

		The best that has been known and said is not at all times the easiest thing to determine ; and even if it were , a mere book-worm of good memory could master it without necessarily be - coming thereby a person of culture .


John Addington Syraonds	PERSON	, while asserting that culture is not an end in itself .

		Imt that it '' prepares man for life , for work , for action .

		t > i the reception and emission of ideas , '' yet mak < - it something a little too definite , too attainable ,
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 29 one might say , in describing it as '' the raising of previously educated intellectual faculties to their highest potency by the conscious effort of their possessors . ''

		Better is his shorter and less precise definition , '' self - effectuation , '' or the ar - rival at what the Germans call Selbst ` dndigkeit except that here too we have a result rather than a process .

		A later passage has more of suggestion and enlightenment ; it identifies cul - ture with '' a psychical state , so to speak , which may be acquired by sympathetic and assimila - tive study . ''

		By a rather unexpected concession from this eminent humanist , humanism and also science are named as the `` two principal methods for arriving at the ends involved in culture . ''

		But it is soon added that if , as Pope asserts , `` the proper study of mankind is man , '' then humanism must always hold the first place in the higher intellectual culture .

		Curious and perplexing are the relations of culture to genius and of genius to culture .

		Talent and culture naturally consort with each other , but genius is impatient of all rules and limitations .

		Burns and
Turner	PERSON	and
Walt Whit	PERSON	- man were hardly men of culture , perhaps because they were so much more .

		Goethe and
Heine	PERSON	,
Dante	PERSON	and
Petrarch	PERSON	and Tasso ,
Milton	PERSON	and
Keats	PERSON	, were all cultured men of genius .

		To Shakespeare it would be absurd to deny cul - ture , and it would be scarcely less absurd , or at least it would be feeble and pointless , to ascribe it to him . ''

		Genius does what it must , but talent does what it can , '' is the one memorable line in the works of a poet not otherwise mem - orable .

		Self - effectuation by conscious effort is not what we see in the manifestations of genius .

		Self - suppression is what would require the conscious effort .

		It is the innate , the invol - untary , the compelling , the something independ - ent of culture and defiant of law and custom , that startles the world and forces it to stand still and admire .

		Nothing has it to do with that cul - ture which , entering into the life of the specialist absorbed in the study of tadpoles or of
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	's moons , teaches him his and their true relations to the universe .

		It is safer , and more likely to profit us , to make our conception of culture too generous , too inclusive , too vague even , than to form it on too narrow and inflexible lines .

		The defini - tions and general descriptions found in the authors cited above , and in others , are collec - tively not unsatisfying ; but no one formula seems to cover all that is meant by culture .

		Probably no formula satisfactory to all could ever be framed .

		Possibly it may suffice for the present to conceive of the essence of culture as lying in that intellectual and emotional awaken - ing that comes with wider knowledge and deeper insight , and that is promoted by the study of the best in literature and art .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE DEATH OF CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER reminds us a little sadly of the fast decreasing number of those who were contributors to
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	in its earlier years .

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	or ''
Mel '' Fuller	PERSON	, as his friends knew him then was a great reader of books of all sorts , and an excellent reviewer of them .

		He did not disdain the novel ; and his first contribu - tion to THE DIAL -LRB-
Jan. 1 , 1881	DATE	-RRB- was a four-column review of
Disraeli	PERSON	's `` Endymion , '' which had then just appeared .

		It was one of the `` best sellers '' of its day largely because , as the reviewer said , it was `` the work of a Prime Minister of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		The novel fails , we are told , in `` the only real test of the merit of a production like this '' in anything like a masterly delineation of character ; and the summing up is that `` upon the whole , the
Earl of Beaconsfield	ORGANIZATION	must depend for posthumous fame upon something else than his novels '' an opinion which time has pretty well approved .

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	was espe - cially fond of biography , and contributed to an early number of THE DIAL an extended review of the life of General
Hancock	PERSON	, a character whom Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	greatly admired , not only as a gallant soldier but because of his '' profound sense of the importance of subordinating the military to the civil authority , '' and his `` deep conviction of the utility of the peace - ful methods of civil government . '' ''

		Paternalism , with its constant intermeddling with individual free - dom , has no place in a system which rests upon the self-reliant energies of the people . ''

		was the demo - cratic utterance of the future
Chief Justice	ORGANIZATION	.

		Others of Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's biographical writings were on
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	-LRB- THE DIAL ,
April 1 , 1882	DATE	-RRB- and on
Jefferson	PERSON	and
Hamilton	PERSON	-LRB-
May 1 , 1883	DATE	-RRB- .

		Readers of the present day might find entertainment in Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's eight-column review of a life of
Benton	LOCATION	by
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	-LRB-
May 1 , 1887	DATE	-RRB- , in which the reviewer finds that '' Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	holds the pen of a ready writer , and has a mind definitely made up as to public men and measures of the period under consideration . ''

		A peculiar interest attaches to an article on Chief Justice
Marshall	PERSON	-LRB- THE DIAL ,
May 1 , 1885	DATE	-RRB- , of whom Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	said : '' In mere juridi - cal learning he has been surpassed by some , but in the power of pure reason by none . ''

		An illustration of Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's highly devout nature is revealed in this passage : `` Numerous personal incidents are narrated in illustration of the simplicity of his -LSB-
Marshall	PERSON	's -RSB- character ; but there is none more striking than the fact that the head of the most powerful tribunal on earth never retired to rest without repeating the Lord 's Prayer and the lines 80 THE DIAL -LSB- .

		Inly 16 , commencing ` Now I lay me down to sleep . '

		As the yean pass , the fame of thin great man continues to shine with undiminished lustre , and so will con tinue until the firmament front whence beam the glories of Tribonian and D'Aguesseau , of
Hale	PERSON	and
Mansfield	PERSON	, is rolled together like a scroll . ''

		And these words were penned but three years before Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	stepped from private life to occupy the posi - tion of the illustrious jurist of whom he wrote .

		I Hi : ANNUAL OVERHAULING OF OUR EDUCA - TIONAL METHODS has been going on in
Boston	LOCATION	, with teachers reckoned by the tens of thousands from all parts of the country in attendance .

		As is usual on such occasions , there has been much criticism of the existing order , much attempt to tear down , and some worthy endeavor to build up .

		Outspoken cen - sure of the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	as '' one of the biggest monopolies in education that ever existed '' was heard at one meeting ; at another , college men were pronounced incompetent for practical work as compared with high-school graduates , the colleges having become rather social and sporting clubs than training schools ; and , again , colleges and univer - sities were declared to be usurping the functions of the normal school , functions that they are not qualified or intended to perform .

		In a discussion concerning the teaching of English , one speaker found fault with the material placed before the pupil as too remote , not of present and living interest , and urged the study of authors more likely to rivet the young reader 's attention .

		Perhaps there is danger here of conceding too much to the pupil 's intellectual laziness .

		Those instructors in Knglish who use in their classes current clippings from the newspapers , instead of
Goldsmith	PERSON	and
Burke	PERSON	and
Charles Lamb	PERSON	and
Walter Scott	PERSON	, for serious study and discussion , may succeed in arousing the pupil 's interest ; but whether it is an interest that is worth arousing , or the highest and best sort of interest that can be aroused , are open to serious question .

		The most notable incident of the
Boston	LOCATION	meeting was the choice of Mrs.
Young	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	for President the first time a woman has ever been President of the
National Education Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE
KINO	ORGANIZATION	AND THE MAN OF LETTERS are both human beings , and one likes to see them meet occa - sionally on that common footing of humanity .

		Mr.
Arthur C. Benson	PERSON	adds a bit of personal reminis - cence to his graceful tribute to
King Edward the Third	ORGANIZATION	, in the
June	DATE	' Cornhill . '' ''

		I came away , '' he says , `` from an interview with the King at
Buckingham Palace	ORGANIZATION	, in which he had spoken to me very warmly and graciously of the
Letters of Queen Victoria	ORGANIZATION	.

		When I came out , an
Equerry	ORGANIZATION	, with whom I was acquainted , was waiting for me .

		` Well , ' he said , ` how did you fare ? '

		I said the only words which came into my mind : ` The
Kini	PERSON	; was very kind . ' '

		He always is , ' said the
Equerry	LOCATION	, with a smile .

		That was the simple secret an invariable and genuine kindness , which streamed from the King like light from the sun . ''

		And further praise of his gentle dignity and j ^ reat charm follows .

		Compart * with thin
Boswell	PERSON	's account of
Johnson	PERSON	's memorable interview with
George the Third	ORGANIZATION	in the Queen 's Library at
Buckingham House	ORGANIZATION	on the site of the present
Buckingham Palace	ORGANIZATION	where Mr.
Benson	PERSON	had his interview . ''

		After the King withdrew , '' writes
Boswell	PERSON	, ''
Johnson	PERSON	shewed himself highly pleased with his Majesty 's conver - sation and gracious behaviour .

		He said to Mr.
Barnard	PERSON	-LSB- the librarian -RSB- , ` Sir , they may talk of the King as they will ; but he is the finest gentleman I have seen . '

		And he afterwards observed to Mr.
Langton	PERSON	, ' Sir , his manners are those of as fine a gentleman as we may suppose
Lewis	PERSON	the Fourteenth or Charles the Second . ' ''

		Again , with pleasing frankness , he assured Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	, '' I find it does one good to be talked to by his Sovereign '' - although
Johnson	PERSON	, as he himself admits , did the greater part of the talking .

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	and
Johnson	PERSON	agree in finding the near presence of royalty stimu - lating and genial .

		... UTILITABIAN SUBSTITUTES FOR POLITE LEARN - ING , in our colleges and universities , are so rapidly crowding Plato and Aristotle , Homer and
Virgil	PERSON	, Thucydides and Tacitus , into the background , that in a few more decades it will be a marvel to find a bachelor of arts who has ever even heard , for example , of the Peripatetic School , or who can tell , off-hand , who wrote the '' Agricola , '' and whether the same pen produced the ''
Jugurtha	PERSON	. ''

		At this season there are appearing sundry interesting announce - ments of new and never-before-imagined courses of study for the coming college year .

		The
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, for instance , will henceforth give instruction in `` wood technology '' to those yearning for a closer acquaintance with the chemical com - position and physical properties of beech , birch , and maple , and other members of the tree family .

		At
the University of Rochester	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Howard T. Mosher	PERSON	will in the autumn take his seat in the brand-new chair of `` citizenship '' and proceed to teach the principles of sanitation , fire protection , police administration , school systems , water work .

		- .

		care of streets , and much else that relates to muni - cipal or village life .

		It is to be noted that the new course does not promise to make good citizens of all those who pursue it , good citizenship like good morals being far less a thing of theory than of practice .

		A SUPERFLUOUS YARD OF PUBLIC-LIBRARY RED TAPE still remains , in some places , for reform and common-sense to cut away .

		In connection with the recent action of the librarian and trustees of the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	in deciding upon a partial adoption of the open-shelf system , a word may be said regarding one of the reasons commonly nrijed in favor of that system as against the old one of gratings and bars and strict formality of procedure .

		The applicant for a book , judging of its nature and con - tents merely from a brief catalogue entry , often has
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 31 delivered to him a volume entirely failing to meet his wants or equal his expectations ; but the rules forbid the loan and return of a book on the same day , hence the disappointing thing must be lugged home and brought back again the
next day	DATE	, or later , when a fresh trial , perhaps equally unsatisfactory , is made .

		Therefore the extreme desirability of free access to the books themselves .

		But if , as many librarians claim , thefts and misplacements and hard usage render the open-shelf system inadvisable , at least let the stupid and arbitrary rule governing the return of books be abolished .

		To be sure , it makes a little more work to have a book handed back before the record of its loan has been properly filed ; but what of that ?

		It is easy enough to register the return on a special slip and lay it aside until the
next day	DATE	, when everything can be made straight in the frac - tion of a minute .

		Some libraries , probably many , have adopted some such plan .

		But we and doubtless many of our readers know to our sorrow that not all of the closed-shelf class have yet shown this amount of sweet reasonableness in smoothing the path of the book-borrower .

		THE IDENTITY OF '' GEORGE MEEK '' now consti - tutes a '' question of the hour '' in literary
London	LOCATION	, and is turning gray the hair of the public-library cataloguer , who is torn with conflicting impulses whether to class the already famous ``
George Meek	PERSON	, Bath Chair-Man , by Himself '' with biography under '' Meek '' or with fiction under ''
Wells	PERSON	. ''

		Certain chapters of the book , reinforced by certain passages of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's Introduction , almost persuade the cataloguer that the book is a genuine `` human docu - ment '' ; and then again certain other features of it almost demonstrate its utter fictitiousness and fraudulence .

		The fact that ``
George Meek	PERSON	'' is writing to the newspapers in vehement asseveration of his flesh-and-blood reality , and of his veritable authorship of his own autobiography , weighs little one way or the other ; it is easy enough to write fraudulent letters to the newspapers , after having once perpetrated the fraud to which they refer .

		And it would be easy enough , again , to write further letters vindicating the authorship of the first series , and so on ad infinitum , or at least to the end of the writer 's finite existence in this world of pens and ink and of hoaxes and humbugs .

		THE WANDERINGS OF
SABRINA	LOCATION	, better known in certain college circles as the protecting divinity of the even-year classes at
Amherst	LOCATION	than as the nymph of the river Severn -LRB- Latin Sabrina -RRB- , have been chronicled in a book that seems deserving of a place among the best of American student publications .

		To those who know not
Sabrina	PERSON	, any handbook of classical mythology will give her pathetic history .

		Milton has honored her with brief mention in his '' Comus . ''

		But it was left to Mr.
Max Shoop	PERSON	, the goddess 's guardian for the class of
1910	DATE	, to prepare the most detailed and variously interesting account of the lovely maiden in his ''
Sabrina	PERSON	: the Class Goddess of
Amherst College	LOCATION	, '' which is published at
Amherst	LOCATION	by Mr.
Shoop	PERSON	himself .

		The bronze -LRB- or zinc -RRB- statue which , to be honest , is the real subject of this truthful history , is a replica of the
Shrewsbury	LOCATION	representation of
Sabrina	LOCATION	, and was given to
Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	in
1857	DATE	by Col.
Joel Hayden	PERSON	of
Haydenville	LOCATION	, lieutenant-governor of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	from
1863	DATE	to
1866	DATE	.

		The goddess 's trying expe - rience on the college campus , and her subsequent many wanderings after the higher powers had re - fused longer to sanction her presence there , can readily be imagined to furnish material for the literary exercise of collegiate wit and wisdom .

		The much-travelled divinity was reposing in a fishing hamlet on the
Maine	LOCATION	coast when Mr.
Shoop	PERSON	's book went to press , but was about to start on a journey for parts unknown , to escape the profane gaze and rude touch of odd-year collegians in hot pursuit of her .

		THE ELIMINATION OF THE REDUNDANT has been the passion of some of the greatest writers .

		Flau - bert , in seeking ever to clothe his thought in just the right words , with not a shade too much or too little of emphasis , attained to something like perfection in exactly fitting the expression to the idea .

		Cut his sentences and they bleed , such is the vitality of his style .


Jules Renard	PERSON	, the French poet , novelist , essayist , and playwright , who has just died at forty - six , is said to have studied simplicity and brevity of style with an enthusiasm amounting almost to mania . ''

		I would rather , '' he declared , `` write a short story than a novel , I would rather write a paragraph than a short story , a sentence than a paragraph .

		I like to rewrite a sentence twenty times in order to give it the precise form that best fits it . ''

		This passion for restraint and economy in literary style , while it sometimes betrays one into mannerisms and affec - tations , recalls the excellent saying of the Hindu pundit : `` A wise man rejoices more over the saving of a syllable than over the birth of a son . ''

		DISTRACTIONS FROM THE SERIOUS PURSUIT OF FICTION are in certain quarters making notable inroads on the public-library records of circulation .

		At
Dubuque	LOCATION	,
Iowa	LOCATION	, for instance ,
9671	DATE	fewer novels were loaned in
1909	DATE	than in
1908	DATE	, the circulation in other departments of literature remaining about the same .

		Certain
Massachusetts	LOCATION	libraries , too , have reported a slight decrease in circulation for the past year , and the suggestion has been offered that pos - sibly the moving-picture show is responsible .

		If it is found that only fiction is being thus slighted by the public , the lessened circulation need not be regarded with unmixed regret .

		Out-door pastimes , notably golf and automobiling , to say nothing of ballooning and aviation , are in the ascendant , and are to be encouraged .

		The more serious reading of the scholar , the writer , the literary club member , and others to whom the world of letters is far wider than the domain of English prose fiction , is not likely to be materially lessened by any feverish enthusiasm for base-ball or other passing amusement .

		A GALAHAD OF THE MAKKET-PLACE .

		* Those who knew
William Henry Baldwin , Jr.	PERSON	, in his lifetime , or who even met him but casu - ally , can never forget the charm of his person - ality or the beauty and strength of his character .

		Those who had not the good fortune to know him personally can yet frame for themselves , out of the record of his manifold activities and interests and noble enthusiasms , some fairly ac - curate conception of him as he lived and moved among his fellows during the much too short span of life allotted to him .

		The careful chron - icle of his brilliant achievements prepared by Professor
John Graham Brooks	PERSON	, with the title 44 An
American Citizen	ORGANIZATION	, '' must appeal to all readers concerned with questions of social wel - fare and interested in the lives of those who have generously devoted themselves to the pub - lic good .

		The life of
Baldwin	PERSON	as told by his biographer goes far toward disproving the common asser - tion that no man can play the game in the `` big business '' of the world , and win , without loss of moral integrity .

		The late president of the
Long Island	LOCATION	Railroad , and director or officer in thirty-seven other important business corpo - rations , held himself always ready , in spite of his unfailing success as a captain of industry , and in spite of the public service he was able to render in that capacity , to relinquish his post and devote all his energies to the numerous philanthropic causes that already claimed so much of his time and strength , if it appeared that his continuance in business was morally detrimental to himself or others .

		But he re - mained ever '' the Galahad of the market-place , '' as Dr.
Felix Adler	PERSON	called him ; '' the uncor - rupted knight , '' as Dr.
Slicer	PERSON	expressed it .


William Henry Baldwin , Jr.	PERSON	, was born in
Boston	LOCATION	,
February 5 , 1863	DATE	, being sixth of the nine children of
William Henry	ORGANIZATION	and
Mary F. A.	PERSON	-LRB-

Baldwin	PERSON	.

		The father , whose death last year fell within a few days of that of his lifelong friend

Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	* s offer of a humble position in the
Union Pacific Railroad	ORGANIZATION	offices .

		His subsequent work in es - tablishing reading-rooms and libraries for the railway hands , his rapid advance to higher ami higher posts and increasing responsibilities , his management of the
Montana Union Railroad	ORGANIZATION	, of the
Flint	LOCATION	and Pc * re
Marquette	LOCATION	, and of tl it - Southern , and his presidency of the
Long Island	LOCATION	road , constitute an enviable record of earlv - developed and speedily-enlarged executive capa - city in a most exacting department of business a record nowhere stained with the least sug - gestion of dishonorable deed or intention .

		Concerning the difficulties confronting the young and determinedly honest railroad man - ager in those early days at
Butte	LOCATION	, we read in Professor
Brooks	PERSON	's pages : `` In the getting of new business , especially in tilling his freight cars , he meets the familiar spectre of petty briberies .

		He finds his rivals distributing ' favors ' to those who have it in their power to decide where freight shall go .

		He learns that these men are often shown the town ' by his competitors ; that he too is expected to make provision for the display of dreary vices at expensive rates .

		With bald effrontery these practices have been such a part of the competitive system as to rank among the commonplace necessities of busim -- enterprise .

		They have taken innumerable shapes , from mere ' seeing the town ' with charged-up revelries in local dives , to the politer forms of gift and entertain - ment which soften and conceal the bribe through flat - tering indirection . ''


Baldwin	PERSON	's way of facing such situations , of which he had a plenty to face in his nearly twenty years ' experience of railroading , may be illustrated by his manner of attacking this first hard problem .

		Writing from
Butte	ORGANIZATION	to a trusted friend , he said : '' When I came to
Butte	ORGANIZATION	, I had the toughest job to tackle on the
U. P.	LOCATION	as railroad men said , an unen - viable position .

		I was told that I would have to be a champion liar and become a veritable bum ' in order to secure any business .

		I gave orders at once , howcMT , that all business from my office must be done on an honorable basis , and that any statement made must be the truth .

		I decided to work the opposite of the game played by many of my competitors , and have business men feel that honor and fair treatment were our motto .

		... We had almost no friends , and the bitterest oppo - sition ; and it has been the worst up-hill work . ''

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 33 But he is able to write later that his plan has proved successful and that he can win the game and still keep his self-respect . ''

		I am not a sentimentalist , quite the opposite , '' he declares on another occasion ; '' but every day makes me more and more convinced that I can carry out my ideals which grew out of my life with you and a few of our common friends . ''

		Added to the perfect squareness of his dealings was a remarkable ability to get along smoothly with associates and subordinates .

		Those under him admired and respected him , and also felt a cordial liking for him ; hence they obeyed his orders and were always ready to listen to him when differences had to be adjusted to prevent a strike or other serious disturbance .

		His faculty for conciliating discontented or hostile workmen was notorious , and it became the habit of his superiors to '' leave all the rows to
Baldwin	PERSON	. ''

		It was his transparent honesty and his sense of fair play that prevailed where others would have but wasted their words .

		When the presidency of the
Long Island	LOCATION	Rail - road was offered him he told the directors that he did not think himself the man they wanted , because he was known to be on the working - man 's side and that was not the attitude they would expect in a railroad president .

		On the contrary , was the reply , that was just the reason they wanted him for president .

		And when his anti-Tammany activity as chairman of the famous
Committee of Fifteen	ORGANIZATION	seemed likely to impair his practical usefulness in the great work of securing tunnel and terminal rights in
New York	LOCATION	for the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	and the
Long Island Railroads	LOCATION	, he had his resignation all ready to send in to the railway officials ; in fact , it was sent in , but was refused , as we are glad to note .


Baldwin	PERSON	's work for Tuskegee and for South - ern education in general , his exertions for tenement-house reform and for the lessening of the social evil , his service as
Smith College	ORGANIZATION	trustee and as co-worker in countless good causes , as well as individual doer of many kind deeds unknown to the world , would by them - selves fill a volume .

		Professor
Brooks	PERSON	has , naturally enough , chosen to dwell on his efforts and achievements as a broad-minded , far-seeing railroad man , as a student of the race question and an active worker for the improvement of the negro , and as a social reformer conspicuous in the many movements for weeding out the innumerable evils that rankly flourish in the administration of our municipal affairs .

		With
Baldwin	PERSON	as his starting-point and returning - point , the biographer has made numerous excur - sions into domains familiar to him and inviting enough to the reader , but having little immediate connection with his main theme .

		For example , the chapters on `` Trade-Unions , '' `` Labor and Capital , '' and '' Open or Closed Shop , '' though excellent and useful , and here and there show - ing where
Baldwin	PERSON	stood in the larger concerns of his calling , do not contribute much toward filling in the portrait which the book is supposed to present of this singularly winning and gifted character .

		That he was richly endowed with other capabilities than those of a commercial and executive order , is made plain by the fol - lowing paragraph from his close friend , Dr.
Samuel A. Eliot	PERSON	, quoted by Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	: `` What sensitiveness to beauty played about his strength !

		He sunned his soul in music .

		He could always sing well , and nothing gave him greater pleas - ure .

		He never had time for much instruction in music , but he could manage to play somehow on almost any musical instrument .

		If he had not been a railroad president I think he would have liked to be a church organist .

		He loved nature and enjoyed the perplexities and trials of a farmer 's life .

		He could talk about soils and crops with the same buoyant enthusiasm as about subways or the great composers .

		He loved the bright laughter of little children , the flying cloud-shadows on his lawn , and the rush of the surf up the beach . ''

		As a lesson in civic righteousness ,
Baldwin	PERSON	's life , as told by Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	, is most admirable ; and the tale is full of warm human interest , despite the social and economic disquisitions which have been interspersed and for which we are not ungrateful .

		Three portraits are pro- vided : of
Baldwin	PERSON	the young college graduate , of
Baldwin	PERSON	the man of thirty-six , and of Bald - win as he appeared in his last years .

		The book , dedicated `` to the men and women of
America	LOCATION	in whose keeping lies the civic and business honor of the nation , '' is worthy of their careful reading .

		Inly 16 , are but a remnant of the multitudes of their generation which came into the world .

		A simple calculation will demonstrate this , for if all the individuals of even the slowest breeding species were to survive , the world would be overstocked in a short time .

		In this game of life , with the odds so heavily against the individual , much de - pends upon success in eluding natural enemies .

		As the slayer sharpens his wits and claws , so must the slayee contrive new ways to escape him , or all is lost .

		Yet it is not quite correct to say `` contrive , '' for usually no volition or deliberate intention is involved .

		It is simply this : through the continual destruction of the more easily detected individuals , in the course of ages , all variability in the direction of ineon - spicuousness is favored , with a final result which is at once the delight and wonder of anyone who will pay attention to it .

		To anyone who has seen a bird hunting in - sects , it may well seem that all the concealing coloration in nature , wonderful as it is , is really of no account .

		The robin on the lawn can find grubs enough for a full meal where I saw nothing .

		The predators get enough to eat , in spite of anything ; and what could they more ?

		Then again , some concealing devices are admittedly nearly perfect to our eyes , but what about the lesser degrees of inconspicuousness leading up to them ?

		Would they deceive anything ?

		Would not the animals perish before they attained any sort of success ?

		In answer to this , it must be recalled , in the first place , that in the long ages past the hunt - ers must have grown in skill , the ability to find and the ability to avoid being found developing in equal measure .

		In the second place , the important thing , after all , is usually relative inconspicuousness .

		A plate of peaches passed around the table , all of them in full sight , will sometimes illustrate the principle of natural selection .

		When food is abundant , as is com - monly the case , the predator will select , -RCB- -RRB- erhaps unconsciously , the more conspicuous , other things being equal .

		Thus , when there is more than enough to go round , creatures which would be readily detected were they alone will escape amid the multitude of more noticeable or more attractive objects .

		The outcome is , that living nature abounds with disguises of every kind ; and there is no more fascinating occupation for the naturalist than to hunt these out , as they occur in every woodland or meadow , mountain or desert , and even in the great ocean .

		For the most part , these things are never seen , and so to many who read Mr.
G. H. Thayer	PERSON	's new book on '' Conceal ing-Coloration , '' there will IK ?

Abbott	PERSON	II .


Thayer	PERSON	, who is well known as a skilful artist .

		In
1896	DATE	he published the important generalization which is now known as ``
Thayer	PERSON	's law , '' showing that nearly all animals are darker above than beneath , this difference very accurately balancing the amount of illumi - nation .

		By means of models he made it evident that if animals were merely `` colored like their surroundings , '' they would be conspicuous !

		> - cause of the shaded under parts , but the actual difference of tint produces a nearly uniform effect which makes them `` flat '' and incon - spicuous .

		This common-sense suggestion was widely and favorably discussed , and it was remarked that it took the eye of an artist to fully appreciate the meaning of color in nature .

		After this success , Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	and his son con - tinued to follow up the subject with enthusiasm , and as a result we have a large and beautifully illustrated book , written by the latter .

		In the Introduction , it is claimed that this whole sub - ject belongs properly to the arti > t. `` The entire matter lias been in the hands of the wrong custodians .

		Appertaining solely to animals , it has naturally been considered part of the zoologist 's province .

		But it properly belongs to the realm of pictorial art , and can be interpreted only by painters .

		For it deals wholly in optic.-il illusion , and this is the very gist of a painter 's life .

		He is born with a sense of it ; and , from his cradle to his grave , his eyes , where - ever they turn , are unceasingly at work on it , and his pictures live by it .

		What wonder , then , if it was for him alone to discover that the very art he practices is at full beyond the most delicate precision of human powers on almost all animals ? ''

		The writer of this review , being one of those who are thrown out of court by the terms of this utterance , should perhaps be still ; but he will venture a mild protest .

		Were he an artist like Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	, he would be tempted to ask the editor 's permission to insert a cartoon repre - senting the new-born infant investigating optical i illusion .

		The truth is , that the painter is trained ; to view color , form , light and shade , in a partic - ular way ; and there is no doubt whatever that he has a special outlook on the world for this reason .

		It may fairly be suggested , however , that all artists seek harmony and beauty , and are able to find it where others can not .

		Is it not possible , therefore , that they sometimes sec too much , from the standpoint of the present investigation ?

		Predatory animals are not look - ing for color harmonies , but rather the reverse , and their whole training and point of view must be very different from that of Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	.

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 35 It would take another book to discuss the facts in detail , but after prolonged considera - tion I can only conclude that the field is still open for a more critical and scientifically trained investigator .

		The authors appear to have such absolute faith in their own judgment , and so little regard for any other possible points of view , that they are not in the best position to do scientific work .

		One is continually reminded of
Whistler	LOCATION	's remark to Chase : '' My dear Colonel , I 'm not arguing with you : I 'm telling you ! ''

		In consequence they lead us to such ex - treme views that we are almost ready to believe , by way of reaction , that the whole thing is hum - bug .

		Every bird and every animal is assumed to be inconspicuous in its proper surroundings , and if it has any striking patches of color these are said to '' cut up '' its figure so that it looks like something else .

		No doubt there is some - thing in this ; but placing ourselves in the sup - posed position of a predator , we find that we are looking continually for something which , according to the hypothesis , we never see .

		We rather conclude that under the circumstances we should drop the psychological concept of what a bird ought to look like -LRB- how did we get it ? -RRB-

		and begin to attend to actual appearances !

		Perhaps the climax of our astonishment is reached when we come to some pictures of flamingoes .

		The red flamingoes match a brilliant red sky , at sun - rise or sunset , but the white species with a dash of red matches a white cloud , with a red sunlit one seen against it !

		In general , in spite of artistic authority to the contrary , we are satisfied that the color-tones in the pictures are far too flat and uniform -LRB- e. g. , plate xi . -RRB-

		.

		This may be partly due to the method of reproduction , but we are invited to accept them as they stand .

		On the whole , it seems to me that the book is un suited for those who will use it uncritically ; but for those who care to study the phenomena it discusses , it will be helpful and instructive , and its very faults may then prove stimulating .

New York	LOCATION	:
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		in the first three , dealing with President
Gil	PERSON	- man 's career before the founding of the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, he edited chapters contrib - uted respectively by Mr.
William C. Gilman	PERSON	,
Miss Emily H. Whitney	PERSON	and her sister Miss
Margaret D. Whitney	PERSON	, and Professor
William Carey Jones	PERSON	of
the University of California	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book thus has the unity of a single author 's work , and the additional advantage that each period of Dr.
Gilman	PERSON	's life is sympathetically presented by one who knew him at the time and could draw upon a rich fund of personal recol - lection .

		President
Gilman	PERSON	was preeminently an edu - cational organizer and leader .

		His thought was often , indeed one might say usually , a generation in advance of the day ; but his effort was always practical .

		The keynote of his whole career is sounded in a letter that he wrote from
Berlin	LOCATION	, in
1854	DATE	, when he was still undecided upon any definite course in life . ''

		For some things , I rejoice to find that my notions grow more and more definite .

		For instance , in the desire to act upon the minds of men , to do my part , even though it may be but little , for the elevation and improvement of such society as my lot may be cast in .

		It seems to me that I care less and less for money and for fame , but I do desire to use what influence I can for the establishment of such ideas as seem to be im - portant and right .

		Whether this be done by the voice or the pen , or by both , whether in the pulpit or in the college , in the editor 's chair or the office of a common school superintendent , can not perhaps for many years be decided . ''

		Truly this was an ideal of unusual maturity for a young man of twenty-three , and it was in holding to this ideal of helpful service for more than fifty years that his greatness consisted .

		Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	was born
July 6 , 1831	DATE	, and graduated from
Yale	ORGANIZATION	in the class of
1852	DATE	.

		In
December	DATE	of the following year he and his life - long friend , Dr.
Andrew D. White	PERSON	, sailed for
Europe	LOCATION	as attaches of the
United States Legation	LOCATION	at
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	.

		The next two years were spent partly at the Russian capital , partly in study and travel .

		In
1855	DATE	he returned to
New Haven	LOCATION	and became assistant librarian , subse - quently librarian , at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, a position that he held for the next ten years .

		Prior to
1859	DATE	he also acted as school visitor , when his efficient service in introducing the graded system and written examinations in the grammar schools led to the appointment of the first Superintend - ent of Public Schools in
New Haven	LOCATION	and the establishment of a high school .

		These were formative years for the modern system of edu - cation , and the ideas he advocated at that time are worth noting .

		In a pamphlet on '' The 36 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, Idea of the Graded School '' he not only pre - sented the advantages of the system , but in urg - ing the cultivation of habits of clear thinking and close observation he advocated a more careful study of English and the use of simple geo - metric figures with elementary drawing .

		These ideas have in large measure been realized in recent years in all our better schools .

		Unfor - tunately , his notion that the cultivation of the voice in speaking is more important than in sing - ing has not as yet found general acceptance .

		With the passage of the
Morrill Act	ORGANIZATION	, Mr. Oilman interested himself in securing its bene - fits for tbe
Scientific School	ORGANIZATION	already established at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was appointed Professor of
Physi	LOCATION	- cal Geography in
1863	DATE	, and for the next nine years proved himself not only an exceptionally inspiring teacher , but in his administrative work as secretary of its faculty he was largely instru - mental in securing endowment and so shaping policy that the '' step-child '' of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	became the
Scheffield Scientific School	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was at this time , partly by force of circumstances , that he worked out the idea of the `` group system , '' an idea that later proved of the utmost value to the universities that he directed and to educational policy in general .

		In
1865	DATE	Professor
Gilman	PERSON	resigned his posi - tion as librarian , because he could see no pros - pect of obtaining adequate funds for either books or administration .

		It is an interesting commen - tary on progress in library affairs to note that the library at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	was then open but five hours daily , was housed in a building practically unheated , and that students desiring to borrow books were required to pay a fee for each volume taken out .

		It is pleasant to add that , largely through Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	's influence , the reforms that as librarian he had been unable to obtain were soon secured .

		In the
spring of 1866	DATE	Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	prepared the first annual report of the
State Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		Many of the ideas he then advanced , especially regarding the consolidation of small school districts , the care of vicious and backward children , and cooperation between the schools and colleges , though now generally considered necessary , are not yet carried through ; indeed , they are often regarded as among the most recent notions in educational development .

		Between 1865 and
1872	DATE	Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	, though devoting himself primarily to the duties of his professorship , gained a wide reputation as a man fitted to be the executive head of a large university .

		In
1870	DATE	he was called to the presi - dency of the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, and a few weeks later to that of
the University of California	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was also prominently mentioned as the successor of President
Woolsey	PERSON	; but for election at his alma mater he was too much of a man of the '' new education . ''

		What would otherwise have been the result , is an interesting but fruitless query .

		In
1872	DATE	came a second call to the
University of California	ORGANIZATION	; and now family considerations led him to accept .

		Space forbids any extended notice of the work done by him during the two years that he held the position .

		It must , how - ever , be said in passing , that the time was a critical one in the development of the Univer - sity , and that to President
Gilman	PERSON	is due the credit of establishing its entire freedom from the control of party politics in the legislature , and also of securing the fund that has made the
Lick Observatory	ORGANIZATION	its astronomical department .

		With the founding of the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, in
1874	DATE	, Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	was elected to the presidency , and charged with the task of its organization and the selection of its faculty .

		It is worth noting that the Trustees , before making their choice , had sought the advice of the Presidents of
Harvard	LOCATION	,
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	, and Mich - igan , and each of them had immediately named Mr.
Gilman	PERSON	as the man best fitted for the posi - tion .

		His wise and tactful administration made the
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	foundation the first real American university .

		To give an adequate description of the influence he exerted in this way would be to write the history of American graduate study , and would include the biogra - phies of many men now prominent in academic work .

		As a well-known educator recently re - marked , no small part of President Oilman 's best service was in recognizing young men of extrordinary ability and setting them at research work .

		In this connection may be mentioned , from a far longer list , the names of
Henry A. Rowland	PERSON	,
C. K. Lanman	PERSON	,
Ira Kemson	LOCATION	, and
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	.

		The early courses of lectures that the most eminent men in various lines , among them
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Cooley	PERSON	,
Walker	PERSON	, and Child , were invited to deliver , also did much to create a university atmosphere .

		Thus from the vory first , through the philosophical faculty that President
Gilman	PERSON	gathered around him .

		the ideals of scholarship and scientific research that characterized the German universities were established for this country .

		In laying the foundations of the
Medical School	ORGANIZATION	at
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	, President Oilman also set a standard that , in the words of the present Dean of the School , constitutes - his
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 37 second great contribution to the educational development of this country . ''

		For various rea - sons , the Medical School was not established till seventeen years after
the University	ORGANIZATION	opened its doors .

		President Oilman had , however , antici - pated it from the very beginning , and with the prevision of a great leader had insisted upon a high standard of preparation and professional attainment .

		At that date no medical school in
America	LOCATION	demanded even the preparation needed to enter the freshman class of any reputable college .

		But President Oilman felt that a col - legiate degree should be demanded , and that the work leading to it should be chosen with special reference to fitting the candidate for his subse - quent professional study .

		Natural sciences , the modern languages , psychology , and ethics , were , he felt , indispensable subjects ; and an attempt was made to provide such a course .

		What he wanted is well indicated by his sympathy with the jesting suggestion of a friend that the course should lead to the degree of F.S.M. -LRB- fit to study medicine -RRB- .

		In working toward his ideal , the first biological laboratory in
America	LOCATION	had been established when the
University	ORGANIZATION	opened , and Dr.
H. Newell Martin	PERSON	-LRB- a pupil of
Huxley	LOCATION	's -RRB- and Professor
William K. Brooks	PERSON	had been called to the
Chairs of Physiology	ORGANIZATION	and Morphology .

		Their teaching attracted to the
University	ORGANIZATION	many brilliant students whose names are now widely known .

		In
1884	DATE	Dr.
William H. Welch	PERSON	was appointed
Professor of Pathology	ORGANIZATION	, as that seemed to be the next scientific chair demanding an experimental laboratory and yet distinct from the
Hospital	ORGANIZATION	.

		The latter was entirely independ - ent of the
University	ORGANIZATION	and had a distinct
Board of Trustees	ORGANIZATION	, but
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	had expressly demanded that it should ultimately form a part of the Medical School .

		With the completion of their buildings the trustees of the
Hospital	ORGANIZATION	proposed to begin the work of medical instruc - tion .

		To this , President Oilman was unalter - ably opposed .

		Such instruction , he felt , should be in intimate relation to the other chairs and faculties of
the University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Fortunately his view prevailed , and the two Boards of Trustees united in the appointment of Dr.
Osier	PERSON	as chief physician , Dr.
Halsted	PERSON	as chief surgeon , and Dr.
Kelley	PERSON	as gynaecologist , at the
Hospital	ORGANIZATION	, each receiving a corresponding title at the Uni - versity .

		The Medical School thus constituted was opened in
1893	DATE	.

		It was and is a graduate school in the sense that it accepts as students only college graduates .

		It thus appears that the words of Dean
Howell	PERSON	, quoted above , are fully justified by the facts ; for though other causes have contributed to raise the standards of medi - cal education in this country , none has been more potent than the high ideal proposed and attained by President Oilman .

		Space forbids any further discussion of this most interesting biography .

		President Oilman 's activity in civic affairs , in the work of organized charity , and especially his share in devising and setting in motion the machinery of the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, must be passed without mention .

		But it is not fair to conclude without a brief word concerning the letters that are included in the volume .

		In them the personal side of Dr. Oilman 's life and work is well presented .

		They show him as a sincere friend , a devoted husband , a considerate and tender father and brother .

		In his selection of this material Mr.
Franklin	PERSON	has shown admirable judgment and taste .

		Enough , but not too much , is given .

		The book is inter - esting , inspiring , and thoroughly satisfactory .

		It forms a notable contribution to American biography .


LEWIS A. RHOADES	PERSON	.

		THE MASTERS or PROSE IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		* Mr.
William C. Brownell	PERSON	's volume on the masters of prose in
America	LOCATION	is a notable addi - tion to the books of criticism that are not to be lightly glanced at and laid aside .

		These six essays first saw the light in '' Scribner 's Magazine , '' and are now reprinted with slight modifications .

		Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	holds a place of importance among English-speaking critics .

		His work on the Victorians was discriminating and enlightening ; if he did not say the last word on the subject -LRB- fortunately no one can -RRB- , he considerably advanced the discussion .

		At least the same is true , we think , of the present work .

		His method is commendable .

		He subjects each author to close scrutiny with reference to substance , aim , culture , and style .

		He detaches himself as carefully as possible ; he represses , for the most part , his own feelings ; his criticism is the result not of feeling but of conviction .

		His standards are uncompromi - singly high .

		His conclusions are invariably stated with due modesty ; he never suggests the attitude of ipse dixi .

		For him the adjudication of a writer 's place or achievement is no easy task .

		For
Cooper	PERSON	, Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	makes large claims , and accords him , relatively , the highest praise of all the writers he considers .

		Cooper 's Indians are ably defended ; his women are affirmed to * AMERICAN PROSE MASTERS :

Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Henry James	PERSON	.

W. C. Brownell	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		38 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, be , on the whole , well drawn .

		Incidentally Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	severely handles the provinciality of
New England	LOCATION	in the
second quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		No doubt
New England	LOCATION	was provincial ; yet it may be seriously ques - tioned if
Cooper	PERSON	's own provinciality was not in some respects nearly as great .

		Certainly it was not a time of large and catholic views in either politics or religion , in
New York	LOCATION	or in
New England	LOCATION	.

		In estimating the worth of criticism , the temperament of both the critic and the author criticized must be taken into account .

		Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	disparages
Hawthorne	PERSON	more than any of the others .

		Is he temperamentally fitted to estimate the work of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	?

		To recur to our last paragraph , does he understand the
New England	LOCATION	of which
Hawthorne	PERSON	was the flower ?

		Beyond `` The Scarlet Letter , '' he will allow little good in all that
Hawthorne	PERSON	wrote .

		His novels '' have not the reality of novels . '' ''

		The
House	ORGANIZATION	of the Seven Gables '' is , '' if not the least characteristic of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's larger productions , at least that in which the characters have the slenderest interest , the most shadowy outlines '' -LRB- p. 870 -RRB- .

		Not many will concur in this .

		The '' Tales , '' though original , refined , and elevated , are nevertheless pronounced mediocre -LRB- p. 75 -RRB- . ''

		The Wonder Book '' and '' Tanglewood Tales '' `` have only a juvenile appeal . ''

		The signifi - cance of '' The Marble Faun '' is '' entombed rather than exhibited in its treatment '' -LRB- p. 86 -RRB- .

		Finally ,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	'' had very little to brood over '' -LRB- p. 107 -RRB- .

		We should be disposed to think he had a good deal .

		Mr.
BrownelTs	PERSON	theory is that
Hawthorne	PERSON	allowed his fancy to develop at the expense of his imagination .

		This theory may have led its champion to conclusions that will not find general acceptance .

		Take , for example , '' The Marble Faun . ''

		Must the failure of this story , so far as it can be said to have failed , be attributed to the play of fancy -LRB- e. g. , about Donatello 's ears -RRB- indulged at the expense of the imagination -LRB- < .

		/ / .

		, as regards the effects of sin upon the three characters -RRB- ?

		It seems doubtful .

		Equally questionable in some respects is the conclusion about
Emerson	PERSON	.

		It is quite true that
Emerson	PERSON	's appeal is primarily to the mind ; it is not quite so clear that he '' deifies intellect . ''

		To quote one or two sentences : `` His deification of intellect , indeed , inevitably in - volves a corresponding deficiency in susceptibility , and defective sympathies are accordingly and were as a matter of fact with him as characteristic of
Emer	PERSON	- son 's order of moral elevation as is this one enthusiasm to which his susceptibility limited him '' -LRB- p. 147 -RRB- ... '' Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	... maintains that
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	is essentially religious .

		I can not myself see it .

		Perhaps it is a question of definition , but surely it is an accepted idea that religion is a matter of the heart , and one is confident that no religious or uther emotion ever seri - ously disturbed the placid alternation of systole and diastole in
Emerson	LOCATION	's '' -LRB- p. 150 -RRB- .

		But is religion so much a matter of the heart rather than of the head ' \ \ V have the authority of a respectable writer that ** as a man thinketh in his heart , so is he . ''

		And when our critic affirms that
Emerson	PERSON	's idealism was '' as hostile to the essence as to the ecclesiasticism of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity '' -LRB- p. 169 -RRB- , the reply must be that this depends upon what is meant by the essence of Christianity a meaning which it ought not to be difficult to-day to ascertain .

		Of Foe , Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	perhaps asks too much .

		What he seems to ask for is that
Poe	PERSON	should have dealt with other materials of life with the same skill with which he handles the gruesome and the horrible .

		This is as if one were to quarrel with a great painter for not being as great a sculptor .

		It must , of course , be granted that
Poe	PERSON	is sometimes too self-conscious ; that too often his attitude is that of the fat boy announcing to his auditors that he is going to make their flesh creep .

		The fact is , that very frequently
Poe	PERSON	does this , just as he promised .

		With regard to
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's alleged unscrupulousness -LRB- p. 223f . -RRB-

		, one may admit that he reveals a greater lack of conscience than many others , but need not go to the length of calling him a liar .

		And when he is mentioned in the same breath with
Mandeville	LOCATION	and
Miinchausen	PERSON	-LRB- p. 223 -RRB- , the result is , we think , misleading .

		Even
Mandeville	LOCATION	was not exactly lying , in the strict sense ; he was writing fiction for a credulous age .

		Poe wrote for a different kind of public , and was perfectly well aware of its nature .

		Finally , in saying that as literature
Poe	PERSON	's writ - ings '' are essentially valueless '' -LRB- p. 262 -RRB- , does not our critic champion an extreme view ?

		In our way of thinking , the chief defect of Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	's criticism is a slight lack of sympathy .

		` Does he not now and then fail to consider all the circumstances of intention , environment , the limitations imposed by early training , and the like ?

		The possibility of this , at least , recurs persistently .

		His style , too , at times lacks lucidity .

		Two examples of this may be quoted .

		He has been speaking of
Lowell	LOCATION	's wide reading and the charge that
Lowell	PERSON	lacked scholarship : '' Not a scholar !

		Le moye/i , as the French say , for such a tremendous bookman not to be '' -LRB- p. 295 -RRB- .

		Again , of Hawthorne : '' Something seems distinctly left out of his organization that particular faculty whose function it is to
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 39 make the most of its fellows '' -LRB- p. 97 -RRB- .

		Admit - ting that the sense of these passages can be made out , one may still affirm that they fall short of Quintilian 's ideal , that it shall be impossible to mistake the sense .

		One finds , moreover , too many French quotations .

		The English language may be limited ; one begins , however , to doubt if its limitations are as pro- nounced as is implied by so frequently resort - ing to another speech .

		We repeat , however , that Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	has made a distinct contribution to the discussion of several matters vitally important for the growth of American literary art .

		His method is the only safe one , and most of his conclusions will commend themselves to thoughtful readers .

		In his hands the art of criticism is exemplified as a dignified form of activity , worthy of the ablest minds .


CLARK S. NORTHUP	PERSON	.

		RECENT FICTION .

		* The conception of human society which is crystal - lized in the terrible phrase of Hobbes , homo homini lupus , is presented with force and conviction by Mr.
Robert Herrick	PERSON	in his latest novel , `` A Life for a Life . ''

		The conception is an inadequete one , and only embittered souls will adopt it as a working formula ; but most of us fall at times into the mood which it fits .

		Certainly the gospel of success , as it is both preached and practiced in our country at the present day , gives much countenance to the view that the chief end of man is to prey upon his fellow - man , and that the kind of life commonly held most desirable is to be gained only at the cost of the crushing of weaker lives .

		That great numbers of men have in view a higher end than this , seeking a life that is not built upon the wrecked happiness of others , we profoundly believe ; and the fault of * A LIFE FOB A LIFE .

		Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's picture is that it is painted in colors too black to be representative of the whole of life .

		This , it will be remembered , was the conspicuous fault of his treatment of the marriage problem in ' Together . ''

		But indignation sometimes rises to such a flood as to sweep away all the sober counsels of reason ; and it is in this heightened temper that Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	has penned his diatribe against the heartless and frenzied commercialism of our time .

		His method is that of
Isben	LOCATION	, although he has little of
Isben	ORGANIZATION	's technical skill , and the idealist , passionate and far from hopeless , may be discovered below the pessimistic surface of his presentation .

		He is obsessed by the notion that great individual wealth must needs be ill-gotten , in defiance of the moral law ; and therein he allies himself with the sensa - tionalists who in the cheap magazines appeal to the meanest passions of their readers .

		What we now most need in dealing with the ominous problem of plutocracy is a constructive philosophy which shall distinguish between honest and dishonest fortunes , which shall be as zealous in its defence of the former as fierce in its denunciation of the latter , and which shall lead an attack , not upon the institution of private property in general , but upon the forces of privilege and corruption that now work such unquestionable injustice between man and man .

		Such books as '' A Life for a Life , '' with all their admirable indignation and powerful pleading for a higher morality in the world of affairs , simply play into the hands of the socialists , the realization of whose aims would be the end of all civilization .

		The machinery of Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's novel is fairly conven - tional until near the close , when it becomes simply fantastic .

		His hero , a foundling , grows up in the country , and then comes to the great city to make his way .

		He wins a measure of success under the patronage of the magnate who gives him a start , and whose daughter he dares to love .

		But as his eyes become opened to the conditions under which success of this kind is achieved , he determines to renounce all that he has gained even the love that is his for the asking and cast in his lot with the people .

		The climax of the story comes with an earthquake which lays the great city in ruins , and in which the hero gives up his life .

		The moral is found in this comment of a friend : '' To break the circle of ideas that dominate men that was what
Hugh Grant	PERSON	believed must be done .

		The vicious circle was broken here for thousands by an act of supreme force from without .

		But it must be done singly , individually , each with himself and those nearest his influence .

		The great end can not come through political action , by theory or programme , by any division of the spoils , any readjustment of laws , but only by Will the individual good will to renounce , working against the evil will to possess . ''

		Powerful as this work undoubtedly is , and deserving to be treated with the utmost seriousness , it must never - theless be urged once more that it is a biased pro- duction , and is devoid of any gleam of geniality .

		40 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's sympathies are intense bat narrow ; we hope that in time they will become more com - prehensive .

		Absolute originality of plot is probably an ideal henceforth unattainable by the writer of fiction , but a refreshing degree of originality is still sometimes achieved , a notable recent example being found in `` The Wild Olive , '' by the author of that rather tricky success of last year , `` The Inner Shrine . ''

		In his new novel , Mr.
Basil King	PERSON	, who now seems to be credited with the authorship , certainly pro- vides us with a fresh and piquant opening .

		A fugtitive from the law , already sentenced to death for murder -LRB- of which of course he is innocent -RRB- , is hunted through the Adirondack wilderness by the officers from whom he has escaped .

		Hard pressed , he takes refuge in a lonely cottage , which turns out to be the
summer	DATE	home of the judge who had passed sentence upon him .

		A young woman with Indian blood in her veins -LRB- the judge 's ward -RRB- takes him under her protection , hides him for some weeks in a secluded studio , and arranges for his final escape by way of
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	, the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	, and a transatlantic steamer .

		He is provided with money , clothing , and a new name , all of which he takes with him , first to
England	LOCATION	, then to the Argentine , where he obtains employment , receives rapid promotion , and achieves a successful business career .

		The closing section of the story brings him back to
New York	LOCATION	, and at the same time entangles him in a love affair .

		This confronts him with the moral problem of his assumed name and anomalous legal position .

		He decides that he must make a clean breast of it and take the consequences , which prove to be the loss of his bethrothed -LRB- who is a shallow creature after all -RRB- , and the realization that his destined companion is no other than the young woman to whom he has all the time been indebted for his new start in life .

		His name is cleared soon after he has resumed it .

		and the complication works out to a satisfactory conclusion .

		It makes a strik - ingly interesting story , and a much better one than its predecessor .

		Mr.
Will Levington	PERSON	Comfort pulls the strings of international politics to very lively effect in his stirring romance , ''
Routledge	PERSON	Rides Alone . ''

		It seems that a British officer in
India	LOCATION	was guilty of an indescretion in his frontier operations a good many years ago , and became responsible for the massacre of a number of Afghans .

		The matter was hushed up , and the Afghans , ignorant of the offence , remained on friendly terms with the British and con - tinued to serve in their useful capacity as a buffer against Russian aggression .

		But the facts were at last betrayed to
Russia	LOCATION	by an Irish newspaper cor - respondent , whose hatred of
England	LOCATION	amounted to fanaticism .

		Then there was much excited con - sultation in the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	, and a frantic effort to seek cover ; for the revelation meant that
Russia	LOCATION	would invade
India	LOCATION	with the connivance of
Afghanistan	LOCATION	.

		Nothing but a coup would save the desperate situation , and when this was decided upon it took the form of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance which startled the world a few years ago .

		Tluu the war between
Japan	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	was precipitated , and the threatened invasion of
India	LOCATION	averted .

		Upon this historical basis , partly real and partly imagined , Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	has built an impressive story of love and war , of intrigue and adventure , that has an unusual degree of interest .

		The hero
Routledge	PERSON	is a sort of free lance among correspondents , and his exploits are the wonder of the profession .

		He is a friend of the Irish traitor , and the lover of
Noreen	PERSON	, the Irishman 's daughter .

		Returning to
England	LOCATION	when excitement over the betrayal runs highest in the secret councils of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, he finds himself accused of the infamous deed , and ostracised by society .

		Learning that his Irish friend is the one who is really guilty , he rejects the opportunity thus offered to clear his own name , and bears all the burden of obloquy , sustained only by
Noreen	PERSON	's unswerving belief in his innocence .

		Then he dis - appears , becomes an American correspondent in
Manchuria	LOCATION	, and wins new professional laurels .

		He is finally rehabilitated through
Noreen	PERSON	's efforts , after her father has made a death-bed confession .

		This should make a good story , judging from the outline alone ; it makes , in fact , one of the best stories of its kind that we have ever read .

		The comparison with Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's work is inevitable ; and .

		Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	does not suffer in the comparison .

		His work is tense , virile , and deeply informed .

		More - over , it has a distinctive style , which is as far as possible removed from the banal or commonplace , and may be exemplified by a bit of introspective musing in which the hero indulges . ''

		Which is better , a gaunt , hungry , storm-bitten wanderer , with his face forever at the fire-lit window-panes of civili - zation , or a creased and cravatted master of little ceremonies within ?

		A citizen of ordered days and nights , or an exile with the windy planet forever roaring in his skull ? ''

		The work remains closely in touch with actuality throughout , yet it is shot through with imaginative gleams , and tinged with the mysticism that is justified by its oriental set - ting .

		In characterization it is swift and incisive ; it has in
Routledge	PERSON	a very proper hero , and in
Noreen	LOCATION	the kind of heroine that it is good to dream about .

		They call him '' Collars-and - cuffs '' because he wears clean linen in a community that affects to despise such evidences of civilization .

		He is the new superintendent of one of the toughest divisions of a railway in the
Southwest	LOCATION	.

		When he starts upon his job , he finds lawlessness and insubordina - tion everywhere , his authority uixK-nnined , and his life in constant danger .

		He has accepted the post with reluctance , because he believes himself to be a coward , having in his consciousness the dishearten - ing memory of a hold-up in which he did not meas - ure up to his own standard of manliness .

		What makes the matter worse is that his failure to rise to that perilous occasion has discredited him in the eyes of the young woman upon whom he has fixed
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 his affections .

		But he is persuaded to test himself once more , and assumes the command of the desper - ate situation to discover , when the crisis comes , that his cowardice is only superficial , that it is of the panic sort which threatens to overwhelm for a moment but loses its terrors when he gets what he calls his '' second wind . ''

		Thus he redeems himself after all , in his own eyes and in those of the heroine , who is conveniently present -LRB- looking through a crack in the door -RRB- at the psychological moment .

		All of this is related with verve and realism in '' The Taming of Red Butte Western , '' by Mr.
Francis Lynde	PERSON	.

		The book is an acceptable successor to '' The King of
Arcadia	LOCATION	, '' which acquainted us with a not dis - similar set of conditions and collection of types .

		Both books have a close grip upon Western life , are condensed in description and natural in dialogue , and bear a sharp message of implied rebuke to all mollycoddles .

		An impoverished
Virginia	LOCATION	plantation is the scene of '' The Scar , '' by Mr.
Warrington Dawson	PERSON	.

		The characters are the widowed owner struggling to keep a roof over the family , her two sons , a few neighbors , and a vain and selfish young woman who first makes a visit and later comes to stay , having infatuated one of the sons and made herself his wife .

		The time is the present .

		Out of these materials the author has made a story of moderate interest , photographically true in most , matters of detail , but far from successful in its attempt to realize and make consistent all of the leading fig - ures .

		The best delineation in the book is that of the mother , hardened and embittered by her struggle with poverty , and implacable in her resentment toward the woman whose entrance into the family she considers a bold and designing intrusion .

		This woman , who becomes morally guilty of her hus - band 's death , is afterwards mated to a man who is almost as wobbly as herself in his moral standards , and the prospect of a hardly deserved happiness faces them at the close .

		It is a rather depressing book , and its execution falls far short of its artistic intention .

		Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	's novels are so much alike that the same formula will do fairly well for any of them .

		They are ingenious in plot , swift and varied in action , and are written with the superior air of one who has access to the penetralia of high society and high politics . ''

		The Illustrious Prince '' is one of the best of them , and keeps the reader alert .

		It is a story of international intrigue , and the `` Prince '' is a secret agent of the Japanese government who is also one of the wiliest of criminals , shrinking from no means that fit his ends . '

		His sojourn in
England	LOCATION	is for the purpose of advising his govern - ment as to the desirability of renewing the English alliance , and his decision turns upon the discovery that the voyage of the American fleet is not the veil of a sinister design to make an attack upon
Japan	LOCATION	.

		When he is at last enmeshed in the network of his own crimes , he permits an underling to assume all the guilt -LRB- after the approved fashion of Japanese patriotism -RRB- , and gets off scot-free .

		He is an en - gaging rascal , and we do not altogether regret the outcome .

		A young woman connected with the circus , a pro- fessional dompteuse with bronze hair , a seductive voice , and languorous feline grace , ensnares a gilded English youth whose star is rising above the politi - cal horizon .

		She has a shady French husband somewhere adrift in the world , but does not think it worth while to mention the fact .

		Her victim is a nice boy , brought up according to the strictest prin ciples by a sternly virtuous mother , who is naturally horrified when she learns that her son has succumbed to the wiles of the enchantress .

		The youth is secre - tary to
Simon de Gex	ORGANIZATION	,
M.P.	LOCATION	, and to the latter the mother turns for help in her perplexity .

		Simon con - sents to interview the siren , and thus we have pre - pared for us at the outset all the elements needed for a pathetic story of the Camille-Sapho-Zaza type .

		The story is called '' Simon the Jester , '' but its author , Mr.
William J. Locke	PERSON	, is more of a jester than his hero , and gives the situation a whimsical twist which has some startling consequences .

		Simon is in a peculiar fix .

		He has a '' pain inside '' which the physicians have diagnosed as the sign of a fatal dis - ease , and he has been given six months , more or less , to live .

		His problem is to decide how to conduct himself during this short shrift , in order that he may make a self-respecting and dignified exit from the stage .

		Taking a hint from
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	, he decides to devote his remaining days to the cultiva - tion of '' eumoiriety , '' which means '' the quintes - sence of happy-fatedness dealt unto oneself by a perfect altruism . ''

		The appeal made by the boy 's mother fits very well with this plan of deliberate altruism , and so he makes the acquaintance of
Lola Brandt	PERSON	with the most disinterested of intentions .

		But fate plays him the trick of substituting a new victim for the old one , and the young woman soon makes it evident that she has transferred her affec - tions to her altruistic visitor .

		At this point , in order that the story may proceed without unduly ruffling our emotions , we are made to understand that we have been wholly mistaken in the young woman , who is no mercenary adventuress , but a very pattern of all the virtues and a paragon of womanly loveli - ness .

		This is a pretty predicament for
Simon de Gex	ORGANIZATION	,
M.P.	LOCATION	, with six months , more or less , to live .

		He has already cut himself off from political life , and squandered most of his fortune to help a dis - tressed friend all in his pursuit of eumoiriety .

		Now it becomes his hard task to respect the conven - tions , suppress his personal feelings , and reunite Lola with her lost husband .

		The scene then changes to
Algiers	LOCATION	, where the husband is discovered , more disreputable than the wildest imaginings had pic - tured him ; but he is neatly despatched by the aveng - ing blade of a queer Greek dwarf , an exhibitor of trained cats , whose devotion to
Lola	LOCATION	is of the fanatic sort .

		Then
Simon	PERSON	falls into the hands of a French surgeon , who performs upon him a miraculous operation , with the result that the menace to his 42 -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, life is removed , and he is restored to the prospect of rounding out a normal existence .

		He returns to
England	LOCATION	, but is almost penniless as the conse - quence of his eumoirous proclivities , and , being preceded by the scandal of the taking-off of the undesirable husband and the magnified tale of his reputed relations with the widow , finds himself ostracised .

		But
Lola	PERSON	is faithful to him , and his love for her triumphs over all obstacles even over the difficulty offered by the mutilation of her face at the claws of an enraged cat -LRB- the Greek dwarf 's legacy -RRB- .

		He marries
Lola	LOCATION	, goes in for settlement work , and presumably lives happily ever after .

		This truly delightful tale is by no means represented by such a summary as we have attempted ; its chief charm is found , not in its invention , but in its quiet humor and deft allusiveness .

		It provides a worthy succes - sor for `` Septimus '' and `` The Beloved Vagabond , '' and '' The Morals of
Marcus Ordeyne	PERSON	. '' ''

		The Street of Adventure , '' by Mr.
Philip Gibbs	PERSON	, is a tale of Fleet Street which is another way of saying that it is a tale of the life of the
London	LOCATION	journalist .

		It begins with an account of how the hero seeks and finds a job on `` The Star '' -LRB- called `` The Rag '' by its familiars -RRB- , proceeds with the nar - rative of his reportorial trials and triumphs , and ends not nicely finished off , with wedding belli in the last line , as all good stories should '' but in abrupt and inconclusive fashion , although the wedding bells are at least a possibility of the future .

		It is a very human and natural and intimate story , brightened by quiet humor and softened by tender sentiment , a story of varied and picturesque in - cident , and no plot worth mentioning .

		The staff of '' The Star '' constitute an interesting family of distinctive personalities , and we get an effect closely akin to tragedy when the group is broken up as the owner 's willingness to ' put up '' ceases and the paper ends its existence .

		The atmosphere of
London	LOCATION	journalism seems to be sufficiently like that of its American counterpart to make the book , even in its slighter humors and accidents , easily intelligi - ble to American readers .

		Another story which has no plot to speak of , but is packed with interesting incidents , and is clearly a direct transcript of life , is Mr.
M. Little	PERSON	's At the Sign of the Burning
Bush	PERSON	. ''

		It is a story of three Scotch divinity students , their struggles and vicissitudes , their successes and failures .

		They are characterized for us in very lifelike fashion , and we are given a truly photographic picture of their existence at the various stages of their careers : i picture from which no detail is thought too petty for exclusion .

		It is a humdrum and uneventful sort of life with which the book acquaints us , but of its essential truthfulness we are never in any doubt .

		If the young men with whose professional fortunes we are here concerned do not answer to our precon - ceived and conventional idea of what Scotch minis - ters are like , they are at least authentic examples of humankind , as are also the women folk with whom they are associated by the ties of blood or friendship .

		Hut if the tone of present-day ecclesiastical circles in
Scotland	LOCATION	be fairly represented in this work , the modern departure from its traditional zeal and aus - terity is certainly surprising .

		After a long silenc * - .

		.

		Mr.
Hcnryk	PERSON	Si.-nkirwitv gives us '' Whirlpools , '' a novel of contemporary
Poland	LOCATION	, added to the group which already includes `` Without Dogma '' and `` The Children of tin - Si.il . ''

		Unfortunately , the tried translator of his other n < > v < U is dead , and the new work has fallen into the hands of a literary journeyman whose intentions may be of the best , but whose performance is stiff and un - gainly .

		The translator 's only idea of dealing with an idiomatic or picturesque phrase is to put it into bald and literal English , leaving the reader to puz - zle out the meaning as best he may .

		Aside from this handicap , the new work presents itself to us as a rather labored effort to give organic sliape to a great mass of undigested material .

		It has to do with the socialistic and agrarian unrest of the pres - ent time , and the confusion of unbalanced counsels among the men who should be the leaders of the race .

		The author himself does not seem to have a definite programme or an orderly system of ideas ; and this , at least , is to be expected from one who is as bitterly satirical and as destructively critical as he .

		His hero is a weak but generous-hearted aris - tocrat who in his boyhood had seduced a peasant girl upon his estate .

		The girl reappears many years after , having lived for a long time in
England	LOCATION	, where she has been adopted by a wealthy man of affairs .

		She is now a highly educated woman and a consider - able heiress , and her betrayer meets her as a new acquaintance , having no idea that he has ever seen her before .

		Her charm captivates him , and he becomes her declared lover , only to be confronted with the revelation of her past .

		For a time he is dazed , for such a marriage would be a serious busi - ness in that society of caste and prejudice ; but his love is such that he still resolves to take the step .

		But the woman is too proud to accept the alliance if he is to make any mental reservations ; he fails in the test , through his inherent weakness of character .

		So the story ends dismally enough , and the close is made even gloomier by the accidental death of a young girl who is a sort of secondary heroine a bright and beautiful creature who falls an accidental victim to mob violence .

		The philosopher who , like a Greek chorus , comments upon the whole tragic perplexity , thus voices the message of the work : `` Whirlpools !

		and of sand !

		Sand is burying the whole of
Poland	LOCATION	and transforming her into a wilder - ness , in which jackals live .

		If this is so , then it would be best to put a bullet in the head . ''

		But yet She lives in every one of us , in all of us together , and will survive all the whirlpools in the world .

		And we will set our teeth and will continue to suffer for Thee , Mother , and we and if God so wills it and our children and grandchildren will not renounce neither Thee nor hope . ''

		With this faintly qualified outburst of pessimism the story ends .

		THE DIAL 43 BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Fervently as English gardeners may bless the memor y of the late F : w .

		-
Meyer	PERSON	for setting forth the possibili - ties of '' Rock and Water Gardens '' so sensibly and alluringly , Americans will find in his book far greater reasons for according him their gratitude , since on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	almost nothing has been done in the field he chose for his own .

		A sin - cere student of nature in `` her more artistic aspects , with a knowledge of soils and stones equalled by his knowledge of the needs of the infinite variety of plants that have an affinity for rocky or watery places , Mr.
Meyer	PERSON	studied out the best possible way of bringing these together so as to make art forget itself and nature seem supreme .

		With great care and patience he has shown us how a rock-garden or a water-garden , or a combination of the two , should be planned and built in a manner to convert the barren horrors of an ordinary '' rockery , '' or a pool , into a congenial home for a vast number of beautiful and interesting plants .

		A stretch of old retaining - wall of stone was his delight , and reach a of time - worn brick-work meant such opportunity as he loved ; but lacking these , he told us , cheerfully enough , how to go to work with new stones and fresh - burned brick to lay walls that shall vie with those in interest .

		The American gardener is always seriously handicapped by the climate of our arid summers , our late and inconstant springs , and our early frosts ; and for him there is no ''
Heath	PERSON	Garden '' such as is described in the chapter added by Mr.
Dallimore	PERSON	of the
Royal Gardens	ORGANIZATION	at Keu .

		Otherwise there is much in this charming volume to stimulate and encourage plant-growers in this country .

		It is published in the attractive '' Country - Life Library '' of Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		A handbook Comparatively few readers or tourists of English have very clear ideas of what consti - Cathedral * .

		tute8 a Cathedral church in
England	LOCATION	, or what reasons there may be for the existence of the ecclesiastical establishments thus designated .

		Miss
Helen Marshall Pratt	PERSON	anticipates the publica - tion of a promised series of monographs , and in a comprehensive volume of less than six hundred pages gives an admirable guide-book to '' The Cathedral Churches of
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Duffield	PERSON	-RRB- , valuable not only to those who are fortunate enough to take it in hand and visit the various Cathedral towns , but also to the many who must travel abroad in library chairs .

		A proper sense of proportion and a systematic arrange - ment characterize the book .

		All the Cathedral churches of
England	LOCATION	are not of like interest .

		A page each suffices to record all that need be said of the Cathedrals of the modern sees of
Truro	LOCATION	,
Wakefield	LOCATION	,
Birmingham	LOCATION	, and
Manchester	LOCATION	; and as
Westminster Abby	LOCATION	was a Cathedral for ten years only in the middle of the sixteenth century -LRB- a fact usually overlooked by writers -RRB- it receives no atten - tion whatever .

		The introductory chapters give much information in condensed form about the
Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	establishment and officers , the
Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	fabric , architectural styles , stained glass , and practical suggestions ; and the thirty-two Cathedrals are separately treated in the alphabetical order of the
Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	towns .


St. Paul 's Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	under this arrangement is treated in its proper place as the
Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	church of the see of
London	LOCATION	.

		The classi - fication of the Cathedrals into those of the Old Foundation , of the
New Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, and of the
Modern Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, is the best that could be made .

		The book gives useful and interesting lessons in ecclesiastical and architectural history and church polity .

		The popular glossary furnishes a further fund of architectural and antiquarian lore .

		The many readers of Professor SoS ^ M ^ 'S ^ iler
Mathews	PERSON	will probably agree that this is his most interesting and helpful book .

		It has more than a transient value , but it is eminently timely .

		It is a sound piece of Christian apologetic , positive , practical , persuasive .

		Its pages are not strewn with theological compost or littered with the dry bones of Gospel criticism , but the reader is impressed constantly with the fact that behind every statement there lies not only a serious purpose but an adequate scholastic equip - ment .

		These affirmations respecting the paramount value of religion , the permanent importance of the gospels , and the supreme significance of Jesus , all these declarations carry the implications of mature reflection and mastery of the topics discussed .

		Thi is a strong , sane book , which ought to be widely read .

		The author faces the difficulties of our modern situation with clear insight and perfect frankness ; and he shows with literary skill and convincing logic that while some old notions must be abandoned , the essential facts and forces of historical Christianity not only remain untouched by destructive criticism but issue from this searching examination with increased beauty and power .

		Of the ten chapters , those on `` Jesus the Christ '' and `` The Power of the Social Gospel '' are peculiarly attractive and helpful .

		-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The father Professor
Werner Sombart	PERSON	, the emi - of scientific nent
Berlin	LOCATION	sociologist is quoted as socialism .

		saying that
Karl Marx	PERSON	has `` drawn a great deal of strength from the fact that he has so frequently been misunderstood . ''

		Just in what degree wrong inferences from his teaching have strengthened him , may be an open question ; but there is no question that both his followers and his enemies contradict each other amazingly as to fundamental points of his doctrine .

		Under the cir - cumstances , Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	's admirably lucid , direct , and unimpassioned life of
Marx	PERSON	-LRB-
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- is helpful to those who already have some knowledge of the father of scientific socialism , although it is at the same time sufficiently elementary to serve as a starting-point for a study of the great German 's doctrines and work .

		Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	is a socialist , but 44 THE DIAL , -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, he is not a fanatic , and his book is a frank picture of an irascible , frequently intolerant , and sometimes unfair propagandist , but a fundamentally honest and devoted reformer , whose work , though full of errors and inconsistencies , nevertheless compassed the organization of `` the greatest political movement in history . ''

		If
Marx	PERSON	contradicted himself , he did so , we are told , because he was constantly reaching new and broader points of view , as every progressive thinker must do ; if some of his contentions have been disproved and some of his prophecies have failed , the class-struggle is moving toward a crisis substantially as he foresaw it , and there is at least a possibility of the triumph of the cooperative movement which he so confidently predicted .

		The volume is more than a socialistic appeal , it is a carefully-made con - tribution to biographical literature , an appreciation of the work of a man who was a poet before he was a philosopher , and a pathetic account of a life of heroism and suffering which was closely linked to other beautiful lives .

		A chapter devoted to a detailed analysis of `` The Communist Manifesto , '' another handling the epoch-making treatise on Capital . ''

		and a final chapter entitled '' His Achievements , '' make up the philosophical part of the volume , and form an adequate statement of Marxian doctrine and influence .

		It is an odd combination of poets that Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	has brought together as exemplifications of poetic energy in his volume on `` The Inspiration of Poetry '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Three
English Marlowe	PERSON	, Gray , and
Byron	PERSON	; one Portuguese Camoens ; one Italian Tasso ; and one
Latin Lucretius	LOCATION	, each displays some phase of emotion .


Marlowe	PERSON	's emotion was `` an aspiration of all the faculties , the individual making out toward the infinite in all ways , '' since he was a true child of the Renaissance in its yearning for the impossible .

		Gray , who on the whole is treated rather apologetically , displayed the emotion of those who saw the new light of the romantic move - ment , for he discovered the romance of primitive literature and felt the love of wild and majestic scenery ; there may not be much poetic madness in the '' Elegy , '' but there is in '' The
Bard	LOCATION	. ''

		Byron 's passion burst forth in his practical enthusiasm for political liberty , so that he became for
England	LOCATION	the voice of the French Revolution ; his poetic energy lay there much more than in his personal discovery of the romance of the Orient and of the sentiment of history in landscape .

		Camoens saw the world in the sixteenth century , when
Portugal	LOCATION	was penetrat - ing every sea , and thus became the `` poet of world - discovery . ''

		Tasso , who lived during the Catholic Reaction and does not therefore represent in
Italy	LOCATION	A time of pulsing passion , wrote a poem which is marked by emotion divorced from action , mere feel - ing .

		In his poetry , '' says Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	, '' art is seen on the way to music '' ; and this being to ,
Tasso	PERSON	is not , we should say , a good illustration poetic energy marking an emotional upheaval of the race .

		To speak of him as `` tin - fort-runner and prophet of the age of music soon to dawn after him '' is to confuse the functions of the poet and the IIMIH - cian .

		Lucretius stood in the dawn of scientific reason , '' and he conceived of his subject in terms of poetry ; he had a consuming passion for truth , and a heart pledged to the service of his race .

		To say with Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	that of the above poets '' each represented some mood of the world at a culminating point , and with intensity , '' exceeds our courage ; but we can say that they display poetic energy with an intensity born of their genius and their time .

		, , ami reamer , mystic , seer of visions , of a philosopher , vagabond , and artist to vagabond poet .

		his finger-tips , Mr.
O'Dermid W. Lawler	PERSON	-LRB- if that be his real name -RRB- presents in auto - biographical form a strange and engrossing record of things experienced and imagined during a life - time outwardly obscure and even commonplace , but lived with an intensity and fashioned with an arti-tir touch that make it a thing curiously attractive if not wonderful to contemplate . ''

		East
London	LOCATION	Visions '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is the book 's title , and the characters introduced and scenes depicted are of the humble sort , but all infused with life and reality by the narrator 's magic skill .

		Although a sentence in the preface explains that '' the significance of the story with its visions as here printed will ... best be understood when it is considered as an Essay in Values , an attempt to show the supremacy of the Christian Religion , though not as commonly under - stood , '' nevertheless the tone of the book is by no means didactic or homiletic ; the purpose is far from being tiresomely in evidence .

		The Celtic strain in the narrator 's composition , derived from a father who is depicted as a character of extraordinary force and originality , accounts for much of the peculiar pathos and humor in the book .

		Let a fragmentary specimen of the author 's style be here introduced .

		Recalling his childhood days he writes : '' Boys then had advantages : there was no electric light .

		Candles and rushlights revealed imineasureable values in interiors , faces , forms , which the electric light kills .

		The candles had smouldering wicks .

		You could blow them out , and then blow them in again .

		The old nurse
Grigsum	PERSON	frequently did it .

		in the interval * of her boisterous fairy stories . ''

		Further chapters from this same oddly interesting life are half promised .

		As a happy blend of fact and fiction .

		poetry and philosophy , romance and realism , the book possesses unusual attractions .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		To collect cosmogenetic myths of ludian tribes who have not advanced so far in civilization as to lose their memory of the folk tales of their race , is a fascinating pursuit of the scientist , to which Dr.
Clinton Hart Merriana	PERSON	has yielded with the result that we have , added to his innumerable books and papers on zoolog - ical and botanical subjects , '' The Dawn of the World '' -LRB-
A. H. Clark Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a collection of '' Myths and Weird Tales told by the Merwan Indians of
California	LOCATION	. ''

		The primary purpose of the book is to present these stories as a contribution to scientific ethnological and mytholo - gical knowledge and folklore .

		But a popular character is given to the tales ; and the illustrations furnished by distinguished artists , some of them in color , make the presentation especially rich and interesting .

		The new edition of '' Who 's Who in
America	LOCATION	'' for 1910-1911 , edited by
Albert Nelson Marquis	PERSON	and pub - lished by
Messrs. A. N. Marquis & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is now at hand .

		This edition may be said to mark the tenth anniversary of the founding of this invaluable publication , the first volume having been issued in
1899	DATE	; and it is inter - esting to note that , starting with 870 pages , the work has grown until it now contains 2,648 pages , or nearly three times the original number .

		In his preface the editor states that the labor pertaining to the prepara - tion of this edition for the press has been much greater than for that of any previous one , owing to the fact that practically every sketch has been rewritten since the
1908-9	DATE	issue .

		Much new material has been added , making in all a total of 17,546 sketches , of which 2,831 are entirely new .

		It is not easy to see just what purpose is served by Mr.
Milton Bronner	PERSON	's book on
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	-LRB-
John W. Luce & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		A meagre biography , bald summaries of certain stories , and commonplace remarks on each published work , make up the volume .

		Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's works are not so difficult of assimilation that they require to be done up in predigested tablets for the benefit of intellectual dyspeptics .

		Anyone who does not feel more comfortable after reading one of Mr.
Hew	PERSON	- lett 's charming stories than after going through Mr.
Bronner	PERSON	's book about them had better consult a special - ist .

		Books on books are worth while only when they add to the reader 's intelligent comprehension of the books criticised or drive him with enthusiasm to read and study them himself .

		The thin criticism and the fulsome praise of this volume have produced , it seems to us , exactly the opposite effect .

		74 THE ARCHITECTURAL BACKGROUND OF LITERATURE .

		Nature and Humanity are the terms of litera - ture , but there is a third factor which has grown to great proportions .

		This is the architectural background ; that part of nature which man has infused with his own spirit , and uses as a nest , a refuge , and a fortress .

		Unlike the snail and tortoise , he does not carry his house upon his back ; but in some measure , like them , he secretes it from his own nature .

		It is his second skin the vestiture he places between himself and the world .

		The colder or more varied the climate , the closer does he hug to this outer weaving , the more intimate his relations are to it .

		In a region where people live in the public square , where a man can wrap himself in a cloak and sleep under the foliage and stars , houses have not much importance in life or in its reflected mirror of literature .

		Existence in
Greece	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	was existence in the open air ; and so it was with literature .

		The walls of Troy , the tents and ships of the Greeks , the palaces of Ulysses or Alcinous , are briefly indicated in com - parison with the wealth of detail which a north - ern writer would have expended upon them .

		The forms of architecture show this differ - ence in interest .

		Architecture for the Greeks was for the gods and rulers .

		It was an affair of state , a comparatively outward thing , upon which , indeed , all taste and cost might be expended , but which was not the intimate life - expression of northern races .

		The Greeks stuck four posts in the ground , put a roof over them , and were content .

		The lines of the
Parthenon	LOCATION	are duplicated in the first barn or
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	meeting-house one comes to .

		Accepting the laws of equilibrium so simply , they were free to expend their whole energies on the casing of such a shell ; could carve and paint and decorate .

		Gothic architecture , on the contrary , is a pro- test against the laws of gravitation .

		It gives wings to stone , turns timber to cloud .

		It is a prayer , an agony , a dream .

		All this is not to say that , architecturally , it is better than the Greek style .

		Indeed , as architecture is a material art , the physical perfection of the Greek may consort with its end and aim better than the spiritual aspiration of the Gothic .

		But the last is more individual , more steeped and dyed in human 54 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, feeling .

		And it has reacted upon literature to an enormously greater extent .

		Buildings and houses in the North have become the persons of the drama .

		Heine imagined a scene where all the cathedrals of
Europe	LOCATION	should be gathered together on a vast plain , and a quarrel should arise among them , and they should rush on each other in awful combat .

		And one can shut one 's eyes and call up an endless procession of the houses of men rebuilt by words in modern lit - erature .

		The line would begin away back with Asgard , the home of the gods , whose building calls the curse upon them ; and with
Walhalla	LOCATION	, where the Valkyrie maidens bring the slain warriors to revive and quaff their mead in endless feast .

		Then there is Brunhyld 's home , and the
Hall of Etzel	ORGANIZATION	where occurs the most prodigious slaughter in fiction .

		And there is
Conor	PERSON	's palace at
Emania	LOCATION	, whither D & rdre comes to die .

		But these are mythological and heroic habitations ; .

		and it is not until we come to Chaucer that we get down to the earth , and have houses with chimneys and fireplaces , abodes where it snows of meat and drink .

		Spenser is of the South , or of some No Man 's Land .

		His house is out of doors ; he has a passion for gardens and '' salvage wilds '' ; it is only now and then that he dashes in a vignette of some hut or hermitage or hall , '' seated in hearing of a hundred streams , '' where real peo - ple would want to dwell .

		In the printed drama , the architectural in - terest is of course skeletonized .

		Such scenic directions as '' a room in a palace '' or '' before the altar in a church '' are bare bones from which one can extract little nutriment .

		Yet by hints and indirections , by the issue of the actions , the
Castle of Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	looms sombre and gigantic , the most tremendous projection of its kind .

		And the Palace at
Elsinore	LOCATION	, seen at first with glimmering lights through the dark - ness , denoted by the salvo of cannon which hails the revelry of the
King	LOCATION	, fills the imagina - tion .

		The Tower of
London	LOCATION	broods over and dominates a succession of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's histori - cal dramas .

		The late
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	felt this so keenly that in his production of
Richard III	PERSON	. ''

		he opened with a silent scene which merely showed the huge mass of the fortress where so much of the interest of the play cen - tres .

		In
Belmont	LOCATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is Italian , but he gives the place a touch of home enchantment which probably no Italian poet could have equalled .

		And he contrives also to make the cave in `` Cymbeline , ''
Miranda	PERSON	's home in '' The Tempest , '' and Duke Theseus 's palace , instinct with the same charm .

		The pseudo classical eighteenth century was a homeless one , at least in literature .

		Nobody seemed to be impressed with the poetry of houses ; sermons in stone did not sink into the mind of that light , frivolous , social age .

		The influence of buildings is a romantic power , and only when the Romantic revival hove in si ^ ht did it come into its own .

		The '' Mysteries of Udolpho '' is really an epoch-making work in this respect .

		Here again was the subtle domi - nation or alliance of architecture and action .

		Cowper , in '' The Task , '' sang the home , its snug - ness and comfort ; and
Burns	PERSON	rescued the humble cottage for poetry .

		From the despised , rejected
Defoe	PERSON	, we get what is almost the most notable instance of the significance of home-building .

		The fascination of u
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, '' I think , arises from the fact that it shows the whole genesis and growth of man 's necessary shelter .

		We see the human animal putting this together , bit by bit , furnishing it with needed implements , foraying forth from it in search of food .

		There is nothing in the work but the absolutely ele - mental facts of existence .

		Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	gathered all the Romantic threads into his single hand , and the architec - tural background thrusts forward prodigiously in his pages .

		From
Roslyn Castle	ORGANIZATION	, Fair
Mel	PERSON	- rose , the Hall of the
Last Minstrel	LOCATION	, to
Baron Bradwardine	PERSON	's house , and Ravens wood and
Kenilworth	LOCATION	and
Woodstock	LOCATION	, he has a long suc - cession of houses whose facades or interiors echo and complete the human action .

		But it was reserved for later Romance writers to carry the architectural theme to its limit .

		Victor Hugo deliberately made Notre Dame the central personage , the protagonist of his novel .

		Hawthorne , in ''
The House	ORGANIZATION	of the Seven Gables , '' essayed the same theme on a lesser scale .

		Balzac and
Dickens	PERSON	are almost more the historians of houses than of humanity .

		In the Alkahest of the former , the house and its fur - niture are as much alive as the people .

		And
Dickens	PERSON	seems to have tried to body forth all the picturesqueness and gloom of
London	LOCATION	, all the quaintness and charm of English villages .

		There attaches to houses and buildings where men abide , first the property feeling , the feeling which each individual has that such an alxxle is his seat and throne , `` a poor thing '' perhaps , but their own .

		Then there is the sense of se - clusion , of privacy , of a circumscribed world .

		Catullus , always curiously modern and roman - tic , has an exquisite touch , where , after wander -
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 55 ing over many seas , among many people , he returns to his peninsula abode at Sirmio and stretches his limbs upon his own couch and feels the luxury of home .

		This little universe of the house has its central sun in the fireplace .

		The hearth has always been a superstition with the Aryan race .

		We are all fire - worshippers .

		A good part of the Vedas is devoted to the ritual of the hearth-fire .

		The home too is , or was until recently , the peculiar province of woman .

		It might be dis - courteous to call her the moon which revolves around the sacred hearth , and perhaps in sum - mer when the fires are out , or in steam-heated apartments , she must herself be all the warmth and light .

		Men , with their glowing cigars or puffing pipes , are the stars and clouds of this little world .

		The idea of food , too , attaches to the house .

		We can , of course , eat out-of-doors ; but eating as a fine art suggests a house with the accompaniments and conveniences that pertain thereto .

		What a frame is to a picture the walls and windows of a room are to such a festal site .

		Perhaps such restriction concentrates and intensifies nearly all human actions , which is one reason why modern writers show such a preference for interiors .

		It is hardly an over-fanciful idea that the walls of buildings may absorb , and give out again in influence , the actions , dramas , sorrows or felicities which may have occurred within them .

		Ghosts certainly belong almost exclu - sively to houses , or have but a tethered pastur - age outside .

		In
Bulwer	PERSON	's extraordinary story of '' The
House	ORGANIZATION	and the Brain '' we get the con - ception of a whole building plastic and pliant as it were to the evil will of a long-dead occu - pant .

		Secret passages , disused and mouldering chambers , dungeons , treasure closets , ruins , have all proved valuable assets in literature .

		In the latter part of the eighteenth century there was a great run on ruins , but they have rather gone out of fashion despite this pictur - esqueness and imaginative associations .

		Of course the other side of architecture its beauty , grandeur , charm , and convenience have all been exploited in poetry and fiction .

		The stately homes of
England	LOCATION	, in Mrs.
Hemans	PERSON	' phrase , live in a thousand word-pictures .

		We have them all on our imaginary visiting-list : Darcy 's fine mansion , which turned
Elizabeth Bennet	PERSON	to marry him ;
Esmond	ORGANIZATION	's Castlewood ,
Peacock	LOCATION	's Headlong Hall or
Crochet Castle	ORGANIZATION	,
Shirley	PERSON	's house ,
Wuthering Heights	LOCATION	, and many more whose precincts have been our haunts of pleasure or of wonder .

		The Inn is the house raised to the nth power .

		It offers the unexpected and the piquant , comfort without care , company without respon - sibility , variety without dulness .

		Meals simply happen ; they come at the clapping of our hands .

		And adventures occur without the trouble of seeking them .

		As a consequence literature is crowded with inns ; its pages reek with the savory smoke of their chimneys , glow with the rich light of their fires , echo with the clatter of their dishes , the voices and laughter of their guests .

		All inns in literature have some merit , even the scurvy Spanish inn of
Don Quixote	PERSON	.

		But French and English inns are best .

		Those of Chicot and
Dom Modiste	PERSON	, of
D'Artagnan	LOCATION	and his friends , of
Scott	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	, are delightful enough to draw back translated spirits from heaven .

		The greatest of all in the whole range of fiction is the Boar 's
Head Tavern	LOCATION	,
Eastcheap	LOCATION	, whether Shakespeare or
Goldsmith	ORGANIZATION	invites us over its threshold .

		There is a passage in one of
Hazlitt	PERSON	's essays which seems to me to express the inn feeling at its perfection .

		After a long summer-day 's walk , he has arrived at a country inn and ensconced himself in the cosy coffee-room looking out on an old garden .

		The supper , though sim - ple , is good , and he has a volume of Congreve in his pocket , upon whose glittering prose he regales himself by way of dessert .

		Never , he says , did he feel the charm of literature and of life to a greater degree .

		It would be invidious to say nothing of the lodgings and chambers where so many good fellows , poets , artists , soldiers , men of leisure , the gay rattling advance-guard of each genera - tion , have made their first stand in the fight for place and fortune .

		The roll-call of such lodgers of literature would be longer than the catalogue of the Ships ; but
Tom Jones	PERSON	, Thaddeus of War - saw ,
Nigel Olifaunt	PERSON	,
Warrington	LOCATION	,
Pendennis	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Pickwick	PERSON	-LRB- young at least in spirit -RRB- ,
Marius	PERSON	and Our Boys , rise to mind .

		And the prisons or sponging-houses where so many of these heroes temporarily bring up ought not to be neglected .

		Nor should the cloister cells of colleges , where they have their larvae state before they spread their splendid butterfly wings , go without men - tion .

		We are not altogether lacking in antiquity .

		in
America	LOCATION	, but as a rule we are so furious in rebuilding that we do not let our houses acquire the mellow crust of age , the traditions , memories , ghosts , which would make them serviceable to literature .

		And we march over so vast an estate that our architecture is more puzzling than pic -
56	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, turesque .

		One difficulty with our architecture is the varying climate with which we are endowed ; a building which is suitable for our winter is ridiculous in our
summer	DATE	, and the reverse .

		But we are gradually emerging from architectural chaos , and doubtless literature will follow on and decorate our homes with the wreathed trellis of a working brain . ''

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE POBT-DKEAM OF A WORLD-REPUBLIC of a war less and strifeless time presaged in
Tennyson	LOCATION	's lines from ''
Locksley Hall	PERSON	, '' when `` The war-drums throb no longer , and the battle-flags are furl 'd In the
Parliament of Man	ORGANIZATION	, the Federation of the World ; There the common-sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe , And the kindly earth shall slumber , lapp 'd in universal Law , '' this poet-dream finds a peculiar echo in some words of
Bjdrnson	LOCATION	, uttered twenty years ago in a conver - sation lately reported by Mr.
James W. M. Hall	PERSON	of
Cambridge	LOCATION	: `` One of these days , I think Scan - dinavia and the
United States	ORGANIZATION	will be one Grand Republic , and possibly
England	LOCATION	, too . ''

		And now it appears that no less a dignitary than the
King of Italy	ORGANIZATION	is reported to have made , in a recent interview with Mr.
Maxim Gorky	PERSON	, the following profession of republicanism : `` If the people want a monarch , let them have one .

		If they want a republic , well , let them have it But what I want is the
United States of the World	LOCATION	.

		There should be one President of the World , to be elected once every five years . ''

		Perhaps some might think the term proposed too petty for a scheme so grand , and that the Mexican method of having a President for life affords a more likely model ; yet this is a detail to be adjusted later .

		The main thing now is to find the Man , the Great One who is to serve as President of this World Republic .

		There is not long to wait : voices innumerable are eager to shout his name over the roofs of the world , but let royalty here have pre - cedence .

		All eyes in this great world-convention are fixed on the Italian King , as he points impres - sively to '' the most commanding personality of his generation ...
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	'' Ah !

		of course it was inevitable ; '' the greatest man in the world , '' as a prominent Englishman -LRB- Sir
Joseph Dimsdale	PERSON	-RRB- is reported to have called him in a pub - lic address , should certainly be at the head of
the World Republic	ORGANIZATION	.

		Holland , the home of so many of Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's progenitors , is all ready for him .

		`` If the Dutch people could vote , '' declares a re - turned traveller , ''
Roosevelt	PERSON	could be elected i of
Holland	LOCATION	. '

		* In his own land , the endorsements are of course too many and too vociferous to quote ; but we will give one , from Dr.
Rockwell D. Hunt	PERSON	of
California	LOCATION	, which touches our fancy by its elo - quence and sincerity : ``
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	is the greatest of living men , the ' most startling character since
Napoleon	PERSON	. '

		... The conditions are perfect ; the hero of
San Juan	LOCATION	and the Peace of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, in the midst of his matchless powers , is henceforth called to serve humanity by accepting the post never before proffered to mortal man President of the
United States	LOCATION	of the World . ''

		What more is there to say ?

		By all means , let us have the
U. S. W.	PERSON	, with
Roosevelt	PERSON	as ruler , Till the ironclads are scuttled , and insurgents ' flags are f url M In the

		LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT FROM YEAR TO YKM ; can not now be expected to show any startling leaps and bounds of progress .

		The library , like the school , the university , the hospital , or the public park , has long ago passed its experimental stage , and now settles down to long centuries -LRB- as we hope -RRB- of usefulness and honor .

		The late annual gathering of librarians at
Mackinac Island	LOCATION	was well attended , and was undoubtedly stimulating to all present ; but no epoch-making acts or decisions , no world - awakening speeches , no debates or momentous issues , made it of preeminent importance in the series of annual conventions , now thirty-two in num - ber , that have helped to establish the dignity and weight of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	as a national institution .

		We have learned , in the course of the customary addresses and discussions , that the paper on which our daily news is printed is of so perishable a nature that in half a century those journals that are now being bound for preservation will be crumbling to dust not the greatest imagi - nable loss to literature , yet one that might be pre - vented if newspaper publishers were actuated more largely by altruistic motives .

		But the writing of four books a season , or even one book a month , loses something of its amazing quality when one considers how much of this facile output is merely a variation on a few ever-recurring refrains , whose hypnotizing note will be recognized in the following from the above-mentioned latest book : '' How can it be a large career to tell other people 's children about the rule of three , and a small career to tell one 's own children about the universe ?

		How can it be broad to be the same thing to everyone , and narrow to be everything to someone ? ''

		As a maker of pert paradoxes , Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	has a facil - ity that comes from practice ; but we think others could turn them out almost as well at a pinch .

		For example , What difference does it make whether the world seems upside-down to three-quarters of the human race , or three-quarters of the human race take an upside-down view of the world ?

		With what reason do we complain that there are only three hundred and sixty-five and a quarter days in the year , and sigh with impatience for the coming of the millennium ?

		... THE RECREATIONS OF LIBRARIANS ought to lie as much as possible outside the world of books and catalogues and dating-stamps and charging systems , and all the rest of the paraphernalia of their pro- fession .

		It is pleasant to note the round-table dis - cussion , conducted by
Librarian Ranck of Grand Rapids	ORGANIZATION	at the late annual
A. L. A. Conference	PERSON	at
Mackinac Island	LOCATION	, on the subject of desirable recrea - tions for those of his calling .

		Various sorts of sport and exercise were wittily treated , and in so appreciative a manner as to prove that the librarian , however learned and dignified , is yet a human being .

		Not that we do not still have with us the old-school guardian of books who asks for no amusement more wildly exciting than is furnished in the pages of a trade catalogue or a bibliography .

		In fact , we have in mind one of this sedate and book-learned school of librarians who finds in the daily round , the com - mon task , all he needs or asks for .

		But all work and no play makes the librarian a dull pedant , and modern library methods and ideals call for workers of a different sort .

		THE UNRECOGNIZED DISCOVERER OF THE TEM - PLE LIBRARY AT
NIPPUR	LOCATION	, Dr.
John Henry Haynes	PERSON	, who recently died broken-hearted and worn out by the long and a crimonious dispute -LRB- in which he took no public part -RRB- over the famous find , addressed a few words of modest self-justification , before his death , to his friends in western
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, through the columns of a
North Adams	LOCATION	journal .

		He says , among other details concerning the work of the expedition under his charge : '' The collection here referred to as the '
Temple Library	ORGANIZATION	' was dis - covered after a long-continued , earnest and pains - taking search for tablets , when suddenly , and much to my surprise , I came upon the ` library , ' which was found at a depth of eighteen feet in about one - half dozen rooms .

		That the complete collection was secured is clearly proved by the fact that the exploration of the surrounding rooms and buildings revealed no further trace of tablets or any kind of inscription ... The best years of my life have been freely and fully given to the prosecution of the work , as a sacred mission and trust .

		No per - sonal interests have been allowed to conflict with its duties or detract from its results .

		I have no apology to offer to anyone for facts herein given to the public , and only regret the necessity for correcting misapprehensions of facts in a work dearer than all else in my life . ''

		This death-bed utterance should prove convincing and final .

		Personal acquaintance with Dr.
Haynes	PERSON	moves us to present his case and to hope that the honors withheld in life will now be accorded him after his lamented death .

		THE LURE AWAY FROM THE LIBRARY , which has caused so notable and universal a decline in circula - tion statistics , and to some extent in library attend - ance , is made the subject of a little symposium conducted by that alert and interesting monthly , `` Public Libraries . '' ''

		Good times '' and the moving - picture show are almost unanimously held to be among the chief causes of the decrease in the de - mand for books .

		One correspondent , who fails to see why the decline should be so marked in the juvenile department of libraries , is answered that '' good times '' mean more nickels for the children to spend at the peep-show , and hence fewer hours to devote to reading .

		Another writer asserts that the automobile is responsible for this slighting of the library ; and it is not hard to admit that the man who , with begoggled eyes , unsightly , tight ^ fitting cap , high-buttoned dust-coat , and with tense expression on his face , nervous dread in his attitude , and wearing that unmistakable automobilious look in his counte - nance , goes racing and honking through nature 's garden , is hardly in a condition , mentally or physi - cally , to find comfort or enjoyment in books .

		THE FREE DISTRIBUTION OF UNSPOKEN SPEECHES , or of speeches spoken before empty chairs , by our national law-makers , has reached such a magnitude that it forms no inconsiderable factor in our annual post-office deficit , of which we hear so much .

		So freely is the franking privilege used that as is estimated by a post-office official enough dead-head mail has gone out of
Washington	LOCATION	since the first of
January	DATE	to fill a freight-train that would need five engines to haul it .

		One recent order , on the gov - ernment printing-house and on the postal service , provided for the distribution of eight hundred thousand copies of a windy oration delivered by a Western senator , and as many more are still to go forth , it is said , to various parts of the country .

		This national encouragement of an all but universal 58 THE DIAL -LSB-

		No one profits by it , least of all the senator or representative thus enamored of his own verbosity .

		Votes will not be captured nor political converts made by this frenzied use of the franking privilege .

		-LRB- To the Editor of TUB DIAL . -RRB-

		Your remarks in
THK	ORGANIZATION	DIAL for
July 16	DATE	, concern - ing the scrupulous literary workmanship of
Gustave Flaubert	PERSON	and the late
Jules Kenard	PERSON	, can hardly fail to remind us of the similar quality in the work of our English
Walter Pater	PERSON	that parfait prosateur , as Hour - get once pronounced him .

		Prolonged communion with his own soul in his tour -LRB- Vivoire evolved for him a unique philosophical creed of intense living .

		His own splendid words best express this attitude of his toward the serious aspects of life : ' ' Every moment some form grows perfect in hand or face ; some tone on the hills or the sea is choicer than the rest ; some mood of passion or insight or intellectual excitement is irresistibly real and attractive for us , for that moment only .

		... A counted number of pulses only is given to as of a variegated , dramatic life .

		How may we see in them all that is to be seen in them by the finest senses ?

		How shall we pass most swiftly from point to point , and be present always at the focus where the greatest number of vital forces unite in their purest energy ?

		To burn always with this hard , gemlike flame , to maintain this ecstasy , is success in life . ''

		The New Cyrenaicism of this modern Aristippua , the hedonism of the ancient Epicurean communicated to the spirit of this modern pagan , afforded a practical guide to the proper conduct of the intellectual life and made especially mandatory a certain definite attitude toward the products of the beaux arts .

		To be constantly immersed in the crystal stream of pleasurable sensation , one must not squander his time or energy in attempting to fathom turbid waters .

		The most masterful creations only must serve to appease our -LRB- esthetic appetites those which express the very thought and spirit of the author .

		`` The essence of all artistic beauty , '' writes
Pater	PERSON	in one of his lectures , `` is expression , ... the line , the color , the word , following obediently and with minute scruple the conscious motions of a convinced , intelligible soul . ''

		To the intellectual anarchy of his time he believed this principle a stranger .

		He accord - ingly advised writers to take more pains and write English as a learned language .

		His own tiresome and torturous labor with the pen proved how punctilious he was a veritable priest preserving the fountain of English speech pure and undefiled .

		His own words , put in the thought of his one nota - ble creation ,
Marius	PERSON	the Epicurean , best exemplify his artistic restraint in the use of superflous words : '' He would make of it -LSB- the native speech -RSB- a serious study , weighing the precise power of every phrase and word , M though it were precious metal , disentangling the later asso - ciations and going back to the original and native sense of each restoring to full significance all its wealth of latent figurative expression / ' ... '' From the very beginning of pro- fessional literature , the ' labour of the file ' a labour in the ease of Plato , for instance , or
Virgil	PERSON	, like that of the oldest of goldsmiths as described by Apnleius , enriching the work by far more tli.m tin - weight < > f precious metal it removed has always had it * function . ''

		This whole matter is aptly summed up in the essay on Style : '' For in truth all art does but consixt in the removal of surplusage , from the last finish of the gem-engraver blowing away the last particle of invisible dust , back to the earliest divination of the finished work to be , lying somewhere , according to
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	's fancy , in the rough-hewn block of stone . ''

		The '' Conclusion '' to '' The Renaissance '' best illus - trates how Pater himself laboriously wielded the file .

		It contains in brief outline the summary of his philo - sophical and artistic creed , every word pregnant with purposeful meaning .

		I can not forbear quoting a few lines .

		`` While all melts under our feet , we may well catch at any exquisite passion , or any contribution to knowledge that seems by a lifted horizon to set the spirit free for a moment , or any stirring of the senses , strange dyes , strange colours , and curious odors , or work of the artist 's hands , or the face of one 's friend .

		Not to discriminate every moment some passionate attitude in those about us , and in the brilliancy of their gifts some tragic dividing of forces on their ways , is , on this short day of frost and HUH , to sleep before evening - On this short day of frost and gun , to sleep before evening .

		How much is conveyed in these few words !

		how poignant the sense they give us of the brevity of human life !

		And what penetrating precision they show in the handling of the tools of English speech !

		COLLEGES AND THE CARNEGIE FOUNDATION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Recently , at the meeting of the
National Teachers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	, there was a somewhat sharp attack on the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, one much distressed high-school teacher complaining because the Foundat i < > n is compelling colleges to live up to some reasonable standards of entrance requirements , in brief , because it is insisting that some things are worth counting toward a college degree and some other things are not .

		It is contended by the critics of the Foundation that the preparation for college which it demands of secondary schools is not a preparation for life ; that college educa - tion itself is not such a preparation .

		The fact of the matter is , and we ought to face it squarely , that preparation for life , as it is lived by some people , is not entitled to any academic recognition whatever .

		Educationally , here in
America	LOCATION	, we have been facing the problem of granting academic distinction to people whose sole title to such honors has been that , figura - tively , they have learned how to dig post-holes carefully .

		It is the business of the college to say clearly and with - out any truckling that its distinctions are to be bestowed upon those who have done a particular kind of work and have done it with a certain degree of thoroughness ; and upon them only .

		It must always have , as one of its chief aims , that of establishing a proper sense of value - ; declaring that some things are more worth while than others ; that a scholar and a gentleman is a little finer product of our educational machinery than a clown , however efficient the clown may be in doing his part of the world 's work ; and that its rewards and recognitions are for intellectual effort of a certain high type , and for that alone .

		The high-school teacher referred to
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 59 complains that the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	is a monopoly In a certain sense that is true , but it has the justifica - tion of being a legitimate and proper monopoly .

		It is a monopoly instituted in defense of those who hold cer - tain badges of accomplishment , and are not willing to have them cheapened through being offered as the reward of another and quite different sort of achieve - ment .

		The protest by this teacher that these badges can not be secured by him for his pupils on his condi - tions , that is , by doing a kind of work that he calls practical , instead of that kind that should introduce them to the intellectual life of the world , is at least amusing .

		It is a plea for equality of standing in spite of inequality of condition ; a plea that we shall have to ignore , if college degrees are to mean anything or be things sought after by ambitious young men and women .

		Doubtless in a democracy the difficulty of maintain - ing what in a sense is class distinction is peculiarly serious .

		It is one of the dangers of political equality that it makes it less easy to preserve the finer ideals of the better classes against the clamors of the mob .

		That is in part the business of the colleges and universities ; and in a democracy the problem is complicated by the circumstance that some of the official conservers of ideals in educational institutions have never come into possession of those ideals themselves in any deep sense , because those who are not to the manner born can not acquire them in the class-room , and yet for the patient and the industrious some class-rooms at least are the road to educational preferment .

		Again , the very ex - pansion of our educational system which is one of the splendid achievements of our American democracy has brought about instruction in a vast variety of subjects , acquaintance with which is not the mark of any acquire - ments entitled to any honor or reward beyond that for which they have been in the first instance pursued material success in life .

		The teachers of these subjects , however , do not wish to be counted among the outer barbarians , and they are aggressive and powerful by reason of their numbers .

		They campaign for their cause unceasingly ; but the distinction between working with the brain and working with the hands , between spending even mental energy upon big problems and upon little problems , is a distinction vital in things themselves , and no amount of propagandisin will ever change it .

		`` That is what we want , '' said the teacher to whom reference has been made , speaking of his demand for recognition of everything that the high school may see fit to offer as preparation for college .

		`` Do n't fool yourselves , there 's a lot yet to be done . ''

		He fools himself seriously if he imagines that the educational world is ever going to count skill in digging post-holes , however studiously acquired , equal to skill in unravel - ling or attacking some of the great human problems .

		Some people must forever be satisfied with a training for life that does not merit academic distinction , and they must leave such academic distinction to those who really deserve it by reason of their devotion to other problems of another and a higher kind of life .

		Perhaps it is a pity that we can not all be so distinguished ; but when we are , a great many of us will not care for dis - tinction , and the world will settle into a dead level of mediocrity .

		Then we will be universally content to go to our several human destinies through reform-schools with industrial educational attachments , or other like institutions , without feeling that there is anything to dif - ferentiate us sharply from university graduates .

		That will make earth a paradise for some sections of society against whose undue activities the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	and some other agencies bid fair to preserve us for awhile .

		No doubt we shall do well to increase the efficiency of all classes of people through education , to provide means for that more and more , to train the artisan steadily to greater effectiveness in his work ; but we must all the more certainly provide safeguards against the presumptions of those who would break down real distinctions and put the stamp of gold and silver upon brass and lead .

		THE QUESTION OF '' IMMORAL DRAMA . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Iii a recent number of
THK DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, a corre ` spoudent writing to commend a review of Mr.
Clayton Hamil	PERSON	- ton 's book on '' The Theory of the Theatre '' protests when he comes upon the quoted statement , '' There is no such thing , per se , as an immoral subject for a play : in the treatment of the subject , and only in the treat - ment , lies the basis for ethical judgment of the piece . ''

		It seems to me that the attempt to controvert the truth contained in this passage is of little value in con - sidering the faults of the modern drama .

		Discussions of what plays or what novels ought to be produced or read can only add to the confusion in which the subject is involved , unless a vital distinction is kept clearly in mind the distinction between the ethical and the aesthetic .

		Many a fruitless contention as to whether a thing is immoral or not resolves itself into a question of whether it offends the aesthetic sense .

		There are many things , not necessarily immoral , that refined people do not care to see or to talk much about ; they are offen - sive to good taste , and hence not to be desired .

		Those who uphold offensive plays because of `` the lesson they teach '' are only ridiculous ; and the claim of pious motives on the part of managers who produce such dramas is obviously absurd .

		It seems no less absurd to insist that because a play 's motive is offensive to taste , its subject-matter is immoral .

		If the spectator dislikes the theme of ''
Camille	PERSON	, '' for instance , let him say frankly that he is out of sympathy with such sub - jects for stage presentation , not that the story of '' Camille '' is an immoral one .

		So long as a play tells the truth about the characters it deals with and the phase of life it portrays , it is not necessarily immoral .

		But if it outrages our sense of the aesthetic , or of plain decency , we may very properly condemn it on this score .

		To quote further from Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	: '' Critics who condemn ' Ghosts ' because of its subject - matter might as well condemn ' Othello ' because the hero kills his wife what a suggestion , look you , to carry into our homes ! '

		Macbeth ' is not immoral , though it makes night hideous with murder .

		The greatest of all Greek dramas , ' -LRB-
Edipus King	PERSON	, ' is in itself sufficient proof that morality is a thing apart from subject-matter .

		The only way in which a play may be immoral is for it to cloud , in the spectator , the consciousness of those invariable laws of life which say to men ' Thou shalt ' or ' Thou shalt not . ' ''

		It would aid much to clear the discussion about '' the immorality of present-day drama '' to keep these points in view , and to distinguish clearly between that which offends pur sense of delicacy and that which presents a false or vicious conception of life .

		To take to the law in middle life after tasting , if only in an amateur and i/l/t-f finite fashion , the delights of the muses , is less common than to abandon the bar for the pursuit of art or liter - ature .

		Mr.
Thomas Edward Crispe	PERSON	, who has just given to the world his diverting
Remi	PERSON	- niscences of a K. -LRB- ' .

		. ''

		did not take up the study of his ultimate profession until his thirty-eighth year , having until then been a lecturer , an actor of rather more than amateur pretensions , and the follower of a calling which he thus briefly describes in his opening chapter : '' On leaving school I was articled to a quasi profes - sion , to complete my training , and eventually become what is called a scientific witness , and of my experiences before Committees of both
Houses of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, for and against Railway companies , School and local boards , drainage and other schemes , I shall have a word to say . ''

		Called to the Bar in
1874	DATE	, when he was forty - one years old , he made as a pleader so good use of his previously cultivated oratorical and histri - onic powers that success was not long in coming to him in his new profession .

		In fact , he seems always to have had a happy knack of succeed - ing in whatever he undertook , and this facility marks the agreeable volume of miscellaneous recollections that now adds the honors of au - thorship to his other achievements .

		By no means to lawyers exclusively , but to all readers disposed to while away a
summer	DATE	's day with an anecdotal narrative of personal experience among men and women of more or less character and note all frankly stated and frequently spiced with more than a pinch of self-compla - cency Mr.
Crispe	PERSON	's short and not seldom vivacious chapters will strongly appeal .

		The loss of his father before his birth may have helped to develop early a not unpleasing self-assurance that carried the young man tri - umphantly through many an ordeal , from a lecture delivered at twenty-two before a critical
London	LOCATION	audience to his latest professional suc - cesses as
King 's Counsel	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this connection let us quote his advice to the law student who wishes to succeed as a pleader of causes .

		`` Let any young man who is training for the Bar remember , that if when he joins it he hides his candle under a bushel , no one will see the light There is a difference between being opinionated and entertaining a good opinion of yourself ; the latter is a tonic for suo - KEMINISCKMCKK or A K.

		A wholesome Ix-ln t in \ < > ur own ability can do no harm a little modest assurance , and do not fail t < > express it .

		The man who dubs you egotist , windbag , and froth-blower , in all probability has no ' ego ' of his own not even an air retainer for intellectual bubbles .

		You must believe in yourself ; if you do not , no one will believe in you . ''

		If now the reader has not a pretty good men - tal picture of the pushful barrister whose divert - ing reminiscences we are considering , let him go to the book itself and fill in the details of the portrait .

		Possibly a few more extracts here will be an immediate aid .

		In an early chapter the author says , a propos of a stage kiss and embrace which he as '' Citizen Sangfroid '' had to give to ''
Pauline	PERSON	'' in the play of '' Delicate Ground , '' `` I do not arrogate much to my - self , but I can say I have always tried to do what I have had to do , thoroughly . ''

		This qual - ity of whole-heartedness in his undertakings , including the writing of his '' Reminiscences , '' is not the least of his engaging attributes .

		In the relation of certain youthful experiences in
London	LOCATION	occurs this characteristic passage : '' Once launched , I was soon sailing on my own account ; but my life was not one of dissipation , rather of inquiry .

		I was acquisitive and wanted to see every - thing , and if I sometimes saw something which was not good for me , it did me no harm .

		I had seen it , and there was an end of it . ''

		The record of Mr.
Crispe	PERSON	's intercourse with stage folk in the years when he trod the boards contains many amusing and informing glimpses of theatrical celebrities , and occasionally a rapid pen-portrait of some literary or artistic char - acter .

		A personal experience of his in engaging
Thackeray	PERSON	to give his lectures on '' The Four Georges '' discovers in the great novelist sundry very human but not exactly admirable traits , including a robust appetite for flattery , hyper - sensitiveness to criticism , and a disposition to drive a hard bargain in pecuniary matters .

		But perhaps he is made all the more real to us by being represented as so undeniably human .

		A passing reference to
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	repre - sents him as far more the one-part actor than he really was .

		At the Adelphi I saw
Jefferson	PERSON	in liii > van Winkle , which had an enormous
London	LOCATION	success .

		Much later on , playgoers had the opportunity of seeing Mr. Tree as 4 Rip ' an excellent and conscientious performance , but lacking the naturalness which so distinguished Jef - ferson , who was condemned to play the part for life , like
Sothern	PERSON	, who became the martyr of '
Lord Dun	ORGANIZATION	- dreary ' in the humorous role of that very accent rit - nobleman . ''

		The following in regard to the incomparable
Fanny Kemble	PERSON	, whom Mr.
Crispe	PERSON	had engaged

		THE DIAL 61 for a course of Shakespeare readings at a liter - ary club to which he belonged , is worth quoting . ''

		She was also a great success .

		I found her a charm - ing woman , but much as her relative ,
Charles Santley	PERSON	, has recently described her .

		An air of repellent dignity seemed to dominate her , and she made one recognize that she was a person of importance .

		Her presence was quite Siddonian .

		We old stagers , perhaps , underrate the merits of the actors and actresses of to-day and make unfavorable comparison with those of the past , but my belief is that very few , if any , of the ladies now on the stage could match her .

		As readings , her '
Julius Caesar	PERSON	' and '
Coriolauus	PERSON	' were superb . ''

		To illustrate the author 's versatility as an actor , we find him appearing , on the regular or the amateur stage , in parts as various as
Claude Melnotte	PERSON	in '' The Lady of
Lyons	PERSON	, '' Dr. Pan - gloss in `` The Heir at Law , '' Cox in `` Box and Cox , '' Goldfinch in `` The Road to Ruin , '' Bottom in '' A
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream , '' the First Witch in '' Macbeth , '' Captain Absolute in '' The Rivals , ''
John Mildmay	PERSON	in '' Still Water Runs Deep , '' '' Sir
Edward Mortimer	PERSON	in '' The Iron Chest , ''
Maurice Warner	PERSON	in ''
Camilla	PERSON	's Husband , '' and many other roles familiar to Victorian play-goers .

		In a chapter headed '' A Few Remarkable Men '' there are gathered some recollections of
Archibald Forbes	PERSON	,
Edmund Yates	PERSON	,
Frederick Villiers	PERSON	, and others .

		This concerning
Kinglake	PERSON	is interesting : '' To the war correspondents whom I have met , I add
Kinglake	PERSON	, the great historian of the Crimean War .

		I only knew him a few years before his death .

		He was a most courtly man with that old knightly manner which has gone out of fashion , full of graceful gallantry even in trivial matters .

		I recollect when my two daugh - ters were quite little girls , their going to a children 's party , on which occasion he sent them two lovely bou - quets , which made them very proud : a mere triviality , but worthy of the kind heart of the author of
Eothen	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The author 's professional experience of judges on the bench seems to have been a wide one , and the carefulness of his study of these digni - taries , with reference to the shaping of his pleas and arguments before them , entitles him to a repectful hearing in his retrospective descrip - tions of their various pecularities . ''

		Study your judge , '' was always his maxim , he tells us ; '' humour his weakness judges have some and never skate up to dangerous water .

		In such way , you may manage the judge whom other counsel have found unmanageable .

		Whenever you find your judge will do your work for you , let him do it ; he will do it much better than you can . ''

		Among the eminent occupants of the judicial bench whom the author presents to our view are Chief Justices
Cockburn	PERSON	and
Cole	PERSON	- ridge ,
Lord Russell	PERSON	of
Killowen	LOCATION	,
Justice Lush	ORGANIZATION	, Sir
George Jessel	PERSON	,
Baron Huddleston	PERSON	,
Justice Gainsford Bruce	ORGANIZATION	,
Lord Brampton	LOCATION	, and many others of note .

		Lord
Russell	PERSON	he speaks of as '' A figure which stood out pre-eminent among the legal men of the Victorian period , whether as
Lord Chief Justice	ORGANIZATION	or Sir
Charles Russell	PERSON	, whether as advo - cate , orator , or judge .

		As advocate , intrepid , brilliant , ' he could electrify the jury by the magic of his voice . '

		A perfect elocutionist inflection , emphasis , accent , pause , harmony , all taking fit place .

		His action grand or graceful , as occasion required .

		His eloquence impas - sioned , he could move the multitude .

		In the great
Parnell	PERSON	case , when he said , ' I have spoken not merely as an advocate , I have spoken for the land of my birth , ' his speech was one of intense patriotism .

		I had the advantage of hearing it . ''

		Under reminiscences of
Lord Chief Justice Cockburn	ORGANIZATION	occurs the following : '' I remember , as if it were yesterday , his marvellous summing up in the Tichborne case , in which I was sur - prised to find my old amateur -LSB- actor -RSB- friend
Dickins	PERSON	foreman of the jury .

		I felt great interest in it , as I was acquainted with ' Tichborne , ' or ' de
Castro	PERSON	, ' or '
Arthur Orton	PERSON	, ' or whosoever he was .

		Many believed in the Claimant I confess I did .

		I was younger then .

		I recollect once sitting by his bedside when he was ill a sparsely furnished room , a large crucifix at the head of his bed , the burly man lying on his back .

		I was much struck by his manner , and , despite the errors of speech of a seemingly uneducated man , he was full of intelligence , his ideas well expressed , his voice soft , even melodious , his bearing that of a gentleman he was a mystery . ''

		Not unlike the
Tichborne	PERSON	case was the recent famous
Druce	PERSON	case , with which Mr.
Crispe	PERSON	was professionally connected , and of which he writes authoritatively , as he also does of the well-known case of '' The Country Girl . ''

		Other chapters , on which we can not here dwell , contain useful advice and instructive instances for young bar - risters .

		As a combination of actor , bohemian , club-man , frequenter of smart society , and suc - cessful barrister , Mr.
Crispe	PERSON	writes in a manner to attract and hold one 's attention .

		Two por - traits of him , in wig and gown , appear in the book .

		The second of these in particular constitutes a valuable discussion , long needed , of a subject having the utmost importance to students of Elizabethan poetry ; but it repre - sents the kind of subordinate investigation upon which the history of literature must be founded , rather than a portion of that history itself .

		And why , we may ask , should an article on the book-trade between the years
1557	DATE	and
1675	DATE	, if it is to appear at all in such surroundings , be almost half again as long as one dealing with the position and influence of the Authorized Version of the Bible especially when the edi - tors in charge have given their tacit approval to the belief that the Authorized Version is the first English classic , '' and to citations showing that it has been the most vital of all forces in its reaction upon subsequent masterpieces in English ?

		Is there any good reason for this dis - cord between the implied theory and the actual practice ?

		No satisfying answer can be given to these questions ; hence we may negatively characterize the two volumes under discussion as not only lacking , on the whole , in workman - ship of style , but also as deficient in general perspective .

		It seems necessary to speak still further of these shortcomings , as well as to point out the high degree of excellence which has been at - tained by some of the individual contributors .

		No one , however , will expect so brief a review as this to emphasize all the merits of two large volumes ; for the work , when everything is said , henceforth must be regarded as indispensable to the serious student of English literature .

		In the matter of perspective , then , it may be observed that the amount of space which has been variously allotted to
Dray	PERSON	ton ,
Campion	PERSON	,
Burton	PERSON	, and Sir
John Davies	PERSON	, does not by any means correspond to what one might naturally have predicted .

		It is not easy to comprehend why
Drayton	PERSON	has a long chapter to himself , and not
Daniel	PERSON	also ; or
Campion	PERSON	a short one , while
Davies	PERSON	has but a few pages .

		If the rela - tive importance of these men were to be esti - mated by the effect of each upon the literature of the nineteenth century and an objective standard of this sort would be better than none , the attention which they would respect - ively secure would be very different from that which is accorded to them in the
Cambridge	LOCATION	History .

		And by what arbitrary ruling canu 1 the editors to decide that Sir
Walter Kaleigh	PERSON	, rather than Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	, should be treated in a separate chapter ?

		The fact is , of course , that in their desire at one time to follow the trend of literary movements , at another to dis - cuss types of literature , and at another to re - count the life of some very eminent individual , Messrs.
Ward	PERSON	and
Waller	PERSON	have not consistently adhered to any manifest principle of division and arrangement .

		As a result , we are too fre - quently annoyed by interruptions like the fol - lowing , from the account of
Samuel Daniel	PERSON	in Volume IV .

		-LRB- p. 155 -RRB- : ''
Daniel	PERSON	's sonnets have been discussed elsewhere -LSB- in Volume III . -RSB-

		, and no further mention need be made of them here , while his Senecan tragedies and his masques also belong to another section -LSB- other sections ? -RSB-

		of this work -LSB- i. .

		, Volumes V. and VI. , which are yet to come -RSB- . ''

		Cross-references of this nature are sufficiently trying within the limits of a single volume .

		Where the treatise is more extensive , they are possibly unavoidable .

		Nevertheless , in a model structure like Croiset 's Hlstoire de la Littera - ture Grecque the scaffolding is not thus pain - fully obtrusive , indeed , one topic is there considered at a time , and the treatment of it finished ; nor is the clear-out impression of any phase of a subject marred by the arid and formless writing in which the editors of the
Cambridge History	ORGANIZATION	have now and then allowed their collaborators to indulge .

		A case where editorial revision was needed may be found on page 188 of Volume IV . ''

		Kulke Greville , lord
Brooke	PERSON	, belonged to an elder generation than that of the other poets in this chapter , and was an exact contemporary of Sir

October 1564	DATE	, and , from
Shrewsbury	LOCATION	, he went to
Jesus College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, four years later ...
Fulke Greville	PERSON	was a great patron of letters . ''

		This repetitious clattering of dry bones , from a writer who at his best displays no little anima - tion and critical insight , may serve to introduce a few additional remarks upon the style , or styles , of the
Cambridge History	ORGANIZATION	.

		At the outset , one may observe that , had the present work been a history of Greek literature , organized under the direction of men like Pro- fessors
Tucker	PERSON	and
Rhys Roberts	PERSON	, and other pupils of the late Sir
Richard Jebb	PERSON	at Cam - bridge , the quality of the composition would almost certainly have been better on an average , and more even throughout .

		Is it possible that , by a tendency toward a too narrow specializa - tion , scholarship in English has been drifting away in
Great Britain	LOCATION	from the more humane traditions of culture , and that , as in
Germany	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, special students of modern litera - ture are rewarded for their energy in searching out and merely recording , rather than for the attainment of a sense of values through investigation , of course , or for taste and the power of synthesis ?

		If so , the editors of the
Cambridge History	ORGANIZATION	, both of them skilled and acceptable writers , ought to be among thejfirst to react against so harmful a drift , by exercising a greater care in the choice of their assistants .

		One would not wish to see Mr.
de Selincourt	PERSON	, from whom the remarks on
Fulke Greville	PERSON	are taken , in the number of those excluded .

		Since he is by no means the worst offender , we may quote his '' Successors of Spenser '' once or twice more , by way of indicating the average .

		In the following , he has not regarded
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	on the desirability of avoiding a too obvious recurrence of the letter p in English : '' In like manner ,
Sidney	PERSON	's famous apology for poetry and the English language worked upon his successors so greatly that they one and all wished themselves poets ; and a surprising number were poets '' -LRB- IV. , p. 172 -RRB- .

		Similarly here : '' He -LSB- Wither -RSB- ... wrote pastorals , which were published in
1615	DATE	under the title The
Shepherd	ORGANIZATION	's Hunt - ing .

		In the fourth eclogue , in praising the poetry of ' My
Willie	PERSON	, ' ... he extolled the power of poetry in general '' -LRB- IV. , pp. 178-9 -RRB- .

		Again , this is a curious way in which to end an ac - count of the life of Drummond of Hawthornden : '' He lived twenty-six years after the appearance of Flowers of Sion , and , from one point of view , his life in that year began .

		He took interest in the stirring events that followed the death of
James I.	PERSON	; he wrote a history of
Scotland	LOCATION	; he married and had many children ; he wrote topical prose pamphlets ; he travelled ; he rebuilt his house '' -LRB- IV. , p. 177 -RRB- . ''

		At any rate , '' demands
Socrates	PERSON	in the Phcedrus , `` you will allow that every discourse ought to be a liying creature , having a body of its own and a head and feet ; there should be a middle , beginning , and end , adapted to one another and to the whole ?

		... Now in this rhyme whether a line comes first or comes last , as you will perceive , makes no difference . ''

		In the case of a person who displays so little self - suspicion as Mr.
de Selincourt	PERSON	with respect to the employment of s and p , not to speak of sequence and other points of style , one may venture to exercise the animus supicax upon some part of his subject-matter .

		How many will agree that
Drummond	PERSON	'' saw and sang the truth -LSB- that God is love -RSB- less clearly , and , there - fore , less beautifully , than
Shelley	PERSON	, '' though '' there is much in them of surprising similar - ity '' ?

		`` In
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	's poems ... the idea remained a beautiful theory , whereas
Shelley	PERSON	applied the idea to human life and worked it out in amazing detail , helped by his profound knowledge of human nature '' -LRB- IV. , p. 177 -RRB- .

		To me at least ,
Shelley	PERSON	is distinguished by his pro- found lack of such knowledge .

		And is it safe to affirm that `` the sympathy which
Milton	PERSON	could not but feel for the rebel transformed the figure of Satan from a fine conception to one of immortal grandeur , '' or that
Milton	PERSON	`` human - ized the devil '' -LRB- IV. , p. 192 -RRB- ?

		`` There is neither truth nor wit , '' observes Landor , follow - ing Addison , '' in saying that Satan is hero -LSB- of ' Paradise Lost ' -RSB- , unless , as is usually the case in human life , he is the greatest hero who gives the widest sway to his own passions . ''

		Has Mr.
de Selincourt	PERSON	been duped by the bombastic arguments of the Miltonic Satan , forgetting how Milton himself describes these utterances ? ''

		High words , that bore Semblance of worth , not substance . ''

		In these quotations from '' The Successors of Spenser , '' various odd commas , and the unex - pected absence of capital letters -LRB- '' lord
Brooke	PERSON	, '' `` Jesus college '' -RRB- , are not the fault of the indi - vidual writer .

		The whole work , we must fear , is now committed to a mode of punctuation , espe - cially in the setting off of short restrictive phrases , adverbial qualifiers , and the like , which frequently is irritating and for the most part THE DIAL 1 .

		seems to be unwaranted by the beet practice .

		The demands of uniformity notwithstanding , it would be well to adopt the less provincial usage in the remaining ten volumes .

		In the mat - ter of ordinary proof-reading also , the standard of exactness maintained by the
Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	readily suggests itself as more desirable ; for though Volumes III .

		and IV .

		evince greater care in this regard than thqir predecessors , the number of misprints and other accidents of typography in them is far too large . ''

		The Son - neteering Conceit of Immorality '' -LSB- == Immor - tality -RSB- -LRB- III. , p. 295 -RRB- is a fair example .

		Also compare ''
Davison	PERSON	'' with ''
Davidson	PERSON	, '' pp. 148 , 225 , of Volume IV .

		But let us turn to what ought to be praised . ''

		The sonneteering conceit of immortality '' strikes a key-note in Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's chapter on '' The Elizabethan Sonnet , '' an able discus - sion , clear , full , and precise , showing the fruit of recent studies in Elizabethan authors and their French or Italian models ; yet somewhat wanting in the quality of sympathetic insight .

		Mr.
Lee	PERSON	does , in fact , lay too much stress upon questions of external form and superficial evi - dences of imitation ; so that in the next vol - ume -LRB- IV. , p. 204 -RRB- Mr.
Harold H. Child	PERSON	is forced to observe : Into the vexed question of the genuineness of the sentiments expressed in -LSB-
Drayton	PERSON	's -RSB- and other
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan sonnets , this is not the place to enter .

		It is perhaps , generally recognized that the adoption of a poetic convention does not necessarily denote insincerity in the poet ; and the question is not whether or whence he borrowed his conventions , but whether he lias sub - dued them to his own genius . ''

		We might infer from Mr.
Lee	PERSON	that not even Spenser was competent wholly to subdue a bor - rowed form to the sincere expression of his own feelings .

		Still , if we put together what Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	and others have said in these two volumes about the poets ' poet , Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's insist - ence on some of his favorite conclusions , even where they are not highly imaginative , will send no one far astray .

		Spenser does indeed , and with justice , receive a large share of attention in these sections of the
Cambridge	LOCATION	History ; and Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	's special chapter on him is one of the most satis - factory things thus far in the whole work .

		It is not inspired no one who is familiar with Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	's '' History of English Poetry '' will marvel at the lack ; but his training through long term of years in his own extensive under - taking now enables him to render emphatic those things which ought to be made so , and to pass over and omit what is relatively or altogether trivial .

		In other words , notwithstanding the customary dryness of his manner , he displays certain qualities which the
Cambridge	LOCATION	History as a whole does not , by manifesting a sense of order and proportion .

		His '' Summary View of Spenser 's Genius '' -LRB- III. , pp. 277-280 -RRB- is admirable in its breadth and precision .

		If the editors were fortunate in obtaining the services of Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	for '' The Poetry of Spenser , '' they were yet more so in securing those of Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	for the chapter in Volume IV .

		on the Elizabethan translators ; for his sub - stance is equally good , and the form of his pre - sentation most engaging .

		He too has an eye for what is of vital interest , so that we may condone his occasional fondness for epigram , if it betrays him into nothing worse than the declaration that
Arthur Golding	PERSON	is never a poet and never a shirk . ''

		Are we to admit that the bits of
Golding	PERSON	's
Ovid	LOCATION	that have crept into the dramas of Shakespeare are not poet - ical ?

		But we note with satisfaction that , in spite of the adverse judgment of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	regards
Chapman	PERSON	's translation of Homer as not only '' vigorous , '' but also `` faithful . ''

		`` To do full justice to
Chapman	PERSON	* s work , '' he adds -LRB- IV. , pp. 24-25 -RRB- , '' a continuous reading is necessary .

		It shines less brightly in isolated passages than in its whole surface , various and burnished , like the shield of Achilles . ''

		Our commendation of the chapter must be extended so as to include the valuable bibliography of translations in thirteen pages of the appendix .

		No comparable list of references has hitherto been published .

		What has been observed concerning the choice of collaborators for these two volumes does not hold with reference to the scholars who have been enlisted from countries outside of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Koeppel	PERSON	of
Freiburg	LOCATION	, for example , speaks with authority upon
Barclay	PERSON	and
Skelton	PERSON	; and our own Professor
Cunliffe	PERSON	has two suitable chapters dealing with `` A Mirror for Magistrates '' and ''
George Gas	PERSON	- coigne . ''

		Moreover , the editors have bestowed a signal mark of consideration upon
America	LOCATION	by inviting
Professor Cook of Yale	ORGANIZATION	to explain the position and influence of the
King James	LOCATION	version of the
Bible	LOCATION	, a task for which the author was well fitted on account of his investi - gations into the bearing of Scriptural literature upon Old Kn ^ lish , and his rontinnrd study of the relations between the
Bible	LOCATION	and subsequent writers like
Kuskin	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Burke	PERSON	.

		THE DIAL 65 FROM
ALASKA	LOCATION	TO With pending realization of the long hoped - for and long deferred opening of a canal across the isthmus of
Panama	LOCATION	, the great
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	that remotest of all shores from the main routes of commerce and travel is destined to become the goal of an increasing number of Argonauts .

		The advertising literature of enter - prising railroads , the richly-illustrated booklets of enthusiastic and experienced secretaries of state promotion committees and local chambers of commerce , and the glowing tributes of town - site and colony promotors , have done much to inform the enquiring public of the attractions , genuine and prospective , of the region which is well called the
Italy	LOCATION	of
America	LOCATION	.

		It is both refreshing and informing to turn from this alluring if sometimes turbid flood of informa - tion to a pleasing group of books whose authors view our occidental shores from diverse angles of vision and with very different horizons .

		A comprehensive glance at `` The
Great Pacific Coast	LOCATION	'' of the three Americas is to be found in Mr.
C. Reginald Enock	PERSON	's book with that title .

		The author 's wide experience in travel , and his previous works dealing with Spanish-American countries bordering upon the
Pacific	LOCATION	, have made it possible for him to bring together in a unique volume a very complete and readable account of the
Pacific	LOCATION	countries , from
Chili	LOCATION	to
Alaska	LOCATION	, of '' these sunset lands where roll twelve thousand miles of ocean surge against the
Pacific	LOCATION	shores . ''

		Single chapters are given to

		sive grasp of the important and significant facts and factors in the environment of the peoples of the countries discussed , and of the industrial , commercial , social , and political factors of im - portance in their national life .

		Some inaccu - racies inevitably creep into a work planned so comprehensively .

		Thus , the reader might think that the
Union Pacific Railroad	ORGANIZATION	entered
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia ; that eight thousand years was a fair estimate of the age of the great Sequoias , whereas four thousand is doubtless nearer the fact .

		The author 's statistics of population also need chronological coordination , and his state - ment that prostitution is legalized in
San Fran	LOCATION	- cisco calls for correction .

		It is far from being true that the
State University	ORGANIZATION	at
Berkeley	LOCATION	'' owes its existence mainly to a
Calif	LOCATION	ornian millionaire '' ; nor is the sweeping generalization , made a propos of the boasted freedom of our educational institutions , at all justified by the fact that '' the colour-line is jealously drawn in all American institutions in a way unknown in
Britain	LOCATION	or British dependencies . ''

		The author writes quite sympathetically of the Spanish - American peoples to whose faults and foibles he is at least lenient .

		His knowledge of Amer - ican life has evidently been to a considerable degree gained in mining communities , those out - skirts of modern civilization where the veneer of culture is badly abraded and the stratifica - tion of society is reduced to the simplicity of elemental disorder .

		For this reason , and doubt - less also for others equally good and less com - plimentary to the Native Sons of the
Golden West	LOCATION	and to later arrivals , his freely expressed opinion of Californians is not palatable , nor on the whole a just appreciation of all the forces at work in our cosmopolitan life .

		He says : `` The Americans are a remarkable people for trav - elling .

		They are ever running across their continent and up and down it with the activity of ants , with one underlying motive business .

		The powers of modern usuary are eloquently depicted in American railroads and hotels , and the ceaseless , restless life of barter which is the soul at present of these remarkable people .

		This constant flux and movement naturally prevents the crystallization of the Californians into the distinct nationality which their geographical environ - ment and history might otherwise have induced ... The character of the people , to British eyes , seems overshadowed at times by the almost aggressive incivility and cynical shrewdness common to the West - ern American , which often hides their otherwise good qualities . ''

		Though keenly critical of our crudities and shortcomings , and perhaps not fully cognizant of the sources of our culture and their real strength , the author is still sanguine '' that an 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, era of real civilization will be the outcome of the strenuous life of this splendid stiff-necked people . ''

		Our three remaining books deal with more restricted areas , and are written from less com - prehensive points of view .

		The title of Mr.
C. F. Holder	PERSON	's `` Channel Islands '' at once turns our thoughts abroad ; but
San Clemente	LOCATION	,
Santa Catalina	LOCATION	, and their lesser sisters , have little in common with
Jersey	LOCATION	and
Guernsey	ORGANIZATION	beyond their isolation .

		Bits of drifting desert sand , or of cactus-clad canon , flung far a-sea and strung along the coast from
Point Concepcion	ORGANIZATION	to the Mexican boundary , between the latitudes of 34 and 35 -LRB- about those of the
Riviera	LOCATION	and of
Egypt	LOCATION	-RRB- , the
Channel Islands of California	LOCATION	offer one of the most picturesque and attractive play grounds of the world , and are destined as they become better known to become a boon of inestimable value to all lovers of nature .

		No one is better qualified than Mr.
Holder	PERSON	to write of these islands , of their superb climatic condi - tions , cooler in
summer	DATE	than the shores of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	and warmer in winter than
Naples	LOCATION	, of their submarine gardens and forests of giant kelps , of their unrivalled game-fishes the leap - ing tuna , the great black sea-bass , the yellowtail , and the multitudinous lesser quarry of the deep - sea angler .

		Dr. Holder knows every nook and corner of the fishing-grounds , and is a veteran angler and sportsman , the founder and Presi - dent of the famous
Tuna Club of Avalon	ORGANIZATION	, membership in which is based solely on genuine piscatorial achievement .

		His book is mainly for the sportsman and tourist .

		It is illumined with abundant local color , enlivened with adven - ture , and filled from cover to cover with infor - mation attractively presented and handsomely illustrated .

		The author is a naturalist as well as a sportsman , and writes with enthusiasm and authority of the wonderful life revealed by the clever device of glass-bottomed boats in the turquoise waters of the ocean , and of the strange desert fauna and flora of these scattered islands .

		Lower
California	LOCATION	remains to-day nearly as much a terra incognita as it was when voyagers charted it as an island and peopled its valleys with roving Amazons .

		Visited by followers of
Cortez	ORGANIZATION	in
1533	DATE	, and planted with Jesuit missions on an elaborate scale at great expense during the seventeenth century , little remains to-day of the Castilian civilization save the language and the shattered ruins of once mag - nificent missions or the crumbling bastions of long since dismantled forts .

		Twice won and twice lost a > a province of the
Tinted State *	ORGANIZATION	, it yet remains a land apart from our own , with its beginnings of modern commercial exploitation largely in the hands of English syndicates and of French mining investors .

		Mr.
Arthur W. North	PERSON	's '' Camp and Camino in
Lower Cali	LOCATION	- fornia '' is a vivid account of his travels the length of the land along the old '' camino '' or royal road connecting the missions .

		Surely the word '' road '' can not be the equivalent of `` camino '' in this land at least , for even the trails are often untrodden and the ancient highway is lost in the desert or was never worn through the rocky fastnesses that bar all paths across the peninsula and guard its shores with barren precipitous cliffs .

		It is a land of mystery , of forgotten history , buried treasure , haunts of buccaneers , treacherous Indians , fierce pirates , and lost mines .

		For centuries it has taken its heavy toll on the engineers and prospectors who seek to explore its secrets and exploit its resources .

		Mr.
North	PERSON	's book is a narrative of travel throughout the length and breadth of this land of desert and deserted mountains , of cactus and rattlesnakes , of widely separated water-holes and remote haciendas , and of thirst , thirst , and again thirst .

		Its higher mountains with their forests and game , the reputed great mineral wealth , the air of mystery which sur - rounds it , all send forth a perpetual challenge to adventurous spirits .

		The author is evidently such an one , and his story is well told .

		The illustrations are abundant , though unfortu - nately not well executed ; but one is lucky to return from such a race with death without any pictures of the Inferno !

		The commercial point of view dominates Mr.
Dixon Wallace	PERSON	's '' Beyond the Mexican Sierras , '' a book which recounts his personal experiences of travel in the Mexican states of
Sonora	LOCATION	,
Sinaloa	LOCATION	,
Tepic	LOCATION	, and
Julisco	PERSON	.

		This remote and formerly inaccessible corner of the great South ern republic is being rapidly opened up to travel and commerce by railroad extensions , and offers a splendid field for American enterprise .

		Mod - ern sanitary science has made possible the con - trol of diseases that have ravaged this coast , especially in the lowlands ; while the uplands offer superb climatic conditions , as well as rich agricultural and mineral lands .

		Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	's book is valuable in the rather intimate account which it gives of native peoples and customs , and of the facilities or , rather , lack of them which these rural Mexican communities offer to the chance wayfarer .

		The work is richly illustrated , and is practically the first in the

		THE FAMILY LIFE OF MOTLEY .

		* While we are waiting for the life of
Motley	ORGANIZATION	in the series of '' American Men of Letters , '' we give warm welcome to the handsomely printed , indexed , and illustrated work on ''
John Lothrop Motley	PERSON	and his Family , '' containing further let - ters and records not included in the two octavos of
Motley	ORGANIZATION	's Correspondence edited by the late
George William Curtis	PERSON	.

		These later letters , con - nected by a thread of chronology and history , have been edited by
Motley	ORGANIZATION	's daughter
Susan	PERSON	and her husband , Mr.
Herbert St. John Mild	PERSON	- may .

		Here we can look upon the portraits of the father and mother of the great historian , observe him in his earlier life , study the linea - ments of his intellectual ancestors , see the house at the
Hague	LOCATION	in which he did some of his best work , learn how Prince
Bismarck	PERSON	-LRB- who was his classmate -RRB- looked as a student , and contemplate his classic features as the Dutch artist ,
Madame JBisschop	ORGANIZATION	, delineated them .

		All true Americans feel proud as they look upon that picture .

		Those who have been behind the scenes will welcome as an old friend the volume of the Dutch his - torian Hoofd , which
Motley	ORGANIZATION	holds in his left hand , no doubt opened at a favorite page .

		With this classic writer , as terse as
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	and as philosophical as
Thucydides	LOCATION	,
Motley	ORGANIZATION	was as familiar as with the face of his wife .

		Around him , near the chair in the picture , are other books , like those of Bor and
Wagenaar	PERSON	; Mot - ley having read the works of the latter , as his Dutch physician told the reviewer , no fewer than nine times .

		Motley knew fully the tragedy as well as the joy of life , and the ironies of fate that have befallen his memory seem almost like cruel jibes .

		eldest grandson , his pet and delight , was killed in the South African Boer War by a Dutchman .

		Thus this intensest of Americans is remembered in
England	LOCATION	in his living offspring as well as by literary fame ; while in the
United States	LOCATION	his writings alone , with a few artistic memorials in
Boston	LOCATION	, keep alive his genial memory .

		Perhaps the most interesting portion of the present volume will be found in the letters of
Bismarck	LOCATION	, who wrote and was written to in the most delightful spirit of camaraderie .

		When
Motley	ORGANIZATION	sent him a copy of his '' Rise of the Dutch Republic , ''
Bismarck	PERSON	criticised his refer - ence to the alleged jus primce noctis , which as Professor
Gummere	PERSON	in his '' Germanic Origins '' thinks , can belong only to the '' horseplay of history '' ; while
Bismarck	PERSON	asserts that it never existed in
Germany	LOCATION	in the sense in which the adversaries of the middle ages used it as a weapon against the German nobility .

		Excellent taste characterizes the selection and editing of these letters .

		They show Motley a most intense American , and a believer in the ultimate supremacy of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	arms during the war between the States , as expressed in his illuminating and forceful letters in '' The Times . ''

		No doubt the results of Grant 's pound - ing ,
Sherman	PERSON	's march ,
Sheridan	PERSON	's dash , and
Thomas	PERSON	's tenacity had much to do with Mr.
Edward A. Freeman	PERSON	's discontinuance of that wonderful fragment of his on '' The History of
Federal Government	ORGANIZATION	from the
Amphyctionic Council	ORGANIZATION	to the Disruption of the
United States of America	LOCATION	. ''

		It is needless to say that
Freeman	PERSON	's first and only volume was published before
Appomattox	LOCATION	, and was written previous to the Confederacy 's being '' sawed into three pieces , '' as
Motley	ORGANIZATION	says , at
Vicksburg	LOCATION	,
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, and
Chattanooga	LOCATION	.

		The editors have wisely omitted some letters written during the war which , if printed now , might have made
Motley	ORGANIZATION	seem rancorous and implacable .

		Most delightful are the pictures of society and life in

		Despite the enjoyment of
Motley	ORGANIZATION	and his family in those high circles , there must have been much to make a
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	wish to laugh .

		One social canon required that engaged couples , when in public , must sit or stand together , holding between them a huge bouquet .

		Happily , engagements , when pub - lished , were not supposed to last longer than six weeks .

		We have most delightful bits of history about
Motley	ORGANIZATION	's great book , how it was published , its reception , and the instant place it gave him in society and fame .

		Many of the letters are from , or written by , his wife , 68 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, daughters , or other members of the family , so that the book is well entitled .

		Altogether we have found it one of the most delightful addi - tions to American epistolary literature .

		SOME RECENT DRAMAS .

		* When a drama is offered only on the printed page , the critic does well to pause and hesitate .

		With a poem , a novel , an essay , his task is easier .

		These are written to be read ; their authors have in mind an audience of readers , and readers only .

		With a play it is quite different .

		This is not written primarily to be read , but to be acted .

		Its author has in mind many things that he assumes will be provided by skilful actors and stage manager , tones of voice , illusive scenery , costumes , pantomime , even eloquent silence .

		Unless the critic is prepared to supply much of this '' stage business '' between the lines as he reads , he should question his own fitness .

		Whether a play '' will act '' is a more vital consideration than how it reads .

		In
France	LOCATION	, where we may well look for models of dramatic criticism as of many other forms of art , they are about to reestablish the '' reading commit - tee '' for the
Comedie Francaise	ORGANIZATION	, abolished in
1901	DATE	.

		During the last nine years , the power of accepting or rejecting new plays has been vested in the direc - tor of the theatre company .

		Now , the French Min - ister of Public Instruction proposes that new plays shall be submitted to a committee of ten with the Director as president , and that at least seven mem - bers besides himself must be present at its meetings .

		Plays are to be read either by the author himself or by his representative , or by a member of the committee in the presence of the author if he desires to attend .

		Such are the precautions that no really good thing shall fail to be recognized , no poor thing be exposed to the merciless glare of the footlights .

		Moreover , the burden laid upon the literary critic of the drama is comparatively a new one .

		For a long time indeed we have had the `` literary drama '' so-called , that is , dramas written frankly for liter - ary effect , almost always in blank verse , in a dialogue far removed , and meant to be far removed , from the THRBB PLAYS :

		actual speech of daily life , and seldom with a view to stage presentation .

		Hence they differed little from poems , and could be judged mainly as poetry .

		But with the advent of the modern social drama compositions in prose aiming to present faithful pictures of men and manners a new type of plays has presented itself for judgment These plays date almost entirely from the
last two decades	DATE	, and they are pouring forth in a vast flood .

		Of the two thousand manuscripts said to have been submitted to the
New Theatre	LOCATION	in
New York	LOCATION	during the first fourteen weeks of its history , it is safe to say that a very large proportion were of this type .

		Of the six books of plays on the present reviewer 's table , five are written with the evident hope of stage presenta - tion , only one is frankly a closet drama .

		Also , it is somewhat typical of the present fashion in drama that not one of these six books has to deal with pres - ent times or themes in
America	LOCATION	.

		And this too is in accord with the experience of the New Theatre .

		Although the encouragement of American play - wrights was one of its principal objects , only two plays by American authors were found of sufficient merit to be chosen , and only one of these dealt with American characters or conditions .

		Can it be that our lives are so hopelessly dull and commonplace that we offer no dramatic material ?

		Is it not , rather , that the dramatist is not alive to his opportunity , that it is his own lack of genius for seeing below the surface of things , his own lack of the poetic power , as
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	defined it , `` to see the miraculous in the common '' ?

		In only one of our present group of books do we meet characters from everyday life and speaking the language of our own time .

		Mrs.
W. K. Clifford	PERSON	, first on our list , offers '' Three Plays '' of English life .

		They seem quite well adapted for stage pre - sentation ; indeed , one of them '' Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	's Second Marriage '' has already been given in a
London	LOCATION	theatre .

		Another , `` The Modern Way , '' has been adapted from a story of the same title .

		But the best play in the book is `` Thomas and the Princess , '' a sweet love-story brought to a happy ending after a conflict with English traditions and class prejudices .

		Although not at all thrilling , it is sane and wholesome , and we have not too many such just now .

		Another volume of English plays is ``
Allison	PERSON	's Lad , and Other Martial Interludes '' by Mrs.
Bvulah Dix	PERSON	, six plays , each of one act only , and tatter suited to amateur than to professional presentation .

		In the four-act drama by Mrs.
Munn	PERSON	, Shake - speare is the hero .

		The first act is laid in
1582	DATE	, at
Charlecote Park	LOCATION	, just after
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has stolen the deer ; the second act is
four years later	DATE	, and shows him fleeing from his fireside with a company of strolling players ; the third is twelve years afu-r , when he has won fame and gained entrance to the courtly circles of the
London	LOCATION	of Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	; the fourth presents him at the crisis when lie takes his resolve to return to his wife and children at
Stratford	LOCATION	.

		Thus the action covers that period of
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 69
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's life of which least is known , and which offers such a tempting field to the imagina - tion .

		All of the characters are historic , and no undue liberties have been taken with any of them .

		It all '' might have been , '' from the little we know of what really was .

		Written mostly in blank verse , and in the lofty phrase of the gentlefolk of the sixteenth century , it would call for good reading on the part of actors and actresses ; but given these , there are enough dramatic moments , a clever enough plot and denouement , to make it a good acting play .

		Certainly , it would be interesting if offered by a company having poetic feeling and capacities of expression , and with an actor of the proper endowment to show us Shakespeare '' in his habit as he lived . ''

		`` The Tocsin , '' Mrs.
Esther Brown Tiffany	PERSON	's drama of the Renaissance , is of the modern miracle - play type such as '' Sister Beatrice '' and others by
Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		The principal characters are an abbot and a nun .

		The scene is laid in
1586	DATE	, first in
Florence	LOCATION	, afterward in
Castle	ORGANIZATION	delle
Torre	PERSON	outside the city of
Pistoia	LOCATION	.

		Its scenery and costuming would make this a beautiful '' show '' piece , but it is doubtful if anything but a picked audience of un - usual cultivation would enjoy its plot and dialogue .

		Mrs.
Tiffany	PERSON	is to be congratulated on the beautiful form given to her book by the publishers , its Italian hand-made paper , its fine typography , and the charming binding of soft gray Fabriano boards .

		Another beautiful specimen of book-making is Mr.
Gordon Bottomley	PERSON	's `` Vision of Giorgione , '' which has all the dainty features we have learned to expect in a
Mosher	PERSON	book .

		There is scarcely another painter of equal rank with
Giorgione	PERSON	of whom we know so little .

		Vasari mentions his fond - ness for music and his love for a lady .

		This fur - nishes Mr.
Bottomley	PERSON	the inspiration for his sequence of three poems -LRB- rather than dramas -RRB- called `` A Concert of Giorgione , '' '' A Pastoral of Giorgione , '' and `` The Lady of Giorgione . ''

		The poet has caught the Venetian atmosphere very perfectly in his charm - ing verse ; perhaps he has also caught the secret of the painter 's method in a passage such as this : '' I pose models no more , But find adorable ladies with such fair minds They may be trusted to express themselves Graciously , perfectly in perfect gowns ; I ask them to come here quite half in secret , Wearing the gowns they think for quiet joy ; Sometimes I play them music of subtle discords , Or tell them casual fragmentary stories About the sudden things women do Which no man understands .

		And I watch , I paint and watch ; they think they are but broidering , Or wondering , or resting from their fate . ''

		The author of `` A
Garland	LOCATION	to Sylvia '' takes himself very seriously .

		A preliminary page of his book announces that '' performances are forbid - den and right of representation reserved , under penalty provided by United States Statutes , '' of which Section 4966 is printed in full .

		A needless warning , one would say , for so thoroughly unactable a piece !

		Needless also , and far too personal , seems the fifteen-page preface , recounting the composition of the manuscript , which was begun fourteen years ago , finished eleven years ago , and is now for the first time published , the eleven-year-old preface being included .

		Data so intime , in the case of youthful productions of a great poet like
Tennyson	PERSON	or
Browning	PERSON	after they have won their laurels by greater work , are sometimes worth while .

		They hardly seem so in this case of a
Percy Mackaye	ORGANIZATION	.

		To be sure he has a certain knowledge of dramatic technique , with considerable poetic fancy ; and some of his plays have proved successful on the stage .

		But these are hardly sufficient in quantity or dis - tinguished enough in quality to give us a feeling of vital concern in his sophomoric efforts .

		Notwith - standing some pretty symbolism , and some pretty verse in terza rima , this '' Dramatic Reverie '' might well have been left in the seclusion where it had remained so long .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Roman relics Amon S visit rS J R me * a fa ' outside of the miliar commonplace that the longer Eternal City - vou 8 tay in that city the less you seem to know about it .

		So infinite is its variety of interest , so numerous are the inquiries it arouses as to its past , that the subject seems practically inex - haustible .

		But now an archaeologist , Dr.
A. L. Frothingham	PERSON	of
Princeton University	ORGANIZATION	, has given us a book on '' Roman Cities in
Italy	LOCATION	and
Dalmatia	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Sturgis & Walton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- proving that no stay in the
Eternal City	LOCATION	, however prolonged , can ever be adequate for a study of Roman civilization , not because there is so much to see there , but because there is so little .

		So fragmentary are its ruins , so little is left in
Rome	LOCATION	itself compared with what we can find elsewhere in the Italian peninsula , that it is only by travel in these near-by regions that we can find answer to our most pressing questions .

		To discover what the early Romans wore and what they decorated their houses with , what were their religious rites and customs , we must explore their early tombs .

		But the number of such tombs in
Rome	LOCATION	is very small ; indeed , in such places as
Alba	LOCATION	,
Praeneste	LOCATION	,
Veii	LOCATION	, etc. , there are necropoli far exceed - ing them in numbers , wealth , and extent of time .

		For a study of Roman architecture of the great style of the Empire , we have in
Rome	LOCATION	itself only the
Cloaca	LOCATION	and the
Mamertine	LOCATION	prison ; for a study of old stone walls , with their mounds and fosses , their towers and gates , almost nothing is left .

		For these we must go to
Etruria	LOCATION	,
Umbria	LOCATION	,
Latium	LOCATION	, and other regions farther south .

		Not until the reign of
Augustus	PERSON	did the life of
Italy	LOCATION	become centralized in
Rome	LOCATION	itself ; and even after that time the fires and reconstructions of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, quite as much as time and vandalism , helped to obliterate 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, or fundamentally deface all but a few works .

		Although Dr.
Frothingham	PERSON	's book is written by a scholar and mainly for scholars , its style is so engaging , its comment so illuminating , that it can - not fail to command popular interest .

		The sixty - one full-page illustrations , with the maps , help us to answer the author 's questions in his prologue : What remaining Augustan temple in
Rome	LOCATION	can compare in preservation with those of
Pola	LOCATION	and
Assisi	LOCATION	?

		What Augustan arches or gates with those of Agnino ,
Arsta	LOCATION	,
Rimini	LOCATION	,
Spello	LOCATION	,
Pola	PERSON	, and
Verona	LOCATION	?

		What bridges in
Rome	LOCATION	equal those of
Narni	LOCATION	,
Spoleto	LOCATION	,
Rimini	LOCATION	, and Vulci ? ''

		Before going to
Rome	LOCATION	, it will not come amiss to anyone to read this instructive and agreeable book .

		Under the suggestive title - A Motle y '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- are gathered a number of Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	's '' stories , studies , and impressions , '' written during the last ten years , and all but two published in vari - ous English periodicals .

		They all illustrate this interesting writer 's remarkable power of using apparently commonplace material to present a pic - ture , delineate a character , or narrate an incident , with delicacy and vividness .

		In his pages , if any - where in contemporaneous literature , we find what a recent critic of current fiction was asking for , the fusion of '' sympathy with sincerity and tenderness with truth . ''

		In a sketch of only three pages , for instance , Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	moves the reader pro- foundly by bringing him face to face , in a French railway train , with a sick sailor sent on naval ser - vice to distant
China	LOCATION	, while his poor mother , whose sole support he is , remains at home to grieve over his going and perhaps to starve .

		`` Tell me his eyes seemed to ask why are these things so ?

		Why have I a mother who depends on me alone , when I am being sent away to die ? ''

		The opening chapter , entitled `` A Portrait , '' and now printed for the first time , is a masterly bit of description , almost without incident and thirty pages long , but so infused with life and reality as to hold the unwearied atten - tion of the reader to the end .

		Pathos and humor , which fill a larger place in life than do hilarity and merriment , are the prevailing note of the book , which might perhaps best be briefly characterized as a book of tears and smiles .

		One of the most careful and thor - ou gb * contemporary historical monographs is that by Mr.
Julian S. Corbett	PERSON	on `` The Campaign of Trafalgar '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		The battle itself , although treated with great fulness , occupies a very small part of a large volume ; for the book is an exhaustive study of causes and results .

		All the happenings in
Europe	LOCATION	, from
May 1804	DATE	till
December 1805	DATE	, that had the remotest connection with the campaign and some whose connection is rather difficult to see are anxiously scanned for their bearing on the great sea-fight ; and the reader is constantly warned that all the events under consideration are bound into one great movement .

		This emphasis is a modem tendency that can not be too highly approved ; -RRB- > ut Mr.
Corbett	PERSON	's treatment of details is so exhaustive that it sometimes becomes difficult to see the city for the houses .

		He expresses surprise , in his preface , that the work he has performed so conscientiously should have remained so long undone , when > tudi-s of
Waterloo	LOCATION	, the great land-battle of the Napoleonic era , are numbered by the dozen .

		There are prob - ably several good reasons for this ; the best one is touched on by Mr.
Corbett	PERSON	himself .

		Trafalgar did nothing for
Europe	LOCATION	,
Napoleon	PERSON	was too quick and clever at
Austerlitz	LOCATION	, and a score of other points , for that , and
Europe	LOCATION	owes
Nelson	PERSON	very little .

		Trafalgar did a great deal for
England	LOCATION	, it is true , not so much by securing the British Isles against invasion for they were never in real danger of invasion but by crushing the fleet that stood in the way of the English occupation of naval bases in the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, thus securing and strengthening the British Empire ; but its direct international significance was very small .

		Even the curtest of reviews must not neglect to mention the justice here accorded Lord
Barham	PERSON	, the old
First Lord of the Admiralty	ORGANIZATION	, who deserved quite as much credid for the success of the campaign as does Nelson himself , though he has received an astonishingly small amount of recognition from either his contempora - ries or their descendants .

		Mr.
Corbett	PERSON	is Lecturer in History in the Royal Naval War College , and his somewhat technical and austere volume will prove especially interesting and profitable to the special student of naval affairs .

		For the bett n of what women 's edu - education cat inn shall be has been debated so of women .

		i ong an -LRB- j M one _ 8 idedly that an impartial study of the matter is welcome .

		Dean
Talbot	PERSON	's book on `` The Education of Women '' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- considers women 's education from the standpoint of present-day social and economic needs , and is a concrete and definite study of these needs and the machinery for respond - ing to them , and of the changes necessary in our colleges and curricula in order to fit women for meeting the obligations of life more successfully .

		In Part I. , women 's activities , past and present , are discussed ; Part II .

		deals with our educational machinery , and , among other things , includes a comparative study of the curricula of a woman 's college -LRB-
Vassar	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- and of a State university -LRB- Wiscon - sin -RRB- in the years
1861	DATE	and
1909	DATE	.

		The conclusion is that education in the women 's college * has become stereotyped around the classics and cultural studies ; while the
State	ORGANIZATION	university , representing coeducation , has developed a superior type of training in prac - tical and scientific work .

		The writer strongly urges the changing of women 's hitherto casual interest in social and intellectual affairs into a professional attitude toward work and study ; she advises choos - ing a profession early in the college career , and the
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL selection of courses that best serve that purpose .

		She makes very definite pleas for the training of women in practical affairs , in the arts of the home , and in child-rearing .

		`` So far as the social and economic arrangements of society allot to men and women different tasks , '' she says , '' so far must the educational machinery be developed differently for the two sexes .

		That both be treated according to sound psychological principles , while to each is given the opportunity for being trained for such social tasks as await the well-equipped member of a modern democratic community , is the ideal to be sought . ''

		The book is interesting and important , not only to educators , but to the wider public not so directly concerned in the training of women .

		The botany of the Naturalists of the `` old school , '' who Rocky Mountains , were brought up on Gray 's Manual revised to date .

		of Botany ?

		feel especially friendly toward each new edition of Gray , and toward each new edition of other books which extend its method and its typography beyond the old bounds of the northeastern quarter of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Notable among the outgrowths of Gray 's Botany was Coul - ter 's '' Manual of the Botany of the Rocky Moun - tain Region , '' published in
1885	DATE	.

		Excellent as this volume was , its very excellence soon threw it out of date .

		It gave the basis for more intensive work , especially of local botanists ; and this intensive work soon piled up the additions and corrections .

		The new edition of this work , by Professor
Alven Nel	PERSON	- son of the
University of Wyoming	ORGANIZATION	, brings the whole flora up to date .

		The classification is modern , begin - ning at the bottom , no longer with the '' typical flower . ''

		The grouping of genera and species is along rational and scientific lines , neither radical beyond the facts nor conservative behind the times .

		The descriptions , after the fashion of those of Gray , are clearly written , condensed , and diagnostic , with helpful keys in the more difficult groups .

		The num - ber of species included is 2733 , placed in 649 gen - era .

		The CompositCK are placed last , as the most complex of flowering plants .

		Not botanists only , but naturalists generally will appreciate this useful piece of work .

		The essays There is perhaps nothing in
Francis	PERSON	of
Franks Thompson	PERSON	's `` Renegade Poet , and
Thompson	PERSON	.

		Other Essays '' -LRB-
Ball Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , that quite equals in critical insight and charm of style the author 's posthumous essay on Shelley that article which startled '' The
Dublin	LOCATION	Review '' into an unheard-of second edition ; but there is enough here to make us glad that Mr.
Edward J. O'Brien	PERSON	has collected these pieces into a separate volume .

		They range all the way from the playful humor of the first essay , that gives the title to the volume , to the effort in the manner of DeQuincey called ''
Moestitise Enconium	PERSON	, '' and the more labored narrative in the style of Poe entitled ''
Finis Coronat Opus	PERSON	. ''

		The humor that lightens up most of the book is never very brilliant , but it is also never tire - some .

		Occasionally back of the jest one sees the tragedy of
Thompson	PERSON	's life , not obtrusive but none the less sure ; one hardly needs Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	's bio - graphical appreciation that introduces the volume , to guess how gloomy must have been the background of that life .

		In a criticism of
Crashaw	ORGANIZATION	,
Thompson	PERSON	reverts to the idea touched upon in the essay on
Shelley	LOCATION	, where he had said that `` Crashaw and
Shelley	PERSON	sprang from the same seed ; but in the one case the seed was choked with thorns , in the other case it fell on good ground . ''

		Both were in a way metaphysical poets , and one was no more a devo - tional poet than the other .

		Perhaps the most sug - gestive essay in the collection is that on '' Paganism , Old and New . ''

		We can not , and we should not if we could , bring back the old paganism when paganism was a faith ; that old paganism was without the two great factors in the beauty of modern poetry nature and love .

		The paganism we could bring back is that of the days of Juvenal , and it is this paganism `` which already stoops on
Paris	LOCATION	, and wheels in shadowy menace over
England	LOCATION	. ''

		For us , the poetry of paganism `` was born in the days of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, and entered on its inheritance in the days of Keats . ''

		, , > , * '' The Teachers of Emerson '' -LRB- Stur - Sources of the v inspiration gis
& Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Professor of
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		j ohn
g. Harrison	PERSON	of
Kenyon Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege , presents the results of a careful study which '' has convinced the author that Greek thought has been the most important factor in
Emerson	LOCATION	's intel - lectual development . ''

		In three hundred and fifteen scholarly pages , duly provided with preface , foot - notes , bibliography , and index , he points out Emer - son 's indebtedness to Platonist and Neo-Platonist thought throughout his works , both prose and poetry .

		It is an impressive exhibit , - but not a surprising one , since we are all familiar with the prevailing trend of thought in our
New England Plato	LOCATION	.

		Rather unaccountable in so thorough a sifting of relevant material is the omission of the
Emerson Journals	ORGANIZATION	, two volumes of which appeared last
November	DATE	, five months before the issue of Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's work .

		The Journals , however , so far as published , lend no great strength to the theory of
Emerson	LOCATION	's predomi - nant indebtedness to Plato and the Greeks ; for the non-Hellenic authors quoted and referred to in their pages are greatly in the majority .

		And so Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's book is really a study of but one phase , though a most important one , of
Emerson	LOCATION	's mind .

		Mr.
Samuel Gompers	PERSON	s `` Labor in Studies of the r .

		laboring class
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		represents , in large part , a set of loosely combined observations , desultory impres - sions , and comments , from a diary kept by the writer on a trip through
Europe	LOCATION	during the
summer of 1909	DATE	.

		He was the representative of the
Ameri	PERSON	- can
Federation of Labor	ORGANIZATION	to the
British Trades-Union Congress	ORGANIZATION	, to the
International Congress of Trades	ORGANIZATION	- Unions , and to other local bodies at this time .

		Mr. 72 THE DIAL , -LSB-
August 1	DATE	,
Gompers	PERSON	was interested chiefly in conditions of labor in the various countries that he visited , such problems as unemployment , poverty , and related topics , having his special attention .

		Impressions of various other aspects of English and
Continental	ORGANIZATION	life are included , however , and contrasts with American manners and customs mentioned , all in a keen , if not profound , fashion .

		In addition , there are a few chapters on more general subjects , in which such matters as '' Tipping Systems , '' u Railway Travel , '' '' Plain Water and Pure Air , '' are treated with sound common-sense .

		The book as a whole has in it a considerable number of facts interesting to the student of labor problems ; its main value lies , how - ever , in the first-hand impression that it gives of the life and work of the laboring class in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		That it is written by a man with an obviously strong bias for labor-unionism and a sharp eye for the good results of that system , need not bother anyone who makes the proper allowances .

		The outlook There have been so many books in re - for women in cent years recording various persons '
Wfttem Canada	LOCATION	, impressions of
Canada	LOCATION	and things Canadian , that one is inclined to doubt the probability of a new volume in this field containing anything particularly new or informing .

		Mrs. -LRB- Van 's book A Woman in
Canada	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , has the merit of approaching what is after all a pretty big subject , from a comparatively fresh point of view .

		She tells , in a very entertaining way , the story of a journey through
Western Canada	LOCATION	, made with the specific object of studying the conditions from a woman 's standpoint , and for the particular benefit of English - women who might have pluck and determination enough to face the hardships of pioneer life for the sake of winning an independence .

		After a careful examination of the conditions , her conclusion seems to be that there are splendid opportunities in
Western Canada	LOCATION	for women of the right class ; and if they should grow tired of an independent existence , there are scores of young bachelor fanners in the West who will be only too glad to join forces with tmm .

		Mrs.
VUliers-Wardell	PERSON	's ``
Spain	LOCATION	of the Spanish '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- treats fully and intelligently of life in
Spain	LOCATION	at the present day the court , the press , the theatre , literature , commerce , sports .

		The work belongs to the realistic rather than the romantic school of hooka descriptive of
Spain	LOCATION	, and gives accurately-stated facts instead of fleeting impressions .

		The bull-fight chapter , for instance , tells the rules and customs that govern the performance ; the various acts , or tuertes , are described , and even the costumes of the performers are pictured in detail .

		The principal living torreros are characterized , the breeding and handling of the bulls explained , the cruelty of the sport discussed giving the
Spaniard	ORGANIZATION	's point of view , and an idea is given of that important organ , the bull-fight press ; so that the reader is provided with definite information upon which to form opinions .

		This chapter is characteristic of the book , which treats , as stated in the Introduc - tion , of
Spain	LOCATION	of the Spanish , not of
Spain	LOCATION	of the English .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		The Century Dictionary '' has recently extended it > scope by the inclusion of two supplementary volumes , prepared under the editorship of Dr.
Benjamin K Smith	PERSON	.

		The new volumes are not only as thorough and elaborate in every respect as the originals , but are perhaps even more completely the work of specialists .

		Some idea of the additions included may be gained from the following rough summary : New Words , New Meauings of Old Words , New Encyclopedic Articles , New Foreign Words and Phrases , Slang Words and Colloquialisms , Trade - Names , New Abbreviations , Sim - plified
Spellings	PERSON	, and Proper - Name Additions and Cor - rections .

		Seventy-nine collaborators have been engaged upon the Supplement , which , together with the original volumes , now includes about five hundred and fifty thousand words .

		The first in order of Professor
Bronson	PERSON	's '' English Poems '' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and the last to appear , covers the period from 450 to
1450	DATE	.

		The Anglo-Saxon poems are done into modern prose , the work of Mrs.
Bronson	PERSON	, who has preserved as far as is possible the flavor of the original .

		The Middle F.nglish poems have not been adapted for the benefit of the modern reader , who can , however , by the aid of notes and glossary , interpret the text without much trouble .

		The whole series is intended for use in college classes .

		Chaucer is represented by the '' Prologue '' and the '' Nonne Preestes Tale , '' both complete .

		There are eighteen entire ballads and two fyttes of the ''
Gest	PERSON	of Robin Hood . ''

		Types of mediaeval drama are furnished in the Chester '' Deluge , '' the Coventry ''
Abraham	PERSON	's Sacrifice , '' '' Everyman , '' five scenes from the '' Mar - riage of Wit and Science , '' and
Heywood	PERSON	's `` The Four PP . ''

		Notes , glossary , and bibliography make up the critical material .

		A child 's life of St.

Sophie Jewett	PERSON	of

		Under the title '' God 's Trouba - dour , '' the lovely mediaeval story is told with a charm of literary distinction such as rarely goes into the mak - ing of a book for young readers .

		One likes to think what it will mean to those who , however unconscious of the art behind its sweetness , will follow the boy
Francis	PERSON	from the time when , at the gates of Assist , he welcomed home his splendid merchant father , through the years of his gay young manhood , to that in which mystic , saint , and gentlest lover of men he wandered on moonlit hillsides among the sleeping shep - herds and dreamed of
Bethlehem	LOCATION	ami the little Christ : or how , blessing bird and beast and flower , suffering , toiling , yet God 's sweetest singer still , he waited till the coming of his '' Sister Death . ''

		The story is full of vivid sketches of thirteenth century
Italy	LOCATION	, with now and then a word of present-day
Umbria	LOCATION	, which the photographs scattered through the book aptly illustrate .

		Some paintings of the early Italian masters have been reproduced for their concrete suggestions of old days ;
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 73 and the translations from Italian songs and lyrics further enhance the old-world atmosphere which per - vades the volume .

		Although Mr.
Carleton Noyes	PERSON	has entitled his mono - graph '' An Approach to
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, '' his little book of 230 pages is such a summing-up of the poet as will be best enjoyed by one who is already a disciple , and most useful to one who is familiar with
Whitman	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		It is a quite just appreciation of the author of `` Leaves of Grass , '' obviously sympathetic but altogether sane .

		There are few biographical details ; fewer , even , than in
Isaac Hull Platt	PERSON	's little volume on Whitman , in the '' Beacon Biographies . ''

		As an interpretation of Whitman , however , Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	's book deserves a place with
Carpenter	PERSON	's '' Whitman '' in the English '' Men of Letters '' series , and
Perry	PERSON	's ''
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, His Life and Work . ''

		The chapter on '' Whitman 's Art '' is clear and sound .

		Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	has a pleasing style a style free from the strain for paradox or epigram .

		The book is published by the
Houghton Mifflin Company	ORGANIZATION	and is handsomely issued , containing a reproduction of the poet 's best-known portrait .

		The two volumes of
Schipper	PERSON	's '' Englische Metrik '' were published in
1881	DATE	and
1888	DATE	respectively , and in
1895	DATE	an abridgment of this work , called `` Grundriss der englischen Metrik '' ; now ,
fifteen years later	DATE	, ap - pears the first English translation of the shorter work by Professor
Schipper	PERSON	himself , under the title '' A History of English Versification '' -LRB-
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This is more , however , than a mere trans - lation ; the first few chapters have been `` somewhat more fully worked out , '' and errors noted hi the '' Grundriss '' have been corrected .

		The first book treats of the line , the second of the structure of the stanzas .

		It would have been better if the word `` verse '' had been used throughout instead of '' line , '' if for no other reason than the sake of uniformity .

		Thus , in Book I. , Chapter X. , there is a discussion of the three - foot line , and in the chapter immediately following , of the rhymed five-foot verse .

		The general tendency to-day is to use verse for the older line and stanza for the older verse .

		There is unfortunately no index , but this lack is partly made up by a full table of con - tents .

		Professor
Charles Werner	PERSON	's '' Aristote et Pide'alisme platonicien '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	,
Felix Alcan	PERSON	-RRB- is a volume in the series entitled '' Collection historique des grands phi - losophes . ''

		A comparison with the volumes already pub - lished in the Scribner 's '' Epochs of Philosophy , '' or the
Dodge Company	ORGANIZATION	's '' Philosophies Ancient and Modern , '' shows that they do things differently , if not better , in
France	LOCATION	.

		This volume is a much more serious and severe piece of work than any contributor to an Amer - ican or English series of the kind would venture to offer the public .

		It is a close but lucid metaphysical analysis of the more abstract parts of the Aristotelian philosophy , with especial emphasis on their relation to
Plato	ORGANIZATION	.

		The more humane and concrete works of
Aristotle	LOCATION	, the Ethics , Politics , Rhetoric , and the biolog - ical writings , are practically ignored .

		The work is well done , but this is hardly the place to attempt a summary of it .

		The most important new result reached is that
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's God is the soul of the world .

		There is much to be said against this view .

		But even those who can - not accept the author 's conclusion will learn something from following the course of reasoning by which he arrives at it .

		NOTES .

		An edition of the late
Sophie Jewett	PERSON	's complete poems is announced for fall publication by
Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Those who are acquainted with the rare quality of Miss
Jewett	PERSON	's poetic work will look with interest for this volume .

		From Messrs.
Stanley Paul & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
London	LOCATION	, comes the first issue of a new monthly periodical , christened '' The Beau , '' devoted to '' the science of pleasure . ''

		It is well printed , artistically decorated , illustrated in etchings and photogravures , and seems to be of rather varied interest , containing articles ranging from '' The Future of Marriage '' and '' The Sanctity of the
Eccen	PERSON	- tric '' to `` The Woodcuts of Ellen Thesleff '' and ''
Pavlova	PERSON	and the Spirit of Dancing . ''

		Messrs.
Duffield & Company	ORGANIZATION	's list of books for the autumn includes '' Chantecler '' in English ;
H. G. Wells	PERSON	's '' The New Machiavelli '' ;
Marguerite Bryant	PERSON	's ''
Anna Kemburn	PERSON	, Truthseeker '' ;

Sharp	PERSON	's `` Memoir of William Sharp '' ;
Esther Singleton	PERSON	's `` Furniture '' ; `` Heroic
Spain	LOCATION	, '' by
E. Boyle O'Reilly	PERSON	; `` Sketches and Snap - shots , '' by the Right Hon.
G. W. E. Russell	PERSON	;
Christian Tearle	ORGANIZATION	's `` Rambles with an American '' ; `` Socialism Past and Present , '' by
G. R. S. Taylor	PERSON	and others .

		The handsome new '' Memorial Edition '' of Mere - dith , published by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	, has now fourteen volumes to its credit , comprising the following titles : '' The Shaving of Shagpat , '' '' The Ordeal of
Richard Feverell	PERSON	, '' ``
Rhoda Fleming	PERSON	, '' ``
Evan Harrington	PERSON	, '' ``
Sandra Belloni	PERSON	, '' ''
Vittoria	PERSON	, '' `` The Adventures of
Harry Richmond	PERSON	, '' ''
Beauchamp	PERSON	's Career , '' and '' The Egoist . ''

		Each of the last five titles mentioned com - prises two volumes .

		A special feature of this edition will be found in the illustrations , which consist of photogravure reproductions of the author 's portraits , homes , and the scenes associated with his novels .

		Dr.
Johann David Schoepf	PERSON	's '' Reise durch einige der mittlern und siidlichen vereinigten nordamericanischen Staaten , 1783-84 , '' translated by Mr.
Alfred J. Morri	PERSON	- son , is announced for early publication .

		Dr.
Schoepf	PERSON	was a surgeon in the German division of the British army , who , on coming to this country , set out from
New York	LOCATION	and spent ten months in the examination of the coast states as far south as
St. Augustine	LOCATION	.

		He was a trained observer , and did much good work in the study of North American geology , materia medica , fishes , and meteorology .

		As a contribution to the his - tory of the Confederation , his forthcoming work is un - doubtedly of value .

		Among the
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	announcements of books for the coming season are the following : `` John Win - terbourne 's Family , '' by
Alice Brown	PERSON	; '' A Man 's Man , '' by
Ian Hay	PERSON	; `` The Meddlings of Eve , '' by

		97 OUR LITERARY LOVES AND HATES .

		To have any positive literary likings and dislikings at all , is a gain which often is rated at its real worth only after years of fancied or outwardly-imposed literary tastes and distastes .

		To have read '' Paradise Lost '' three times , and to be able to tell why it is numbered among the masterpieces of the world 's literature , is good as far as it goes , and it may go far toward refin - ing the taste and making it impossible to en - joy unreservedly a metrical performance like '' Lucile '' ; but it need not mean that one heart - ily and spontaneously revels in the grandeurs and sublimities of
Milton	LOCATION	's epic .

		The proudly acknowledged favorites of those young readers who are something better than frivolous readers , or readers of cheap sensationalism , are and must be , as a rule , the books they have been taught to believe they ought to like , not necessarily the books they voluntarily choose out of a whole library .

		What then is the sense of dismay and confusion with which the adult reader one day discovers that what he has always supposed he had a real preference for is after all far from being what he instinctively and temperament - ally craves , and what he now recognizes as his proper literary pabulum !

		The mingled aston - ishment and self-reproach and sense of enlarge - ment at so astounding a revelation to oneself of one 's previous conscientious dishonesty -LRB- for such it really is -RRB- bear a close resemblance to those feelings of combined remorse and freedom with which one at last discovers if he belong not to the class of those who never attain to the power and privilege of thinking for themselves how small a hold on his inmost convictions some of the traditionally-held tenets of his relig - ious faith actually have .

		That there is not , as we had supposed , one and only one road to sal - vation , either intellectual or spiritual , for the whole world , is at first a disconcerting but after - ward a more and more exhilarating discovery .

		We too it dawns upon us help to determine what books shall be profitable for edification and shall survive the literary deluge .

		Even our weak hands aid in building the ark whence shall step forth on some distant Ararat the authors chosen out for rescue from a speedy ob - 80 THE DIAL livion and for the future guidance and uplift of the race .

		But beyond the fact that readers as a whole decide the fate of writers , and that certain gen - eral kinds of books are , and so far as we can see always must be , esteemed superior , and Ttuiii other kinds inferior , there is world-wit It - room for difference of opinion in the judgment of literature , and there are boundless possibi - lities of unforeseen developments in both the taste > of readers ami the ju-oduetions of writers .

		The only thing to be counted on with certainty is that the unexpected will surely happen with refreshing frequency on both sides .

		The curiosities of individual taste that tend to puzzle the philosopher would form a list long enough to circle the globe .

		Why , for example , should the sane and sensible
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, of vast reading and of unusual powers as a writer of solid and enduring books , have revelled in
Richardson	PERSON	's pitilessly spun-out essays in didac - tic sentimental ism ' . ' ''


Clarissa Harlowe	PERSON	, '' he told
Charles Greville	PERSON	, he could almost restore if it were lost , which is far more staggering than his reputed ability to reproduce Paradise Lost . ''

		Even bluff old
Johnson	PERSON	, the uncom - promising foe to all namby-pambyism , and known to have acknowledged to
Boswell	PERSON	that '' you would hang yourself from impatience '' if you read
Richardson	PERSON	for the story , held his novels in high esteem and commended their author as the first to teach the passions to move at the command of virtue .

		Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu	PERSON	, who declared that
Richardson	PERSON	knew nothing of the manners of good society , could not help weeping `` like a milkmaid '' over ''
Clarissa	PERSON	. ''

		A certain Dutch minister ,
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	tells us , even went so far as to main - tain that parts of this novel , if found in the
Bible	LOCATION	, would be '' pointed out as manifest proofs of divine inspiration '' ; and
Rousseau	PERSON	, in a letter to d'Alembert , avows that there is in no language a romance equal to or approaching `` Clarissa . ''

		But any robustness of appetite on
Rousseau	PERSON	's part for sentimental mush served in quart bowls need not greatly astonish one .

		In fact , there is in one sense nothing surprising in the admiration professed by any of these per - sons for the frothy sentiment of
Richardson	PERSON	: it was less a case of individual bias of judgment than of yielding to a prevalent frenzy like the tulip craze that once swept over
Holland	LOCATION	, or the mania for monstrous hats that now pos - OMCO the women of two continents .

		In Mr.
John Graham Brooks	PERSON	's recent excel - lent biography of
William Henry Baldwin	PERSON	, .

		Jr. .

		there is printed a part of a letter from
Baldwin	PERSON	to an intimate friend , in which the writer speak * affectionately of his small library < > f fan-fully selected volumes , all fondly read and re-read , and clung to in preference to any later or less trustworthy candidates for his favor ; and among the few he mentions by name is ''
Marius	PERSON	, '' as in need of a new binding .

		Assuming ``
Mariu	PERSON	- the Epicurean '' to have been meant , we ask ourselves why this manager of railroads and active director in many great business corjxmi - tions , this social reformer and trustee of Tu - kegee , this friend of the negro and worker for the uplift of the poor in the South , this broad - minded and large-hearted philanthropist whom the oppression of the Jews in
Russia	LOCATION	and the mas - sacre of the Christians in
Armenia	LOCATION	alike moved with wrath and pity , why should he , of all men , go to
Walter Pater	PERSON	, the secluded aesthete , the Aristippus of
Oxford	LOCATION	, the coiner of exquisite phrases , for spiritual or intellectual sustenance ?

		What could there possibly have been in com - mon between the minutely painstaking , the all but pedantic , author of ``
Marius	PERSON	, '' fashioning and re-fashioning his periods with the laborious nicety of a mediaeval monk illuminating a pre - cious manuscript , and the executive head of large undertakings in the modern world of affairs ' It is a clear case of the attraction of opposite - , , and is capable of no more logical explanation .

		But in the very unaccountability of our literal \ likings lies the strongest proof of their genuine - ness .

		The things that are real in this world have a way of l > eing inexplicable , or ultimate .

		What rests on a reason needs still another reason to support the first , and so on in infinite regression .

		But with all this arbitrariness of individ - ual choice there are , fortunately , some general bounds set to the play of whim and caprice in the selection of books .

		Otherwise the pub - lisher 's business would be an even more ha / ardous enterprise than it is , and the conduct of public libraries to the general contentment of the average reader would be rendered far more difficult .

		The mental and moral atmosphere of any particular period is the atmosphere breathed , perforce , by all who live at that time .

		Our standards of taste are , far more than \ ve like to admit , determined for us , and it would be extremely difficult if not impossible for any one of us to develop a consuming passion for Paphlagonian poetry or for Tishbite drama when no one else in the world was similarly moved .

		Almost equally difficult , it is true , do some aggressively independent persons find it
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 81 to acknowledge a liking perhaps even to feel it for what all the rest of the world happens just then to be reading and praising .

		And so we demand , in degrees varying with each indi - vidual , some friendly approval of our literary loves , some cordial endorsement of our literary hates , inasmuch as we are all human ; and also we occasionally welcome from others some measure of disapproval and some inability to sympathize and understand , in order that we may thereby flatteringly persuade ourselves of our own marked individuality and intellectual superiority .

		But here we seem to be approaching the region of psychology , whose deep waters do not invite our present sounding .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A KEAL `` FIND '' BY A PUBLISHER 'S READER is an event so rare , as has been said by one of our genial literary essayists perhaps
Curtis	PERSON	or
Howells	LOCATION	, or someone who knew whereof he spoke that when the patient literary purveyor discovers such a treasure among the reams of uncompellatory manuscripts through which he plods his weary way , he is so elated that he goes about clapping his friends on the shoulder and inviting them to take a drink with him in celebration of his luck .

		Some such spiritual exhilaration would have been pardonable , we fancy , to the reader for
Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Company	ORGANIZATION	when the manuscript of `` Enchanted Ground '' swam into his ken .

		The joyous event must have diffused an atmosphere of cheer through the sedate establishment on Park Street , and brought prosperity to the more hilarious centres of culture variously located on
Tremont Street	ORGANIZATION	and
Beacon Hill	LOCATION	.

		And now the book is issued , and the public become sharers in the joy , not necessarily to celebrate its advent with libations , but to delight in it and go about telling their story - loving friends how good it is .

		For that it will be a favorite seems to us a safe prediction .

		It has freshness , novelty , delicate fancy , and sparkling humor , innumerable graces of style and warm human interest of character and story that come like a grateful breeze across the arid waste of much of our contemporaneous fiction .

		The people whom we meet and never meet too often in these diverting pages are not theatrical figures from an artificial stage , but real persons from real life , the life of now and here .

		It is in
New York	LOCATION	our modern Babel that the story is laid ; the city of Power , of Ambition , but most of all the city of Youth .

		And this is a story of Youth its trials and struggles , its temptations and dangers , its triumphs and defeats ; Youth , that finds here its Enchanted Ground , where it may dream and strive but must be ever vigilant , upon which save at its peril it must never sleep .

		It is like the place of vigils of the '' Virginians of the
Valley	LOCATION	, '' where `` Still the ` Golden Horseshoe ' knights Their old Dominion keep ; Whose foes have found Enchanted Ground , But not a knight asleep . ''

		We know not if the title of this book was derived from
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	's poem , but the lines quoted might fitly have been placed on the title-page .

		It does not lessen the charm of the work to find its author , Mr.
Harry James Smith	PERSON	, a comparatively unknown writer .

		We recall a short story by him , published in a magazine a few years ago , which left a distinct impression of power and fine literary workmanship .

		He appears also as the author of '' Ame ` de'e 's Son '' on the title-page of the present volume .

		He cer - tainly is a writer of promise .

		He works in his own field , and his touch is all his own ; his style is singularly pleasing , devoid of affectation or man - nerism although we wish he had been satisfied with but one use of a word so dubious as indicible .

		But why speak of fly-specks on a fabric so finely wrought ?

		One such episode as that of the old Frenchman -LRB- a famous chef in his time -RRB- , and his wife , making a surreptitious pigeon-pie from a pet pigeon , and , after the fatigue of the achievement , calm ' y going to sleep beside the oven where the wonderful pie is burning to a cinder , alone compen - sates for the reading of the book .

		And there is no part of it which , once begun , is likely to be left unread .

		THE LEGEND OF
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	'S PROFANITY AT MONMOUTH will doubtless survive , in company with the venerable tradition of the cherry-tree incident , with the oft-repeated assertion that men and women were burned for witchcraft at Salem , with the too - good-not-to-be-true story of
Emerson 's	ORGANIZATION	and
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	's ecstatic comments on the dancing of
Fanny Elssler	ORGANIZATION	, and with countless other picturesque falsifi - cations of historic fact .

		The latest refutation of the swearing incident comes from the pen of
Marion Harland	PERSON	-LRB- in her recently-published autobiography -RRB- on the authority of a Revolutionary veteran , one
Sterling Smith	PERSON	, who was uncle to the autobiog - rapher 's grandfather .

		`` He did not swear , '' declared the old soldier vehemently . ''

		I was close behind him and I can tell you , sir , we rode fast when what should we meet running away , lickety-split from the field of battle , with the British almost at their heels , but Gen ` ral Lee and his men .

		Then , with that , says Gen ` ral
Washington	LOCATION	, speaking out loud and sharp says he , ` Gen ` ral Lee , in God 's name , what is the meaning of this ill-timed pru - dence ? ''

		: Lee 's answer , as given by
Smith	PERSON	, was this : `` I know of no one who has more of that most damnable virtue than your Excellency . ''

		And so , according to this witness , we have
Washington	LOCATION	indulging in nothing worse than a justifiable invo - cation of the Deity , and Lee garnishing his reply with a veritable swear-word .

August 16	DATE	, fifteen yean ago , delivered at
Charlottesville	LOCATION	his lecture on ''
Charles Lee	PERSON	, the Soldier of Fortune , '' and alluded therein to this
Monmouth	LOCATION	incident , one of his hearers related to him from memory , and afterward reduced to writing at his request , the testimony of another Revolutionary veteran , one Major
Jacob Morton	PERSON	, who claimed to have been within a few yards of
Washington	LOCATION	when the historic utterance was made .

		`` My God !

		General
Lee	PERSON	, what are you about ? ''

		was
Morton	PERSON	's version of the passionate speech ; and he added that when
Lee	PERSON	attempted to explain his conduct , the other , his hand lifted high as when he had first spoken , waved it angrily and cried , '' Go to the rear , sir ! ''

		Then he spurred his horse and rode rapidly forward . ''

		The whole thing occurred as quickly as I can tell it to you , '' concluded the major , who , we are assured , was a man of well-known honesty , courage , and integrity .

		Fiske 's lecture , with foot-note account of
Morton	PERSON	and his report of the incident , is contained in the first volume of his posthumous '' Essays , Historical and Literary . ''

		THE PICTURESQUE SUPERFLUITIES OF SPEECH , in any living language , are surprisingly numerous .

		By picturesque superfluities we mean those collo - quial and sometimes illogical additions that help to make a phrase or sentence more unmistakable or more emphatic in its meaning than if stripped of all but the strictly necessary elements .

		In these days of horseless vehicles by the tens of thousands , and of reckless chauffeurs at the steering-wheel , it is not astonishing that every week we read of some automobile as having `` turned turtle '' ; and recalling from the happy days of childhood the helpless aspect of a mud-turtle on its back , we gain an immediate and vivid conception of the automobile 's sorry plight .

		To turn , or to turn over , or to upset , would be strictly sufficient , and would satisfy the purist , but would not appeal so strongly to the imagina - tion .

		House and home , might and main , toil and moil , by hook or crook these are familiar exam - ples of the emphasis gained by repeating an idea in other terms .

		To stick fast , to stop short , to join together , to rise up , to sink down , to cry out , to issue forth , such instances of verbs redundantly helped out by prepositions or adverbs are innu - merable .

		It is as if the mind were not nimble enough or adaptable enough to grasp a quick suc - cession of naked statements ; some loosely fluttering rags and strings of amplification must be appended to arrest attention and facilitate assimilation .

		Is not this one reason why none of the now numerous artificial languages has made much headway in its linguistic conquest of the world ?

		It is as if the stomach were offered pure carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , and nitrogen , and told to digest them and build up thereon the bodily tissues .

		One of the more recent of these made-to-order tongues -LRB- the '' Universal '' language , we believe -RRB- has now with - drawn from the field in favor of French , its inventor perhaps p-rr-iving the hopflfsMu-ss of try - ing to foist on the world a mere skeleton of sym - bols under the name of a language .

		No more than man himself can a language , or a system of ortho - graphy , for that matter , live without '' atmosphere . ''

		THE PRESERVATION OF NEW ENGLAND ANTIQUI - TIES is to be systematically undertaken by a so - ciety just organized , with headquarters at No. 20 Beacon Street ,
Boston	LOCATION	, whose purpose is to rescue from destruction or obliteration historic dwelling - houses , famous taverns , memorable battle-fields , etc. , a museum being in contemplation for the housing of such movable material as shall be from time to time acquired .

		Civilized man differs from the savage in liaving a past and a future .

		The relics of our past have hitherto been treated with insufficient respect The
Hancock	PERSON	mansion on
Beacon Hill	LOCATION	, for example , than which no finer or historically more interesting example of colonial architecture could have been found , was torn down in
1863	DATE	partly because Governor
Hancock	PERSON	died before giving testa - mentary expression to his alleged intention of leav - ing the house to the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, and partly because the legislature sitting in
1863	DATE	was too little enlightened and liberal to authorize the purchase of the famous building when it was offered at a low valuation .

		Such blunders and omissions it is the aim of the new society to guard against in the future .

		The first number of its Bulletin is an illustrated prospectus .

		Among the score of historic old houses pictured in its pages one fails to note that oldest and not least important of famous
New England	LOCATION	homesteads , the so-called
Cradock House	ORGANIZATION	of Mt * < l - ford , which dates back to about
1634	DATE	and is still in an excellent state of preservation , thanks to certain timely repairs .

		The society invites correspondence from those desiring to join its membership , or who are otherwise interested in its work .

		EAST VICTIMS OF SUPERSTITION are commonly found among actors , artists , musicians , young lovers , and others who , whether temporarily or habitually , live much in their emotions and let their reason slumber .

		To the ardent

		The veteran dramatic critic , Mr.
George P. Goodale	PERSON	, contributes to `` The Dramatic Mir - ror '' some striking instances of actors ' superstition .


Edwin Booth	PERSON	cherished a shuddering abhorrence for the peacock 's feather , a particular hoodoo of stage-folk .

		Upon the completion of Booth 's Theatre in
New York	LOCATION	, a valued friend presented the actor - manager with a fine stuffed peacock of brilliantly iridescent tail .

		Unwilling to offend by declining the gift , Booth placed it on top of his oVsk .

		l.ut presently declared to another friend that the new playhouse was doomed .

		A few years later he walked out of its doors bankrupt in purse and void of hope all on account of that fatal peacock !

		THE DIAL 83
Robert Edeson	PERSON	, no neurasthenic victim of wanton fancies , is said to insist on carrying in his pocket , when he goes on for the opening scene in a play , a bit of the greased paint from the stick used by him in his first make-up for the professional stage .

		Mr.
Frank Mclntyre	PERSON	, the corpulent comedian , owes his confidence before the public to the presence on his person of the drawstring from the football suit he wore in `` Strongheart . ''

		We have heard in regard to a certain well-known actress that she could not be cured of her mania for picking up pins in her walks , until a mischievous friend had strewn her path with these toilet accessories from her hotel to the theatre where she was playing , thus compel - ling her to do violence to her pet superstition or to miss her engagement .

		Probably there is no one , however severely rational , but keeps some little corner of his mind for unreason to run riot in .

		Life were otherwise too desperately a thing of causes and effects , a monotonous chain of antecedents and sequences .

		, AN INDIGNANT DENIAL OF AUTHORSHIP is Sent to his American publishers by Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, who professes inability to `` understand the mental quality of the people who can suppose that I '' we quote his own words `` should deliberately write a lying preface over my own signature to a book by myself , stating in the clearest manner that I did not write it . ''

		The book in question is , of course , the much - talked-about ''
George Meek	PERSON	, Bath-Chair Man , by Himself . ''

		Absurd , preposterous , impossible , that he should have written it , declares the affronted author of '' Mr.
Polly	PERSON	'' and ''
Kipps	PERSON	'' and ''
Ann Veronica	PERSON	. '' ''


George Meek	PERSON	is a very real and inimitable human being , '' he continues , in the same tone of outraged innocence and grieved surprise , '' and I am about as capable of fabricating his work as he is of fabricating mine .

		Will you kindly make this denial public in whatever manner you think best . ''

		And meanwhile the sale of ''
George Meek	PERSON	'' goes merrily on , which may possibly soothe the perturbed feelings of the man who is not
George Meek	PERSON	.

		Why is not this the '' psychological mo - ment '' to bring out a new edition of the book with a frontispiece portrait of Mr.

		Two hundred pounds is the exact size of this tidy premium , and , like the recent prize offer of 250 from Mr.

		COMM UN 1C A TION .

		THE QUESTION OF `` IMMORAL DRAMA . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Your correspondent
M. C. A.	PERSON	, in your issue of Aug - ust 1 , argues for the essential validity of the statement , '' There is no such thing , per se , as an immoral subject for a play . ''

		It should be noted that a critic of this dictum is not required to maintain that the subject is immoral , per se , but only that it is immoral for a play .

		I should certainly hold that there is no subject which may not be discussed in a moral manner , but that it may be so discussed in a play presented to the general public does not seem to follow .

		Nobody would dispute the statement that there are substances which , per se , are unfit for human food ; is there not some analogy between our physical and intellectual pabula ?

		The dis - tinction between immorality and bad taste is perhaps not so fundamental as
M. C. A.	ORGANIZATION	maintains .

		An immoral thing is one which is contrary to prevalent customs or practices considered good .

		Literally , only acts can be immoral -LRB- remembering , however , that in this sense a thought is an act -RRB- ; certainly science and philosophy must maintain that an immoral subject is an impossibility .

		Thus , although the statement criticised and defended is in reality perfectly plain , it should have read , '' There is no subject , the representation of which in a play ne - cessarily constitutes an immoral act . ''

		The imagination of any reader should be sufficient to picture situations in which this would not be true .

		Is it immoral to offend good taste ?

		It must be remembered that all things are good or bad , moral or immoral , as in the long run they affect our thoughts and feelings .

		Surely it is illogical to argue that the offense ceases to be immoral in its nature when it affects them immediately and directly .

		Nevertheless , there is a real distinction , based on the fact that '' good taste '' in a number of matters is not universal .

		When I say a thing is immoral , without qualification , it is generally understood that it is contrary to established good custom .

		When I say it is in bad taste , I may be taking the liberty of assuming that my personal taste is a valid standard to go by , and am rarely supposed to be assum - ing that the offended '' taste '' is even nearly universal .

		On the contrary , while everyone claims to possess '' good taste , '' all admit that it is very rare .

		It is be - cause of this that I am not at liberty roundly to declare plays `` immoral '' because I detest them ; but 1 may nevertheless conclude , after due meditation , that plays which I detest have an injurious effect on those who like them , and are , broadly and ultimately , subversive of the great established good purposes and ends of society .

		When I am convinced of this , I call them immoral , and thank my '' good taste '' for leading me to see the light .

		84 THE -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, `` CHANTECLER '' IN ENGLISH .


M. Rostand	PERSON	's `` Chantecler '' has been `` done into English / ' and is now to be had complete in book form .

		It is a prose translation , made by Miss
Gertrude Hall	PERSON	.

		The question of an English version has been much discussed , and it must be confessed that the possibility of an adequate one is by no means proved even now .

		If '' Chantecler '' were primarily gallina - ceous , our idom might assimilate him ; but he is first of all Gallic , and he must , in spite of the translators , remain essentially Gallic to the end .

		As the national bird of
France	LOCATION	, his naturaliza - tion among us is about as problematic as that of the lion and the unicorn '' in the old song ; and a single glance at the dumpy hang-tailed rooster , depressingly realistic , on the cover-page of a popular magazine , destroys all idea of his equivalence to the rooster rampant of the French louis rf ` or , cocksure and splendid , with swelling throat and proudly flaunting tail .

		Yes , il y a une difference . ''

		Cockadoodledoo '' has but a hint of the clarion ring of the French `` cocortco '' ; we have no fabliaux or traditions of military glory to exalt and magnify the figure of the humble guardian of the poultry-yard , and our gold-pieces , unlike the French ones , bear a bird quite different from a crowing chanticleer .

		The mere idea of a barn-yard drama , therefore , impresses many of us a * ridiculous There is little to excite the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	imagination in this unnatural apotheosis of the ruler of the roost .

		It is , indeed , more than likely that , except for some fugacious curiosity , this is the real Amer - ican attitude toward
Rostand	PERSON	's classic drama .

		The critic may talk as he please , the student and cosmopolite cry foul play , but the fact re - mains that national prejudices are untrans - latable .

		Besides , it is extremely doubtful if domestic animals can be domesticated on the American stage .

		In general , we have no deep fellow-feeling for the animals , in spite of the success of the immortal
Peter	PERSON	the Monk in dramatic vaudeville .

		Of course ,
Rostand	PERSON	's characters are not , aufond , animals .

		His psy - chology and his use of the emotions are abso - lutely human , since his characters are men disguised two-legged animals with feathers , contravening the Aristotelian definition !

		But
Aristotle	PERSON	and the question of
Rostand	PERSON	's CHAKTKCUIB .

		By
Edmond Rostand	PERSON	.

		Translated by
Gertrude Hall	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Duffield A Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		ornithological orthodoxy will take us too far afield .

		Let us get back to '' Chantecler . ''

		We had been led to believe , all along , that this trans - lation would be in verse ; not in alexandrines perhaps , but in appropriate pendecasyllabics .

		That was our dream of an English translation of '' Chantecler , '' and the prosaic reality of the outcome is a disappointment .

		Yet Miss Hall has given us admirable verse translations of the French poets , and the charm and faithfulness of her versions of
Verlaine	PERSON	make one regret that she neglected the opportunity afforded by
Rostand	PERSON	's '' Prologue '' and the much-belauded `` Hymn to the Sun . ''

		The prologue-poem , a veritable lyrical overture , strikes the keynote for the whole play ; and its rendition into prose , with over six stanzas omitted , is the first sacri - fice made to the pedestrian muse .

		After the Prologue they follow thick and fast : onomato - poetic effects , puns -LRB- not all translatable , to be sure -RRB- , bits of dialogue , etc. .

		Of course it was to be expected that liberties would be taken with the French ; but if they are taken , the retention of the graceful lightness of the orig - inal should ever be the end in view , and it must be admitted that parts of this translation re - mind one too strongly of the incorrect correct - ness of the classroom .

		On the other hand , many of the puns are imitated in the English , often with considerable ingenuity , and the gen - eral faithfulness of the work is worthy of high praise .

		One lays down the volume , however , with a definite conviction of the impossibility of trans - lating
Rostand	PERSON	.

		`` Chantecler '' in English is not '' Chantecler '' at all ; nor could it ever be .

		The outlines , the colors , may be copied well enough , but the life , the spirit , the esprit which give to the original its light and fragile grace , are not to be recaptured in another tongue .

		One could instance a hundred untranslatable lines .

		It is a pity but '' Chantecler '' in English can never be more than a colored photograph , a tissue-paper butterfly .

		We are afraid there is no help for it : we must brush up our rusty French if we are to enjoy '' Chante - cler . ''

		Fortified with patience plus a dic - tionnaire d'argot , we can easily get into the spirit of the original , and in the French we shall find that '' Chantecler '' has both rhyme and reason .

		We may miss some of the puns , of course , but in the sum total of
Rostand	PERSON	's too abundant wit we may well lose them .

		We shall lose none of the onomatopoetic beauty of the French ; we shall miss none of the poetry ; nay , we may get from the play more than if we saw

		85 it on the stage .

		Reports from
France	LOCATION	tell of many disappointed spectators , and , indeed , to one who has read the play in the French it is evident that actors short of the very best could hai ` dly fail to spoil it .

		With
Guitry	PERSON	himself in the title role , did not
Paris	LOCATION	regret the exuberance of Coquelin ?

		Let us , then , keep away from the theatre and read '' Chantecler , '' if we can , in the original .

		Inferior to '' Cyrano '' as a drama , it is perhaps equal to it as a dramatic poem ; and the second act , with its exquisite picture of the sunrise , has a lyrical breadth and sweep that
Rostand	PERSON	has never surpassed .

		The poem has a moral , too , which we shall not discuss , save to say that the splendid courage of the disillusioned hero is a keynote of the French character which
Anatole France	PERSON	, with his deterministic pessimism , some - times makes us forget .

		Read `` Chantecler . ''

		With all its excess of technique , with all its stren - uous virtuosity , it teaches a lesson of strenuous virtue .

		A VOLUME OF UISTKETICESTT MEMOIRS .

		* Princess
Helene von Racowitza	PERSON	, who served
George Meredith	PERSON	as a model for his heroine in '' The Tragic Comedians , '' offers her autobiog - raphy to the world with the prefatory warning that it is not intended for `` timid souls or conventional thinkers , nor for those who are prudishly inclined or narrow-minded . ''

		Her reminiscences of a brilliant and rather tempestu - ous life have been written , it appears , `` for eman - cipated people for those independent souls who , having reached the pinnacle which stands above all conventions , look forward to the time when each one will be free to form his own life according to his individuality , untrammelled by social or family prejudices . ''

		That she has written with freedom and frankness , her pages leave no room for doubt ; and while some of her disclosures might well have been reserved for her father-confessor , that thought seems not to have occurred to this broad-minded and inde - pendent lady .

		Certainly the story of her life reads like fiction , and may be of interest not only to those who knew her while she was in this country , but to all who enjoy a volume of sprightly memoirs .

		Translated from the German by

New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Swedish-Norwegian one , directly descended from the Vikings , with the fiercest of Norse blood in their veins ; her mother belonged to one of the old and highly cultured Jewish families in
Berlin	LOCATION	, whose members during the eighteenth century gave to the world poets and philosophers such as the Ashers , Mendelssohns , Beers , and even
Heinrich Heine	PERSON	.

		During
Helene	PERSON	's childhood they lived in
Munich	LOCATION	, where their salon was the resort of eminent men and women , poets , artists , scholars , and of those then known in
Berlin	LOCATION	as the '' ^ Esthetes . ''

		Helene 's vivid temperament seems to have asserted itself even at this early period , accord - ing to an incident she relates of herself which occurred before she was a year old , while her parents were staying with the Crown Prince and Princess of
Bavaria	LOCATION	.

		One morning her mother left her in the castle garden in care of a nurse whose blithe dismissal of responsibility left
Helene	PERSON	quite alone , crying broken-heartedly .

		The young crown princess , hearing the cries , hurried in their direction , and discovered the child lying face downward on the grass .

		On being carried to her mother , she shook the baby 's fist at
Madame Donnige	ORGANIZATION	, saying '' Little
Helene	PERSON	must not be deserted like this ; she is born to be loved , and will cry herself to death if she is left alone '' a commentary which was not without significance during the events of her later life .

		Heleiie 's early education included little that was conducive to ideals of a moral or religious nature .

		The atmosphere in which she lived she describes as that of an eighteenth-century novel : '' I never remember that anything in our house was considered reprehensible except ' bad manners , ' awkward speech or intonation , all and sundry that jarred upon the sense of beauty .

		In my father 's as well as my mother 's family there was an absolutely fanatical love of beauty ... Morals were of secondary consid - eration , although lying was strictly forbidden . ''

		At the age of twelve she was taken to private balls , and from that time on was made love to '' officially , '' as she puts it .

		In describing the impression she made at that time , she quotes from
Baron Voldendroff	PERSON	, who thus speaks of her in his `` Remembrances of an Old Miinchner '' : '' I entered the blue drawing-room , but rny feet were arrested on the threshold by a wonderful picture .

		The sun 's rays fell on the figure of a young girl who sat in the window niche a girl of such extraordinary beauty that I instinctively held ray breath in order not to dis - turb this creature out of a fairy tale .

		Dainty and win - some as a fairy , with sharply cut profile , in which the slightly aquiline nose and the finely drawn mouth were THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, conspicuous , she sat or rather reclined in the chair , her little head drawn back , as if by the weight of the glori - ous golden hair ; her eyes were bent dreamily on the distance .

		And what eyes !

		Later on I often looked into them , but do not know yet what colour they are , whether grey , blue , or green .

		They continually changed colour ; sometimes they wore the most gentle dove-like expression , sometimes particularly when the heavy lids half hid them as if in fatigue they
Hamed	PERSON	like eyes of a beast of prey .

		... At the noise of the clos - ing door , she turned her head towards me and said with the greatest aplomb , < Mamma is not here , but she will come directly , do sit down . '

		I mentioned my name , upon which she made a graceful bow , and I greeted her with the words , ' I suppose you are the
Helene	PERSON	we have been expecting from
Berlin	LOCATION	? '

		Quite right , ' was the reply ; and thus I beheld for the first time the enchantress
Helene	PERSON	, who in later years was so passionately beloved and so bitterly reviled . ''

		It was soon after this that her mother forced her into an engagement with a profligate Italian , whose suit , thanks to her kindly and clever grandmother , did not prosper .

		Once rid of the odious Italian , however , it was not long before she entered upon her first real love-affair , to which she abandoned herself so intensely that
Baron von Kotzebue	PERSON	said of it later : I have witnessed three elemental forces in my life .

		I have been in a typhoon ; I have seen one of the greatest volcanic eruptions of this century ; and I was a spectator of
Helene von Donnige	PERSON	's first love . ''

		Unable to obtain her parents ' consent to a marriage with the charming Russian officer , she spent a winter with her grandmother in
Berlin	LOCATION	, where , while calling upon the heavens for a Southerner with hot blood in his veins , '' she met
Yanko von Racowitza	PERSON	, her dream of a dark fairy prince her '' Moorish page , '' as she often called him .

		He it was who later shot Lassalle , and whom
Helene	PERSON	afterward married regard - ing him as Lassalle 's '' innocent murderer . ''

		On the eve of her promise to
Yanko	PERSON	to marry him if she did not find some one whom she could love far better , and if she did not go on the stage , '' she met Lassalle for the first time ; and as the principal interest in her life attaches to her relationship with the French revolutionist , it is not amiss to quote her descrip - tion of the event which had such tragic conse - quences .

		She was in a friend 's drawing-room , sitting in the background that she might listen to the great man before meeting him .

		`` The folding doors opened , and two gentlemen stepped with the host into the lighted drawing-room .

		I do not know why , but having heard continually of Lassalle 's mind and erudition , I had imagined him to be a little man with strongly marked Jewish feature * .

		As a matter of fact I had not thought much about his personal appearance , and one of the men was exactly as I have described .

		With him entered a tall figure with a Cfesar-like head and expression .

		It never en - tered my head that this could be I ^ assalle the little Jew must be he !

		Clever men are ugly ; but the tall , im - posing one began to speak , and I forgot all else .

		I could only listen and listen , and at hut , in a Hash , I realized that it mus < be he and no other .

		Everyone in tin - room listened spellbound to his conversation , \ s liu-h was stormy and powerful , sweeping over everything 1 had hitherto considered as unalterable and sacred .

		... 1 listened entranced , enthusiastic , but nevertheless not agreeing with everything he was saying Suddenly I sprang up , and forgetting that this man had never seen me , I inter - rupted him by exclaiming , ' No !

		1 do not agree with you there . '

		For one moment he stopped ; the eagle glance of his commanding blue eyes was directed upon me , then a smile crept over his classic features , and stepping up to me he said softly , ' Ho , ho !

		so this is what she looks like !

		I thought so !

		That 's all right .

		And ' laughing heartily ' No is the first word I hear spoken by this mortal ? '

		It was all over .

		In that very first moment he could have said that which he did a little later : We both knew that we had met our destiny in each other . '

		The people around us were for - gotten ... We remained together the whole evening .

		When at last my relations got up to leave ,
Lassalle	PERSON	came out into the hall with me , wrapped me up care - fully in my cloak , and , impatient at the long farewells in the drawing-room , opened the door of the flat , lifted me high in his arms , and carried me down stairs .

		No protest was made by me at such an absolutely incredible proceeding .

		It all seemed to me so natural , so much a matter of course ... and when we arrived at my own door he said to me , Tomorrow I am coming to grand - mamma to get her consent ! ''

		The subsequent story of their engagement is well known ,
Helene	PERSON	's failure to obtain the consent of her parents , their shameful mistreat - ment of her in their effort to break off the match , the consequent misunderstandings and loss of faith which culminated in the duel be - tween Lassalle and
Yanko	PERSON	. ''

		Now followed in my life months of sorrow beyond description .

		To be obliged to remain with my detested parents and to see no deliverance but in a marriage with the man who , even although he had not wished it , was still the murderer of Ferdinand ... Can one imagine a more terrible situation ?

		The apathy I have already mentioned had taken possession of me and pro- tected me during the earlier time from some desperate act .

		Poor
Yanko	PERSON	surrounded me with such tender care , lamented and wept so bitterly with me over my fate that at last I pitied him even more than I did myself .

		In my eyes I have said it thousands of times , and can only repeat it again and again the murderer of Los - salle was not
Yanko	PERSON	, but my father .

		Yanko had been forced into the appalling situation .

		They had bewil - dered his not too keen understanding with false notions of honor : persuaded him he must take my father 's place and save my honor , which had been tarnished 1 > \ Lassalle and the countess .

		In short , they had forced the weapon into his hand with which he , without wish - ing it -LRB- that I can swear before God and everything I hold sacred -RRB- , had killed the man for whose sake he had really meant to sacrifice himself . ''

		After their marriage ,
Yanko	PERSON	lived only a short time ; and
Madame Helene	PERSON	came to

Serge von Schewitech	PERSON	, with whom she

Herrick	PERSON	and Swift seems at first sight preposterous , so radi - cal are the differences in their characters and works ; but one can hardly read through Pro- fessor
Moorman	PERSON	's interesting study of
Herrick	ORGANIZATION	without observing striking similarities in his career to some in
Swift	ORGANIZATION	's .

		Both were early left to the care of an uncle for support , one losing his father shortly after , the other before , birth ; both found
London	LOCATION	their most congenial abode , and both accepted ecclesiastical appointment away from
London	LOCATION	; both liked their rustic par - ishioners none too well , and uttered their discon - tent at their necessary retirement in bitter words ; both regarded less the sanctities of their profession than the cakes and ale of the joyous secular world ; both wrote some verses more remarkable for their trenchancy of sentiment than for their delicacy of expression .

		But in their characteristic literary work they are the poles asunder : one is the sweetest singer of the
Caroline	PERSON	lyrists ; the other is the most vitriolic of the prose satirists of the reign of

London	LOCATION	, after graduation , he apparently dropped the law and became , what was much more congenial , the music at the '' lyric feasts , Made at the Sun , The Dog , the Triple Tun , '' and dedicated verses to '' Saint
Ben	PERSON	, to aid me . ''

		Here he had many mistresses to inspire his verse , but they seem to have been mainly poetic , whether they are known as '' stately
Julia	PERSON	, prime of all , '' or as the more matter-of-fact
Mistress Elizabeth Wheeler	PERSON	.

		He chose rather to '' follow the primrose path ' of dalliance , '' enjoying to the full the pleasures of
London	LOCATION	, and taking no thought of the morrow . ''

		I fear no earthly powers , But care for crowns of flowers ; And love to have my beard With wine and oil besmeared .

		This day I '11 drown all sorrow ; Who knows to live to-morrow ? ''

		But the morrow brought with it unexpected change , and in
1629	DATE	Herrick became vicar of Dean Prior in
Devonshire	LOCATION	.

		The thought of his new life inspired him to indite his verses bid - ding farewell to poetry and to the jolly company of
Ben Jonson	PERSON	and his fellows in their
London	LOCATION	tavern .

		His new life was the cure of souls , not the music at the feast .

		But this life was not so dull and dismal as it seemed to him then and has seemed to many readers of his poems .

		Professor
Moorman	PERSON	shows that his verses expressing his dislike for Dean Prior and his parishioners belong to the later years of his stay there , when his Cromwellian flock were in strong opposition to him as their royalist vicar and were of course prevailing .

		It was then that he broke out into diatribes against them as '' A people currish , churlish as the seas , And rude almost as rudest savages ; '' and of the place thus : '' Search worlds of ice , and rather there Dwell than in loathed Devonshire . ''

		That he sang of '' May-poles , hock-carts , wassails , wakes , '' as charmingly as he did of
Julia	PERSON	and the liquefaction of her clothes , shows that he found pleasure in life , even though it was not in
London	LOCATION	.

		And his relations with his people were on the whole pleasant , even though it is recorded on doubtful authority that he one time threw his sermon at his congregation , with a curse for their inattention .

		We like to think of his happy relations with
Prudence Baldwin	PERSON	, his faithful housekeeper , and to believe on quite 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, insufficient evidence that be kept a pet pig , which he taught to drink out of a tankard , and to know that some of his '' Noble Numbers '' were handed down for one hundred and fifty years by oral tradition in the place where he ministered .

		At the end of eighteen years he went back to
London	LOCATION	, in
1647	DATE	, as one of the 44 on ted '' clergy , who refused to subscribe to the
Solemn League	ORGANIZATION	and Covenant .

		What else he did in
London	LOCATION	besides publish his Hesperides '' and 44 Noble Numbers , '' we do not know in any detail ; we do know that he returned to Dean Prior in
1662	DATE	and that he died in
1674	DATE	.

		The second part of Professor
Moorman	PERSON	's work is a critical study of
Herrick	ORGANIZATION	's poetry , the lyr - ical and non-lyrical poems of the 4t Hesperides '' and the '' Noble Numbers , '' and a discussion of the relation of the Elizabethan to the
Caroline	PERSON	lyric .

		Professors Schelliug and
Wendell	PERSON	hold that the latter shows signs of degeneration in its evolution from the former ; Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	saw in the work of
Herrick	PERSON	the culminating glory of the lyric in this continuous period .

		Professor
Moorman	PERSON	maintains that the differ - ence is one of kind rather than of degree , and to prove his contention he outlines the develop - ment of this form in its various manifestations .

		There is the native product that reached its culmination in the matchless songs of the Shakespearean plays ; there are the madrigals that came in under Italian influence , and the sonnets that were introduced by
Wyatt	PERSON	and
Surrey	LOCATION	, both kinds in the main art-lyrics that lack the spontaneity of the native songs ; and there are the verses of the 44 Miscellanies '' which glow with the
Italy	LOCATION	of the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	, and of which we have a famous example in
Marlowe	ORGANIZATION	's exquisite 44 Come live with me and be my love . ''

		This poetry is that of a nation in the first glory of adolescence , whose move - ments have an indefinable rhythmic grace , and whose outlook upon the world is untroubled by care or misgiving .

		It is a lyric which re - creates for us the golden age long dreamed of by the poets of antiquity . ''

		But this lyric is rarely intense , individual ; it does not reveal the recesses of the poet 's soul .

		The
Caroline	PERSON	poets , on the other hand , do reveal personality ; and the first of them ,
Donne	PERSON	, lays bare his soul in every line he writes .

		For him his verse is the 44 cry of an intense and passion-swept soul . ''

		Thus , as the lyric became more subjective , it became more and more formally excellent , more and more a work of art .

		And the great agents in achieving this result were
Ben Jonson	PERSON	, and through him the Greek and Latin poets ,
Anacreon	LOCATION	,
Catullus	LOCATION	, and
Horace	PERSON	.

		The conclu - sion is therefore that , though there may IK ?

		a 44 loss of spontaneity , tunefulness , and at times of idyllic beauty , there is an immense gain in all that pertains to art .

		A sense of form and of structure manifests itself ; and the lyric , sacrificing romantic charms , wins instead a cer - tain classic grace ... The seventeenth cent M r \ brought to lyric poetry the sense of individual - ity , the personal note , the lyrical cry of a human soul amid its pleasures and its pains .

		its hopes and its fears . ''

		And of the seventeenth century lyrists , Her - rick was the greatest .

		He had
Jonson	PERSON	's classi - cism without his pedantry ; he becomes so much a pagan at times that we have to stop and reflect that he was a clergyman of the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	.

		His anacreontics are as good as , and in his noble flights better than ,
Anacreon 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lowell has called
Herrick	PERSON	the 44 most Catullian of poets since Catullus , '' and in many respects this is true , though as a love poet he is far in - ferior to the Latin singer , since he never knew the pain that pierced the heart of Catullus .

		44 By thine own tears thy song must tears beget . ''

		Perhaps more than to any other ,
Herrick	PERSON	's sym - pathies went out to
Horace	PERSON	, both in respect to his philosophy of life and a kinship of tastes , and in their , fine confidence in the immortality of their work .

		Among his contemporaries ,
Donne	PERSON	, and still more
Jonson	PERSON	, influenced him ; and yet to both he rises superior both in range of subject and in delicacy of touch .

		May we agree , therefore , with Professor
Moorman	PERSON	, and regard
Herrick	PERSON	, the leading lyrist of the
Caroline	PERSON	poets , as different only in kind and not in degree from the Elizabethans ?

		His poetry is individual , personal ; he has brought the lyric to an artistic excellence which undoubtedly surpasses anything attained by the earlier poets .

		But this very excellence is one of the marks of decadence , when it is not accompanied by intense feeling .

		And
Herrick	PERSON	did not love deeply ; he did not drink the cup of life to the lees , whether the draught was of joy or pain , and in his verse we do not get that intense cry that marks the supremest lyric utter - He has no love-song of such poignant ance .

		regret as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's `` Take , O take those lips away . ''

		His purely religious poems are singularly unemotional , and only the pagan ones in a Christian guise are poetic * .

		1 1 is litany to the
Holy Spirit	ORGANIZATION	is more playful than religious , and he can naively invite God to look upon his poems and assure Him that He will '' take no tincture from my impure book . ''

		This playing
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 89 with emotions comes perilously near insincerity ; and it , along with the absence of any soul - stirring emotion , marks the waning of the `` golden
summer	DATE	of the English lyric , '' as Pro- fessor
Schelling	PERSON	says .

		Yet the waning is beau - tiful , for it was that of the most rapturous period in our literature , when the world was still young and men had not lost all their illusions .

		So it is that '' in holiday mood , we turn to the ' Hesperides , ' and find refreshment of soul in the contemplation of an age that knew little of misgiving or disillusionment , and of a poet in whom , beneath the garb of an Anglican clergy - man , there beat the heart of a votary of Apollo , ' for ever piping songs for ever new , ' and bidding us gather rosebuds while we may in the bowered glades of Arcady .

		LAKE GEORGE AXD LAKE CHAMPLAENT .

		* From that memorable day in
July , 1609	DATE	, when Champlain with his party of Algonquin warriors defeated the Mohawks , two centuries of conflict have been waged about the beautiful shores of the lake that bears his name .


Lake Champlain	LOCATION	and
Lake George	LOCATION	stood on the main thoroughfare between the French and English colonies , which was also the war road of the Iroquois .

		From
1609	DATE	to
1814	DATE	, men struggled for their possession : at first the Indian and the French , then the French and British , finally the British and American .

		A century of peaceful occupation followed , and in
1909	DATE	the descend - ants of the warring nations came together on this historic spot to celebrate the tercentenary of its original discovery .

		As in the case of the similar celebrations at
Quebec	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, the
Lake Champlain Tercentenary	LOCATION	has given birth to a considerable body of special literature which , if not particularly original or historically important , at least serves to keep alive popular interest in the subject .

		To this literary aftermath of the
Lake Cham	LOCATION	- plain commemoration belongs Mr.
Max Reid	PERSON	's handsome volume on ''
Lake George	PERSON	and
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	. ''

		Starting with that sturdy ex - plorer and colonizer ,
Samuel Champlain	PERSON	, he traces the story of the lakes through three centuries of discovery , warfare , and peaceful development .

		A chapter is devoted to discus - sing the probable site of
Champlain	LOCATION	's battle with the Mohawks in
1609	DATE	, the author making * LAKE GEORGE AND LAKK CHAMPLAIN .

		copious quotations from an interesting mono - graph by Dr.
George F. Bixby	PERSON	, tending to show that Crown Point , rather than
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	, was the scene of the conflict .

		In later chapters he summarizes the early history of the Mohawks , the Jesuit missions among the Iroquois , the Caughnawaga settlement on the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	, the building of Ticonderoga and its dramatic history , the connection of the lakes with the French and Indian wars , with the conquest of
Canada	LOCATION	in
1759	DATE	, with the American invasion of
1775	DATE	, and with the War of
1812	DATE	.

		Inter - spersed in the narrative are Indian legends and pioneer reminiscences bearing on the his - tory of
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	and
Lake George	LOCATION	.

		These latter form by all odds the most interest - ing , and probably the most valuable , feature of the book .

		They constitute in many cases a dis - tinct addition to our knowledge of the region , and , while far enough from historical accuracy , throw light on the men and manners of a bygone age .

		Mr.
Reid	PERSON	is at his best in telling the legend of Theretee .

		Another story , lacking the romantic charm of that of Therese , but not altogether devoid of dramatic interest , is the Iroquois legend of the mosquito .

		While per - haps not historically important , and possessing no very special bearing on the history of
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	and
Lake George	PERSON	, the subject is timely enough to bear quotation . ''

		There were , in times of old -LSB- so the legend runs -RSB- two feathered monsters , permitted by the Manitou to descend from the sky and light upon the banks of the
Seneca	LOCATION	river , near the present route of the canal , at
Montezuma	ORGANIZATION	.

		Their form was that of a mosquito , and they were so large that they darkened the sun like a cloud as they flew between it and the earth .

		Standing , the one on one side and the other opposite on the other bank , they guarded the river , and stretching their long necks into the canoes of the Indians as they attempted to paddle along the stream , gobbled them up as the stork king in the fable did the frogs .

		The destruction of life was great , for the embargo was so strictly enforced that an Indian could not pass without being devoured in the attempt .

		It was long before the monsters could be exterminated , and then only by the combined efforts of all the warriors of the
Cayuga	LOCATION	and Onondago nations of Indians .

		The battle was terrible , many warriors being slain by being transfixed with their dagger-like bills or trampled upon by their huge feet , while large war canoes were overturned and their occupants drowned , by a single blow of their ponderous wings .

		But the warriors finally triumphed , and the mammoth mosquitoes were slain .

		But sad to relate , as their huge carcases decomposed in the sun , every particle became vivified and flew off daily in myriads of clouds of mosquitoes .

		And they have filled the country ever since . ''

		It is difficult to understand why Mr.
Reid	PERSON	should have thought it necessary to pad out his book by quoting verbatim a couple of chapters 90 THE DIAL , -LSB-
August	DATE	li .

		from
Daniel Pierce Thompson	PERSON	's '' Green Moun - tain Boys . ''

		Judge
Thompson	PERSON	's style is revealed in the following sample : M The brief ceremonies of the surrender were soon over ; when , as the fortress was pronounced to be in full possession of the conquerors , the heavens were again rent by the reiterated huzzas of the Green Moun - tain Boys , while British cannon were made to peal forth with their deep-mouthed thunders , to the trembling hills and reverberating mountains of the country around , the proclamation of victory !

		the first triumph of
Young Freedom	ORGANIZATION	over the arms of her haughty oppressor . ''

		This sort of '' buncombe '' may have tickled the intellectual palates of some of our grandfathers , but scarcely appeals to a more sophisticated generation .


LAWRENCE J. BURPEE	PERSON	.

		A RUSSIAN REVOLUTIONARY ox THE FRENCH REVOLUTION .

		* The French Revolution was made up of so many diverse currents that the task of inter - preting it justly is sometimes facilitated by studying the impressions it has left upon the minds of men of widely varying convictions and temperaments .

		For example , the student who would be far from following
M. Jaures	PERSON	in his programme of social change may profit by reading his volumes on the Revolution , because their approach to many of its problems is free from the distorting effect of traditional pre - judice , and because they emphasize sympatheti - cally everything that concerned the fortunes of the common people .

		In the same way , one has a right to expect from a revolutionary like Prince
Kropotkin	PERSON	some suggestive interpreta - tions .

		To a certain extent the reader of this volume will not be disappointed .

		Prince
Kro	PERSON	- potkin has meditated upon the subject a long time .

		It is twenty-five years since he began his investigations of the peasant risings in
France	LOCATION	, with the aim of throwing light on the economic history of the Revolution .

		Although his book includes the general history of the movement , it is the economic aspects that he treats with fulness .

		One or two questions notably the disposition of the communal lands or commons , ordinarily neglected he discusses at consider - able length .

		Upon everything that touches the abolition of the feudal system he also enters into detail .

		Unfortunately , the value of his work is seriously compromised , and for some readers will be destroyed , by his failure to com - ply with the one essential condition of cogency , THE OKKAT FRENCH REVOLUTION .

		By
P. A. Kropotkin	PERSON	.

		Translated from the French by
N. F. Dryhunt	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:
O. P. Putnam	PERSON	's SoM .

		tin - use of none but proved or provable facts , ignoring idle or malicious rumors , even if they conveniently confirm fixed prepossessions .

		At the outset , one is met by swiping but questionable generalizations upon the aims of the leaders in
1789	DATE	.

		We are told that they '' meant to concentrate all governmental power in the hands of a central executive authority , strictly controlled by the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, but also strictly obeyed in the
State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		There is no hint here of that administrative anarchy , that fatal scheme of decentralization , which is the -RSB- > eculiar feature of the constitution built up by the Con - stituent assembly .

		To his imaginary consti - tution , Prince
Kropotkin	PERSON	attributes in part a sinister aim . '

		* By the side of this concentra - tion , '' he says , '' they intended to proclaim complete freedom in commercial transactions , and at the same time to give free rein to indus - trial enterprise for the exploitation of all sorts of natural wealth , as well as of the workers , who henceforth would be delivered up defence - less to any one who might employ them . ''

		He discovers all through the Revolution a settled purpose on the part of the middle class -LRB- and in this class he places the well-to-do farmers -RRB- to decide every question to ` their economic advan - tage ; in other words , to '' exploit '' the situation , to substitute themselves for the clergy and the nobility as the privileged class .

		This is the reason , he thinks , why there was such a wide - spread desire on the part of the villagers to divide the commons , instead of leaving them intact as communal property .

		Of the middle class , as well as of the nobles whom they drove from power , Prince
Kropotkin	PERSON	is ready to believe every damaging rumor , or , rather , he accepts rumors unhesitatingly , as if in such a case evidence is not required .

		Apropos of the ReVeillou riot , he repeats one of the slan - ders of the day , to the effect that Reveillon had made himself especially prominent 1 > y the bru - tality of his remarks to the poor , and had said , '' The working man can live on black bread and lentils : wheat is not for the likes of him . ''

		In order to justify the murder of Flesselles , he alludes to an apocryphal correspondence .

		Although he has
M. Flammermont	ORGANIZATION	's account of the fall of the Bastille before him , his own account contains a strange admixture of the rumors that were flying about
Paris	LOCATION	on that momentous fourteenth of
July	DATE	.

		He still be - lieves that the uprising of the city nipped in the bud a scheme of the government to dissolve the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, punish several of its leaders , and crush
Paris	LOCATION	in case of resistance , although the
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 91 existence of such a plot was disproved by
M. Caron	PERSON	two or three years ago in the Revue cTHistoire Moderne .

		He repeats the old story that
Foulon	PERSON	'' had promised to make the people of
Paris	LOCATION	eat grass '' in explanation of his cruel fate later in
July	DATE	.

		It is needless to add in - stances of the historical method illustrated in this volume .

		The case would not be serious were individual facts the only matters treated in such fashion .

		The account of feudal property is equally regard - less of evidence . ''

		Formerly , '' he remarks , '' the whole of the land meadows , woods , waste lands , and clearings had belonged to the village communities .

		The feudal lord held the right of administering justice over the inhabitants , and most of them had also the right of levying various taxes ... in exchange for which the lords were pledged to maintain armed bands for the defense of the territory . ''

		This may have been partially true of
Russia	LOCATION	, but such theories can not be transferred bodily to mediaeval
France	LOCATION	.

		Furthermore , the treat - ment of the abolition of feudalism is rendered inexact by the author 's failure to refer to the texts of the several laws in the Duvergier col - lection .

		It must be repeated that discussion , or interpretation , is possible only if the simple principles of historical evidence are treated as constant factors .

		since . ''

		Thinking that he would like to get posses - sion of the remainder of this English edition , the author discovered that he could not have it sent to him , because some of the poems were copyrighted in
America	LOCATION	, and our exasperating laws forbade the importation .

		We tell the rest of the story in Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's own words : '' Accordingly , I desired Mr.
Macmillan	PERSON	to burn the rest of the volumes or to consign them afresh to the paper-mill to serve for reincarnation of the poems in some more fortunate form .

		I asked also that fifty bound copies be sent to
America	LOCATION	.

		They were promptly stopped in the
New York	LOCATION	Custom-House .

		A book said to be copyrighted in
America	LOCATION	, printed in
England	LOCATION	, returned to
America	LOCATION	, the law forbids to enter .

		I asked what should be done with them .

		Might I buy them ?

		I could not .

		I believe it was finally concluded to cremate them .

		1 ' Truly , it is discouraging to be an American poet .

		One can not sell his poems , and one can not get possession of them to give them away !

		And Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	, as our readers well know , is a serious poet whose work fairly belongs to literature in the refined and restricted sense .

		If one were in doubt of this proposition , '' The Comfort of the Hills , and Other Poems '' would alone be enough to convince .

		It is a slender sheaf , but the grain is ripe and golden .

		We need do no more by way of evidence than quote these stanzas from the titular piece : '' The years that come as friend and leave as foe , The years that come as foes , and friends depart , Leave for remembrance more of joy than woe , All memory sifting with
Time	ORGANIZATION	's gentle art , Till He who guides the swallow 's wintry wing Gives to our grief-winged love as sure a
spring	DATE	.

		`` The mountain summit brings no bitter thought ; And in my glad surrender to its power , Familiar spirits come to me unsought , But unto thee , my child , the twilight hour , When level sun-shafts of the waning day Their girdling gold upon the forest lay . ''

		Here , long ago , we talked or silent knew The woodland awe of things about to be , And , as the nearing shadows round us drew , Some growing sense of unreality , Ancestral pagan moods of far descent That thronged the peopled woods with wonderment . ''

		Art with me now , and this thy gentle hand ?

		Or is it that love 's yearning love deceives , And in too real a solitude I stand , Hearing no footfall in the rustling leaves , Sole comrade of far sorrows , left alone The awakened memory of a dream to own . ''

		Slow fades the light of day 's most solemn hour .

		The autumn leaves are drifting overhead .

		In vain I yearn for some compelling power To keep for me these ever-living dead .

		Peace , peace , sad heart ; for thee a gentle breeze , God 's angelus , is sighing in the trees . ''

		There are not many poets living who could match these grave and lovely lines .

		This fine sonnet `` To Virgil '' is from the `` Poems of Belief '' of the Rev.
Theodore C. Williams	PERSON	, who has perhaps been more successful than any other translator in turning the '' JEneid '' into an English poem : 92 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, '' Thy
Rome	LOCATION	died many deaths .

		Her native power By alow diseases , such aa nations know When liberty ia lost , became a ahow And pageantry for slaves ; then came the hour Of outward death , aa when a withered flower Falls in a tempest ; o'er her lying low The barbarous legions in resistless flow Rained aeaa of death on temple , street , and tower . ''

		Bat than , imperial
Virgil	PERSON	, couldst not die .

		Still through strange seas thy storm-tossed Trojans fare ; Thy visions live ; thy voice is singing still .

		We wanderers in a vaster West descry New worlds , new sorrows : but true hearts that bear The sacred past , seek
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's prophetic will . ''

		This is one of a group of several sonnets of equal distinction .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	also writes stately blank verse , exemplified by such poems as '' Seneca on the Soul '' and '' Ave Roma Immortalis . ''

		But the prevailing note of his volume is religious , as the writer 's profession warrants and his title indicates .

		Sincerity of faith and loftiness of aspiration mark these religious pieces , which also have now and then a touch of mysticism .

		We may quote the Emer - sonian stanzas entitled - God in All '' : '' The flowing soul , nor low nor high , Is perfect here , is perfect there .

		Each drop in ocean orbs the sky , And seeing eyes make all things fair . ''

		The evening cloud , the wayside flower Surpass the
Andes	LOCATION	and the rose ; And wrapped in every hasty hour Is all the lengthened year bestows . '

		Therefore erase thy false degrees , From stock and stone strike starry fire .

		Lo !

		even in the least of these Dwells the
Lord Christ	LOCATION	, the world 's desire . ''

		Mr.
Lloyd Mifflin	PERSON	's '' Flower and Thorn '' gives us an even fifty of his later sonnets , chaste , medi - tative , and inspired by the passion of varied ideal - isms . ''

		The Lover 's Retrospect '' is one of the simplest and best in the collection : '' In deeps of
Elis	ORGANIZATION	, when was done the chase , Or ere she bathed , fair
Arethusa	ORGANIZATION	stood Star-like in beauty .

		In that solitude Her loveliness lit all the leafy place .

		Alpheus , seeing the soul-light of that face , Loved her , although she did his arms elude ; At last beyond the blue Sicilian flood , They rushed together in one long embrace : ' Light of my Youth !

		in days of adverse fate I saw yon standing by my life 's lone shore And passionately sought to clasp your hand ; But ah , than he I am less fortunate , Favored Alpheus !

		no Orfygian strand Shall see our currents mingle , ever more ! ''

		Form and substance are here welded into almost perfect union , and both are of the purest essence of poetry .

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	's volume of '' Harmonies '' gives us graceful and cultured verse , of which the titular piece may be taken as fairly representative : '' Strange instrument of many strings For men to play on , slaves and kings , Let me but keep thee , Life , in tune , That fall what may , by night or noon .

		Still in the heart shall sing for me One clear and constant melody . ''

		Too oft the clamor and the .

		> Of living quench the notes of life ; Too oft they lose their customed way , In alien sequences to stray .

		Yet ever stealing back , they fall Into the cadence sought through all . ''

		Then grief and gladness , love and pain Blend all their harmonies again ; The heavens uplift a shining arch Spacious above the soul 's brave march : If I but keep thee , night and noon , Ever and truly , Life , in tune Strange instrument of many string * Fortlavet to play on , and for kinqt . ''

		It is not a deeper note but possibly a more solemn one , that is sounded in `` The Field of Honor , '' with its fine ethical thought : '' Soldier and statesman fall no more
Like Hamilton	PERSON	, slain in his pride ; No sailor hero seeks the shore To die as great Decatnr died ; For honor 's code of murderous lust Lies buried ` neath dishonor 's dust .

		`` Now in the dark east waits the day Long prophesied , prayed , yearned for still .

		When angered nations shall obey God 's law for men thon shalt not kill .

		Then all the codes of blood shall cease , And fields of honor smile with peace . ''

		We take the poem called ''
Gloria Victis	PERSON	'' as our illustration of Mr.
Stafford	PERSON	's Dorian Days '' : '' Let the song cease and him who sang depart , Singer and song have found enough of praise ; The tale was all for one and touched her heart ; He only sang to one and won her bays . ''

		Bear the dead knight in triumph though o'erthrown ; The herald , who proclaims him conquered , lies ; He jousted for his queen 's delight alone , And she looked on him with acclaiming eyes .

		Let the pale martyr bleed ; he but obeyed The unrelenting conscience 's behest .

		Of her , not of the world , he walked afraid , And when he gave her all she gave him rest . ''

		The greater part of Mr.
Stafford	PERSON	's volume , as its title indicates , is made up of pieces upon classical themes .

		The author 's blank verse is grave and restrained , almost Landorian in its simplicity and suggested strength .

		A pleasant conceit is expressed in '' The Sea - flowers , '' one of the '' New Poems '' of Mr.
Richard Edwin	PERSON	Day : '' The living splendors of the main , The pink and purple companies .

		That spangle the untravelled plain , Beneath the azure seas , '' Grow ever to an alien bloom , And sow the deep with buds and leaves Blossoms that light the cold , vast gloom O'er which the billow heaves . ''

		But vacant is each silent court , And desolate each flowery way ; For in these paths no children sport , Nor whispering lovers stray . ''

		No breeze of morning bends the stalks , No evening / fj > liyr lifts ilu - boughs That tremble only when these walks Slowly the dead ship plows .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .


Kichard Hoffman	PERSON	, the
New York	LOCATION	P ^ t wh died last
August	DATE	, had the good fortune to unite rare musi - cal gifts with a healthy and normal personality .

		Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	's Sons have recently published a very attractive little volume called '' Some Musical Recollections of Fifty Years , '' containing a biog - raphical sketch by the deceased pianist 's wife , his own '' Recollections , '' and a reprint of his essay entitled '' How to Stimulate Thought and Imagina - tion in a Pupil , '' published first in
1895	DATE	by
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		An Englishman by birth ,
Hoffman	PERSON	came to this country in childhood , but his admira - tion for Queen
Victoria	PERSON	was so great that he never renounced his allegiance to her .

		Established in
New York	LOCATION	as a teacher , composer , and concert per - former , in
1852	DATE	.

		he never changed his residence and rarely visited other countries or even other parts of this country ; but the mountain came to
Mahomet	LOCATION	, and he seems to have been in close per - sonal contact with a great number of the last gen - eration 's musical celebrities , as well as with an interesting list of the distinguished in other fields .

		He is very happy in catching the curious traits of the great men and women of whose work he gives us glimpses .

		Mendelssohn laying aside his baton and applauding with the audience ;
Leopold de Meyer	PERSON	being measured by his tailor while he gave a piano lesson ;
Giulio Regondi	PERSON	interesting the serious musical public with performances on the concertina ;
Hoffman	PERSON	and the `` Boy Wonder ''
Joseph Burke	PERSON	trundling a rented piano on its castors along the street to the owner 's house after one of their con - certs ;
Sigismund Thalberg	PERSON	practising two bars of one of his own compositions all night long ;
Gotts	PERSON	- chalk biting his nails till he was unable to execute a glissando movement ; these and a hundred other eccentric touches make the book a very engaging one .

		While not in any sense a sensational or `` trick '' performer ,
Hoffman	PERSON	himself will be remembered for his amazing quickness at sight-reading , which made it possible for him on several occasions to take the place of another performer on a moment 's notice and play the most difficult music with accur - racy and expression .

		His memoirs are strewn with very positive general statements , which should set students of musical problems to thinking .

		He is sure that too much attention is being paid nowadays to technique , and too little to the expression of feeling .

		He tells us that the players of the last generation were more finished performers , because they did not scatter their studies over so great a variety of material .

		He considers the English chorus singers the best in the world , and his general estimate of musical
England	LOCATION	is very different from the current one .

		He is an optimist with regard to the musical future of
America	LOCATION	, from which country he predicts that `` the great composers of the twentieth cen - tury '' will come .

		The Elizabethan Mr -
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	somewhere says dramatists on that he would willingly sacrifice one their own work .

		of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays -LRB- which one , if we remember correctly , he does not specify -RRB- for the sake of a preface , written , we should presume as a necessary qualification , with the usual brilliance of G. B S. Shakespeare never wrote a preface , but he did drop a few casual remarks about the art of the drama ; these , along with those of his contem - poraries in the Elizabethan drama , Dr.
David Klein	PERSON	has brought together into a volume entitled `` Lit - erary Criticism from the Elizabethan Dramatists '' -LRB-
Sturgis	PERSON	and
Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The work considers first the criticism up to
1600	DATE	, then that of Shake - speare and of
Jonson	PERSON	, who had more to say about their art than practically all the others and on that account are given separate treatment , and finally that from
1600	DATE	to the closing of the theatres .

		Shake - speare stands forth as the romantic critic ,
Jonson	PERSON	as the classical ; the former conceived the theory of the contemporary drama , the latter founded the school which culminated in the eighteenth century .

		One emphasized '' the inspirational aspect of poetic creation , '' the other declared that not inspiration but diligent labor produces poetry .

		The function of the drama develops from the purely moral pur - pose to that of profit and delight as in themselves sufficient .

		Authority is cast aside as the drama becomes aware of its own strength ; and here the dramatists are at entire variance with the profes - sional critics , who echoed the continental criticism , which was only a scholastic elaboration of Aris - totle 's '' Poetics . ''

		They realized too , even
Jonson	PERSON	admits this in two places , though it is not his usual belief , that the people are the ultimate judge of the worth of a play .


Jonson	PERSON	set his fellows thinking about the question of plot , and they bettered the instruction in that they saw its importance , though they differed as to what constituted a good plot , 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, whether it should be simple or complicated .

		Jonson , unlike
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in the main , was opposed to the classical unity of action , but he held to the others ; thus he is reversed in modern theory .

		The literary quality of the drama was a matter of importance in that day , and the modern drama shows signs of a return to that belief , notwithstanding Dr.
Klein	PERSON	's statement that the playwright to-day disregards or despises that quality .

		Out of the criticism of the dramatists came two profound truths : '' first , that freedom is essential to art ; second , that the imagi - nation is supreme in the sphere of art . ''

		In the words of Professor
Spingarn	PERSON	, who furnishes a short Introductory Note , ' Dr.
Klein	PERSON	deserves the thanks of scholars for having made this material accessible in a single volume . ''

		As to why he should have such spellings as '' Aischylos , '' ''
Lily	PERSON	, '' and ''
Marlow	PERSON	, '' we must confess our ignorance , unless it be that the first is a reversion to type , and the others have become `` reformed . ''

		A narrative o /
Eberhard Ludwig	PERSON	,
Duke of Wttrtr	ORGANIZATION	love ami intrigue temberg in the early part of the in wurttemberff .

		eighteenth century , lived for twenty years in subservience to his capable and unscrupu - lous mistress ,
Wilhelmine von Gravenitz	PERSON	, a
Meck	PERSON	- lenburg adventuress .

		This woman 's life is told by
Marie Hay	PERSON	in a volume entitled '' A German Pompadour '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .


Marie Hay	PERSON	has a certain skill in fleshing out historical episodes into sensat - ional half-romances , and her book has had its popu - larity .

		It was originally published in
1906	DATE	, was reprinted the same year , and the present edition is the third one .

		There is a superabundance of cheap poetizing , and a cynical treatment of scandalous incidents which is not pleasing ; but the story itself is an exciting one , and is told with spirit .

		There is no documentation , and the curious reader is tor - mented to know how much of the unique complica - tion is history and how much is romance .

		He is the more at a loss because the work is so nearly sui generit .

		It is too rich in detail and psychol - ogizing to be a faithful recounting of the events of two centuries ago ; it sacrifices dramatic effect to the known facts of history too often for romance , even the harnessed and hobbled romance of
Muhlbach	PERSON	and
Musick	PERSON	.

		It is a literary nondescript .

		Wilhel - mine 's career is a romantic one .

		Summoned in
1705	DATE	to
Stuttgart	LOCATION	from
Gttstrow	LOCATION	in Mecklenburg by her ambitious brother , who held a place at
Court	ORGANIZATION	,
Wilhelmine	PERSON	seems at once to have attracted the young
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's favorable attention by her command - ing beauty and her marvellous singing voice , and to have easily displaced the favorite of the hour .

		Madame de Gevling .

		Through the new-comer 's influence , a palace was built at
Ludwigsburg	LOCATION	, and the Court composed largely of her relatives and accomplices was transferred thither , leaving the Duchess
Johanna Elizabetha	PERSON	and her sickly son to pine away in neglect at
Stuttgart	LOCATION	.

		The Duke sur - rendered his authority , and
Wttrttemberg	PERSON	was man - aged , even to the pettiest details of government , by a low-born foreign woman without legal status .


Eberhard Ludwig	PERSON	and his sweetheart were even parties to a marriage ceremony , which was promptly declared null and void by the Emperor .

		The reac - tion came ; the favorite was deposed , exiled , recalls I. tried for various offenses , convicted , sentenced to life imprisonment , and , outliving the Duke and the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's line , pardoned at last , dying on a visit to a half-deserted village which was once her brilliant capital of Ludwigsberg .

		Recollection , Life OD the Plain8 and * ' of
Armv Hff Fort Phil Kearney Massacre	ORGANIZATION	, with on the plain * .

		an Account of the Celebration of ` Wyoming Opened ' '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is a realistic and stirring relation , forty years after , of the hard - ships and perils encountered by Mrs.
Henry B. Carrington	PERSON	in her westward journey in
1866	DATE	to join her husband at a frontier military station in the then great
Dakota Territory	ORGANIZATION	.

		After letting her manuscript lie and season for two years , Mrs.
Carrington	PERSON	was moved to take it in hand again and add the narrative of her revisiting the old scenes on the occasion of the late celebration in honor of the victims of the
Fort Kearney	LOCATION	massacre .

		In that terrible slaughter she lost her first husband , Lieut.
George W. Grummond	PERSON	, whose commanding officer ,
Colonel Carrington	PERSON	, she married
five years later	DATE	.

		The daily and hourly dangers from hostile Indians , and the winter sufferings from intense cold , with numerous other tests of her fortitude and endurance , are unrhetorically set forth in Mrs.
Carrington	PERSON	's interesting narrative , which is accompanied by illus - trations and maps .

		In reviewing the changes that forty years have wrought in our great West , she refers to the coming of the railroad , to her own experience as '' the only woman passenger on the first passenger train that went over the newly-laid track , nearly a hundred miles west from
Omaha	LOCATION	, '' and adds that now , instead of one road , we have three transcontinental lines .

		Railway progress has been even greater than that , as the latest maps indicate .

		The book is valuable as an eye-witness 's account of memorable conditions that have long ago ceased to exist .

		_ Psychotherapy is in the air , and the world is more or less influenced by hygienic * .

		jhe widespread preaching of the gospel of spiritual hygienics .

		It is not amazing , therefore , that two simultaneous versions of Feuch - tersleben 's
Zur Duitetik	PERSON	der Seek should appear at this time ; and , fortunately for their translators and their publishers , neither need stand very much in the way of the other .

		Mr.
Ludwig Lewisohn	PERSON	's translation , entitled '' Health and Suggestion '' -LRB-
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- is in substance a faithful rendering of the original , briefly prefaced by the translator : while Mr.
Gustav Pollak	PERSON	's book , '' The Hygiene of the Soul '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- presents the Austrian physician 's views on the subject in a very free adaptation , with much comment and related matter interspersed , and The cult of
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 95 with a prefatory account of
Feuchtersleben	ORGANIZATION	's life and work .

		In fact , Mr.
Pollak	PERSON	's sub-title , `` The Memoir of a Physician and Philosopher , '' well indicates the nature of his book .

		Ernst
Baron von Feuchtersleben	PERSON	was born in
Vienna	LOCATION	in
1806	DATE	, and died there in
1849	DATE	.

		His authorship of the popular German song beginning , Es ist bestimmt in
Gottes Rath	PERSON	, besides other verse and prose , makes him interesting in a literary way ; but his best-known work is that of which we are now speak - ing , which appeared in
1838	DATE	, and has now forty-six German editions to its credit .

		An English version appeared in
London	LOCATION	in
1852	DATE	, as Mr.
Pollak	PERSON	tells us , and this was reprinted in
America	LOCATION	in
1858	DATE	, and again republished in a revised form in
England	LOCATION	in
1873	DATE	.

		Some aphorisms culled from
Feuchtersleben	ORGANIZATION	's '' Leaves from a Diary '' are added to the original work , and a number of these have been reproduced by both Mr.
Pollak	PERSON	and Mr.
Lewisohn	PERSON	.

		The speci - mens given seem hardly to justify Mr.
Pollak	PERSON	's opinion of the author as ranking `` with the great writers of all countries in this branch of literature . ''

		As a psychotherapist , however , he is esteemed by Dr.
Elwood Worcester	PERSON	and others of the school .

		.

		ful There is much useful material , not Shakespeare only for the teacher but also for the drill-book .

		general reader of studious bent , in Professor
Albert H. Tolman	PERSON	's '' Questions on Shake - speare '' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , of which the first two volumes have just appeared .

		The
First Part	ORGANIZATION	, which is introductory , consists of a compact exposition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's language and verse , and a select and valuable bibliography arranged under fifteen topics .

		We can not agree with Professor
Tolman	PERSON	that the metrical stress should be identical practically with the grammatical or sense stress , that , for instance , `` That her | wi ` de waMs | encom | pass 'd but | on ' e m ` an '' should have both syl - lables stressed in the second and the fifth feet , and that neither should be stressed in the first and the fourth .

		So read , it becomes prose , not verse .

		Even in prose , the '' but '' bears a stress .

		The
Second Part	ORGANIZATION	is a drilling in questions of a general nature , then on individual acts and scenes , characters , sources , and text .

		In this part our author takes up the first histories the three parts of `` Henry VI. , '' and ''
Richard III	PERSON	. ''

		the early poems , and the first comedies `` Love 's Labour 's Lost , '' `` The Comedy of Errors , '' '' The Two Gentlemen of
Verona	LOCATION	, '' and '' A Midsummer-Night 's Dream . ''

		The questions are such as will demand a lot of thinking and con - siderable reading in order to arrive at satisfactory answers .

		The cobbler - Mr '
Wiuiam Leighton	PERSON	has trans - poet of the lated some forty-five of
Hans Sachs	PERSON	's Reformation .

		`` Merry Tales '' and three ''
Shrove	PERSON	- tide Plays '' -LRB-
David Nutt	PERSON	-RRB- into trotting Hudibrastic verse , and has prefaced them with a brief '' Fore - word '' on the life and work of the author .

		This translation gives the English reader a very good idea of the mild satire of the cobbler-poet of the Reformation , for these poems are mainly satirical of common conditions at that time ; he pokes fun at the guilelessness of the peasant , the clever rascality of the impecunious student , the greed and laziness of the religious orders , the sorrows of the jealous husband , the iniquities of the cheating landlord .

		All this is done without the bitterness of his contem - porary Protestant reformers , more after the fashion of a rustic Chaucer who disapproves of the present shocking state of affairs but whose sense of humor forces him to smile at it .

		The frontispiece to this volume is a good reproduction of a fine portrait of old Hans from a seventeenth century wood-cut .

		Indian leaenas Much f the S \ am r that ^ rounds of the great the red man or the western wilder -
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		ness j s doubtless due to the freedom , real or imagined , of his forest life , and to the sublimities of nature amid which he moved .

		Some - thing of the unfading glory of that life in the open , under the spell of majestic mountains , mirror-like lakes , pathless forests , and boundless prairies , has been caught and preserved for us in the pages of Miss
Helen Fitzgerald Sanders	PERSON	's `` Trails through Western Woods , '' published by the
Alice Harriman Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Seattle	LOCATION	.

		Many quaint legends and well - executed descriptive sketches are to be found in its pages .

		In at least one instance , we are told , native tradition never before published is presented on the authority of an Indian narrator , as translated by an experienced interpreter .

		Like all folk-lore , it is crude , simple , childish , and of small value or inter - est in itself ; but it helps one to conceive of the vanishing Indian as he really was .

		In a vein of retrospective regret the author says : ``
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	expressed pity for the cast-off Shinto gods whose places were usurped by the deities of the Bud - dhist creed .

		Likewise , the best Christian amongst us , if he looks beneath the surface into the heart of things , must be conscious of a vague regret for the quaint , mythical lore which cast its glamour over the wilderness ; for the poor , vanished phantoms of the wood and the gods who have fallen from their thrones .

		Sometimes in the remotest mountain soli - tudes we dare to acknowledge thoughts we would not harbour elsewhere . ''

		American sor Trent s '' Biographies ot Leading essayists .

		Americans '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- is Mr.
William Morton Payne	PERSON	's `` Leading American Essayists , '' including
Irving	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Thoreau	LOCATION	, and
Curtis	PERSON	.

		The Introduction treats briefly of lesser essayists born before the middle of the
last century	DATE	.

		Some important writers are left for other volumes in the series ;
Lowell	PERSON	and
Holmes	PERSON	, who are essayists as well as poets , are to be treated under the latter class .

		It is questionable whether such arbitrary classification of literary biographies is satisfactory .

		There is certain to be considerable overlapping of writers from one class to another , and not infre - quently the work in each class may be of the first 96 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, importance .

		In the individual biographies one can - not regard only the work done l > y the author as poet or as essayist or as novelist ; the full work of the man must be brought out in the outline of his life and his literary development .

		If , again , one wishes to study any one genre , such aa the essay , one must hunt through the series to get at all the essayists and to know their work .

		The biographies in the volume before us are well done .

		They are no mere compila - tions of facts from the lives of the subjects , but suc - cinct and readable accounts of the development of these men as literary forces in the great era of
Ameri	LOCATION	- can letters .

		As far as possible , the men themselves or their contemporaries are made their own interpreters .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		In a volume entitled `` The Health of the City '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr. H oil is Godfrey has written ten chap - ters on the best way to secure health for the residents of cities .

		He writes out of full knowledge , and in an interesting style , of such matters as air , milk , food , water , ice , plumbing , noise , housing , etc. .

		A carefully selected bibliography is added .

		M Euthenics ,
the Science of Controllable Environ	ORGANIZATION	- ment , '' by
Ellen H. Richards	PERSON	, is a timely book issued by
Whitcomb & Barrows	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Nine-tenths of the questions which absorb the energies of most legislators are petty compared with those discussed by the talented
New England	LOCATION	woman who does so much to make the fundamental physical sciences serve higher human effici - ency .

		In a wasteful age and land , this message is needed .

		The table of activities and methods found at the end of the volume is an admirable summary of the argu - ment and a definite programme for community action .

		A second edition of Mr.
K. H. Lock	PERSON	's `` Recent Progress in the Study of Variation , Heredity , and
Evo	PERSON	- lution '' -LRB- Duttou -RRB- has recently been issued .

		It is sub - stantially a reprint of the first edition , the only change of particular moment being the addition of a chaper on Eugenics .

		Minor additions and revisions have brought the other chapters into accord with the developments which have occurred in the subjects treated during the period from
1906	DATE	to
1910	DATE	.

		There is no apparent reason why this second edition should not succeed to the popularity achieved by the first as a clear and non - technical exposition of the general significance of the results of investigations made during the last decade in the field of evolution .

		In Mr.
Harold Waldstein Foght	PERSON	's `` American Rural School '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , we have a systematic and well - rounded discussion of the essential aims and principles of the hosts of teachers who are trying to better condi - tions in the country school .

		Mr.
Foght	PERSON	has done his work thoroughly well ; he knows the facts and is capa - ble of interpreting them from the standpoint of a pro- fessional teacher .

		He gives in one volume a summary of the discussions by competent leaden on the subjects of organization , administration , maintenance , supervis - ion , training , salaries of teachers , sanitation , -LRB- esthetic problems , gardens , clubs , manual training , libraries , hygiene , and consolidation .

		The recommendations are wise , timely , and practical , tke style spirited and clear ; but the bibliography , although good as far as it goes , might well have been made more complete .

		NOTES .

		A new volume of Dr.
Samuel M. Crothers	PERSON	's essays is a welcome announcement of the Fall season .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	will also have a new volume .

		Mr.
Herbert N. Casson	PERSON	, who not long ago gave us '' The Romance of the Reaper , '' has now prepared for early publication '' The Romance of the Telephone . ''

		Probably the most interesting drama of the Fall publishing season will be
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's `` M : u \
Magdalene	PERSON	, '' a play founded on the familiar 15il .

		lic.il theme . ''

		The Book of Ruth '' is soon to be brought out in an attractive illustrated edition by the
Dodge Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	, with an introduction by
Bishop William A. Quayle	PERSON	of
Oklahoma	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	will have two new books to his credit this Fall .

		One of these , ''
Keith	PERSON	of the Border , '' is a tale of the
Western	LOCATION	plains ; the other is a story for boys entitled ''
Don MacGrath	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
Robert Hichens	PERSON	's articles on the Holy Land , which with
Jules Gue	PERSON	`` rin 's splendid illustrations in color have been appearing in the `` Century Magazine , '' will be issued shortly as a holiday gift-book .

		An attractive '' Portrait Catalogue '' of the publica - tions of
the Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	has recently appeared .

		We are reminded in its pages that this house is one of the oldest in the American trade , its existence dating back to
1830	DATE	.

		The '' Memories and Impressions '' of
Madame Helena Modjeska	ORGANIZATION	, comprising an autobiography of the great Polish - American actress , promises to be one of the most interesting biographical works of the coming season .

		The forthcoming novel by Mr.
J. C. Snaith	PERSON	, entitled '' Mrs.
Fitz	PERSON	, '' is said to combine the setting and atmos - phere of modern English country life with the spirit of romance and adventure associated with the Zenda type of fiction .


September 13	DATE	has been fixed upon as the publication date of Mr.
William de Morgan	PERSON	's new novel `` An Affair of Dishonor . ''

		While shorter than this author 's previous books , the new story is said to be twice as long as the average novel .

		The eighteenth edition of
Winwood Reade	PERSON	's study of civilization entitled `` The Martyrdom of Man , '' with an introduction by Mr.
F. Legge	PERSON	, is published by the
John Lane Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		The recurring reprints of this work attest to its permanent value .

		The recent death of Dr.
William J. Rolfe	PERSON	will bring to a close the revision of his edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays , which was going forward , and which the
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	are issuing in a special limp leather edi - tion .

		The volumes hereafter to be issued in this form will contain all of Dr.
Rolfe	PERSON	's notes in unabridged form .

		At least three new books by Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	will enliven the coming season .

		Chief among these is '' Mr.
Ingleside	PERSON	, '' a long novel of modern English life .

		The two others are '' The Slowcoach , '' a book for children ; and '' The Second Post , '' an anthology of letters on the same plan as '' The Gentlest Art . ''

		Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	is said to have entered upon a new literary field in a series of detective stories .

		Strange to say , his hero is not a Sherlock Homes or a Leooq , but a gentle little parish priest who uses his knowledge of human nature gained in his religious work
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 97 to unravel mysterious crimes which have baffled the police .

		These stories , which are to be first published in serial form , are to begin with one entitled '' The Innocence of Father
Brown	PERSON	. '' ''

		The New Machiavelli '' is the title chosen by Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	for his new novel , now in press .

		It is said to be more similar in style to '' Touo-Bungay '' than to ''
Ann Veronica	PERSON	'' or '' Mr.
Polly	PERSON	, '' and it was composed , after the author 's fashion , in the intervals of writing the other two .

		In the early Fall ,
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will bring out a noteworthy illustrated edition of
Cooper	PERSON	's `` The Last of the Mohicans , '' for which Mr.
E. Boyd Smith	PERSON	has made eight colored illustrations , and numer - ous outline chapter-heads , on somewhat the same plan as those of his illustrated edition of ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, '' published last year .

		Hitherto there has been no trustworthy account , in available form , of the woman 's suffrage movement , which has lately made such tremendous headway .

		This lack is soon to be supplied in the publication of two important books , '' The Suffragette , '' by
Miss E. Sylvia Pankhurst	PERSON	, a daughter of the famous English leader ; and '' What Eight Million Women Want , '' prepared with more particular reference to the movement in this country by Mrs.
Rheta Childe Dow	PERSON	.

		Those who have already been startled by some chance discovery of the debasing and deadly conditions of residence in our cities ask for a definite , practical , and authoritative plan of improvement .

		An attempt to meet this need is made by Mr.
Lawrence Veiller	PERSON	in a timely work on '' Housing Reform . ''

		Mr.
Veiller	PERSON	is one of the best informed men in the world on this particular subject ; he is master of all the technical problems in - volved ; he has a constructive policy ; and he knows how to state his points clearly and forcibly .

		He has been criticized for his conservative attitude toward municipal ownership of tenement property ; but no one can deny that he bases his objections on past experience .

		His suggestions for legislative and municipal regulation are wise and radical in the best sense .

		A '' Modern Criminal Science Series '' of books writ - ten by continental authorities is an important enterprise announced by
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It appears that the
American Institute of Criminal Law	ORGANIZATION	and
Crimin	PERSON	- ology is behind the enterprise , for this organization is of the opinion that
America	LOCATION	is backward in intelligent and systematic improvement of the criminal law .

		It was decided therefore to translate and publish , with American introductions , the principal works dealing with the individualization of present treatment and the causes of crime that now hold the stage of thought on the Continent .

		The first book to appear will be '' Criminal Psychology , '' by Professor
Hans Gross	PERSON	of
Austria	LOCATION	, translated by Dr.
Horace M. Kallen	PERSON	, lecturer in philosophy at
Harvard	LOCATION	; the author will supply a special preface for American readers , and Professor
Joseph Jastrow	PERSON	of
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	will fur - nish an introduction .

		This work will be followed later in the season by '' Modern Theories of Criminality , '' by
C. Bernaldo de Quiros	PERSON	of
Madrid	LOCATION	; the translator is Dr.
Alphonse de Salvio	PERSON	of
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	, and an American preface to accompany the translation has been prepared by the author , while Dr.
W. W. Smithers	PERSON	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	will supply an introduction .

		Other vol - umes to follow in
1911	DATE	include `` Crime , Its Causes and Remedies , '' by
Cesare Lombroso	PERSON	; `` Criminal Sociology , '' by
Enrico Ferri	PERSON	, Professor of Criminal Law and Pro- cedure in the
University of Rome	ORGANIZATION	; `` The Individualiza - tion of Punishment , '' by
Raymond Saleilles	PERSON	, Professor of Comparative Law in the
University	ORGANIZATION	of
Paris	LOCATION	; `` Penal Philosophy , '' by
Gabriel Tarde	PERSON	, late Magistrate in
Picardy	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	; `` Criminality and Economic Condi - tions , '' by
W. A. Bouger	PERSON	, Doctor in Law of the Uni - versity of
Amsterdam	LOCATION	; '' Criminology , '' by
Raffaelle Garofalo	PERSON	, late President of the Court of Appeals of
Naples	LOCATION	; and '' Crime and Its Repression , '' by
Gustar Aschaffenburg	PERSON	of
Cologne	LOCATION	.

		ENCHANTED GROUND An Episode in the Life of a Young Man By
HARRY JAMES SMITH	PERSON	'' A real ' find ' by a publisher 's reader is an event so rare , as has been said by one of our genial literary essayists perhaps
Curtis	PERSON	or
Howells	LOCATION	, or someone who knew whereof he spoke , that when the patient literary purveyor discovers such a treasure among the reams of uncompellatory manuscripts through which he plods his weary way , he is so elated that he goes about clapping his friends on the shoulder and inviting them to take a drink with him in celebration of his luck .

		Some such spiritual exhilaration would have been pardonable , we fancy , to the reader for
Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Company	ORGANIZATION	when the manuscript of ` Enchanted Ground ' swam into his ken .

		The joyous event must have diffused an atmosphere of cheer through the sedate establishment on Park Street , and brought prosperity to the more hilarious centres of culture variously located on
Tremont Street	ORGANIZATION	and
Beacon Hill	LOCATION	.

		And now the book is issued , and the public becomes sharers in the joy , not necessarily to celebrate its advent with libations , but to delight in it and go about telling their story-loving friends how good it \ s. `` The Dial . ''

		We suspect that this story will prove , if not a ` best ' seller , a very good one .

		, It has a strong vein of sentiment , a flexible and kindly humor , a plot directly concerned with a pair of young lovers , and a vigorous style . ''

		The Nation . ''

		As an observer of cosmopolitan life , Mr.
Smith	PERSON	is obviously an adept , and he repro - duces what he has seen and heard with a keen sense of its mingled comedy and tragedy . ''

		122 TWO RECENT AMERICAN CLASSICS .

		It is the business of the literary critic to fight for the chiefs who have fallen on the field of letters , to drag their bodies from the heap of the slain , to build their pyre and see that they have due funeral honors .

		Or if this is too heroic a strain , the critic may be compared to
Scott	PERSON	's '' Old Mortality , '' who went about among the graveyards , freshening up the head - stones and recarving the names of the martyred dead .

		We do not do enough of this sort of thing in
America	LOCATION	, at least in our periodicals .

		`` Out of sight , out of mind . ''

		What we do is to wait for anniversaries , when at one fell swoop we jumble together our impressions of our great men .

		During the intervals we allow their names to be obscured , their books to drop list - lessly from our hands .

		A continual modest service in the temple of fame would be better for their reputation .

		To change the figure , it is by the frequent assaying of the ore of litera - ture that we get at last its value and determine the intellectual riches of a nation .


Stedman	PERSON	and
Aldrich	PERSON	are two of our last inheritors of renown whose claims have not yet been adjudged , whose ghosts indeed have hardly yet come into that arena where the struggle for immortality is on .

		In their earlier life they were overshadowed by our older group of poets ; and they fell on evil days in the end , when the waters of oblivion seemed to rise and roll over everything that was distinguished , that had the stamp of poetry and pure art .

		Aldrich has been rescued from the engulfing tide by Mr.
Greens	PERSON	- let in a biography which is a model of tact and taste .


Stedman	PERSON	still awaits his memorial .

		Both these men were primarily poets .

		Like wine , poetry seems to require a certain time to ripen and mellow .

		What is minor poetry to contemporaries often comes of age and discloses quite adult qualities .

		Neither
Aldrich nor Stedman	PERSON	, though popular in a way , was taken quite seriously when alive ; but they are good being gone .

		Both men , too , were essentially lyric poets .

		What they essayed in other fields of verse , nar - rative or dramatic , will hardly be counted in the canon of their work .

		As both were forced to depend mainly on prose writing or on editorial labors for a livelihood , their output in poetry is 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, not large .

		A comparison of the two may per - haps help to bring out the qualities that each In lyric poetry , there are three prime fac - tors the movement or lilt of the verse , the richness and pregnancy of the words , and the originality and importance of the theme .

		Of these , the first is overwhelmingly the most important .

		Lyrical poetry is song , and its winged rush of sound is what carries it to the heart and head .

		The poorest words , the most meagre thoughts , will live if they are associated with some gush of lyric verse , some thrilling or unexpected movement of metre which the senses find memorable .

		Mother Goose 's melodies hold their place .

		In narrative poetry the second quality that of loveliness or majesty of dic - tion is predominant ; and in dramatic work it is the theme , evolved through character , which is all-important .

		Of course , in a perfect work of poetry , long or short , all these elements ought to combine and form a final flower of art .

		And of course they are seldom distinctly separable .

		We can not put our finger here or here , and say that this is music , and this is expression , and this is theme .

		Poems are not made like a pound-cake a cupful of this , a cupful of that , and a pinch of the other .

		But we can usually recognize the predominant char - acteristic of a poem and discern the principal gift of the poet .

		Stedman , both by nature and conviction , was a singer .

		He carried his belief in the song - element of poetry into his criticism , frequently to the injury of his critical poise .

		This belief accounts for his preferring Hood to
Arnold	LOCATION	, for his adoration of
Swinburne	PERSON	, for his over - estimate of
Lanier	PERSON	.

		All the poems which bear the stamp of his right genius have a spontaneity , a heartiness as if they were written by the blood itself , in their metre and movement .

		Some - times this spontaneity is perhaps rather cheap , as in `` The Diamond Wedding . ''

		Sometimes , as in ''
Bohemia	LOCATION	, '' '' The Ballad of Lager Bier , '' or '' How Old Brown Took
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry , '' it is reminiscent of Tennyson or Thackeray or
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		But in a considerable group of his poems , such as '' Country Sleighing , '' '' An - onyma , '' and '' Pan in Wall Street , '' his music is his own , is a new thing .

		Aldrich 's melodies are more of the mind , echoes from haunted chambers of the brain .

		He has little spontaneity , though in some of his early pieces the ballad of '' Baby Bell '' and 44 When the Sultan Goes to Ispahan '' there is the same throb , the same clear and open note , as in
Stedman	PERSON	.

		But his characteristic music is secret and unexpected , ethereal incantations .

		All his lyrics are poems , they are not songs .

		And , indeed , even
Stedman	PERSON	, with his far more obvious and easy lilt , never wrote a piece which any considerable number of people would want to sing .

		In the great quality of expression , in preg - nancy , pomp , or perfection of words , neither poet had a great deal to boast of .

		Without doing them the disfavor of bringing against them the large utterance of our early poetic gods , it may be said that there is a secondary American poet , with whom they had much in common , who may be called upon to test them .

		It may be doubted if there is anything in Sted - man or Aldrich which for concentration of style or loveliness of diction equals the best work of
Fitz-Greene Halleck	PERSON	the starred , flushed , faceted passages of ''
Alnwick Castle	PERSON	, '' ''
Boz	PERSON	- zaris , '' or the poem to
Burns	PERSON	. ''

		Wild roses by the
Abbey	ORGANIZATION	towers Are gay in their young bud and bloom ; They were born of a race of funeral-flowers That garlanded , in long-gone hours , A templar 's knightly tomb . ''

		No , our recent classics have not the classic cast and color of diction of poems like these .

		Even Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	in the one passage where he stands tiptoe on the pinnacle of expression , surpasses them : '' The mossy marbles rest On the lips that he has prest In their bloom . ''

		Aldrich has more of the wonder and glory of words than
Stedman	PERSON	, but his is a frail splendor at its best , like the cloud-wraiths after the sunset 's fires have left them .

		Two of his sonnets , that on '' Sleep '' and the '' Enam - ored Architect of Airy Rhyme , '' are the limitary outposts of his domain of words .

		Aldrich may be said to be the greatest master of the theme among American lyrical poets .

		Given a mood , a fancy , a fragrant thought , and he presents it in its naked simplicity , so that it stamps itself on the reader 's mind and haunts him with its significance .

		And there is a large group of his poems in which this thematic power is exhibited .

		Among them are '' Identity , '' '' Memory , '' u Pres - cience , '' `` Untimely Thought , '' '' Destiny , '' '' Ap - paritions . ''

		In their kind they are almost unique .

		Odd as it may sound , he may have trained his gift for this piercing forthright kind of poem from his long handling of light verse .

		Vers d societe do not require pomp of phrase or sjx?cial

		THE DIAL 107 richness of music .

		They are better for having nothing to call away the attention from the neat setting forth of central idea or scene .

		Aldrich 's `` Palabras Carinosas '' and `` Thalia '' are in their way as simple and direct as his poignant tragic studies .

		Some of
Stedman	PERSON	's later poems show this same thematic effect .

		Both poets were influ - enced by the spirit of the age , which had , tem - porarily at least , turned away from the physical , male , aristocratic God of poetry , towards the spiritual , womanly , democratic Muse .

		In prose
Stedman	PERSON	was the critic , and
Aldrich	PERSON	the novelist and short-story writer .

		Some may think the functions should have been reversed .

		In view of
Aldrich	ORGANIZATION	's letters , which have lately been pub - lished , it is impossible to doubt that his literary judgment was surer , his taste keener , than
Stedman	PERSON	's .

		When they clashed in opinion ,
Aldrich	PERSON	was always right .

		And
Stedman	PERSON	, in his narrative poems of '' The Blameless Prince '' and ''
Alice	PERSON	of Monmouth , '' gave evi - dence of creative gifts , the power over elemental human nature , superior to
Aldrich	PERSON	's talents in this kind .

		If
Stedman	PERSON	had written novels , his figures would have moved in heavier marching order than
Aldrich	PERSON	's light skirmish-line .

		But
Stedman	PERSON	took up the critic 's burden , and gave us what is on the whole our largest body of sound literary appreciation .

		It is impossible to over-praise his devotion to the highest mani - festations of literary art .

		He compelled Amer - ica for awhile to attend to poetry , something which no one since has succeeded in doing .

		He had his quota of defects as a critic .

		He was too temperate in his eulogy of the best , and too tolerant in his treatment of the mediocre .

		He kept to the via media , which , though safe , is hardly the path of revelation .

		The great mass of his judgments are good , they will stand ; but the question is , whether posterity will care to refer to them .

		They are in the main contemporary judgments , and it is a great deal easier to be wise and pregnant and pene - trating about the literature of the past than about that which is rising around one .

		Every critic has his defects .


Stedman	PERSON	's
Waterloo	LOCATION	was his judgment on
Arnold	LOCATION	, whose merits , either in prose or verse , he seemed incapable of seeing .

		Aldrich 's prose works were so fresh , so sparkling , that judicious readers hailed them as a special dispensation , the art of
France	LOCATION	made decorous for American homes .

		Read over again now , a good deal of them seems thin ; the sparkle has somewhat evaporated .

		But they have by no means gone flat like stale champagne , and the scaling down of their pretensions is the fate to which nearly all fiction has to submit .

		The novel and the short-story seem almost as evanescent as the art of the theatre .

		Aldrich invented an art of the short-story of his own ; and it was an invention which needed no patent , for no one could infringe upon it without detection .

		Perhaps he used his trick of surprise too often .

		But his short stories are still readable , and are likely to keep their place with those of a half-dozen of our best recent artists .

		They certainly do not class with those of the older men
Poe	PERSON	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, or Irving .

		Of his novelettes , ''
Prudence Palfrey	PERSON	'' has a cool , virginal charm ; there has hardly been a better embodiment in prose of
New England	LOCATION	life .

		The opening pages of '' The Queen of Sheba '' promise a masterpiece , and though it falls off in the end it is still a delightful thing . ''

		The Story of a Bad Boy '' is unique in its charm and in its healthy humor .

		Mass and velocity ,
Aldrich	PERSON	did not have .

		And by mass we do not mean length .

		A great artist can make the carving of a cherry-stone colossal , as witness some of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's and
Milton	PERSON	's son - nets .

		But grace and pleasantness appeal , and
Aldrich	PERSON	's prose has enough of these qualities to make it permanently enduring .

		We are told that we should not try to classify and rank masterpieces that we should not look gift-horses in the mouth .

		The game of precedence is an old one , however , and we probably shall have to keep it up .

		No one can foretell how
Aldrich	PERSON	and
Stedman	PERSON	will finally come to stand in our roll of writers ; but no one would now claim for them an equality with the elder gods of our literature with
Poe	PERSON	, or
Emerson	LOCATION	, or
Bryant	PERSON	.

		Nor have they the power and magnificence of that more mortal monarch ,
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		The romance writers Irving ,
Haw	PERSON	- thorne ,
Cooper	PERSON	are larger figures .

		But they are likely to have no mean place among the rest , with
Longfellow	PERSON	, so melodious and sooth - ing , yet so essentially unoriginal , so plumb to the average ; with
Whittier	LOCATION	, that
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	volcano who instead of fire spouted half-fused stones and homely earth ; or with
Whitman	PERSON	, with his amorphous verse and his doctrines borrowed from
Emerson	PERSON	and the Hindus and badly understood .

		A little art of great excellence will hold its own with masses of inferior quality .

		Aldrich and
Stedman	PERSON	have hardly had their just dues , either in life or as yet in death .

LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE GREAT EVENT OF THE COMING PUBLIMtlM .

		SEASON IN ENGLAND will be , according to the Lon - don '' Nation , '' the issue of the eleventh edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica , '' The time of the publication will be about the beginning of
November	DATE	, when , in contrast with the earlier method of pub - lishing one volume at a time , fourteen volumes of the twenty-eight will see the light , and will be fol - lowed in about three months ' time by the remaining fourteen volumes , which include the Index .

		It may be said at once of this great venture , to which Mr.
Hugh Chisholm	PERSON	and his able staff have devoted eight laborious years , that , first , it is essentially a new book in one volume , for example , not more than sixteen per cent of the old material has been used and , secondly , that it is authoritative through - out Its fifteen hundred contributors cover all the learned institutions of the world , and include a great body of practical workers and experts in their departments of thought and life .

		Many of these first-class authorities have written , not only the longer articles , but the brief notices which are usually assigned to less accomplished students .

		In a word , the new Encyclopaedia represents a thor - oughly fresh and complete work of specialization .

		The great novelty on the mechanical side of the venture is the issue on
India	LOCATION	paper , in a form in which a volume of over nine hundred pages can be read and even turned back on its cover with the greatest ease .

		A further advantage is cheapness ; each volume will be issued at a little more than half the price of its predecessor .

		The work , as a whole , is beyond doubt a very great feat of British scholarship and literary organization .

		THE OLDEST INSTITUTION OF LEARNING IN THE WORLD is probably the
University of El Ashar	ORGANIZATION	, at
Cairo	LOCATION	, founded by the great
Saladin	PERSON	in the year 988 , and occupying an ancient mosque in the Arab quarter of the city .

		Here , sitting at the foot of a column assigned him by the particular descendant of the Prophet who chances at the time to be Chan - cellor of the
University	ORGANIZATION	, any reputable man of learning may gather around him such disciples as his fame or ability succeeds in attracting .

		Eight thou - sand five hundred and ten such learners are enrolled in the latest catalogue ; or , at least ,
Patterson	PERSON	's '' Col - lege and School Directory '' gives that as the number .

		One is almost sorry to read that recently a wealthy Egyptian , some
Rockefeller	PERSON	of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, has left a generous bequest for the erection of a new building , so that the rambling old mosque , a series of cloisters surrounding open courts and covering several acres of space , is likely to be deserted ere long , perhaps to be torn down .

		What a contrast to our smart groups of laboratories , museums , lecture-rooms , libra - ries , and dormitories , which constitute the visible and tangible parts of our universities , is this old Egyptian seminary of learning !

		Contemplating its millennium of educational activity , and learning further , from the above-named '' Directory , '' that there are no fewer than thirty-six other univenuticN that were founded before
the end of the fifteenth century	DATE	, one loses something of one 's pride in the antiquity of
Harvard	LOCATION	and
Yale	ORGANIZATION	and
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		In educational history they are but toddling infants .

		OF INTEREST TO SHAKESPEARE LOVERS every - where is the project , recently formulated in the I Con - don '' Times '' over the signatures of seventeen prom - inent literary men , to acquire by public subscription '' The Shakespeare Head Press '' at Stratford-upon -
Avon	PERSON	, and to make of it a permanent centre for the publication of Shakespearian literature .

		This Press , it will be recalled , was established in
1904	DATE	by Mr.
A. H. Bullen	PERSON	-LRB- known to all who know Elizabethan literature -RRB- , with the primary object of issuing from the poet 's native town a worthy edition of his works .

		That edition , completed some time ago , stands as a monument of dignified bookmaking a worthy mod - ern successor of the noble old folios .

		Other publi - cations , of less importance but all distinctive in form and contents , have appeared from the Press at inter - vals ; and Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	has now in preparation a vol - ume embodying Professor
Wallace	PERSON	's full presentation of his recent sensational Shakespeare discoveries .

		The Press occupies the house in
Stratford	LOCATION	once leased by
Julius Shaw	PERSON	, an intimate friend of Shake - speare and one of the witnesses to his will .

		Not the least of the perennial charms of
Stratford	LOCATION	to the literary pilgrim is a ramble through this quaint old Tudor house , with its timbered ceilings and massive chimney and lovely old-world garden ' cir - cummured with brick . ''

		It is peculiarly fitting that Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's pious labors should find habitation here ; and we have no doubt that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	lovers in
America	LOCATION	will count it an honor to bear their part in the plan now in progress toward lifting all financial incubus from his shoulders and making the Press a permanent addition to
Stratford	LOCATION	's noble memorials of her poet SAN FRANCISCO 'S SEVENTY LIBRARIES , as enu - merated and briefly described in the
July	DATE	number of '' News Notes of
California	LOCATION	Libraries , '' betoken unusual and very creditable activity in this branch of public education .

		Already , only four years after the destructive earthquake and fire of
1906	DATE	, the public library of the city has acquired respectable proportions , 98,499 being the reported number of volumes now in its possession , with a main building and three branches from which to circulate them .

		But when will
John Chinaman	PERSON	reach the point of using our American public libra - ries , together with his fellow-aliens from
Germany	LOCATION	and
Sweden	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	and other old-world countries ?

		A pig-tail in a public library has such a sight ever been seen ?

		And will it ever be ?

		A RAILROAD TEST OF THE POPULARITY OF THE CLASSICS was recently made by a large middle - Western road in its placing of sets of the Eliot five-foot-shelf books in the library cars of its express trains .

		That
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	and
John Woolman	PERSON	and their comrades should have failed to captivate the commercial traveller and other patrons of the road is not at all to the discredit of Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's chosen authors , nor very much to the discredit of the travellers .

		The mood of neither the pleasure tourist nor the business traveller is suited to the reading of so serious literature as that embraced in the
Eliot	LOCATION	list ; and it was doubtless in tardy recog - nition of this fact that the company decided to withdraw the unappreciated volumes and leave its patrons to the undisputed enjoyment of their news - papers , their ten-cent magazines , their fifty-cent paper-covered novels and their cigars .

		The ideal traveller would of course be glad to relieve the monotony of transit across the western prairies by losing himself in Homer or
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, in
Plutarch	LOCATION	or Pliny ; but those who purvey to the literary tastes of a trainload of more or less tired and worried and fretful folk , have to face a condition , not a theory .

		TWO CURIOUS REASONS FOR THE ENGLISH LIKING OF AMERICAN NOVELS have been discovered by the
London	LOCATION	literary correspondent of a
New York	LOCATION	jour - nal .

		As they are almost the last that might have occurred to one , they are worth giving .

		Careful investigation has revealed to this inquirer that the English middle-class mother feels it safe , as a rule , to entrust an American work of fiction , unread , to the hands of her daughter or daughters , which is more than she dares do with the more '' advanced '' native productions , especially when the latter are written by women .

		Secondly , the heroine of the American novel is well-gowned , at least by the illus - trator , which is not so often the case with the ladies of English fiction .

		The existence of other causes for the increasing vogue of our novels in
England	LOCATION	is admitted by this authority ; but who would have thought that correct conduct and correct costume would have proved so potent in swelling sales .

		INTERBIBLIOTHECAL RIVALRY , like intercollegiate rivalry and business competition , has its admir - able aspect , and also its less admirable .

		The yearly counting-up of circulation and attendance shows a commendable desire to keep all the patronage already won , and to win more ; but it also reminds one of the daily newspaper 's striving to outdo its competitors in circulation and in number of adver - tisements printed .

		A brief passage in the current annual report of the
Galesburg	LOCATION	Public Library fur - nishes food for thought and for some mild amuse - ment .

		The librarian , after naming certain reasons why the library was unable to do more than hold its own , adds : '' Further than this , the
Knox College	ORGANIZATION	library was reopened , and naturally took some of the student patronage from us .

		Moreover , this must be reckoned with in the future too , for as the col - lege library becomes better equipped for the use of the students , their patronage , which has always been a large element in our work , will be transferred in a greater or less degree to the college library . ''

		In - stead of a note of rejoicing at the increased library facilities of the community , one detects here a cer - tain tone of sadness .

		A MARK TWAIN MONUMENT IN
HEIDELBERG	LOCATION	, where the plan of '' A Tramp Abroad '' was con - ceived , is to be erected by the American colony there .

		This rather unexpected memorial will take the form of a statue of the great humorist , and the necessary fund has already been subscribed ; at least so says the report from the university town on the
Neckar	LOCATION	.

		/ PUBLICITY FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES , through local newspaper notices , quarterly or monthly bulletins , and other sufficiently decorous and dignified meth - ods , seems legitimate and desirable .

		The

		The recorded circulation of nearly two hundred thousand , among a population of about forty-two thousand , may serve as a proof of the wisdom of this policy of publicity .

		It is to be noted , however , as in harmony with experience elsewhere , that the number of books lent to school - children through the schools , in that city , fell off last year to the extent of nearly eleven hundred .

		In this matter of bringing home to the town 's peo - ple the fact that they own , and too often neglect to profit by , a fine collection of the very best literature , why might it not be well to secure for advertising purposes a portion of the omnipresent billboard , even at the risk of crowding out some of the regular announcements of things eatable , drinkable , smok - able , and wearable ?

England	LOCATION	, was for some years an active worker in the cause of Socialism , and at present enjoys the protection and countenance of Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, who vouches for him in an inter - esting Introduction .

		He has also turned his hand to countless other casual occupations , in - cluding poetry ; but , he says , '' I have come to the conclusion that I have no vocation for verse - making , much less poetry , though a few odds and ends of mine have been printed and one song published with music : I have never heard of anyone singing it , however . ''

		These few quoted words give the keynote of the book , dispassionate , detached , objective statement of facts , always well within the truth , and resorting to no art but the difficult one of entire natural - ness .

		No wonder Mr.
Wells	PERSON	declares that '' he has produced a living work that will defy the embargo of Mr.
Mudie	PERSON	and all the libraries '' an embargo which some of Mr.
Meek	PERSON	's candor in the treatment of facts may very conceivably invite , while the polished and gilded eroticism of the '' society novel '' passes muster even before the severe scrutiny of '' Miss Timmins '' and her kind .

		The vogue attained by such unvarnished accounts of hand-to-mouth existence as have been written by the late

		There is in it no spectacular tramp - ing or '' bumming , '' no voluntary experience of prison life , though there is one involuntary term of imprisonment for debt , and no curious explor - ing of the purlieus of wickedness .

		It is just the unembroidered and unsensational record of an up-hill struggle for existence , and yet it is pre - sented with such an unconscious artistry that it holds the attention from Ix ' ^ iniiinj ; to i-ncl .

		THE DIAL ill What avails it , we ask ourselves , to study rhet - oric at college and to write laborious themes , when a Bunyan or a Meek can thus make our labors ridiculous and cause our favorite classic authors to pale their ineffectual fires ?

		Eastbourne was the birthplace and for most of his life the home of our chair-man .

		-LRB- The book 's happy ending , with the appearance of a well-to-do uncle from
Vancouver	LOCATION	, shows why one can not confidently assert that
Eastbourne	ORGANIZATION	is Mr.
Meek	PERSON	's present abiding-place . -RRB-

		Scanty schooling fell to the lot of
George Meek	PERSON	, who , being early consigned to the care of a grand - father who soon afterward died , found himself obliged at a tender age to shift for himself .

		Worse than that , he had to work at precarious jobs for his living , and was dispossessed of his wages by an unnatural mother who returned from
America	LOCATION	, rather inopportunely for her boy 's best good , after her husband had lost his life in the
Brooklyn	LOCATION	theatre tragedy of
1876	DATE	.

		A certain native refinement and passion for the ideal appear in the lad , according to his own account of this period .

		He says : `` I had few , if any , pleasures besides my reading .

		... Most of the boys I got to know through working with them were too filthy in their habits and conversa - tion to suit me , and I made no girl friends ; I was usually very badly dressed , and unless I made a few coppers unknown to my mother I never had any pocket - money .

		And I was naturally very shy .

		1 buried myself as much as I could in my readings and my day-dreams to escape the irksome realities of everyday life .

		Unless trouble was very acute and pressing I could nearly always withdraw my mind from my environment into a land of dreams a land which was my very own , where great and glorious things happened .

		This faculty I have enjoyed ever since I can remember , though of late years I find it less easy to detach myself from my surroundings , and the visions I see are less vivid . ''

		A studious house-painter from Nottingham converted young Meek from an indifferent sort of Anglican into a firmly convinced agnostic , and he tells us that he has since had only occasional relapses into religion .

		But , far re - moved though he is from religious enthusiasm , he has always been a worshipper of the fair sex , owing , he thinks , what little strain of poetry there is in his temperament to the fact that from his earliest years he has been given to idealizing women . ''

		Although my experience leads me to conclude that I am mistaken , '' he confesses , '' I always like to think of them as being but a little lower than the angels . ''

		Knowing now his atti - tude toward religion and toward women , we have some accurate conception of the man himself .

		A passage here and there from his autobiography will help to complete the picture .

		Of the early
Eastbourne	ORGANIZATION	days he writes : '' As I remember , I used sometimes to have to do very hard and even dangerous work pushing heavy tradesmen 's trucks , carrying heavy loads , and standing outside second or third story windows to clean them .

		But while all my money was taken from me I was badly fed and clothed .

		Once I was at work for a well-to-do tradesman in Terminus Road ; he was exceed - ingly religious , so much so that he would not allow his children to go to Christmas parties .

		One day he set me to clean out the space in front of the cellar window which was covered by a -LSB- n -RSB- iron grating in the pavement in front of his shop window .

		Here I found about four - pence three-farthings in coppers , and got into trouble because I stuck to it !

		He was a preacher for one of the obscure sects which drone their monotonous dirges -LRB- you ca n't call them ' hymns ' -RRB- in various holes and corners about the town . ''

		To this adolescent period preceding the bath chair misery belongs also a brief experience of farming life in
America	LOCATION	'' at
Warsaw	LOCATION	, Wy - oming county , U. S .

		A , '' where dwelt a great - uncle and some cousins , and where he enjoyed the good cheer of his kinsfolks ' bounteous table and the unaccustomed freedom of frontier coun - try life ; but the half-blind weakling was not the man for subduing the western wilderness , and back he soon went to the uncertain vicissitudes of unskilled labor at the smallest of wages .

		It was in
February , 1891	DATE	, that he sank , as he says , to the `` profession '' of bath chair-man .

		He presents successively the darker and the brighter side of the calling : '' If you would know the horror of black despair go out with a bath chair day after day , with chair-owner or landlord worrying you for rent , food needed at home , and get nothing .

		Stare till your eyes ache ; pray with aching heart to a God whom you ultimately curse for His deafness .

		And this not for weeks , but year after year . ''

		Among the chair-men I have known since I first began to work at the calling seven have gone mad , many have taken to drink , others have died in the workhouse or are there still .

		The work demoralizes everyone in some way .

		It sets man against man .

		Some will do the meanest things to get work away from others .

		For instance , men have gone to my customers and told them I could not see , or that I was a Socialist , or that I drank .

		It is quite a common thing for me to get cus - tomers and suddenly lose them .

		One of the men tried to get the contract work I was doing last year away from me by telling the lady I was a Socialist , but she happened to be that rara avis a sensible woman and took no notice of it .

		In fact , she gave me some of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's books , besides some of the
R. P. A.	PERSON	cheap reprints . ''

		The author stops at this part of the book to tell the reader that he is writing in the spare moments of his heart-breaking occupation , that he has a chair weighing about three hundred - 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, weight to draw , and that he is not strong .

		Hut on the brighter side such cheering incidents as the following were not unknown to him : '' One
Sunday	DATE	in
June	DATE	, a few years ago , I had stood from eight in the
morning till eight at night	TIME	on the corner of
Wilmington Square	LOCATION	without earning a penny .

		I was pretty low-spirited .

		I was hiring my chair from a very hard man , and I had no money for him or myself either .

		As I pulled off the stand to go home , a gentle - man called to me .

		I hoped he wanted to engage me , but he only wanted a light . ''

		Very busy ? '

		he asked . ''

		No , ' I said ; ' I 'm sorry to say I 've been here since
eight o'clock this morning	TIME	and have n't had a job . ' ''

		` That 's hard lines , ' he said ; ` here 's half a crown for you .

		Are you married ? '

		Yes , ' I said , thanking him . '' '

		Any children ? '

		he asked . ''

		` Yes , ' 1 said ; ` one little girl . ' ''

		` Oh , ' he said , putting his hand in his pocket , 4 here 's another five shillings ! ' ''

		Mr.
Meek	PERSON	's unhesitating acceptance of such occasional offerings as the above-mentioned seems at first a little inconsistent with his evi - dent high-mindedness and his sturdy sense of personal independence ; but a starving wife and child at home will drive one to worse things than the taking of alms , and perhaps he found some - where in his socialistic creed a justification for accepting a part of the rich man 's unearned in - crement .

		In this connection may be given the concluding paragraph of his important chapter entitled '' My Socialist Work '' : '' Although I have ceased to take a very active part in politics for some time , I am entirely in sympathy with the latter -LSB- ' .

		e. , the Socialists -RSB- .

		Some day the workers will tire of mere politicians of every shade and will organize themselves for the definite struggle with Capitalism .

		Then , thoroughly grounded in the eco - nomics and ethics of Socialism , they will know what to do .

		It will be no great loss to the idle rich for them to live useful , healthy lives , nor to the business man to be relieved of the ever-increasing strain of competition .

		The worker will have no fear of unemployment or of want through sickness or old age .

		The reign of hatred engendered by the competition of individuals and the war of classes will give place to that of ' Peace on earth , goodwill to men . ' ''

		The prosperous uncle 's entrance on the scene , near the end of the book , and his offer of a home and a living in
Vancouver	LOCATION	to the wretched chair - man and his family , seemed to Mr.
Meek	PERSON	's publishers too much like the conventional story-book ending , and they hesitated about allowing it .

		But evidently they were over - ruled .

		Their own benefaction , as liberal-minded publishers , toward the new author also forms a part of the cheerful issue of the sombre narra - tive , as does furthermore the writer 's reawa ke - ened hope to accomplish something still in the literary world .

		It is at present a treatise on ethics that he ha fixed his heart on writing .

		Hut he will never again make such a hit , both artistically and commercially , as he has made with his autobiography .

		He might now well be content to be a man of one book .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's Introduction gives the reader some acquaintance with Mr.
Mrrk	PERSON	in his ill - fitting and dust-covered suit of black , peering about him , walking ill , and speaking indistinctly , but never abashed , never cringing , and never other than manly and gentlemanly in his bear - ing .

		For tht '' -LRB- li ` spical -RRB- !

		* - ^ raimnarian '' Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has supreme contempt , and certainly the grammarian would be despicable who should bring the weight of his erudition to l-ar on Mr.
Meek	PERSON	's maiden effort at book-writing .

		Nevertheless the grammarian , and also the ungrammared reader , may wonder what num - ber , exactly or approximately , is meant in Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's statement that '' Meek went to
Ashford	PERSON	and met quite several men in a tiny room . ''

		Both uncritical and critical readers too will marvel at the book 's display of unexpected learning side by side with something that can - not quite be called by so complimentary a name .

		Mr.
Meek	PERSON	writes in an early chapter , for example , that his father and uncle , `` like the Atridae , '' married sisters , and a few pages later speaks of a floor covered with coker-nut mat - ting . ''

		The literary sponsor 's professed ap - proval of what is squalid and unedifying in the book seems a little excessive .

		But as a part of the life-story so effectively told , these portions take their place among the rest .

		THE PROBLEMS OF THE SOUTH : A NORTHERN VIEW .

Olmstead	PERSON	travelled extensively through tin - South and wrote a book telling what he saw .

		Profes - sor
Albert Bushnell Hart	PERSON	has recently followed in his wake , and has written a book telling something of what he saw and a good deal of what he thinks .

		Professor
Hart	PERSON	's excuse for writing this book , if excuse be necessary , is that criticism from an outsider is always illuminating .

		He would welcome an investigation of certain conditions in
New England	LOCATION	by a Southerner .

		But more than this : '' In Reconstruction , the North attempted to bring about a new political system THE SocTHXiur SOUTH .

		THE DIAL 113 with the honest expectation that it would solve the race question .

		Surely it has a right to examine the results of its action , with a view either to justify its attitude or to accept censure for it . ''

		The result is some things to praise and some to censure in the acts and attitude of both sections .

		Southern people in particular should welcome the book , not simply for the pleasant things which it occasionally says about them , but for the sober treatment of several prominent questions and the searching criti - cisms which it offers .

		The South has been rightly accused of being too resentful of criti - cism .

		Professor
Hart	PERSON	was altogether right when he said , `` A social institution that was too fragile to be discussed was doomed to be broken . ''

		Certainly the
Southerner	ORGANIZATION	is now ready to discuss the negro problem possibly a little too ready , if the other man is a
North	LOCATION	- erner ; and this seems almost to have misled Professor
Hart	PERSON	into thinking that the negro question is by far the greatest of the Southern problems .

		Eight out of twenty-seven chapters of his book are devoted expressly to the negro , seven more have the negro for their key-note , and he plays at least a minor chord in practi - cally all the rest .

		In spite of all that is said and printed on the subject , the vast majority of Southern people pass many a day without ever thinking of the race problem as such .

		The Southern problem , according to Profes - sor
Hart	PERSON	, is '' how twenty million Whites and ten million Negroes in the
Southern States	LOCATION	shall make up a community in which one race shall hold most of the property , and all the government , and the other race shall remain content and industrious ; in which one gets most of the good things of life and the other does most of the disagreeable work ; in which the superior members of the inferior race shall accept all its disadvantages ; in which one race shall always be at the top and the other forever at the bottom ; yet in which there shall be peace and good will . ''

		If it is true that `` the Negroes , who are a third of the population , own only a fortieth of the property in the South , and that one-fourth of the negroes own four-fifths of all negro property , '' then the problem is simply the world-old and world-wide question of the privileged few against the unprivileged many , complicated in this case by racial differences , antipathies , and prejudices , which the North once insisted should be ignored .

		Whether these differences are right or wrong , they are a '' condition and not a theory , '' and must be dealt with accordingly .

		Another excuse given by Professor
Hart	PERSON	for writing the book is that the North `` has expert knowledge of race troubles and of ways to solve them , '' and that it may `` offer something out of its own experience . ''

		This is not intended for humor .

		The `` something '' to offer is the Indian problem , not the earlier solution of indiscriminate killing , which is rightly repro - bated when applied to the negro , but the `` land - in-severalty plan . ''

		When the Athenian envoys were defending at
Sparta	LOCATION	the policy of
Athens	LOCATION	in subjecting the other cities of
Greece	LOCATION	to her sway , they said : `` The world has ever held that the weaker must be kept down by the stronger . ''

		And a great part of mankind has ever been kept in subjection of one kind or another .

		Yet voices have cried out against such monstrous philoso - phy , and it is no longer openly defended .

		On the contrary , we now accept the opposite phil - osophy , that the strong must help the weak to rise , though we are a little slow in putting it into practice .

		When the French serfs were freed they were not at once given land ; but in the general shakeup which immediately followed many of them managed to secure some .

		A few years later when the German peasant was freed he was given a liberal portion of the land he had tilled for centuries .

		At the very time when .

		the bonds were being stricken from our slaves , the Russian serfs were given lands , though on conditions they never could fulfil , conditions which were finally removed in the recent Rus - sian revolution .

		Even
Great Britain	LOCATION	is at last atoning for centuries of wrong by helping the Irish to acquire land .

		But it was left to demo - cratic
America	LOCATION	to strike the shackles of slav - ery from millions of men , and then give them the ballot instead of bread i. e. , land on which to make it .

		Not only did they give the freed - men no land ; they even left to an impoverished section practically the whole task of educating them .

		The '' forty acres and a mule '' dream of the negroes was one which the nation rested under some obligations to fulfil .

		Professor
Hart	PERSON	's explanation of the reason why this was not done is that the North was so blind that it '' honestly supposed '' that '' the ballot would at the same time protect the black against white aggression , and would educate him into the sense of such responsibility that there would be no negro aggression . ''

		This is simply the old mistake of eighteenth and nineteenth century political philosophy , that political and civil liberty is a panacea for all our social ills .

		Do the ballot 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, and the writ of habeas corpus protect the steel workers of
Pittsburg	LOCATION	, the coal miners of where - ever there is coal , or the sweatshop workers of wherever there are sweatshops ?

		What men need is genuine economic freedom not the laissez '' / / / ' kind and the right to protect them - selves in its possession .

		The North was a little behind
Europe	LOCATION	in
1865	DATE	on this question ; but had she reached its full solution then , she would have been decidedly in advance of the rest of the world .

		Now , it seems , the South is to be left alone in the solution of her peculiarly difficult problem ; for Professor
Hart	PERSON	tells us that a propaganda is no longer possible , `` the North has too much on its own hands in curing the political diseases of its cities , in absorbing the foreigners , '' and , he ought to have added , in settling the re - lations of labor and capital .

		The South was a little slow in rejecting the ancient Greek phi - losophy of subjection .

		She , in common with the rest of this country , has accepted the an - tithesis of this doctrine that of helpfulness .

		A social philosophy which reverses the old order is sometimes slow to be realized in working insti - tutions ; but the South has at last made a begin - ning .

		When
the North	ORGANIZATION	has solved its social and economic problems , beside which the curing of the political diseases of the cities is but a sum - mer pastime , perhaps the South will have made some progress .

		Meantime it is helpful to the South to know that she has the generous sym - pathy of the North , which now recognizes that she is sincere .

William Archer	PERSON	, has written a book on the
American Race Problem	ORGANIZATION	, with this dedication : * To
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, with whom I so rarely dis - agree that when I do I must needs write a book about it . ''

		Since Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, in The Future of
America	LOCATION	, '' came to the conclusion that the Southern whites were wholly wrong in their attitude toward their race problems , we expect to find quite a different account in Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's book .

		And so we do .

		An English Reading of the Race Problem .

		By
William Archer	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Southern whites , and it is full of interesting facts , discussions , and opinions ; while in many matters the author exhibits a freshness of thought and an originality of ideas that are wel - come to one weary of the stale American argu - ments and conventional statements .

		The book contains accounts of the author 's travels in the South , in
Cuba	LOCATION	, and in
Panama	LOCATION	; of his obser - vations of negro life in city and country , of negro homes and schools , of the relations be - tween the races , of '' jim crow '' cars , serfdom , and prohibition .

		Brief quotations from the
Introduction	ORGANIZATION	will give Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's conception of the American Race Problem : '' Ought the colour-lines drawn by Nature to be enforced by human ordinance , and even by geographical segregation ?

		Or ought they to be gradually obliter - ated by free intermingling and intermarriage .

		Or , while intermarriage is forbidden -LRB- whether by law or public sentiment -RRB- , is it possible for people of different colours to dwell together in approximately equal num - bers and on terms of democratic equality ?

		Or is it for the benefit of both races that one race should always maintain , by social and political discriminations , its superiority over the other ?

		Or is this opinion a mere hypocritical disguise of the instinct which begot , and maintained throughout the ages , the institution of shivery ? ''

		The truth is , it seems to me , that no race problem , properly so called , arises until two races are found occupying the same territory in such an approach to equal numbers as to make it a serious question which colour shall ultimately predominate . '' ''

		The race problem means -LRB- in its only convenient definition -RRB- the problem of adjustment between two very dissimilar populations , locally intermingled in such pro- portions that the one feels its racial identity potentially threatened , while the other knows itself in constant danger of economic exploitation .

		Now these condi - tions , as a matter of experience , arise only where a race of very high development is brought into contact with a race of very low development , and only where the race of low development is at the same time tena - cious of life and capable of resisting the poisons of civilization .

		In other words , the race problem , as here defined , is a purely Afro-European or Afro-American problem . ''

		The views and actions of the Southern whites , Mr.
Archer	PERSON	considers natural , under the cir - cumstances , normal .

		He declares that there is no other race-problem in the world , and never has been except in the South , for never else - where did such conditions exist .

		His opinions may be summed up briefly : The problem is acute , and no solution is evident ; the jim crow '' car , etc. , is necessary ; the white South is very wrong in its indifference to the abuses of labor laws , resulting in peonage ; the prohi - bition movement has been good for the negro ; the average negro desires the amalgamation of
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 the races , and the Southern whites know that he wants it ; negro civilization is only a veneer .

		The author insists upon one principle : that the whole trouble is due to physical dissimilarity .

		The negro to him is so grotesque a being , so unlike the white , that he is repelled .

		`` The per - manent difficulty underlying all impermanent ones , that time , education , Christian charity , and soap and water may remove , is that of sheer unlikeness .

		Oh !

		they are terribly unlike , these two races ! ''

		But '' if the Ethiopian could but change his skin , how trifling would be the problem raised by his ignorance , shiftlessness , poverty , and crime ! ''

		For a solution , Mr.
Archer	PERSON	suggests the four threadbare possibili - ties : Extinction ; the
Atlanta	LOCATION	Compromise ; Amalgamation ; Segregation .

		The first and third being out of the question , he prefers the fourth .

		That the
Atlanta	LOCATION	Compromise the suggestion of
Booker T.	ORGANIZATION
Washington	LOCATION	that each race will work out its own destiny , within its own sphere , each race aiding the other will ever come to pass , he doubts .

		Will not the work of the Tuskegees and the
Hamptons	LOCATION	, the industrial training of the negro , create a new form of friction ?

		`` I did not doubt for a moment , '' he says , `` that Mr.
Washington	PERSON	's work was wise and salutary ; but I wondered whether the material and moral uplifting of the negro was going to bring peace or a sword .

		In other words , do the essential and funda - mental defects of the situation really lie in the defects of the negro race ? ''

		An important phase of the problem , usually slurred over by writers on this subject , is dwelt upon by Mr.
Archer	PERSON	: the psychological effect of the constant uneasiness of the whites , especially the lower classes , about their women .

		Herein , of course , lies one important cause of the frequent furious and seemingly causeless outbreaks of whites against negroes .

		While sympathizing with the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	whites , the author nevertheless points out some inconsistencies and weaknesses in their position .

		He is probably not altogether just in his estimate of negro home-life , of the domestic melioration attained by the upper class of negroes '' resolute refinement , '' he calls it , '' veneer . ''

		The boasted negro homes , he says , are not homes at all , but mere '' imitative and mechanical tributes to the American ideal of the prosperous and cultivated homes . ''

		There might be more justification in this criticism were it not also true of a very large number of the homes of whites .

		His books have made a favorable impression on many reviewers , as they well might ; for the style is vivacious , and a large part of the matter appears , on first sight , to be new .

		After the publication of the
Sheridan	PERSON	biography , however Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	's extensive claims to originality , announced in the preface and repeated many times in footnotes and elsewhere , began to be questioned in private and , eventually , in the press .

		It was intimated that , although
Mr Sichel	PERSON	had indeed added to our knowledge of
Sheridan	PERSON	, he had also drawn heavily upon the life of
Sheridan	ORGANIZATION	by the late Mr.
W. Fraser Rae	PERSON	, while treating his memory with scant courtesy ; that he apparently claimed to be the first to call attention to literary parallels which had been observed by other writers on
Sheridan	PERSON	; and that in his bibliography he marked by asterisks several editions of
Sheridan	PERSON	's works and single plays as his own discoveries , though they may be found in other and earlier bibliographies of
Sheridan	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	, it has been alleged , did all this while he professed acquaintance with '' every known and some unknown editions '' of
Sheridan	PERSON	.

		Then came , last
spring	DATE	, Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	's ''
Sterne	PERSON	: A Study , '' within a year after the publication of the '' Life and Times of
Laurence Sterne	PERSON	, '' by the writer of this review .

		Mr.
Percy Fitz	PERSON	- gerald , `` a pioneer '' in
Sterne	PERSON	studies , after reading the new book , sent a letter to the Lon - don ''
Saturday	DATE	Review '' -LRB-
April 30	DATE	-RRB- , protesting against Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	's literary methods , to de - scribe which he coined the verb '' sichelize '' after the analogy of '' bowdlerize '' derived from Dr.
Thomas Bowdler	PERSON	, who spent his time in mutilating
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in the interest of pub - lic morality .

		According to Mr.
Fitzgerald	PERSON	, '' to sichelize '' means to re-hash old facts and old ideas so as to give the impression that they are new .

		To quote him directly , '' Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	's system is to come along after the hard-working harvest-men have gone home to rest , and help himself from their granaries . ''

		A biographer may of course refer , in his preface or in an occasional footnote , to previous laborers in the same field ; but these acknowledgments should be on unessential points , or on points of dis - agreement , in order that the impression of *

		116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, indebtedness may be kept within reasonable bounds ; and while claiming to bring to bear upon his work a large amount of '' unpub - lished '' or '' unnoticed '' material , he must really add a new document or two , else he will have nothing whatever to stand upon in case the day of reckoning ever comes .

		Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	, for example , has made use of two letters in his new book not accessible to other biographers , and of a memorandum and two other letters which , though previously published elsewhere , had never been quoted in a life of
Sterne	PERSON	.

		He also publishes for the first time two or more second - rate portraits of
Sterne	PERSON	and an interesting por - trait of Mrs.
Sterne	PERSON	, if indeed it be Mrs.
Sterne	PERSON	.

		He really had enough new material for a letter to a weekly periodical , but not quite enough for a magazine article .

		Now the reviewer has no quarrel with anyone over the use he may make of the '' Life and Times of
Laurence Sterne	PERSON	, '' for the book now belongs to the public .

		It has been amusing rather than annoying to see Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	tossing about , as stale and time - worn , the results of others ' investigations before they were a year old , or treating conjectures as facts , though the writer of them now knows some of them not to be such .

		One may con - gratulate himself on escaping better than Mr.
Fitzgerald	PERSON	, who seems to have been converted by one of Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	's references into a certain '' Mr.
FitzPatrick	PERSON	. ''

		For further consolation , we are here reminded how Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	recently lost much more than his identity under the feminine hand of the author of a recent biography called '' Mr.
Pope	PERSON	: His Life and Times . ''

		Doubtless others also observed , on reading this life of Pope , that
Miss Symonds	PERSON	was under great obligations to Professor
Louns	PERSON	- bury for certain of her chapters , and that her only acknowledgement was a mere reference in her preface to MRS. -LSB- sic -RSB-
Lounsbury	PERSON	's '' valu - able book . ''

		In these days of '' sichelizing , '' one should be thankful that he is not unsexed !

		It will be instructive as well as amusing to illustrate Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	* s apparent literary meth - ods , for if '' sichelize '' and its derivatives are to come into common use we should know what the words mean .

		Here is a sichelism lying on the surface , to be picked up by anyone : Fifty-odd pages of Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	's book are given over to the publication of
Sterne	PERSON	's `` Journal to Eliza . ''

		Without exactly saying so , Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	implies in his preface that he is publishing the Journal for the first time .

		His English pub - lishers and the English reviewers have so an - nounced it or congratulated him upon it .

		When Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	's attention was subsequently called to the fact that the Journal had been published in
New York	LOCATION	back in
1904	DATE	as a part of the works of
Sterne	PERSON	, his retort was that '' the Jour - nal may have been transcribed in
Germany	LOCATION	or Kamschatka , '' but that he was the first to pub - lish it in
England	LOCATION	.

		Not quite satisfied , perhaps , with the implication that an English imprint -LRB-
Germany	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	not counting at all -RRB- is necessary to publication , Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	went on to say that he really never claimed to publish the document for the first time .

		His publishers and the reviewers had only inferred it , he said , from a paragraph in the preface beginning '' Fresh matter assists these pages '' and ending with the entire Journal to Eliza speaks for itself '' -LRB- ''
Saturday	DATE	Review , ''
25th June	DATE	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	seems to have forgotten a paragraph in his book -LRB- page 17 -RRB- relative to the '' unpublished Journal to
Eliza	LOCATION	, ' which will be found at the end of this volume . ''

		In a similar manner Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	present *
Sterne	PERSON	's correspondence .

		Letters are intro - duced with a declaration that they are '' new '' or with a sentence from which the uninformed reader infers that they are new , though they may be found in previous biographies or in various editions of
Sterne	PERSON	's works .

		And so it is with other minor documents .

		On page 69 , for instance , Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	takes up
Sterne	PERSON	's '' Dream '' with the remark that it '' deserves more attention than it has received , '' when as a matter of fact it has received from
M. Paul Stapfer	PERSON	-LRB- who first published it -RRB- and from other writers on
Sterne	PERSON	, five times the attention de - voted to it by Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	.

		More curious still , a letter on page 169 -LRB- which Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	says '' finds noplace in the printed collections ' -RRB- appears with a superscription , though there is none in the ex - isting manuscript of the letter or in the letter as hitherto published .

		Again ,
M. Tollot	PERSON	, one of
Sterne	PERSON	's
Continental	ORGANIZATION	friends , never quite identi - fied , is several times mentioned by Mr.
Sidu-l	PERSON	: is '' the Abbe * Tollot '' -LRB- see pp. 215 and 227 -RRB- ; but there seems to be no warrant for the title except that an educated Frenchman of the eighteenth century was sometimes an abbe * .

		And so Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	proceeds merrily through his volume .

		Another form of sichelism is Mr.
Su-lid	PERSON	's claim to some fact or incident which we are informed has been `` unnoticed '' or '' UUJMT - ceived '' or '' missed '' by other writers on Sternr .

		and consequently first noticed or pom-ivcd by himself .

		Out of many sichelisms of this kind .

		we may cite two or three .

		On page 34 is the '' unnoticed fact '' that
Sterne	PERSON	has in one of the
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 117 later volumes of '' Tristram Shandy '' a Curate D'Estella , as if in memory of the romantic retreat called D'Estella where he courted
Miss Lumley	PERSON	in his youth .

		This fact was noticed many years ago by Mr.
Fitzgerald	PERSON	in his '' Life of Sterne '' -LRB- I. 23 -RRB- .

		Again , it is implied in Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	's preface that he has discovered that the '' Jenny '' of '' Tristram Shandy '' is the '' Kitty '' of
Sterne	PERSON	's correspondence .

		But all this is in
Fitzgerald	PERSON	-LRB- I. 105-106 -RRB- .

		On page 129 , Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	goes so far as to say that the reference to '' Kitty '' in the last installment of '' Tristram Shandy '' -LRB- 1767 -RRB- '' has never yet been noticed , '' and then proceeds to quote the references to her down to
1767	DATE	, much as they have appeared in other biographies of
Sterne	PERSON	.

		And , finally , Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	says -LRB- p. 155 -RRB- that '' the real cause '' of the meeting between
Sterne	PERSON	and
Warburton	PERSON	'' has escaped biographers , who have removed the incident to a subsequent phase of their squabble . ''

		The `` real cause '' of the meeting and the approximate date of it -LRB- all that Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	gives -RRB- have been given by
Fitzgerald	ORGANIZATION	,
Traill	PERSON	,
Sidney Lee	PERSON	, and by the present re - viewer , who , in fact , stated the exact day of the first meeting along with the incidents that led up to it -LRB- '' Life and Times of
Sterne	PERSON	, '' pp. 196-198 -RRB- .

		Who are one may ask the biographers of
Sterne	PERSON	?

		Were there space for it , it would be equally amusing to illustrate the perils attending sich - elization , from the numerous misstatements , outside of claims , in Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	's volume .

		On page 106 , we are told , for example , that
Sterne	PERSON	's '' Watch-Coat '' was '' only posthum - ously printed . ''

		The '' Watch-Coat , '' as printed in
Sterne	PERSON	's lifetime -LRB- before the appearance of '' Tristram Shandy '' and '' The Sentimental Journey '' -RRB- is fully described in the '' Life and Times of Sterne '' -LRB- pp. 164-177 and 531 -RRB- .

		But , to proceed no further , Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	, when confronted with his claims and misstatements , replies that they are unimportant , for it was not his intention to write a biography of
Sterne	PERSON	.

		A pertinent question in rejoinder is , Why make claims if they are unimportant ?

		Indeed , his book would stand the test no better if it were examined as a study .

		If Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	is ac - quainted with the literature on
Sterne	PERSON	, he must know that the aspects in which he has presented him , as humorist , sentimentalist , dreamer , and precursor of modern impressionism , have noth - ing novel about them at all .

		It was perhaps worth while to re-work the old mines ; but it savors of the promoter to advertise them as fresh discoveries .

		BRIEFS osr NEW BOOKS .


Mark Twain	PERSON	's Xt is a wise word that the Polish - premeditated ers of ``
Mark Twain	PERSON	's Speeches '' impromptus .

		-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- have chosen from his own writings as a prefatory caution to the reader : '' There is no more sin in publishing an entire vol - ume of nonsense than there is in keeping a candy - store with no hardware in it .

		It lies wholly with the customer whether he will injure himself by means of either , or will derive from them the benefits which they will afford him if he uses their possibilities judiciously . ''

		As occasional reading , these speeches , delivered at various times in the
last four decades	DATE	of his life , are generally of a nature to entertain and to amuse , although their quiet perusal may not move the reader to praise them quite so highly as does Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, who heard many of them at banquet or other festal occasion , and who contri - butes a brief introduction to the volume .

		We learn from him , without surprise , that it was his friend 's practice to prepare his oratorical exercises before - hand , to commit them carefully to memory , and to study their probable effect on his hearers .

		If the reader can not always catch that spirit of conviviality and of cordial readiness to applaud even a labored witticism which commonly smooths the path of the after-dinner speaker , he can at least admire and enjoy the neatness and probably telling effect of many of the humorous turns taken by these short speeches .

		But there is little need , at
this late day	TIME	, to call attention to the qualities of
Mark Twain	PERSON	's inimitable oratory .

		One fault we have to find , not with the book , but rather with the publishers .

		Their announcement on the wrapper says that '' here will be found the speech delivered at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	when he received the Doctor 's degree from that uni - versity , ... the address delivered at the
Aldrich Memorial	ORGANIZATION	meeting , etc. '' The et cetera we have easily found , but have turned every page in the book three times in vain search for the Aldrich memorial address and the alleged
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	utterance .

		Mark Twain could defy the conventionalities , but we had not before heard that he astonished the assembled Oxonians by making a speech on the receipt of his doctorate .

		Hence the keenness of our disappointment in not finding this promised gem of oratory .

		Otherwise , the book is , in its way , all that could be desired . ''

Shilleto Smith	ORGANIZATION	, in her recent volume literature . ''

		on j -RRB-
ean Swift	PERSON	and his circle of friends -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is to refute certain unjust slanders and a few generally accepted beliefs about the character of one of the most interesting and perplexing fig - ures in the history of literature and of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		The tone of the book from cover to cover is that of an apologia , and the author 's admiration for her subject causes her to magnify his sensitiveness and dominating influence while she denounces his en - emies in no mild phrases .

		In somewhat prismatic 118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, imagery she says , in her Introduction : `` I have written the life neither of a saint nor a fiend ; I have neither dragged him down to hell nor raised him to heaven , I have dressed him neither in black nor in white ; I have not attired him in scar - let , nor endowed him with a cloven foot , setting him to dance among friends worse than himself . ''

		With strong emphasis upon his sunless childhood and friendless youth , she portrays Swift as `` the ugly duckling of the literary world . ''

		Poverty and disease , two factors which influenced his whole life , were `` heritages '' from his youth ; and his hoy hood memories seem to have been largely grievances .

		With frequent excuses for his mistakes and their consequences , the author traces
Swift	ORGANIZATION	's career as secretary to Sir
William Temple	PERSON	, whom she calls '' a moral iceberg , '' and interweaves much of politi - cal history into her account of the positions of influ - ence in
State	LOCATION	and Church which came to Swift , in his manhood , as a result of his early association with
Temple	ORGANIZATION	.

		The personality of Swift is not pre - sented with graphic effect in many parts of this biog - raphy ; and the reader must turn to the more lucid though briefer life by
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	to elucidate certain references that are indefinite or nnsequential in
Miss Smith	ORGANIZATION	's pages .

		But in spite of defects of structure and frequent heaviness of style , the story of Swift 's life is told faithfully , and certain portions show intuitive touches as the revealment of his disappointed hopes and ambitions , his cramped environment at Laracor , his sensitiveness to slight * and misjudgments , and his disfavor with Queen
Anne	PERSON	.

		The innate belief of Swift in his own pow - ers , his assurance of an unfulfilled '' vocation , '' and his dominating influence , almost brutal in kind , over both men and women , are emphasized .

		There is no new interpretation here of his relations with `` Stella '' and ''
Vanessa	PERSON	, '' although the author justi - fies , to her own mind , his imperiousness towards them .

		Incidental attention is given throughout the book to
Swift	ORGANIZATION	's writings , and a later chapter deals with The Poet and the Moralist '' Libraries and Dr '

		It is scholarly , and at the same time not too technical to be of gen - eral interest The author 's experience as librarian in
New York	LOCATION	,
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, and
St. Louis	LOCATION	, where he not long ago succeeded Mr.
Crunden	PERSON	as head of the public library of that city , and his recent holding of the presidency of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, are a sufficient warrant of his ability to write under - standingly on his chosen subject Partly historical , but more largely descriptive and wisely suggestive , his book contains -LRB- for the somewhat bookish , at least -RRB- a greater amount of agreeable reading than its title might indicate .

		While he maintains a judi - ciously dispassionate attitude toward most questions of library policy , contenting liim > flf with presenting the arguments on hoth sides of such questions , he occasionally lets us see which way his bias tends , as in the open-shelf and clo-t-d-slu-lf controversy , and in the treatment of juvenile users of the library .

		Free access to a large part of the books and special attention to the young folk , including the increas - ingly popular story-hour , are favored by him .

		In a few matters of detail , the all but impossibility of attaining strict accuracy in a work of this sort is illustrated .

		His useful list of `` State library com - missions , with official name of commission or board and title of executive officer , '' gives for
Maryland	LOCATION	, ``
Maryland	LOCATION	Public Library Commission : Secretary , '' whereas the current report of this commission indi - cates that it should be , ''

		A ttudv of mental vagaritt .

		Dr.
Isador H. Coriat	PERSON	's main purpose in the writing of his volume entitled '' Abnormal Psychology '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an admirable one , as is likewise the plan upon which he proceeds .

		He groups the abnor - mal phenomena of the mind about the conception of the Subconscious , making Part I. the exploration of the Subconscious and Part II .

		the diseases of the Subconscious .

		In all that pertains to the clin - ical evidence and the description of cases and data , some of them original and all well-described and related , the work may be commended .

		Its chief lack is in furnishing the lay reader with a careful analysis of the concepts indispensable to the under - standing of the wayward and irregular appearances which it is the business of abnormal psychology to set in order .

		The same criticism applies within the first division , in which there is a clear setting forth of the recent methods of analyzing mental states and of revealing hidden motives and obstacles ; but a decidedly less clear account of the significance of the observations .

		The scope of the work and the interest of the problems seem so admirably suited to disseminate a rational understanding of what is often sensationally and misleadingly consid - ered , that it is a matter of regret that a work so well planned should fail in what after all is an essential consideration , that of a clearer analysis and a richer setting of the objective data .

		None the less , considering the imperfections of contribu - tions in this field which aim to instruct and often mislead the public .

		Dr.
Coriat	PERSON	's work will form a welcome addition to the group of books that are coming to be called for on the shelves of many a library .

		It is possible that if the author had more

Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- were prepared in celebration of centenary , bicen - tenary , or tricentenary events in the literary world ; some were written as introductions to new editions of standard works ; while two at least have a more evident spontaneity than their fellows .

		The entire ten , however , though a little stale , from a publisher 's point of view , are surprisingly fresh and attractive to the reader .

		To say the appropriate and signifi - cant thing so wittily and so well as does Professor
Trent	PERSON	on the occasion of a literary anniversary gives literary anniversaries an adequate excuse for being .

		Beside
Longfellow	LOCATION	, he briefly treats
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Johnson	PERSON	,
Milton	LOCATION	, and
Poe	PERSON	, and also discusses the relations of history and literature ,
Scott	PERSON	's '' Heart of
Midlothian	LOCATION	, '' Daudet 's '' Tartarin '' books , and
Thack	PERSON	- eray 's verses , and gives a wholesome talk to would-be teachers .

		His style is warmed with a quiet humor and brightened at times with a flashing wit , while beneath all lies the sound scholarship without which the rest would be but emptiness and vanity .

		His Poe-enthusiasm crops out in frequent passing refer - ences to the subject of his closing essay , which itself was delivered before the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	at the exercises in honor of the hundredth anniver - sary of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's birth .

		An incidental mention of Sir
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	brings out the curious fact that the commonly accepted spelling of his name is `` the only way out of some seventy odd forms that he seems never to have used . ''

		Nevertheless Professor
Trent	PERSON	still writes ''
Raleigh	LOCATION	, '' and not '' Ralegh '' or any other form .

		As another matter of minute detail , why does he say '' financial '' when he means '' pecu - niary '' ?

		So thoroughly readable a collection of occasional essays does not often appear .

		A littie-known Although frequently small as to size , painter of the the books of Mr.
Bernhard Berenson Sienee	PERSON	school .

		are never otherwise than significant as to art criticism .

		His latest volume , '' A Sienese Painter of the Franciscan Legend '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , con - tains only seventy pages , and is a reprint of two articles published in '' The
Burlington	LOCATION	Magazine '' six years ago .

		The purpose of the book is to show that , as a painter of Franciscan ideals , there was a greater even than
Giotto	PERSON	one
Stefano Sassetta	PERSON	, born in
Siena	LOCATION	in
1392	DATE	.

		That this comparatively little-known man is a greater artist than
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	does not claim , but that he was more lyrical , more rapturous , with an imagination of a type better fitted to penetrate the open secret of Franciscan doctrine , Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	insists with em - phasis and strong conviction .

		He places side by side collotype illustrations of fourteen paintings by
Sassetta	LOCATION	, five by
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	, and four of the school of
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	, the latter being those over the tomb of St.
Francis	PERSON	in the
Lower Church	ORGANIZATION	at
Assisi	LOCATION	, commonly ascribed to
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	himself , but which Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	and Professor
Venturi	PERSON	now unite in attributing to his followers .

		As an adequate rendering of the Fran - ciscan soul in art , according to Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	, the whole range of painting offers nothing equal to
Sassetta	LOCATION	's nine panels , now scattered , but once form - ing the front and back of a single altar-piece .

		Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	is himself the owner of the triptych forming the print .

		In its suggestions of an ecstatic harmony with the spirit of all things , there is but one picture in European art which approaches it
Raphael 's Transfiguration	ORGANIZATION	, in its upper portion .

		And even that is inferior , owing to its being less simply , less flatly designed , and to its relatively greater realism , both in the figures and the landscape .

		In conclusion , Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	finds that
Sassetta	LOCATION	was not only one of the few masters in
Europe	LOCATION	of imaginative design , but the most important painter at
Siena	LOCATION	during
the second quarter of the fifteenth century	DATE	, the channel through which Sienese Trecento traditions passed and became transformed into those of the Quattro - cento , nearly all the later painters of
Siena	LOCATION	being his offspring .

		Theproares , '' The Ascending Effort '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , of the race by Mr.
George Bourne	PERSON	, owes its title through art .

		to
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's observation , in < ` The Conduct of Life , '' that `` no statement of the Universe can have any soundness which does not admit its ascending effort . ''

		The all-important factor in this ascending effort , according to Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	, is the art instinct , art being conceived of as `` a form of energy able to set up fresh energies in our physical being . ''

		With this broad meaning assigned to art , which itself is subdivided into fine art , craft , and play , it becomes easily possible to elaborate a theory of human development and social progress that presents many attractive features and beautifully explains many of the phenomena of individual and social evolution .

		There is , however , something almost too mechanical , too fatalistic , in parts of Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	's doctrine to make it thoroughly inspiring ; as for instance : `` At every hour of man 's existence the same specific vitality which assembled the tissues of his body and gave them its own impress before he was born continues to assert itself .

		It leads him to approve in other people certain things for imitation ; it suggests his thoughts , and is the mainspring of his ambitions ; while to everything he does it gives its bias . ''

		Excellent , on the other hand , is his concep - tion of art as aiming always at a noble ideal that never is but always to be achieved , as '' toiling on for centuries at a task never to be finished , providing the fine experiences from which choice ideas may be fashioned ... Still the tales of passion and adven - ture have to be rewritten , the dramas to be composed anew , the aspects of land and sea and people to be 120 THE DIAL -LSB-

		... '' Except that he makes art too inclusive , playing the parts of several other actors in the great drama , Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	writes convincingly and well .

		There is moral and intellectual uplift in his book .

		_ Wage-earning Another volume on working-women women and and their problems , written from a thrir rrobirmt .

		gijghtly different angle to that of previous treatments , is Miss Mac Lean 's '' Wage - Earning Women '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The contents com - prise some of the results of an investigation carried on under the auspices of the
National Board of the Young Women 's Christian Association	ORGANIZATION	, and managed by the editor .

		A very wide field of industry and extent of territory were covered , the definite purpose being to discover the actual social conditions under which women all over the country labor , with a view to basing betterment work on this first-hand knowledge .

		The fields of labor chosen for investi - gation were those of paper , clothing , shoes , and textile manufactures in
New England	LOCATION	,
New York City	LOCATION	, and
Chicago	LOCATION	; work in the
New Jersey	LOCATION	towns ; women toilers in the
Middle West	LOCATION	, with special reference to
Iowa	LOCATION	and
Michigan	LOCATION	; hop-picking in
Oregon	LOCATION	; the fruit industries of
California	LOCATION	; and women in the coal-fields of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		In addi - tion , the actual improvement agencies already at work are described , and definite recommendations for still further improvement are made .

		The book is distinctly constructive , its chief value lying in its numerous suggestions for social betterment .

		But in form it is fragmentary and disconnected .

		One feels that greater fidelity and fulness might have been secured if the separate investigations had been described directly by their investigators , leaving it to the editor merely to summarize and interpret the whole .

		A '' moss-back '' he most certainly is not , as the account of his commercial successes in printing , publishing , advertising -LRB- his own goods and other people 's -RRB- , magazine-booming , and other kindred activities , makes plain .

		Of course the chief triumph of his career thus far has been the immense success of '' Everybody 's Magazine , '' which Mr.

		Less familiar to the public , but of almost equal interest , is the story of how Mr.

Munsey	PERSON	tried for a month and a day to pull together in double harness .

		One especial service rendered by Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	to the cause of honesty in the publish - ing world must not be overlooked .

		He discounte - nanced and , as far as he could , suppressed the fraudulent advertisement , the advertisement calcu - lated to catch the dollars of the sick and the feeble - minded .

		On the reverse of his title - page appears an announcement somewhat remark - able in its form : '' Published also in French under the title ' Les Etapes du Succes ; Souvenirs d'un ' business man '' AmeVieaine . ' ''

		The pieces selected are essentially poems of places those which reHect touches of local color combined with historic associa - tions .

		Such a collection must necessarily lack the ele - ment of completeness , and represent largely the personal tastes of the compiler .

		Miss
Humphreys	PERSON	's collection is interesting , and is presented in a compact and charming little volume which will find its place in the regard of poetry-lovers .

		The hoary superstitions concerning the deadly perils lurking in fresh air are giving way before the demon - strations of science .

		In his little book on '' Open-Air Schools '' -LRB- Ooubleday -RRB- , Dr.
Leonard P. Ayres	PERSON	, of the
Department of Child Hygiene	ORGANIZATION	,
Russell Sage Founda	PERSON	- tion , gives the history of this interesting educational development from its origin in the
Charlottenburg	LOCATION	Forest School , started in
1904	DATE	, through similar estab - lishments elsewhere in
Germany	LOCATION	, in
England	LOCATION	, in
Porto Rico	LOCATION	, and in this country , down to the latest open-air schools of
Hartford	LOCATION	,
Rochester	LOCATION	, and
Pittsburg	LOCATION	.

		An appended bibliography of half a hundred titles gives some idea of the interest in this subject even so soon awakened both here and abroad .

		The book is copiously illustrated , and well provided with tables and charts in graphic demonstration of the merits of this movement '' back to nature . '' ''

		The School Department Room '' is briefly but ably and clearly handled by Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	in the latest number of his pamphlet series of expert treatises on '' Modern American Library Economy as Illustrated by the
Newark	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, Public Library '' -LRB- Elm Tree Press ,
Newark	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		After a few pages of excellent doc - trine on the public library 's legitimate place in the educational scheme , Mr.
Dana	PERSON	describes , with aid of a diagram , the
Newark	LOCATION	library 's children 's room , and the work it sets itself to perform .

		Concerning the very natural and commendable interest in children manifested by many librarians , he says : '' I do believe that we have allowed a pardonable enthusiasm to carry us too far .

		In the story-hour , for example , we have permitted our delight in the pleasure we can give , almost casually , to a very few of the children in our respective commu - nities , to blind us to the fact that we are , when we take up such work , not only stepping into another 's Held , but grievously neglecting our own . ''

		The little treatise deserves a wider reading than that of the learners in library science for whom the series is especially designed .

		THE DIAL 121 NOTES .

		Mr.
Francis Ferris Greenslet	PERSON	, a well-known writer and critic , formerly associate editor of `` The Atlantic Monthly . ''

		and for three years chief literary adviser of the
Houghton Mifflin Company	ORGANIZATION	, has been elected a director of the company .

		The Memoirs of
Goldwin Smith	ORGANIZATION	, which are to be published shortly by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, will give a very full story of his life , beginning with his earliest days and ending with certain chapters dealing with his later years that were dictated only a few weeks before his death .

		Of foremost interest among literary announcements of the Fall season are the '' Life and Letters of
Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	, '' by his granddaughter ,
Miss Laura Stedman	PERSON	, which Messrs.
Moffat	PERSON	,
Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will pub - lish ; and the '' Life and Letters of
William Sharp	PERSON	, '' prepared by his wife , which is announced by
Messrs. Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The success of Mr.
Owen Johnson	PERSON	's later
Lawrence	PERSON	- ville stories has led the
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	to issue a new edition of the first
Lawrenceville	LOCATION	volume , '' The Eternal Boy , '' now published as '' The Prodigious
Hickey	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's lively portrait of the Amer - ican '' prep '' schoolboy seems not unlikely to take a place on the same shelf with ''
Stalky & Co.	ORGANIZATION	'' '' The Atheuseum '' makes the interesting announce - ment that Sir
George Trevelyan	PERSON	intends to finish his '' History of the American Revolution '' by another vol - ume , written on a new plan , and with a complete change of treatment .

		It will deal largely with Parliamentary and social interests , and the English and European aspects of the Revolution .

		An extended work on '' The Literature of the South , '' by Mr.
Montrose J. Moses	PERSON	, is announced by Messrs.
Crowell	PERSON	.

		The book comprises a study of the subject from its beginning to the present time , and includes criticism of all the modern Southern writers .

		This work is the result of several years ' research and study on the part of the author .

		Messrs.
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, whose general pub - lishing business has been developed during the past few years to a very large extent , have now entered the edu - cational field .

		They have engaged to take charge of this branch of their publishing business , Mr.
C. E. Ricketts	PERSON	, for many years connected with one of the largest school-book houses in the country .

		Dr.
Arthur Howard Noll	PERSON	, the author of '' A Short History of
Mexico	LOCATION	'' and '' From Empire to Republic , '' has written , in collaboration with Mr.
A. Philip Mc	PERSON	-
Mahon	PERSON	, an account of
Miguel Hidalgo	PERSON	, '' the Father of Mexican Independence . ''

		The book will be published early this month by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, under the title '' The Life and Times of
Miguel Hidalgo	PERSON	y Costilla . ''

		A Centenary edition de luxe of
Thackeray	PERSON	's works , which will contain , in addition to the original illustra - tions , a series of five hundred new plates by Mr.
Harry Furniss	PERSON	, has been arranged for publication next year by Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	.

		There is also in preparation for the centenary of -LRB- Thackeray a new revision of the `` Biograph - ical Edition , '' for which Lady
Ritchie	PERSON	has rearranged the biographical prefaces , making various changes and ad - ditions .

		The edition will be in twenty-six volumes , and the issue will begin , it is hoped , in the
Autumn	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` A Midsummer Memory : An Elegy on the late
Arthur Upson	PERSON	, '' by his friend and fellow poet , Dr.
Richard Burton	PERSON	, is announced for publication next month by Mr.
Edmund D. Brooks	PERSON	of
Minneapolis	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	's name is closely associated with that of
Upson	PERSON	, as he was the publisher of half a dozen volumes of the brilliant young poet 's work , including the two-volume Memorial Edition of which Dr.
Burton	PERSON	was the editor .

		The Elegy will be issued in an edition of five hundred copies printed from type upon hand-made paper .

		Under the title of '' A Modern Outlook : Studies of English and American Tendencies , ''
Mr J. A. Hobson	PERSON	is about to publish , through an English house , a selection from the essays on society and literature which he has contributed to the
London	LOCATION	'' Nation '' during the past three years .

		The contents of the book fall under five head - ings : `` Life and Letters , '' `` The Woman of the Future , '' '' American Traits , '' '' The Church of the Future , '' and '' Of Politics . ''

		It is to be hoped that these discerning and finely-written studies may find an American pub - lisher also .

		News of the death , on
August 26	DATE	, of
William James	PERSON	, for over twenty years professor of psychology at
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, reaches us just as we go to press .

		Professor
James	PERSON	was called to
London	LOCATION	several months ago by the sickness of his brother , Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	.

		A month ago he himself became ill , and upon his ar - rival in
Quebec	LOCATION	two weeks ago he was taken at once to his
summer	DATE	home at
Chocorua	LOCATION	,
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, where he died .

		More extended mention of Professor
James	PERSON	's notable career and accomplishment will be given in our next issue .

Zane Grey	PERSON	reveals a strange , wild life , half patriarchal , half savage , intense as the sunglow of the desert and as dramatic as the shadowy depths of the great canons .

		In a series of swift , tense scenes the drama of the wilderness is fought to a thrilling close .

		^ 187 ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS 189 -LRB- A classified list of the new books planned for pub - lication during the coming Fall and
Winter	DATE	season . -RRB-

		BOOKS OF THE COMING SEASON .

		The season of hammock and deck-chair read - ing is at an end , and the shortening days remind us that for six months or more we shall scan the pages of whatever books we read in the light of the lamp or the electric globe , and no longer in the liberal light of nature reflected from azure skies .

		It is assumed , perhaps rashly , that this change of conditions gives to our thought a more serious cast , and that we demand a more nutritious sustenance than has seemed adequate for the idle
summer	DATE	days .

		Certainly , the plans of publishers are founded upon this assumption , for , to change the metaphor , they reserve their heavy artillery for the fall and winter season , bombarding us with the shot and shell of history and philosophy and criticism , and putting aside the popguns that have been dis - charging their pellets of `` light reading '' all sum - mer long .

		They , at least , will not fail us , and if we prove recreant to the cultural opportunities they offer , we have only ourselves to blame .

		In the extensive classified list of forthcoming books that constitutes a feature of our present issue , the biographical section is by far the richest in alluring announcements .

		No sort of book is more satisfying to the cultivated sense than a good biography the story of a man 's life provided it be told with insight and sympathy , making large use of his own forms of expression , and provided also that it be a life of rich associations and significant activities .

		Judged by these tests , we should say that no other book in our list held out greater promise of enjoyment than the `` Life and Letters of
Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	, '' as prepared by Miss
Laura Stedman	PERSON	, the poet 's granddaughter .

		It is nearly three years since Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	died , and the record of his life has been made up with ample time for deliberation and the collec - tion of material .

		It is to consist largely of his letters , and he was one of the best of letter - writers , giving of himself freely to his friends , and not keeping all the good things for his books .

		No man was more closely in touch than he was for over half a century with all that was best in American life and thought , and his flashing intellect illuminated every theme toward which it was directed .

		Miss
Stedman	PERSON	, who is his only surviving descendant , was the constant !

		* THE DIAL , -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, companion and helper of his later years , and may be trusted to deal with his career in a spirit of delicate and tender appreciation .

		She says of her book and its subject : '' So wonderful is his personality even after death that I do not seem to have written it myself .

		I constantly have had the feeling that he was directing what I should say and what I should not say , even sometimes contrary to my planning . ''

		The work will be in two large volumes , with illustrations .

		Three or four other volumes of a biogra - phical -LRB- or rather autobiographical -RRB- character stand out prominently in the season 's announce - ments .

		The '' Reminiscences '' of
Goldwin Smith	ORGANIZATION	are sure to have the deepest interest , and we understand that they cover practically the whole course of the veteran historian 's life .

		They are edited by his private secretary , Mr.
Arnold Haultain	PERSON	.

		Of a very different and more romantic kind of interest will be the '' Memories and Impressions '' of
Madame Helena Modjeska	ORGANIZATION	, with their story of theatrical life in two worlds , of ranching-days in
California	LOCATION	, and of asso - ciations with the leading spirits of her time .

		Still another genre of autobiography will be provided by '' The Digressions of V. , '' in which Mr.
Elihu Vedder	PERSON	takes the world into his confidence , and reveals his own engaging tem - perament .

		Of more special interest , but hardly less absorbing , will be the '' Twenty Years at
Hull House	ORGANIZATION	, '' as chronicled by Miss
Jane Addams	PERSON	.

		Other noteworthy books in the cate - gory now under consideration will be the '' Life and Letters of
William Sharp	PERSON	, '' edited by his widow ; the new biography of
John Brown	PERSON	, by Mr.
Oswald Garrison Villard	PERSON	; ''
Grover Cleve	PERSON	- land : A Record of Friendship , '' by
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	; `` The Life of Tolstoy , '' by Mr.
Aylmer Maude	PERSON	, the best-known English disciple of the Russian moralist ; and Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	's biography of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, which will doubtless be a worthy companion to Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	's treatment of the same subject .

		The historical list seems rather less interest - ing than usual .

		We note among the more important titles , Admiral
Chadwick	PERSON	's history of '' The Spanish - American War '' ; Lord Acton 's '' Lectures on the French Revolution '' ; '' The Wilderness Trail , '' by Mr.
Charles A. Hun	PERSON	na ; '' The Incas of
Peru	LOCATION	, '' by Sir
Clements Markham	PERSON	; a translation in four volumes of M .

		A ill anl 's history of the French Revolution ; General
Morris Schaff	PERSON	's `` The Battle of the Wilderness '' ; '' The Influence of Wealth in Imperial
Rome	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
William Stearns Davis	PERSON	; and the final volume of that largely - planned work , the `` Cambridge Modern His - tory . ''

		These seem to be all the titles that call for special mention , although we make no doubt that numerous other works of like iin portance will turn up before the season is over .

		The department of literary history and criti - cism offers much that is of interest .

		There will be a new volume of essays by that charming writer Mr.
S. M. Crothers	PERSON	, and new volumes by such writers of distinctive excellence as Mr.
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	, Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	, Mr.
Adrian H. Joline	PERSON	, Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	, and Mr.
W. D. Howells	PERSON	.

		M n.
Emily James Putnam	PERSON	has collected into a volume her magazine papers on '' The Lady of Different Times and Nations , '' the Japanese Letters of
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	have been edited for publication by Miss
Elizabeth Bisland	PERSON	, and a volume entitled ''
Mazzini	PERSON	, and Other Essays '' has been put together from the papers left by
Henry D. Lloyd	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Montrose J. Moses	PERSON	has a work on '' The Literature of the South , '' Pro- fessor
Oscar Kuhns	PERSON	a volume on '' The Love of Books and Reading , '' and Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	a volume on '' The Women of Shakespeare . ''

		Colonel
Roosevelt	PERSON	's `` African and European Addresses '' may perhaps be mentioned here , and readers who like that sort of thing may also revel in a collection of '' dynamic utterances on various subjects '' to be entitled '' The Real Roosevelt . ''

		The recent growth of interest in the drama as literature is attested by the promise of an unusual number of plays in book form ,
Herr Sudermann	PERSON	's three '' Morituri '' are to appear in English , as are also
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's ''
Mary Magdalene	PERSON	, ''
M. Rostand	PERSON	's '' Chantecler , '' and Mr.
Andr	PERSON	& ev 's '' Anathema . ''

		English and American play-writing are to be represented by Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	's '' Justice , '' Mr.
Rudolph Besier	PERSON	's '' Don , '' Mr.
Edward Sheldon	PERSON	's '' The Nigger , '' and Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	's `` The Tragedy of Nan , and Other Plays . ''

		The allied category of poetry is marked by new volumes from the pens of Mr.
Edward Arlington Robin	PERSON	- son , Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	, Mrs.
Helen Hay Whitney	PERSON	, Mr.
Samuel Minturn Peck	PERSON	, and the late Father
Tabb	PERSON	.

		We note also with much satisfaction that Professor
Curtis Hidden	PERSON	Page 's long-awaited `` Golden Treasury of American Songs and Lyrics '' is at last actually announced for publication .

		Of forthcoming fiction , the books most eagerly awaited are probably Mr.
Arnold Ben	PERSON	- nett 's '' Clayhanger , '' Mr.
William De Morgan	PERSON	'' ^ '' An Affair of
Dishonour JlMiss May Sinclair	ORGANIZATION	^
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 169 '' The Creators , '' Mr.

Robert W. Chambers	PERSON	's ''
Ailsa Paige	PERSON	, '' and Mrs.
Katherine Cecil Thurston	PERSON	's ''
Max	PERSON	. ''

		Such a list as this should suffice to whet most kinds of novel-readers ' appetites .

		FICTION AND FACT .

		Paraphrasing
Browning	PERSON	, we might with cheerful confidence declare that all good things are ours , nor fact helps fiction more than this helps fact .

		Indeed , we might go further and find it not so very hard to defend the thesis that fact is based on fiction rather than fiction on fact .

		At least they are greatly in - debted to each other , and are so closely inter-related and interwoven that one can seldom or never deter - mine just where lies the boundary line separating the unadorned plainness of fact from the elaborate embroidery of fiction .

		What we call fact or reality is not so much a matter of passive perception as of active experience .

		It is man 's moulding and shaping imagination , his color-imparting fancy , his pronenesa to see in a certain light and from a certain angle rather than otherwise , that make the world what it is to him .

		It has been said , not necessarily in any spirit of irreverence or even of paradox , that the noblest work of man is God , or , to make the parody on Pope complete , `` an honest God 's the noblest work of man . ''

		Next to that , his most wonderful and awe - inspiring creation is the universe which he inhabits , and with the fashioning of which and the deciding what objects in it shall be objects of admiration and desire , what of scorn and abhorrence , what shall partake of permanence and meaning , what of tran - siency and insignificance , what shall be deemed beautiful and what accounted ugly , man collectively and cumulatively has had so much to do .

		Because we are actors far more than we are spectators , be - cause we bring to the interpretation and enjoyment of life so much more than is brought to us by our bare existence and by things-in-themselves -LRB- if there be any such -RRB- , we are justified in maintaining the primary importance of that creative imagination which the fiction-maker possesses in so high a de - gree .

		The very etymology of the word '' fiction '' -LRB- from fingere , to shape or fashion -RRB- emphasizes this power of the romancer to make his facts assume such form as he chooses .

		The aspect and meaning he gives them they are never thereafter able wholly to throw off .


Mary Queen of Scots	ORGANIZATION	owes her beauty and charm , so far as we are concerned , much more to the author of '' The Abbot '' than to her bodily progenitors ; and the
Brocken	PERSON	takes its weirdly ro - mantic character from the pen of Goethe and
Heine	PERSON	and countless others , rather than from its geolog - ical formation or physical aspect .

		What person of mature years , and mature mind , but can recall the sudden sense of freedom and power with which he recognized , all in a flash it may have been , his right and privilege to interpret the so-called facts of existence for himself ?

		Excepting the fun - damentals of ethics , there is indeed nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so .

		Within the bounds of morality , and without disregarding the categorical imperative , one can always refuse , if one thinks best , to accept the conventional meaning or importance of any act or event or association ; and then , if one is a master in the literary representa - tion of his ideals and convictions , whether through the medium of prose fiction or of poetry or of drama , much can be done toward the establishment of new conventions and the perpetuation of new meanings , which of course must stand their chance in turn of being disallowed and overthrown .

		Whether there would be anything left to us of what we call life and reality if the element of fiction , or imagination , or romance , were removed , is doubt - less too whimsical a query to merit serious consid - eration ; but certain it is that we get from that element constant and repeated affirmations of our own personal experiences , and a sense of our own reality and the worth-whileness of things , that come to us from no other source .

		`` Identity of experi - ence , '' according to Professor
Mtinsterberg	PERSON	in his recent philosophical work on '' The Eternal Values , '' is what we all crave in order to convince ourselves of a something more permanent than the flashlike passing impression , of an individuality in us more stable than the `` stream of consciousness '' with which psychology concerns itself .

		It is these re - current and ever-welcome discoveries in literature of such identity of experience , proving that the most personal thing is often if not always the most universal thing , that give undying fascination to the novel or the poem or the play .

		The great writers stand to us in the position of parents or other beloved adults to children , whose little daily experiences lack the touch of actuality and meaning without the ap - proving or sympathizing nod of an older person .

		Just as the cake loses something of its sweetness and the tart something of its flavor to the infant condemned to eat these dainties in solitude , BO our loves and hates and enthusiasms would be robbed of their zest without the imaginative associations that cluster around them , and that we owe so largely , even though it may be indirectly , to literature . ''

		I am never quite sure of life unless I find litera - ture in it , '' frankly confesses .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	in his preface to `` Literature and Life . ''

		He continues : `` Unless the thing seen reveals to me an intrinsic poetry , and puts on phrases that clothe it pleasingly to the imagination , I do not much care for it ; but if it will do this , I do not mind how poor or com - mon or squalid it shows at first glance : it challenges my curiosity and keeps my sympathy . ''

		Another passage from another of the same author 's books shows how much more real than so-called reality the figments of poetic fancy can become to a sympa - THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, he tic reader .

		In '' My Literary Passions '' he speaks of having , as a youth , saturated himself with some of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's earlier and shorter poems .

		`` I read the book , '' he says , '' night and day , indoors and out , to myself and to whomever I could make listen .

		I have no words to tell the rapture it was to me ; but I hope that in some more articulate being , if it should ever be my unmerited fortune to meet th.nt tommo potto , face to face , it shall somehow be uttered from me to him , and he will understand how completely he became the life of the boy I was then . ''

		The creative imagination and interpretative skill of the artist in words often succeed in transfiguring for us what had before seemed ugly and valueless , much as the genius of the artist
Whistler	LOCATION	first made interesting and beautiful the shipping and dockyards and murky atmosphere of the Thames in the neigh - borhood of
Chelsea	LOCATION	.

		Such books as '' Children of the Ghetto , '' '' Mrs.
Wiggs	PERSON	of the Cabbage Patch , '' Little Aliens , '' and many other modern works of fiction that deal lovingly and understandingly with what most of us had thought only squalid and depres - sing , enlarge the reader 's sympathies and open up for him unsuspected mines of wealth in unlikely regions .

		One is reminded of what
Emerson	PERSON	says , that `` the poet , who re-attaches things to nature and the whole , re-attaching even artificial things and violations of nature , to nature , by a deeper insight , disposes very easily of the most disagreeable facts .

		Readers of poetry see the factory-village and the railway , and fancy that the poetry of the land - scape is broken up by these ; for these works of art are not yet consecrated in their reading ; but the poet sees them fall within the great Order not less than the beehive , or the spider 's geometrical web .

		Nature adopts them very fast into her vital circles , and the gliding train of cars she loves like her own . ''

		How different the attitude of
Ruskin	PERSON	toward the hated iron road and its smoke-belching monsters of noisy locomotion !

		To the fashioners and the makers , the fiction - writers and the poets , the world owes more than it is wont to acknowledge for rescue from the perils of dead convention and of complacent satisfaction with the existing order .

		Important changes and reforms have a way of getting themselves effected more easily and quickly when no professional re - former or agitator appears on the stage to arouse and concentrate the bitter opposition of `` vested inter - ests . ''

		What the pen of jaunty ridicule and humor - ous fancy and creative insight has done in pointing the better way and gently but irresistibly turning reluctant footsteps into it , can never be told .

		And so it is , as was intimated at the outset , that we , as inhabitants of a world partly given to us and partly created by us , are unprepared to say that we owe more to fact than to fiction , even were it possible to tell where the one ends and the other begins ; but for the beautifying and spiritualizing and ennobling of life we must hold ourselves vastly more indebted to the vitalizing imagination than to the dead ma - terial on which it works .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A POPDLARIZER OF PSYCHOLOGY , and to a scare .

		1 \ less extent of its more abstruse sister , philosophy .

		Dr.
William James	PERSON	leaves thousands of former pupils to mourn his death , and probably even more devoted readers to regret that the last of his fasci - nating studies of the deeper problems of life and mind has now been given to the world .

		Born in
New York	LOCATION	in
1842	DATE	, son of the Rev.
Henry James	PERSON	, a Swedenborgian minister , he came honestly by his more lately developed interest in religion as a force powerful for good in the uplift of the individual and the race .

		In his '' Varieties of Religious Experi - ence '' are to be found his well-considered opinions on this theme . ''

		The Will to Believe '' is a work of kindred nature , and is also of peculiar interest as first revealing the author 's leanings toward that habit of philosophic thought which he later made famous under the name he chose to give to it , Pragmatism .

		His two books on this subject , espe - cially the earlier one , which had already been made public in the form of
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	lectures , are among the most characteristic of his writings .

		His literary style , whether he was dealing with the ele - ments of psychology , the sublimities of religious faith , the results of psychic research , the perform - ances of
Madame Palladino	PERSON	, or `` The Moral Equi - valent of War '' -LRB- his latest and in some respect * most admirable piece of work -RRB- , was an unfailing joy to the appreciative reader .

		For lucidity and dexterity and picturesqueness in the presentation of rather abstruse matter in philosophy and religion , he had no equal .

		THR STOKY OF A POST-PRANDIAL BLUNDER , as told both by the blunderer himself and by the toast - master of the occasion , may now be read in full , in the opening pages of `` Mark Twain 's Speeches , '' which was briefly reviewed in our last issue , and in the
September	DATE	``
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine , '' where Mr.
Howells	PERSON	continues his reminiscences of his friend the humorist .

		The dinner in question was one of those
Boston	LOCATION	banquets attended by the aristocracy of culture that was making the then still youthful ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly '' famous for its sustained high standard of literary excellence .

		Emerson and
Longfellow	PERSON	and
Holmes	PERSON	were among the distin - guished guests present were , in fact , the most distinguished ; and these three idols of their age in cultured
New England	LOCATION	our specially invited humor - ist conceived it would be amusing and not indeco - rous to make the subjects of a burlesque in which wit and fancy joined in that unrestrained horse - play of which
Mark Twain	PERSON	, especially the earlier
Mark Twain	PERSON	, was so eminently a master . ''

		When I came to
Clemens	PERSON	, '' relates the unhappy toastmas - ter , '' I introduced him with the cordial admiring I had for him as one of my greatest routri I tutors and dearest friends .

		Here , I said , in sum , was a humorist who never left you hanging your hea * l for having enjoyed his joke : .

		and then the .

		.

		a.maz!ng
1910	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 171 mistake , the bewildering blunder , the cruel catas - trophe was upon us . ''

		And now not the least amazing part of it all is that the blunderer himself should have resuscitated that lamentable perform - ance and put it at the head of his published speeches , adding at the same time an editorial note of frank admiration for its cleverness and a confession of inability to see in it any vulgarity or even impro - priety - ... THE RIPENING OF A NOVELIST is described with much interesting detail by Mr.
A. St. John Adcock	PERSON	in his illustrated account of the author of ''
Alice	PERSON	- for-Short , '' in the
London	LOCATION	'' Bookman '' for
August	DATE	.

		Since there is some truth in Mr.
Adcock	PERSON	's assertion that '' a bewildering lot of nonsensical inaccuracy has been published about Mr.
William de Morgan	PERSON	, especially in
America	LOCATION	, '' a few plain statements of fact may be not out of place here .

		Mr.
de Morgan	PERSON	was born in
London	LOCATION	in
1839	DATE	, being the eldest son of
Augustus de Morgan	ORGANIZATION	, the famous mathematician , author of the ever-readable '' Budget of Paradoxes , '' friend of
James Martineau	PERSON	, and fellow-professor with him at
University College	ORGANIZATION	.

		From his mother ,
Sophia Elizabeth Frend	PERSON	, as well as from his father , the son
William	PERSON	inherited intellect and imagination , together with literary aptitudes .

		Artistic tastes and abilities he has also displayed , as possessors of his highly esteemed pottery are aware , and as may be gathered from his having illustrated one of his sister 's books of fairy tales .

		How he came to turn his hand from the potter 's wheel to fiction , at the age of sixty-seven , and his immediate success as a novelist , need not here be told again , nor need we more than refer to his fondness for
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	, which has left its mark on his pages .

		This and other qualities of his style will be enjoyed anew in his latest book , '' An Affair of Dishonor , '' which is now fresh from the press .

		A ROLAND FOR
MR. LANG	PERSON	'S OLIVER is what one is tempted to essay on reading his recent amusing and unfortunately too well deserved criticism of the imperfect familiarity with English nobility displayed by our novelists , or at least by one of them .

		`` I find , '' writes Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, '' in a roman policier , -LRB- A Sealed Verdict , ' an English assassin who says , ' I am the third or younger ' -LRB- youngest ? -RRB- '

		son of the late Sir
James Allonby	PERSON	, sixth
Earl	PERSON	of
Menton	LOCATION	. '

		If the late
Earl	PERSON	did happen to possess a baronetcy , his son would never think of mentioning the circumstance .

		The man 's father and two elder brothers have died , he says , so he is Lord
Menton	LOCATION	, but the amateur detective of the tale calls him ` Lord Allonby , ' and he , though a very bad man , is too polite to correct the absurd error . '

		I charge you with the murder of your wife ,
Laura	LOCATION	, Lady Allonby . '

		He could easily have escaped , on these terms , as there was no Lady Allonby to be murdered !

		... Before coming into the earldom , this variegated miscreant , son of the
Earl	ORGANIZATION	, was ' Sir
Cyrus D. Anvers Allonby	PERSON	. '

		Did he catch the baronetcy , like measles , from his living father ?

		... Next , he becomes , after his decease , ` Lord
Cyrus Allonby	PERSON	. '

		C'est un comble !

		And that is not all .

		Lord
Menton	LOCATION	is finally described as ' Sir
Cyrus D. Anvers Allonby	PERSON	, ' and as such is he buried . ''

		This is rather hard on Mr.
Lawrence L. Lynch	PERSON	, the author of the book , and we do not see how we can very well soften it , unless by indulging in a little '' back talk . ''

		The English novelist , Mr.
Max Pemberton	PERSON	, in his highly enter - taining book , '' A Daughter of the States , '' makes his heroine say : '' Is there any Venezuelan ship that would harm a subject of the
United States	LOCATION	? ''

		What free-born
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	, outside of an English novel , would ever speak or even think of subjects of the
United States	LOCATION	?

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, himself , in his '' Dis - entanglers '' causes one of his characters , an English-bred American girl , after a diligent study of American humorists , to utter the following as idiomatic : ''
Your Tennyson	PERSON	has the inner tracks of our
Longfellow	LOCATION	; your
Thackeray	PERSON	gives our
Bertha Runkle	PERSON	his dust . ''

		Truly , it is given to few to know well more than one country and one dialect .

		.

		A NEW CLAIM FOR ESPERANTO , put forward by the committee of physicians at the late
Esperanto Congress	ORGANIZATION	in
Washington	LOCATION	, is of passing interest , though the lay public will doubtless refuse to go all the way with these Esperantist doctors .

		The latter maintain that the promulgation of important medi - cal discoveries is now delayed for several years because of the slowness of translations in making their appearance .

		In the olden time Latin was the universal language of the learned world , but its obsolescence now renders necessary a modern sub - stitute , such as Esperanto , which will , it is hoped , serve to acquaint all nations promptly with the most recent developments in medical science .

		These developments , however , seem to take the form of discoveries of new diseases oftener than of cures for existing maladies ; and of new and fashionable dis - tempers we already have quite enough .

		Also , might not the same amount of energy that is now scatter - ingly bestowed on the rival world-languages be pro- ductive of larger results if concentrated upon some already widely-used tongue , such as French or English or German ?

		... THE PORTRAIT OF A RESOURCEFUL AND SUCCESS - FUL PUBLISHER is drawn with both pen and pencil or pen and camera in the
September	DATE	`` American Magazine . ''

		The subject of the sketch is Mr.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	, the present
Charles	PERSON	, whose latest triumph - ant exploit in drawing into his net the prize author of the day , the lion-hunter of
Sagamore Hill	LOCATION	, has excited the most widespread interest .

		The closing sentences of the eulogistic account of his work and his character may not be out of place here .

		Patient and courteous he is in a high degree , though `` he has doubtless had many experiences with business rivals as well as business associates which have tried his temper ; the publishing business is enough to try anybody 's temper .

		Of strong convictions , and vigorous ideas , it may be said that he is slow to 17-2 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, wrath , yet slow in no other process of his mind .

		He is eminently a just man , and punctiliously careful of other people 's rights ... He was for years the President of the
Publishers Association	ORGANIZATION	, and is now its Vice President , a director in several important banks , and a familiar figure in various social organizations . ''

		A DICTIONARY THAT IS CO8TINO A FORTUNE , comparable with that so generously spent by the late
George Smith	PERSON	in creating the ' Dictionary of
National Biography	ORGANIZATION	, '' has now at last come within measurable distance of its end .

		The ''
New Oxford Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, '' first undertaken by the Philological Society , but soon afterward taken charge of , in a finely disinterested spirit of scholarship , by the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	, will ultimately have cost its printers more than a quarter-million of pounds sterling .

		Sir
James Murray	PERSON	, the chief editor , has won his knighthood by his scholarly devotion to the great Dictionary , and other noted names associated with the work are those of the late Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	, of Dr.

		By a wise division of labor among these and other competent scholars the vast work has been pushed to its present advanced stage .

		By the time the last volume appears , however , our rapidly growing language will have developed ample material for a substantial supplement .

		For lexicographers , no less than for the wicked , there is no rest THE HISTORICAL EXHIBITION AT THE JERSEY CITY PUBLIC LIBRARY in connection with the Hudson-Fulton celebration hist year was of so un - usual interest , and so successful in every way that it was decided to issue an illustrated and briefly descriptive catalogue of the many family heirlooms and other noteworthy articles loaned for the occa - sion .

		In a thirty-eight-page pamphlet Miss
Esther	PERSON	.


Burdick	PERSON	, the librarian , has drawn up a careful list of these relics of a day that is dead .

		The accom - panying pictures , especially that of `` a colonial interior '' -LRB- an old-time bedroom , with canopied four - poster , antique cradle , spinning-wheel , and other quaint reminders of the past -RRB- are attractive .

		But will not this seem to some rather strange business for a library to be engaging in this usurping of the functions of the museum ?

		How does it strike the librarian of the neighboring city of
Newark	LOCATION	, who has lately made some very sensible remarks on the proper and the improper functions of the public library ?

		AN ADVERTISING MYSTERY that may have puzzled others besides the present writer presents itself in the manifest reluctance of publishers to advertise their wares in the month of
August	DATE	, when more light literature , especially fiction , is read than at any other season of the year .

		The manager of the largest book-distributing agency in
England	LOCATION	has asserted that of all the months in the
year August	DATE	is the one when novels are most in demand ; but as surely as that month comes around publishers ' advertiseraents , with few exceptions , are discontinued .

		I could name a book now , '' writes Mr.
Charles Marriott	PERSON	to the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript , '' `` well advertised up to the end of
July	DATE	, that only needs the word in season to turn a moderate success into a remark a Me one .

		With the opening of the autumn season it will be too late .

		The book ... will be swamped in tin - tide of new arrivals .

		I firmly believe that one advertisement in
August	DATE	, the holiday month , is worth ten at any other time of the year . ''

		A word to the wise .

		To be sure ,
August	DATE	has just departed .

		but other Augusts are coming .

		THE PROPOSED DICKENS TESTIMONIAL STAMP , representing a tardy royalty of one penny , and to be sold for the benefit of his descendants , some of whom are needy , would usefully and fittingly re - mind his many readers that such a man as
Charles Dickens	PERSON	was born nearly one hundred years ago .

		It is hoped to have these stamps printed and on sale at all bookshops when the centenary year comes around .

		Three of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's children and seventeen grandchildren are said to be now alive , and only three of the twenty are on the pension roll .

		If all owners of the twenty-four million copies of his works estimated as in existence should become stamp-purchasers , affixing one stamp to each vol - ume from the novelist 's pen , a handsome perhaps too handsome testimonial could be handed to the less prosperous and more deserving of the
Dickens	PERSON	family .

		But there is no probability of any such result ... A CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE IN FICTION , to which we have already directed attention , has for six years been producing itself from the untiring pen of
M. Romain Holland	PERSON	, who has just accom - plished the ninth instalment or volume of his popular ''
Jean Christophe	PERSON	. ''

		So dear to the Gallic heart is this musically talented and otherwise interesting hero that the reading public will by no means con - sent to his death , or even to his honorable retirement to the enjoyment of a peaceful and uneventful old age .

		And so
Jean Christophe	PERSON	bids fair to rival our own
Elsie Dinsmore	PERSON	in the number of volumes chronicling his progress from the cradle to the grave .

		An authorized translation of the first four books is about to appear in this country .

Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	, and even in quiet realism is never rated with the incomparable Miss

		But she did produce one piece of work that grips the reader with a sense of unmistakable and , in passages , tragic reality , her biography of

		THE DIAL 173
MR. ROOSEVELT	PERSON	'S JUXGLE BOOK .

		* Little short of superfluous would be any formal review of
Colonel Roosevelt	PERSON	's `` African Game Trails , '' after the considerable portions of it that have appeared serially and received wide reading and much discussion , and after the daily newspaper chronicle and comment during the year of the distinguished hunter 's wanderings in the
Dark Continent	ORGANIZATION	.

		All the world knows about his leaving
America	LOCATION	on the 23d - of
March , 1909	DATE	, for
Naples	LOCATION	, whence he proceeded to
Mombosa	LOCATION	, in
East Africa	LOCATION	, where , on the day after landing , he and his party boarded a railway train for '' the most interest - ing journey in the world , '' through a vast zoolog - ical garden and out to the
Kapiti Plains	LOCATION	.

		There the safari awaited the hunters '' safari '' being the native term to denote '' both the caravan with which one makes an expedition , and the expedition itself . ''

		Proceeding slowly in a generally northwestern direction , with a number of side trips for hunting purposes , and crossing the
Victoria Nyanza Lake	PERSON	, the party reached Gondokoro toward the end of
February	DATE	, and , after a few days of further hunting , started down the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	to
Khartoum	LOCATION	, where the finish - ing touches were put to the narrative of the '' great adventure , '' and the last sheet of manu - script was despatched to the printer ,
March 15 , 1910	DATE	, as planned a year before .

		All this of course makes a big book -LRB- of more than five hundred large pages -RRB- , and it is one that fairly throbs with vigor and glows with enthusiasm and is tense with the strenuousness of physical exertion .

		Perils and hardships were not lacking to try the mettle and the endurance of the hunter-naturalists ; but with an attendant train of two hundred or more servants of various kinds , and with all necessary supplies -LRB- includ - ing a travelling library -RRB- in abundance , the rigors of the wilderness journey must have been very perceptibly and agreeably softened .

		On an early page attention is called to the fact that this was noamere huntsman 's holiday , however it may have been regarded by the onlooking world at large , but '' a scientific expedition sent out by the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	, to collect birds , mammals , reptiles , and plants , but especially specimens of * AFRICAN GAME TRAILS .

		big game , for the
National Museum	ORGANIZATION	at Wash - ington . ''

		Of this seriously purposeful expedition Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	was the commander , and he wishes to impress upon the reader that no un - necessary killing of animals was indulged in .

		The interests of the
National Museum	ORGANIZATION	had to be kept in mind , and the expedition had to have its supplies of fresh meat ; but after that the denizens of the jungle , the antelope and buffalo of the plain , the birds of the air , and all the rest of the marvellously varied East African fauna , were at liberty to go their way unmolested .

		Thus at least we are repeatedly assured .

		Nevertheless the author 's final '' list of game shot with the rifle during the trip '' assumes proportions that scarcely harmonize with these assurances .

		By Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	and his son
Kermit	PERSON	alone there were bagged seventeen lions , eleven elephants , twenty rhinos -LRB- to abbreviate an otherwise unpluralizable noun -RRB- , eight hippos , nineteen zebras , fifty-three hartebeests , and so on to a '' grand total '' of five hundred and twelve animals , birds , and reptiles ; which can - not but excite our wonder at the large demands of the Museum and of the appetites of the hunter-naturalists .

		To suspect the latter of having indulged in any wanton shooting of unoffending beasts would be to question the sincerity of the author in his solemn assurances that no such barbarity was allowed . ''

		Game butchering , '' he declares , `` is as objectionable as any other form of wanton cruelty or barbarity , but to protest against all hunting of game is a sign of softness of head , and not soundness of heart . ''

		Just how much extinction of animal life is unavoidable in man 's appointed task of replenishing the earth and subduing it must always remain a more or less open question ; but it would be difficult to maintain that Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's progress -LRB- significantly traced with a red line on the map in the book -RRB- through
British East Africa	LOCATION	was indispensable to the promotion of science or to the advance of civili - zation .

		Remarkably versed in natural history though he undoubtedly is , and important though his contributions to the
National Museum	ORGANIZATION	's col - lection will justly be regarded , the whole excur - sion from start to finish was a grand holiday outing in which our exuberantly vigorous ex-President had a '' bully time , '' and freely allowed himself something of the aboriginal savage 's fierce joy in killing brute beasts .

		So why attempt to disguise the truth ?

		Instances may readily occur in which to pro- test against the taking of animal life would be a sign of soft-headedness , but in no conceivable 174 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, instance would the taking of such life be a necessary mark of the highest manhood ; more often than not it would be likely to serve as evidence of the blunting or the non-existence of the finer sensibilities .

		Many a man , unsus - pected of any softness of head , and conspicu - ously gifted with soundness of heart , has kept to the end an unconquerable shrinking from the infliction of suffering or death upon even the lowest forms of animate existence .

		To such it would have been impossible either to engage in or to describe in abhorrent detail any event like the following from Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's pen .

		It has to do with a buffalo hunt in which a number of the animals had been hit without being disabled : We now turned our attention to the wounded cow , which was close to the papyrus .

		She went down to our shots , but the reeds and marsh-grass were above our heads when we drew close to the swamp .

		Once again
Heatley	PERSON	went in with his white horse , as close as it was even reasonably safe , with the hope either of seeing the cow , or of getting her to charge him and give us a fair chance at her .

		But nothing happened and we loosed the two dogs .

		They took up the trail and went some little distance into the papyrus , where we heard them give tongue , and immediately afterward there came the angry grunt of the wounded buffalo .

		It had risen and gone off thirty yards into the papyrus , although mortally wounded the frothy blood from the lungs was actually coming out of my first bullet hole .

		Its anger now made it foolish , and it followed the dogs to the edge of the papyrus .

		Here we caught a glimpse of it .

		Down it went to our shots , and in a minute we heard the moan - ing bellow which a wounded buffalo often gives before dying .

		Immediately afterward we could hear the dogs worrying it , while it bellowed again .

		More pleasing to contemplate is the author 's kindly treatment of a much smaller and weaker bit of game , '' a wee hedgehog , with much white about it , '' which would cuddle up in his hand , snuffing busily with his funny little nose . ''

		We did not have the heart , '' he confesses , '' to turn the tame , friendly little fellow over to the na - turalists , and so we let him go . ''

		The bagging of his first full-grown male lion was naturally an important event to Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	, and he describes it in a characteristic passage .

		Equally in his unmistakable style , and recording a dis - play of cool courage worthy of a better cause , is his account of the dexterous despatch of another powerful lion that charged him with decidedly hostile intent . ''

		I was sighting carefully , from my knee , and I knew I had the lion all right ; for though he galloped at a great pace , he came on steadily ears laid back and uttering terrific coughing grunts and there was now no question of making allowance for distance , nor , as he was out in the open , for the fact that he had not before been distinctly visible .

		The bead of my fore - sight was exactly on the centre of his chest as I pressed the trigger , and the bullet went as true as if the place had been plotted with dividers .

		The blow brought him up all standing , and he fell forward on his head . ''

		Of more varied and less sanguinary interest than these successive shootings of sundry sorts of big game are the first and last parts of the book , describing the author 's memorable journey on the cow-catcher , or lion-catcher , of a loco - motive as the train sped through the
Pleisto	PERSON	- cene , '' his experiences on an East-African ranch , and his voyage down the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	.

		As illus - trating Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's more studied style let us quote the closing sentences of his preface : The hunter who wanders through these lands sees sights which ever afterward remain fixed in his mind .

		He sees the monstrous river-horse snorting and plung - ing beside the boat ; the giraffe looking over the tree tops at the nearing horseman ; the ostrich fleeing at a speed that none may rival ; the snarling leopard and coiled python , with their lethal beauty ; the zebras , barking in the moonlight , as the laden caravan passes on its night march through a thirsty land .

		In after years there shall come to him memories of the lion 's charge ; of the gray bulk of the elephant , close at hand in the sombre woodland ; of the buffalo , his sullen eyes lowering from under his helmet of horn ; of the rhi - noceros , truculent and stupid , standing in the bright sunlight on the empty plain .

		u These things can be told .

		But there are no words that can tell the hidden spirit of the wilderness , that can reveal its mystery , its melancholy , and its charm .

		There is delight in the hardy life of the open , in long rides rifle in hand , in the thrill of the fight with danger - ous game .

		Apart from this , yet mingled with it , is the strong attraction of the silent places , of the large tropic moons , and the splendor of the new stars ; where the wanderer sees the awful glory of sunrise and sunset in the wide waste spaces of the earth , unworn of man , and changed only by the slow change of the ages through time everlasting . '' ''

		He loved the great game as if he were their father '' is the smile-provoking quotation , from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle , prefixed to this remorseless record of harrying and slaughter .

		It is a book primarily for hunters , and second - arily for naturalists , with probably what will prove strong claims on the `` general reader '' ; but it will never find a place beside those quiet , loving studies of animate nature that have come to us from the leisurely pen of White , of
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	, of
Thoreau	LOCATION	, and of many others that could be named .

		Its rush and stir and stren - uousness compel the attention of the hour , but give no sure promise of anything like immortal - ity .

		It will doubtless take rank among the best-sellers , despite its bulk and price , and then , like most best-sellers , it will have had its day .

		It must not here be dismissed , however , with - out a word of warm praise for its many excel -

		`` APPRAISED BY SMITH . ''

		* `` Mentioned in ` Smith 's Catalogue Rai - sonne ' '' conveys something of the unction that the old religious lady derived from the word ''
Mesopotamia	LOCATION	. ''

		It gave her comfort and in - spired hope .

		By the same token , when the picture - dealer utters this resounding phrase in corrobo - ration of the lineage of one of his old Dutch or Flemish masterpieces , it is supposed to bring comfort and confidence to the prospective pur - chaser .

		If on the strength of this endorsement the latter buys the picture , it will probably be a satisfaction to him to possess a copy of
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's work for his own persual and to show to his friends .

		He will keep a marker at the page where the mention of his picture occurs ; will compare
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's description of the subject with his own impression of it ; note the collections to which the picture has previously belonged , the engravings , if any , that have been made of it , and the prices at which it has changed hands in the past or was appraised by
Smith	ORGANIZATION	.

		He will rehearse these particulars to his friends , point - ing in proud conclusiveness to the printed words which to those who themselves are not writers carry such a weight of importance . ''

		Smith 's Catalogue Raisonne '' has long been at a premium .

		It may be only a legend of the salesroom , but I have heard of the original and only edition of nine volumes fetching as much as
$ 1500	MONEY	.

		A copy which lies upon my desk , borrowed for purposes of comparison , was bought at public auction for close upon
$ 900	MONEY	.

		The fact of its scarcity , coupled with the prevalent notion of the importance of the work , is sufficient ex - planation of the appearance of a new edition .

		This is an absolutely direct reprint of the ori - ginal , reproduced page by page apparently by photography , for even the typographical errors of the original reappear .

		The only variation is the insertion in the new edition of a consider - able number of fairly good photogravure im - * A CATALOGUE RAISONNE of the Works of the Most Eminent Dutch , Flemish and French Painters , with a De - scription of their Principal Pictures .

		pressions of pictures described in the text .

		The reason for this scrupulous adherence to the form of the original is a good one , as far as it goes , since every reference that has been made to the work by volume , page , and number , can be identified as well in the new edition as in the old .

		The continuing value of the work as a book of reference is unimpaired .

		Meanwhile , this identity involves objections , to be mentioned later .

		Smith his name was
John	PERSON	enjoyed dur - ing the earlier part of the last century an honor - able reputation as a dealer in pictures of the schools that were then popular with collectors .

		The vogue , as he himself states , excluded the Italian schools , and embraced pictures '' of the first class '' by Dutch and Flemish masters , with a partial appreciation of French art in the persons of
Nicholas Poussin	PERSON	,
Claude Lorrain	PERSON	, and
Greuze	PERSON	.

		The first volume of his great work was published by subscription in
1829	DATE	.

		It deals with what we reckon to-day as some of the less important genre painters
Gerard Dou	PERSON	, Pietcr Van Slingelandt ,
Frank Mieris	PERSON	,
Willem Van Mieris	PERSON	,
Adrian Van Ostade	PERSON	,
Isaac Van Ostade	PERSON	, and the brilliant and vivacious
Philip Wouwer	PERSON	- inan .

		The enumeration throws an interesting light upon contemporary taste .

		The author begins with an Introduction , in which he addresses himself to collectors and pur - chasers , urging them on the one hand not to sacrifice the value of their treasures by injudi - cious cleaning and restoration , and warning them on the other against the wiles of the dealer in respect of copies and faked masterpieces .

		All of this , barring a little flavor of the rhetorical manner , reads very modernly . ''

		Connoisseurs '' of that time , it seems , were no more immune than our own from the epidemic of fraud ; per - haps our present-day victims may be able to ex - tract from this some balm of consolation .

		Thus launched upon his adventure ,
Smith	ORGANIZATION	prefaces each list of pictures with a short account of the painter .

		The one concerning Dou is principally composed of anecdotal gossip , drawn probably from
Houbraken	PERSON	, and of generalized statements about the '' finish '' of his style .

		When facts are involved , they can not be accepted without ex - amination .

		He gives , for example , the name of one of
Dou	ORGANIZATION	's teachers as
Rouwhorn	LOCATION	, instead of Couwenhorn ; and in the same volume assigns
1620	DATE	as the date of Wouwerman 's birth , although that artist was baptized in
Haarlem	LOCATION	on the
24th of May , 1619	DATE	.

		These errors are symptomatic .

		Whether they result from carelessness , or from necessary ignorance of the facts that later exact 176 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, study has revealed , they render the biographi - cal portion of the work ^ nerally unreliable .

		However , it is only fair to add that the claim of the work to perennial value is based upon the '' Catalogue Raisonne '' the description of the pictures of each painter that had come within the purview of
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's study .

		They comprise the examples at that time known to exist in the public galleries and principal private collections in
England	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	,
Belgium	LOCATION	, Ger - many , and
France	LOCATION	.

		Of these in most cases the author seems to have had first-hand knowledge and to have made the descriptions from per - sonal observation .

		Meanwhile , of other exam - ples , in galleries lying outside of his own range of travel , he frankly admits that his informa - tion has been gathered from hearsay or second - hand sources , and claims indulgence for possible or even probable errors .

		Smith 's first volume was so well received that he followed it by seven more , published in as many successive years , and finally , after a pause of five years , he issued a bulky Supplement .

		Meanwhile , in
1838	DATE	, appeared another work of somewhat corresponding scope .

		This was
Gustave Fried	PERSON	rich
Waagen	PERSON	's '' Art and Artists in
England	LOCATION	, '' better known by the title of its re-published edition -LRB- 1854 -RRB- , `` Treasures of Art in
Great Britain	LOCATION	. ''

		In his preface , Dr.
Waagen	PERSON	, alluding to
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's '' Catalogue Rai - sonne * , '' observes : '' Many opinions on pictures to which we can not assent proceed more from a regard to the possessors than from want of bet - ter judgment . ''

		To this
Smith	ORGANIZATION	naturally takes exception , and hits back at the German .

		`` An author , '' he says , `` however talented , should surely have paused before pronouncing opinions on works of art of the highest importance cal - culated to injure valuable property ; both the names of painters of high-class pictures are changed to those of inferior masters , and the state of preservation of many fine pictures is seriously misrepresented . ''

		Among the instances which
Smith	ORGANIZATION	cites of '' inferior '' attribution is the '' Christ Disputing with the Doctors '' of the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	.

		At that date it was as - signed to Leonardo da Vinci ; but subsequent criticism has confirmed the judgment of Dr.
Waagen	PERSON	that it is the work of
Luini	LOCATION	.

		It was candid of
Smith	ORGANIZATION	to quote , in the pre - face to his Supplement , Dr.
Waagen	PERSON	's criticism of himself ; for the shrewd German has exposed the bias to which a picture-dealer , however hon - est , can scarcely help leaning .

		Even if only un - consciously , he is interested in flattering his pa - trons and in extolling the value of their posses - sions , many of which have reached them through himself .

		Moreover ,
Smith	ORGANIZATION	had not the critical faculty as highly developed as Waagen .

		The latter 's work in consequence has come better through the test of modern scientific criticism .

		While the two works do not cover the same ground , though in part they overlap , the
Waagen	PERSON	is recognised to-day as the more generally ser - viceable .

		Meanwhile both of them are being put out of decisive commission by works of later and closer criticism .

		Had the new edition of
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's '' Catalogue Raisonne '' been brought up to date , its publication would have been hailed with genuine satisfaction ; but merely to reproduce it with its original errors of commission and omission seems to be an act of dubious useful - ness ; the more so that a work of definite value , based upon
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's , is now in course of being achieved .

		This is the catalogue of the most eminent Dutch painters of the seventeenth cen - tury , which is being compiled under the author - ity of the Dutch critic and historian of art , Dr.
C. Hofstede de Groot	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will consist of eight or nine volumes , two of which have been already published , while a third is to be expected shortly .

		When this is completed , it will , in conjunction with
Max Rooses	PERSON	' works on the painters of Ant - werp , relegate Smith to a position of merely antiquarian interest .

		THE DIAL 177 kept faithfully from her eighth year to the lasi days of failing health but unfading activities oJ mind and heart .

		If the comments and entries seem over-effusive , in some places , and the trib - utes almost too adulatory in tone , we musl remember that such was the atmosphere in which Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	lived for many years .

		The reader who has chanced to be among the guests at the '' Fridays '' in
Rutland Square	LOCATION	, which for thirty years were considered a feature of
Boston	LOCATION	's social and literary life , will recall the group of admir - ing friends and celebrities from abroad who clustered about Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	in her library furnished in large part by gifts of authors and artists , listening to her reminiscences of distin - guished people or urging her to recite , in her sensitive musical voice , some favorite lines of verse .

		Scores of men and women in this coun - try who have been debtors to this hostess , and many more acquaintances in
England	LOCATION	, will wel - come this biography , although to the disinter - ested critic its permanent value may not be apparent .

		In addition to its revelation of the poet 's personality , the volume furnishes several interesting thumb-nail sketches , and some excel - lent anecdotes of literary society in
Boston	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and
London	LOCATION	during the
last quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		With due acknowledgment of Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	's gifts of personal charm and poetic sentiment and refinement , few discriminating readers would ascribe to her verses that indefinable quality which we call genius .

		It is unfortunate , perhaps , that Miss Whiting begins her biog - raphy with this challenging word , as one of the implied characteristics of her subject .

		In her general treatment of Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	's poetry , however , she shows justice and reserve as well as sympathetic appreciation .

		Throughout the poems brief , delicate lyrics like `` Roses , '' ''
Laus Veneris	PERSON	, '' and '' Now and Then , '' and the artistic sonnets , fittingly compared with those of
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	and Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, were expressed rare delight in beauty , crav - ing for love , and subtle , mystic gropings for some knowledge of the invisible beyond .

		After the publication , in
1890	DATE	, of `` In the Garden of Dreams , ''
George Meredith	PERSON	wrote to Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	, '' You are getting to a mastery of the sonnet that is rare , and the lyrics are exquisite . ''

		The sonnet , `` Help Thou My Unbelief , '' was widely quoted and commended by churchmen and literary critics alike .

		Miss
Whiting	PERSON	thinks that the moods of tragic doubt and longing that assailed Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	were due in part to temperamental traits , and in part to the influence of early Calvinistic teachings in a home that otherwise abounded in whole - some and tender surroundings .

		These cravings and gropings limited her vision and gave to many of her verses a tincture of sadness of which she was conscious , for she wrote in her journal : ''
Louise Guiney	PERSON	and I are looking over my poems together .

		Oh , I wish there were more variety in them .

		They are good -LRB- I hope and think -RRB- in form , but they are , almost all , the cry of my heart for the love that I long for , or its protest against the death that I fear .

		Ah , well , I can only be myself . ''

		It was the fortune , or misfortune , of Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	to win immediate literary success , represented by extravagant praise and a sale of twenty thousand copies of her first book , '' This , That , and the Other , '' issued when she was eighteen , a potpourri of sentimental rhymes , sketches , and tales , which she had con - tributed to newspapers and annuals .

		These writings , says
Miss Whiting	PERSON	, '' were as typical of the fashion of the day as the bonnets of the forties which one finds in a dusty attic . ''

		Mar - ried at twenty to
William Upham Moulton	PERSON	, an editor and publisher of
Boston	LOCATION	, she was kindly received into local society , and her poems and prose found places in the leading periodicals .

		To the
New York	LOCATION	'' Tribune '' and ''
Indepen	PERSON	- dent '' she wrote , for several years , weekly letters of literary gossip , of the witty friendly sort , and later sent similar columns from
London	LOCATION	to the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Herald . ''

		Volumes of short stories and travel-sketches , now forgotten , had ephem - eral interest , but the prose which seems to have the most lasting charm is contained in her two volumes of `` Bedtime Stories , '' dedicated to her daughter , and beloved to-day by many mothers and children in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		In memories of her own youth and its simple noble environment of nature and love , Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	was most spontaneous and sincere .

		One of her finest lyrics , tender and strong , was '' Strength of the Hills , '' immortalizing
Pomfret	LOCATION	, Con - necticut , and her birthplace there .

		1 My thoughts go home to that old brown house With its low roof sloping down to the east , And its garden fragrant with roses and thyme That blossom no longer except in rhyme , Where the honey-bees used to feast .

		Afar in the west the great hills rose , Silent and steadfast , and gloomy and gray .

		I thought they were giants , and doomed to keep Their watch while the world should wake or sleep , Till the trumpet should sound on the judgment-day .

Moulton	PERSON	's life has many pages commemorative of her social experiences abroad , for almost without exception , from

1907	DATE	, she passed long summers in
England	LOCATION	, with side-excursions on the Continent .

		Her journals often read like the `` society column '' of a metropolitan newspaper , jottings of luncheons , dinners , and week-ends at the homes of nobility and writers , or in studios of famous artists .

		There are interesting impressions and a few anecdotes of
Browning	PERSON	,
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	,
Lord Houghton	LOCATION	,
Swinburne	LOCATION	,
George Eliot	PERSON	, Dore '' ,
Stephane Mallarme	PERSON	, and many other people of note .

		Her social activity never wholly interfered with daily literary work in some form , although her biographer says truly that this work `` was done in an atmosphere utterly in - compatible with imaginative production . ''

		Her poetry was well received in
England	LOCATION	; '' Swallow - Flights '' was published there , in
1877	DATE	, and thus favorably reviewed by the conservative '' Athenaeum '' : '' It is not too much to say of these poems that they exhibit delicate and rare beauty , marked originality , and perfection of style .

		What is still better , they impress us with a sense of subtle and vivid imagination , and that spontaneous feeling which is the essence of lyrical poetry . ''

		Miss
Whiting	PERSON	emphasizes her conviction , which is shared by many friends of Mrs.
Moult	PERSON	.

		> n. that the latter craved and prized the companionship of talented and interesting people more than she cared for society , in the usual restricted meaning of that word .

		Her conditions of life and personal graces brought her into close acquaintance with people of talent whose homes were affluent and hospitable , but her kindliness and genuine sympathy with humanity 1 impelled her to give as cordial a welcome to the obscure and those in need of help and encourage - ment as she gave to the wealthy and famous .

		Her correspondence in her later years was bur - densome , often increased by appeals for aid and advice in literary work , and to such inquirers she gave generously of her time and suggestions .

		She exemplified in her life her words found in a chapter on `` The Gospel of Charm '' in '' Ourselves and Our Neighbors '' : M So many new gospels are being preached , and that so strenuously , to the girls and women of the twentieth oentnry , that I have wondered if there might not be a danger lest the
Gospel of Charm	ORGANIZATION	should be neglected .

		And yet to my mind there are few teachings more important I would advocate no charm that was insin - cere , and none that would loscn tin - happiness of any other woman ; but the fact remains that the slightest act may be done with a graciousness that warms the day , or with a hard indifference that almost repels us from goodness itself .

		It is possible to buy a newspaper or pay a oar-fare in such wise as to make newsboy or car-conductor feel for the moment that he is in a friendly world . ''

		The last chapter of
Miss Whiting	LOCATION	's volumr contains a list of the books , to be known as the
Moulton Collection	ORGANIZATION	, which have been acquired as a legacy by the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, with valuable comments and inscriptions chosen by Professor
Arlo Bates	PERSON	, a loyal friend and literary co-worker of Mrs.

		BOCCACCIO AND HIS DK < \ M 1 HON. * So much new literature about
Boccaccio	PERSON	and the Decameron attests a growing impression of the man and his work as deserving of serious study .

		The popular notion of him as a naughty writer will no doubt subsist .

		The Decameron will remain taboo to the little moralist and the short - sighted censor , and will continue to be placed , with ''
Tom Jones	PERSON	'' and ``
Roderick Random	PERSON	, '' and Maupassant , and , alas !

		Montaigne , upon that schoolboy list of guilty tidbits which is so mysteriously passed down from generation to generation .

		This is regrettable ; but it can not be helped , and it can not put the Decameron upon the Indejr ejyuryutorius of any healthy mind .

		Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	, in the preface to his bio - graphical study of
Boccaccio	LOCATION	, disclaims the intention to apologize for or to defend his subject . ''

		His life , the facts of his life , his love , his humanity , and his labours , plentifully set forth in this work , will defend him with the simple of heart more eloquently than I could hope to do .

		And it might seem that one who exhausted his little patrimony in the acquire - ment of learning , who gave Homer back to us , who founded or certainly fixed Italian prose , who was the defender of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, the passionate BOCCACCIO .

		THE DIAL 179 defender of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, and who died in the pursuit of knowledge , should need no defence anywhere from anyone . ''

		The tone of the champion is not absent from this declaration of faith .

		We know very well what the writer 's opinion is of
Boccaccio	PERSON	's detractors .

		But he attempts no repression of those facts which can not be brought into accord with our sexual code ; they are to be taken into account with the other facts in making up our final estimate of the man .

		If the story of
Boccaccio	PERSON	and
Fiammetta	PERSON	is told very fully , and indeed with a kind of gusto , not less pains and enthusiasm are expended upon the events of
Boccaccio	PERSON	's more mature experience .

		Though his enjoyment of youth was superabundant , age drew upon him apace .

		At thirty-seven he was alone in the world .

		His few relatives , his
Fiammetta	PERSON	, were all dead . ''

		He had seen Flor - ence run with blood , and every sort of torture and horror stalk abroad at
Naples	LOCATION	.


Rome	LOCATION	, if he ventured there , can have appeared to him little less than a shambles .

		Rienzi , with all that hope , had come and vanished like a ghost .

		The fairest province in
Italy	LOCATION	lay under the heel of a bar - barian invader . ''

		Finally came the plague a final blow to the optimist the plague which was to supply a strange setting for his prose masterpiece .

		`` The Decameron , '' says Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	, `` is an absolute work of art , as ' detached ' as a play of Shakespeare or a portrait by
Velasquez	PERSON	.

		The scheme is formal and immutable , a miracle of design in which almost everything can be ex - pressed . ''

		But he admits that the
Canterbury Tales	ORGANIZATION	equal the Decameron in design , and far excel it in characterization .

		Boccaccio 's story - tellers are not individualized ; they are little more than mouthpieces .

		And he -LRB- with some - what unneccessary reluctance -RRB- admits that the Decameron '' lacks a certain idealism , a certain moral sense which is never absent from English work , and which , even from a purely aesthetic point of view , would have given a sort of balance or sense of proportion to the book which , I con - fess , in my weaker moments , it has sometimes seemed to me it lacks . ''

		It would have been better for Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	to acknowledge this lack cheerfully , offsetting against it , by way of con - solation , a lack of the hypocrisy often present in English work .

		Whatever its demerits , this biog - raphy is a spirited and sincere piece of work .

		The four-volume reprint of the Decameron edited by Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	for the '' Tudor Trans - lations '' series is a model of typographical dignity and beauty .

		The text is a reprint of the first English translation that approximated completeness .

		It was published in
London	LOCATION	in
1620	DATE	by
Isaac Jaggard	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	calls it the first `` practically complete '' edition in English , and says that it is `` translated inaccurately but very splendidly , apparently from the French version of Antoine Le
Macon	LOCATION	. '' ''

		Practically complete '' seems a sweeping phrase to use of a version which omits entire tales and so garbles and Bowdlerizes others as to make them hardly recognizable .

		For instance , the tale of Rustico and Alibech may be more amusing than edify - ing , or may be adjudged neither ; but to have it absolutely omitted , and a long moral tale sub - stituted , is to take the name of the translator in vain .

		Many of the other tales are rather adapted than rendered ; and the splendor of the transla - tion , where it is a translation , is not sufficiently overwhelming to make up for our deprivations .

		The English is rather cumbrous and halting in comparison with that later translation , also anonymous , which appeared in
1741	DATE	, and which formed the basis of what must be considered the standard English version .

		The other two books in the present group offer the results of research rather than of criti - cism .

		Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's attempt has been '' to give a concise but as far as possible complete account of the sources of the tales in
Boccaccio	LOCATION	's Decam - eron , with notices of the various parallels and analogues . ' '

		No previous attempt has been made to do just this thing , and the result is a book invaluable to students of
Boccaccio	PERSON	and his period .

		One by one the tales are taken up , the sources , analogues , and obvious imitations in contemporary and subsequent literature dis - cussed , with a synopsis of many of the variants .

		One is given practically a series of independent notes on each of the novels ; they are all readable as literature , as well as packed with information .

		Miss Jones 's ''
Boccaccio	PERSON	and his Imitators '' is a drier and narrower product of modern re - search .

		There is a brief and somewhat conven - tional introductory essay on the subject ; for the rest , the investigator is content to tabulate her results .

		There is a table to determine the relative popularity of the tales on the basis of the number of imitations registered .

		There is another table giving a summary of the
Boccac	PERSON	- cio tales imitated by ten authors , selected two by two from
Germany	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	, '' to show the wide geographical dis - tribution of these tales of the Decameron , '' etc. .

		Altogether , we find tabulated some 850 imi - tations of the Decameron tales .

		It can not be denied that there is a humorous 180 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, aspect to this painstaking and spectacled grub - bing among the bones and the dust of the joyous Decameron .

		For a joyous book it is , though marred for the Anglo-American reader by the acrid tang of a sensualism a variety of sen - sualism peculiar to the Latin races .

		And yet it is well for us to to be advised from time to time that this story-teller was no mere trifler , but a man of generous mould , whose propor - tions grow rather than dwindle as time passes .

BOYNTON	LOCATION	.

		A CONFEDERATE 'S HISTORY OF THE CIVIL , WAR .

		* It must be premised that Mr.
Eggleston	PERSON	, author of the latest history of our Civil War , served in the Confederate army , and that the writer of this review also spent four years in the same service .

		Whatever the author 's Southern proclivities may have been , he seems to have approached his task in a spirit of fairness and impartiality , in which he has doubtless been aided by his long residence in the North since the war ; he has tried to divest himself of pre - judice , and to hold the scales of justice evenly .

		The work is divided into two books , of which the first , comprising 173 pages , treats of `` The Causes of the War , '' and the second of '' The Conduct of the War . ''

		It is hard to treat the causes of the war impartially , even at this day , although the author says : '' The passions of the war are completely gone .

		Even in politics , war prejudices no longer play a part worth consider - ing '' -LRB- p. 11 -RRB- .

		This is probably in the main correct , notwithstanding the recent sporadic ebullition of `` war prejudices '' over the erec - tion of a statue of General Lee at the
Capitol	LOCATION	.

		Only one other criticism on the first book , and I pass to the second and by far the more impor - tant one .

		The author says : As for the ex - tremists -LSB- / .

		e. , of the South -RSB- , they anticipated military commissions and political preferment for themselves , and they cared for little else than to occupy a conspicuous place in public attention for a little while '' -LRB- p. 172 -RRB- .

		The present reviewer was of full age when he entered the Southern service , and he saw nothing of what is here charged .

		In fact , he has always regarded the action of his comrades , in
April , 1861	DATE	, as purely unselfish and patriotic ; and time has in no wise changed his views .

		THR HISTORY or
THK	ORGANIZATION	CoNriiDKRATR WAR : lu
Cauaw	ORGANIZATION	and ita Conduct .

		A
Narrative and Critical History	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
George Car	PERSON	?

		Egglerton .

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In treating the conduct of the war , the author follows the usual chronological order .

		In his chapter on
Fort Sumter	LOCATION	, he says : '' At the South , practically all the able-bod ie < l yonnjj men were enlisted in what were then called * volunteer companies / though it did not yet appear in what cause they were supposed to be volunteering '' -LRB- p. 187 -RRB- .

		The present reviewer was one of that class , and he thinks he knew perfectly well in what cause he was volunteer - ing ; and he was not wiser than his comrades .

		That remark might well have been omitted .

		The author speaks of the
Buchanan	PERSON	adminis - tration as `` seemingly at least , promising the early evacuation of Fort Sumter . ''

		There was no '' seemingly '' about it , even after
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's inauguration .

		We all remember
Seward	ORGANIZATION	's noted telegram : `` Faith fully kept ; wait and see . ''

		We waited , and we saw ; but we did not see '' faith fully kept , '' but something very different .

		The '' pepper-box strategy '' of the Federal government in
1861	DATE	is commented on , and an account is given of the first battle of
Manassas	LOCATION	-LRB- Bull Run -RRB- , with the Confederate mistake of not pressing on to
Washington	LOCATION	, and the conse - quent '' paralysis of victory '' on the part of the Confederates .

		A chapter on '' The European Menace '' follows .

		There was never any real prospect of European intervention .

		It was a Deus ex machina for which the Confederates were always wrongly hoping ; but if they had discarded all thought of it , and trusted entirely to their own arms ; it would have been better for them .

		The chapter on '' Border Operations , '' in its conclusion , touches upon the formation of the
State of West Virginia	LOCATION	a thoroughly unconstitutional operation from every point of view , but , like the emancipation of the slaves , defended , as President Lincoln always con - tended , as a war-measure .

		The importance of the blockade is rightly emphasized , for without it the
United States	LOCATION	could never have hoped to be successful .

		-LRB- In this chapter the misprint '' Pocotatigo , '' for Pocotaligo , occurs three times . -RRB-

		What the author denominates '' the era of incapacity '' follows , in which
Halleck	PERSON	is greatly depreciated and
Grant	ORGANIZATION	magnified ; but
Halleck	PERSON	had at least written a book on strategy , in which he showed himself familiar \ vith its theory , while Grant had not yet shown what was in him .

		As soon as President
Lincoln	PERSON	found Grant out , there were no more domineer - ings by
Halleck	PERSON	, who sank to his proper level .

		The author scarcely ^ i \ r > the importance it tle > erVCS to till ' fl .

		` Mtll -LRB- if AllxTt SMlley I Hot
Sydney	LOCATION	-RRB-
Johnston	PERSON	at
Shiloh	LOCATION	.

		But for that
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 181 event ,
Shiloh	ORGANIZATION	would undoubtedly have been a Confederate victory the first day , and there would have been no need for the second day 's battle which
Beauregard	ORGANIZATION	lost to
Buell	ORGANIZATION	's fresh troops .

		The war in the West is treated in better perspective than that in the
East	LOCATION	, where the exploits of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the Potomac and of the
Army of Northern Virginia	ORGANIZATION	are chiefly dwelt upon .

		After Farragut 's capture of
New Orleans	LOCATION	in which chapter
Butler	PERSON	receives a few well - deserved touches we return to Mc - Clellan , who had been all winter getting ready for his
Richmond	LOCATION	campaign .

		It should be remarked , in passing , that
Fredericksburg	LOCATION	is not on the Potomac -LRB- p. 356 -RRB- , and that
Joseph E. Johnston	PERSON	himself made the stand at
Williams	ORGANIZATION	- burg in order to give his wagon-train time to retire -LRB- p. 357 -RRB- .

		The author rightly remarks that ''
McClellan	PERSON	was not
Grant	PERSON	, nor such as he '' -LRB- p. 359 -RRB- ; but he seems to forget that Grant had not yet been developed .

		And he might have recalled Grant 's own words , in which he said that neither he , nor General
Sherman	PERSON	, nor any officer known to him in the war , could have done better than
McClellan	PERSON	did under the con - ditions in which the latter was placed in his operations on the
Peninsula	LOCATION	.

		If Mr.
Eggleston	PERSON	had read the work of the late Colonel Allan on ''
Jackson	PERSON	's Valley Cam - paign , '' he would have obtained a clearer view of that stirring event , and especially of the cause of Secretary
Benjamin	PERSON	's order which induced
Jackson	PERSON	's resignation .

		The order re - ferred to was due to the request of
General Loring	ORGANIZATION	to be ordered back from
Romney	LOCATION	to
Winchester	LOCATION	; and the only result of it was the relief of
Loring	ORGANIZATION	from service with
Jackson	PERSON	.

		Too much is made of this incident .

		Benjamin did not '' sacrifice '' anything that ''
Jackson	PERSON	's energy and genius had accomplished in the
Valley	LOCATION	. ''


Jackson	PERSON	continued `` master of the Valley , '' and nobody was discouraged , except perhaps some of
Loring	PERSON	's troops who thought they had been hardly dealt with .

		Having been
Jackson	PERSON	's Ordnance officer in
the Valley	LOCATION	, the writer of this review saw something of the '' snow and sleet and slush and mud . ''


Jack	PERSON	- son did not have the troops that would have justified an invasion of
Maryland	LOCATION	and
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania ; he was merely '' bluffing , '' as was his wont .

		While Secretary
Benjamin	PERSON	is to blame for yielding to
General Loring	ORGANIZATION	's request , and directing
Jackson	PERSON	to order
Loring	PERSON	back to
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	, thus overriding both
Jackson	PERSON	and
Johnston	PERSON	, it is doubtful if anything was lost by it , for Romney was not '' the strategic key to the position . ''

		It was a mere outpost , and
Jackson	PERSON	would undoubtedly soon have ordered
Loring	PERSON	back ; but this does not excuse Secretary
Benjamin	PERSON	's action .

		The reviewer would like to dwell on
Jackson	PERSON	's Valley campaign , which he went through to the end ; but lack of space forbids .

		Next we have accounts of the Seven Days ' Battles , the
Second Manassas Campaign	ORGANIZATION	, and Lee 's First Invasion of
Maryland	LOCATION	; but the treat - ment is very meagre especially of the last campaign , which involved one of the best-fought battles of the war -LRB-
Antietam	LOCATION	-RRB- , where the Con - federates had but about 36,000 men against
McClellan	PERSON	's 90,000 .

		McClellan 's mistake was in not putting in more men , for they were there .

		We fought from daylight to 9 a. m. , resisting successively
Hooker	PERSON	,
Mansfield	LOCATION	, and
Sedgwick	PERSON	, when we were at last forced back on the left , but not far , and as soon as some of McLaws 's troops came up from
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry the
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- erals were forced back across the
Hagerstown	LOCATION	pike , where they stayed until we retired the
second night	TIME	, and recrossed the Potomac after sunrise .

		In the chapter on the Seven Days * Battles -LRB- p. 400 -RRB- , `` twenty-seventh '' is wrongly printed for twenty-sixth ; it is important to be accurate as to the day here .

		The author says -LRB- p. 407 -RRB- : ''
Magruder	PERSON	and Huger failed Lee at the crisis '' ; but to these
Jackson	PERSON	himself should be added , for he too failed on this day -LRB-
June 30	DATE	-RRB- to do what was expected of him .

		The battle of
Malvern Hill	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
July 1	DATE	-RRB- should never have been fought ; it was fought by detachments until ten p. m. , rather than nine , with no result but the loss of many brave men .

		The author calls Pope '' a good and active officer , unfortunately given to vainglorious boastings '' -LRB- p. 417 -RRB- ; but I can not concur in this commendation , for he wrecked a body of good troops when he should have gained the day at the second battle of
Manassas	LOCATION	.

		Lincoln 's opinion of Pope is shown by his action in restoring
McClellan	PERSON	to com - mand ; but the latter 's treatment was `` hard lines '' after his relief of
Maryland	LOCATION	from Lee 's invasion .

		While
McClellan	PERSON	was slow , he was certainly capable , which can not be said of his successor ,
Burnside	PERSON	, who persisted in '' butting his head against a stone wall '' and suffered the bloody repulse of
Fredericksburg	LOCATION	.

		After a brief account of this exploit , the author continues his narrative of the war in the
West	LOCATION	.

		Here , as elsewhere in the work , a more plentiful sprinkling of dates would be 182 THE DIAL .

		16 , desirable , and a reasonable supply of maps would have helped the narrative , for `` chron - ology and geography are the eyes of history . ''

		Bragg is `` let off easy '' for his
Kentucky	LOCATION	cam - paign , the only result of which was `` a rich booty of supplies , '' when so much had been expected from it .

		It is very true that the dis - proportionate numbers of
Bragg	LOCATION	and
Buell	PERSON	must be taken into consideration , but it does seem that with better management
Buell	PERSON	might have been prevented from reaching
Louisville	LOCATION	.

		The subsequent battle of
Murfreesboro	LOCATION	, between
Bragg	ORGANIZATION	and
Rosecrans	PERSON	, may be rightly called a drawn battle ; but the Confederacy could not afford to fight drawn battles .

		We now travel East again , to the field of
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	, -LRB- Vol .

		II. , p. 83 -RRB- , where
Hooker	PERSON	had 180,000 men against Lee 's 60,000 , for but two divisions of Longstreet 's corps -LRB- McLaws 's and
Anderson	PERSON	's -RRB- were with Lee .

		-LRB- It may be remarked , in passing , that Lee 's soldiers did not call him '' Mas ' Bob '' -LRB- p. 89 -RRB- , but '' Mas ' Robert '' ; though writers often make this mis - take . -RRB-

		An interesting account of the
Chancel	LOCATION	- lorsville battle is given , which , however , requires one or two corrections . ''


Hanover Court House	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- p. 100 -RRB- should be '' Hanover Junction '' ; and u Culpeper '' -LRB- p. 101 -RRB- would have been a bad route to take to reach
Richmond	LOCATION	, it being on the road to
Washington	LOCATION	, where
Hooker	PERSON	could have easily headed off Lee even without cavalry .

		The author quotes
Dodge	ORGANIZATION	's '' Campaign of
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	, '' but he should also have read
Allan	PERSON	's book on the same subject .

		The chief defect in the treatment of this battle is the failure to mention that
Hooker	PERSON	was stunned by a shell striking a post against which he was leaning , which seriously affected his power of thought at a critical moment .

		The next in command ,
General Couch	ORGANIZATION	, should have directed the fight thereafter , but does not seem to have done so .

		Following this battle , we have an account of the
Gettysburg	LOCATION	campaign , the events of which are familiar to all readers of military history .

		Here I must take exception to the author 's use of an expression in speaking of General
Stuart	PERSON	, `` who had no discretion . ''

		Stuart had much discretion , as was shown at
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	, when he took command of
Jackson	PERSON	's corps at the latter 's request ; but in his march to
Carlisle	LOCATION	he met with obstacles that he had not antici - pated .

		Too much has been made of
Stuart	PERSON	's absence from the main army on this march .

		Ewell '' should read `` Hill , '' on p. 135 ; for
Ewell	PERSON	joined Hill later in the day on the left , Hill having brought on the battle of
July 1	DATE	. -RRB-

		The author rightly says -LRB- p. 143 -RRB- : '' Long - street 's support of Lee 's plan of battle seems to have lacked something of efficiency the lack of which may have been determinative of results . ''

		This is putting it mildly .

		Longstreet 's advice had been overridden , and as a consequence his heart was not in the fight .

		The battle was not fought with the force that General Lee intended , and it was therefore a predestined failure .

		The author closes the chapter with a comment on the inactivity after
Gettysburg	LOCATION	: '' The where - fore of this inactivity has never been explained '' -LRB- p. 150 -RRB- .

		To anyone who was there it seems patent enough .

		Men are not machines , and superhuman efforts can not be kept up indefi - nitely .

		Next we have an account of the
Vicksburg	LOCATION	campaign , with certain comments on '' the state of things after
Gettysburg	LOCATION	. ''

		The author ex - aggerates the conduct of ''
Winder	PERSON	's men , '' the provost-guard of
Richmond	LOCATION	-LRB- p. 179 -RRB- .

		The present reviewer got to
Richmond	LOCATION	very seldom during the war , although his home was within twenty-five miles of it ; but if he had ever gone without a written leave , he deserved to be ar - rested .

		The events following
Gettysburg	LOCATION	must be greatly condensed in this brief review .

		The struggle for
Charleston	LOCATION	is followed by the
Chickamauga	LOCATION	and
Chattanooga	LOCATION	campaigns .

		There must always be a scapegoat for lack of success , and
Bragg	LOCATION	now served the purpose ; so , after
Grant	PERSON	's success at
Chattanooga	LOCATION	, though it was partly accidental , Gen.
Joseph E. Johnston	PERSON	was put in command of the Confed - erate Western army .

		He conducted an admir - able defensive campaign from
Dalton	LOCATION	to
Atlanta	LOCATION	.

		But the South wanted an advance , not a retreat ; so when
Johnston	PERSON	reached
Atlanta	LOCATION	, President
Davis	PERSON	committed the astonishing blun - der -LRB- though urged to it by those in whom he had confidence -RRB- of relieving him of his command and replacing him with Hood an excellent fighter as a division commander , but totally unequal to the responsibilities placed upon him , as was later seen .

		Grant was transferred to
Virginia	LOCATION	at the opening of the campaign of
1864	DATE	; and now began the struggle between the two great lead - ers , the one with overwhelming resources of both men and means , the other with neither men nor means for the emergency .

		The result was inevitable .

		The battles of the
Wilderness	ORGANIZATION	,
Spotsylvania	LOCATION	,
Hanover	LOCATION	Junction , -LRB- ' < > !

		< !

		ll : irbor , followed in quick succession , until although the
summer	DATE	was not over '' this line '' was
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 183 abandoned for one that could have been reached by water without the loss of a man , and the two armies settled down to the siege of
Petersburg	LOCATION	, which consumed nearly another year .

		Mean - while
Sherman	PERSON	, finding nothing to oppose him when Hood started on his '' wild-goose '' trip to
Nashville	LOCATION	, was enabled to take his holiday jaunt to
Savannah	LOCATION	, himself furnishing a forceful illus - tration of his adage , `` War is hell . ''

		There is an interesting account of '' Early 's Valley Campaign , '' in which the reviewer participated and which he would like to discuss did space allow .

		But Early 's troops were needed at
Petersburg	LOCATION	, and took part in that siege during the last tragic months .

		The line was stretched until it snapped , and after
Appomattox	LOCATION	all was over .

		With certain corrections , some of which have been noted , Mr.
Eggleston	PERSON	's book will serve as a good compendium of the history of the war .

		It has the advantage over some that have been written , in that it covers the whole field .

		Doubt - less some portions would have been treated in greater detail if it had not been necessary to con - dense the narrative .

		As a Confederate soldier , the reviewer can commend the impartiality with which the work is written ; and I think a
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eral soldier will find little , if anything , to object to , except perhaps in the under-estimate of
General Early	ORGANIZATION	's numbers in his Valley cam - paign .

		Having been Ordnance officer of the largest division in Early 's army , I well know the force with which the battle of Winchester -LRB-
Sept. 19 , 1864	DATE	-RRB- was fought : about 9,500 muskets .

		Adding officers -LRB- proportionately very few at that period -RRB- and artillery and cavalry , 15,000 would be an over-estimate , against
Sheridan	PERSON	's 45,000 men of all arms .

		It is , in fact , a series of informal jottings , odd bits culled here and there from the varied adventures of a journalist , whose occupation has brought him in contact with many aspects of

		Among these last was
John Hay	PERSON	, who , upon once being asked by Mr.
Milne	PERSON	whether he was sorry to leave Lon - don , quoted
Johnson	PERSON	's saying : '' Why , sir , you find no man at all intellectual who is willing to leave
London	LOCATION	.

		No , sir , when a man is tired of
London	LOCATION	he is tired of life . ''

		This anecdote , recalled in con - nection with Mr.
Milne	PERSON	's pleasure in coming to live in the very heart of the city , suggests a comment of
Mark Twain	PERSON	's on Hay 's `` Prairie Bell '' ; while a description of
London	LOCATION	roofs at night brings back an
evening	TIME	when the author of '' Wee Macgreegor '' shared the weird sight , and incidentally told how he met the little ``
Glasgow	LOCATION	pickle `` named Macgreegor , who was the original of his famous character .

		Again
Gladstone	PERSON	's statue in
Westminster	LOCATION	is the peg upon which hangs a characterization of the great states - man based on personal acquaintance , a description of his way of speaking , and an account of the visit of Li Hung
Chang	PERSON	to
England	LOCATION	's Grand Old Man .

		The place to see royalty to advantage is not
London	LOCATION	; Mr.
Milne	PERSON	takes us to
Balmoral	LOCATION	for that , reproduc - ing the impressions of homely Highlanders , and showing kings , queens , and princes enjoying them - selves quite like other people .

		`` What
London	LOCATION	Reads '' is the title of a chapter enlivened by anec - dotes from the stores of some cynical booksellers .

		`` Those Dear Americans '' is full of dangerous generalizations and some amusing misconceptions , underlaid with keen interest in us and cordial appre - ciation of our breezy directness .

		Altogether Mr.
Milne	PERSON	has filled his summer in town with real and varied interests , which his readers will enjoy shar - ing .

		The Influence of standpoint
Darwin on Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	, and Other in philosophy .

		Essays in Contemporary Thought '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , Professor
John Dewey	PERSON	has collected a series of essays and addresses dealing with various aspects of the pragmatic movement in philosophy .

		The majority of these papers have previously appeared in one or another of the technical journals of philo - sophy .

		It is to the clientele of such journals , rather than to the `` general reader '' that they are adapted both in matter and in manner , but particularly in manner .

		The treatment is often rather severely metaphysical .

		To one somewhat out of practice in this particular kind of intellectual gymnastics the following of the subtleties of metaphysical discus - sions is a rather difficult business .

		Thus it is not immediately clear in what manner the following statement regarding the mutual relation conceived by the author to exist between a rose and its smell helps one either to understand or to enjoy a beauti - ful rose : '' The import of the smell is the indicating and demanding relation which it sustains to the enjoyment of the rose as its fulfilling experience ; while this enjoyment is just the content or definition of what the rose consciously meant , i. e. , meant to mean . ''

		One must hasten to say , however , that even though Professor
Dewey	PERSON	's style may not always in matters of detail be the most lucid in the world , these essays do form a real contribution to contem - porary thought .

		They give a critical and conserv - ative exposition of the pragmatic standpoint re - 184 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, garding a number of the fundamental problems of philosophy ; such , for example , as the nature of truth , the basis of morals , the problem of knowledge , and the relation of belief to knowledge .

		The first essay gives the main title to the collection .

		Perhaps nowhere has the essential nature of the great and far-reaching effect which
Darwin	PERSON	's work had upon all modern thought been so succinctly and happily expressed as it is in the following words which form the concluding summary of this first essay : ``
Intel	ORGANIZATION	- lectual progress usually occurs through sheer aban - donment of questions together with both of the alter - natives they assume an abandonment that results from their decreasing vitality and a change of urgent interest .

		We do not solve them : we get over them .

		Old questions are solved by disappearing , evaporating , while new questions corresponding to the changed attitude of endeavor and preference take their place .

		Doubtless the greatest dissolvent in contemporary thought of old questions , the greatest precipitant of new methods , new intentions , new problems , is the one effected by the scientific revo - lution that found its climax in the Origin of Species . ' ''

		`` Sketches and Snapshots '' -LRB- Duf - field -RRB- contains fifty-five articles , largely reminiscent of noted persons now deceased , partly also of a political-historical character , and occasionally de - voted to literary criticism .

		The most considerable and most important chapter in the book has to do with
Gladstone	PERSON	, whom the author knew well , both as a man and as a public character , and whom he greatly admired .

		Other personages , of more inter - est to English than to American readers , are treated in more or less detail .

		Coming to matters of literary and miscellaneous interest , we catch as we turn the pages the following sentence , commendable in its sentiment : '' To ' speak the tongue that Shake - speare spake * is a stronger title to the world 's regard than the possession of all the bloated arma - ments that delirium ever conceived , or the reddest of red lines ever traced across a subjected
Conti	PERSON	- nent . ''

		Seasonable and likely to touch responsive chords is this concerning a world-language : '' But what is that language to be ?

		Esperanto ?

		A thou - sand times , No ; for unless it is remarkably unlike all other languages , Esperanto must be learnt ; and I have no mind to replace myself , in tottering age , under the linguistic discipline which oppressed my youth . ''

		In literary themes the author will meet with some occasional dissent on the reader 's part , as of course he will expect to do .

		A paper devoted to
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	makes this most Greek of English poets to be of the school and of the lineage of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	.

		Thus to couple the author of IVter Bell '' and the author of `` Empedocles on Ktna '' as poets of the same school will seem to many as emphasizing too strongly the common ele - ment of nature-love in the two .

		In so varied and comprehensive a volume as Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's he will be hard to please who can not find something to suit his taste .

		An Englith That something original can still be account of done by one writing about the Civil our Civil War , War fa ^ been ghown by Mf
John Formby	PERSON	, an English writer , whose two-volume work on `` The American Civil War : A Concise History of its Causes , Progress , and Results '' -LRB-
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has just appeared .

		The arrangement of the work is unique .

		The author divides the field of opera tions into the following > r < - tions :
Kast	PERSON	.

		Southeast .

		South ,
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	, and
West	LOCATION	.

		Each chapter relat - ing to the war covers a half year , and at the end of the chapter is placed a chronological table to show the progress of events in each section .

		The aim is so to arrange the account that the reader can keep in mind the entire field of operations , conse - quently each chapter takes up in turn the military operations of each section , with footnotes and cross - references on each page to show what is taking place elsewhere the blockade , the war at sea , affairs in
Mexico	LOCATION	, etc. .

		Each chapter closes with estimates of the leaders on both sides , of the gains and losses of each combatant , and a short summary .

		In order to avoid confusion , Confederate names and titles are printed in italics .

		The maps , sixty-five in number and very good ones , are printed in a separate volume , and are standardized as to scale the first time that this has been done .

		Throughout the volume of narrative frequent references are made to the maps .

		The unusual arrangement of the text destroys its unity , though it undoubtedly adds to the value of the work for one making a close study of the campaigns .

		The style is at times involved .

		The views of the author are always interesting and sometimes original .

		His tracing of the causes which led to the war is not of much value , and the same may be said of the brief sketch of Reconstruction .

		On the other hand the importance of the French intrigues in
Mexico	LOCATION	is properly shown , and the Mexican affairs are well woven into the account of the general situation .

		Some of Mr.
Formby	PERSON	's conclusions and opinions are inn-r - esting .

		For example , he asserts that the contest was decided in the really vital part of the country between the
Mississippi River	LOCATION	and the Appalachian - .

		and that the great campaigns of the
East	LOCATION	were < liu - mainly to political and sentimental considerations .

		The Confederacy , he says , had three chances of suc - cess : the first , to win by force of arms , was lost at
Murfreesboro	LOCATION	in
December , 1862	DATE	; the second , to win through recognition by foreign states , was lost at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	in
1863	DATE	; and the third , to win by tiring out
the North	ORGANIZATION	, was lost when
Johnston	PERSON	was replaced by Hood in
1864	DATE	.

		If the Confederacy

		THE DIAL 185 could have built an efficient marine engine the au - thor believes that its chances for success would have been greatly increased .

		As it was , the strong Con - federate ironclads could not be maneuvered .

		The Confederate military organization was , however , superior to the
Federal	ORGANIZATION	, for in it each officer exer - cised command appropriate to his rank , and quar - rels over seniority were therefore infrequent .

		Some of the judgments expressed about the military lead - ers are of interest : Pope was `` a most able offi - cer , '' in spite of his erratic speech ;
Rosecrans	PERSON	was '' the best minor strategist the war produced '' ;
Buell	PERSON	and
McDowell	PERSON	were fine generals who were not allowed proper opportunities ;
Sidney Johnston	PERSON	is not highly regarded ;
Sheridan	PERSON	and
Hardee	PERSON	`` never found their limit '' ; Early was an `` extraordinary '' general ; McClernand was one of the ablest of gen - erals but `` the worst of politicals '' ; Semmes was unequalled for the making and carrying out of large designs ;
Halleck	PERSON	was jealous , vindictive , obstinate , and untrustworthy ;
Joe Johnston	PERSON	and other engineer generals were prone to the defensive ;
Sherman	PERSON	`` was the cleverest intellect brought to bear on the war '' ; Lee was prejudiced in favor of
Virginia	LOCATION	generals .

		Pen portraits '' Mad Shepherds , and Other Human of rustic Studies '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , by Mr.
L. P. Jacks	PERSON	, oddities .

		editor of The Hibbert Journal , '' belongs to that class of quietly realistic , semi - humorous , and semi-pathetic delineation of humble humanity that can almost be said to have come into being within the
last decade	DATE	, and to which Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	-LRB- in his sketches entitled collectively `` A Motley '' -RRB- and Mr.
Edward Thomas	PERSON	-LRB- in his '' Rest and Unrest '' -RRB- have very recently made note - worthy contributions .

		The plot and the continuity of the formal novel are lacking to these delicate little fabrications ; but the artistic touch , the insight , the creative imagination , and the tender sentiment of the romancer are present .

		How true to their originals such characters as the Mad Shepherds may be , or how far idealized and beautified , one can not say ; but at any rate they convey the impression of reality viewed with the eyes of loving tenderness and large charity , and presented with artistic detach - ment and literary skill .

		What reader of books and student of human nature could fail to find rich enter - tainment in Mr.
Jack	PERSON	's atheist shoemaker of whom we are told that '' the boots of labourers out of work and of other unfortunates he mended free of cost , regularly devoting to this purpose that part of the Sabbath which was not occupied in proving the non - existence of God , '' and who , as one of his cronies said of him , '' spent his breath in proving that God does n't exist , and his life in proving that He does '' ?

		A baker 's dozen of these captivating little character - studies , all breathing a sense of the mysteries and the sublimities of our common lot , are embraced in the little volume , which is provided with a frontispiece portrait of ''

Andrew D. White	PERSON	has made a care - ful study of '' Seven Great Statesmen in the Warfare of Humanity with Unreason '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which he appropriately dedicates to the memory of another champion of humanity , the late
Goldwin Smith	ORGANIZATION	.

		Statesmen of the European continent rather than of
England	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	have been chosen because , as the author says , `` the great leaders of our own country and of
Great Britain	LOCATION	have already been fully and admirably portrayed for the American student of history , '' and also because , he continues , '' my early years abroad were spent mainly upon the European continent , and public duties since have led me to make prolonged stays in various
Continental	ORGANIZATION	states
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, the Nether - lands ,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	where the study of Continen - tal statesmen has been almost forced upon me . ''

		Of the seven statesmen selected for portraiture ,
Sarpi	LOCATION	,
Grotius	LOCATION	, Thomasius ,
Turgot	LOCATION	,
Stein	PERSON	,
Cavour	PERSON	,
Bismarck	PERSON	, the author could , of course , claim anything like first-hand knowledge of only the last two ; and even in
Cavour	LOCATION	's case he had no personal impressions to draw on , but only conversations with friends and political associates of the great man .

		Bismarck , however , it was Dr.
White	PERSON	's fortune to know long and with some intimacy ; consequently he is presented with greater fulness and vividness than any of the other characters .

		To the author of '' The Warfare of Science with Religion '' this kindred antagonism between unreason and sweet reasonableness forms a congenial subject for care - ful study and illuminating discussion ; and the work is undertaken and executed with a scholarly thor - oughness and a contagious enthusiasm that give the book both weight and vitality .

		When Mr.
Harry Graham	PERSON	christened his volume of humorous essays and sketches `` The Bolster Book '' -LRB- Duf - field -RRB- , he was humorously apologizing for the absence of a quality which in fact particularly distinguishes his work .

		Mr.
Graham	PERSON	's worst enemy could not accuse him of soporific dullness .

		He is as lively as a cricket , and as irresponsibly , unreasonably cheer - ful .

		His wit is not of a very high order ; it consists chiefly in outrageous puns , delightful misquotations , daring personalities , and cutting home truths indis - tinguishably mixed with wild exaggeration and utter nonsense .

		It plays , apparently with perfect ease , upon any subject , from keeping a dog , breakfasting in bed , or the dangerous trade of cheese-punching , to the personality of
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	, the manners of the idle rich , and the merits of
Brighton	LOCATION	as a holiday resort .

		Nothing notable is said upon any of these subjects , but plenty of good laughs are 186 THE DIAL , -LSB-

		The tale of Mr.
Graham	PERSON	's expensive efforts to `` livt - up '' to the sumptuous appearance of a magnificent fur coat will evoke a responsive thrill in the hearts of many readers .

		The incisive analysis of the motives and methods of holiday-makers will please others .

		Some of the topics are hackneyed and some of the jokes slender , but we doubt if anybody will fall asleep over `` The Bolster Book . ''

		Harvard has favored us with a vol - ume of five essays which readily group themselves under the general title , '' The Durable Satisfactions of Life '' -LRB-

		This is also the heading of the first chapter , a brief address given to the new students at
Harvard	LOCATION	,
October 3 , 1905	DATE	, on what makes for an honorable and useful life .

		More elaborated , and fitted to the needs of somewhat younger hearers , is the next-following lecture on '' I ` lu - Happy Life : The Moral Purpose of the Universe , '' which was first read before the students of
Phillips Academy	ORGANIZATION	,
Exeter	LOCATION	,
N. II.	PERSON	, and afterward rewritten .

		Then comes the sketch of ``
John Gil	PERSON	- ley ,
Maine	LOCATION	Farmer and Fisherman , '' which has already appeared in print As a lifelike and thor - oughly interesting account of a plain man of the people , who was a hero in his humble way , the sketch is admirable , and it exhibits the writer 's powers in a field not habitually occupied by him .

		Some reflec - tions on '' Great Riches '' come next , and the now rather famous lecture on '' The Religion of the Fu - ture '' closes the volume .

		Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	counts health '' the chief blessing of life after the domestic affections , '' and in his opening page he says : '' So far as I have seen , there is one indispensable foundation for the satisfactions of life health . ''

		Yet there have been chronic invalids who have conquered for themselves some few durable satisfactions of life , perhaps even some satisfactions denied to the robust .

		Encourag - ing is the author 's conviction that '' it is quite unnec - essary in this country to feel alarm about the rise of a permanent class of very rich people .

		To trans - mit great estates is hard .

		They get divided or dis - persed . ''

		In this , as in his other views , Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	shows himself a confirmed optimist , always taking a wide and hopeful outlook , and seeing life in its wholeness .

		That she should have cherished for the English no fond affection is not surprising , and to this frank dislike of that country and all persons and things belonging thereto the reader is indebted for some of the spice and snap of her outspoken style .

		She seems to have written .

		however , in the language of that hated land , and at the instance of one of its citizens , Mr.
Robert Leighton	PERSON	, who contributes an introduction to tin - volume .

		Many famous persons appear in her pages , notably the Empress Euge ` nie , whom she seems to have cordially hated , and the Emperor himself , whom the kindred blood in her veins made her judge more kindly .

		The late
Alexander Johnston	PERSON	's '' History of American Politics '' -LRB-

		The vexed question of the authorship of `` Tiimm < > f

Ernest Hunter Wright	PERSON	in a monograph recently issued from the

Thompson	PERSON	has touched upon a timely topic in the discussion of the

Sigurd	PERSON	is depicted as a young Norse rover , a wanderer not only by land but by sea , this latter innovation seeming to lend itself quite naturally to the established legend .

		The action takes place about the middle of the fifth century , that eventful period which may be said to mark the end of the ancient , and the beginning of the modern world .

RASMUS B. ANDERSON	PERSON	, formerly Professor of Scandinavian languages in the

		248 A PEOPLE 'S PERSONALITY .

		We all know what personality means when we are speaking of the individual ; it is what makes a man or woman interesting , although not neces - sarily admirable . ''

		Hbchstes Gliick der
Erden	PERSON	- kinder , '' Goethe called it , and proclaimed its cultivation to be the paramount duty of every one of us .

		In our own time ,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	has insisted with perhaps excessive vehemence upon its im - portance , and has assured us that it is better to have a bad character , well-rounded and sharply defined , than no distinctive character at all .

		This is also the underlying idea of the individual - ist philosophy of such men as Mill and
Spencer	PERSON	and
Lord Morley	PERSON	, who hold that every attempt to force individuals into a common mould is a step away from progress and in the direction of spiritual stagnation .

		We believe this doctrine to be essentially sound , and that the largest measure of personal liberty not absolutely antag - onistic to the stability of the social order should be insisted upon , and jealously defended , by the well-wishers of humanity everywhere .

		Repres - sion and coercion should be applied only when the necessity for them is established beyond question ; in all cases not perfectly clear , the individual should be given the benefit of the doubt .

		This position is getting more and more difficult of practical maintenance in these days of excessive regimentation and insidious social - istic theorizing , and it takes a good deal of vigilance to hold properly in check the rapidly multiplying assaults upon the citadel of in - dividualism .

		The preservation , and even the accentuation , of the personality of a whole people is probably no less important than the similar endeavor in the case of the individual , but the problem of what constitutes personality in the case of the aggregation has many perplexities .

		It used to be thought that the statistical method was ade - quate to deal with this problem .

		Only collect enough statistics of all kinds and tabulate them , and the character of a people was set down in black and white .

		This is still largely the method of the '' sociology '' which is struggling so hard to secure recognition among the sciences , and up to a certain point it yields useful results .

		But certain students have recently been at work upon what they call '' the psychology of the crowd , '' 218 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, and their investigations seem to show that the character of a large group of people is not quite the same thing as the sum total of the characters of its separate units .

		There is perhaps no new element , but there is such a suppression here and such an emphasis there that the qualities which emerge do so with an energy that seems disproportionate to the importance of their con - stituent items .

		We get a suggestion as of the driving force of a turbine , and a sense of wonder that so tremendous a resultant should proceed from the pressure of the steam upon such tiny blades .

		It is evident that when the psychology of a people is in action as in some social or political upheaval we need more than arith - metic to account for it , that a more subtle cal - culus than the statistician employs is requisite for a complete analysis .

		We have got far beyond Buckle in our way of envisaging the problems of organized society , and the old cock - sureness has given way to a great deal of philosophic doubt .

		That there is such a thing as national char - acter , that it is possible to make definite propo - sitions concerning the personality of a whole people , are general opinions to which most of us will give some sort of assent , however much we may afterwards disagree when it comes to actual characterization in a particular instance .

		It is like the problem of Shakespeare as raised by certain modern commentators the man must have revealed himself in his works , but whose vision is clear enough to read the revelation with certainty ?

		Hit or-miss character - izations of nations are offered us a-plenty , both by tourists and arm-chair philosophers .

		Then there are great numbers of conventional judg - ments , crystallized into telling descriptive phrases , passed on from generation to genera - tion , and accepted without close critical inspec - tion .

		The French frivolity , the English arrog - ance , the German stolidity , and the Russian melancholy , are ascriptions that have just enough of truth to pass muster with the superficially - minded , but they are subject to so many qualifi - cations that little is left of them after a really searching analysis .

		Now and then we find a student of national character who really thinks , and who has the insight to discern what is es - sential and enduring in the people under observa - tion .

		Taine had this faculty in a marked degree , and his examination of the English temper as expressed in English literature has lasting value .

		Other examples of a truly philo - sophical appraisal may be found in such books as
M. de Vogue	ORGANIZATION	's Russian studies , Mr.
Have	PERSON	- lock
Ellis	PERSON	' g '' The Soul of
Spain	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
W. C. Brownell	PERSON	's '' French Traits , '' and Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	's '' The Americans . ''

		Such books are genuinely enlightening , and will repay care - ful reading .

		But the majority of judgments glibly expressed by our would-be national phy - siognomists are the veriest snap-shots , inductions from observations that are neither comprehen - sive nor penetrating .

		The character of the American people has tempted a great many foreigners to display their acumen , with results for the most part pitifully prejudiced or inaccurate .

		Nor have our own self-appointed critics done much better , for they have rarely had an intimate acquaint - ance with more than a narrow section of this great commonwealth .

		One may have a fair knowledge of the spirit of puritan
New England	LOCATION	, or of the South , old or new , or of the Missis - sippi Valley , or of the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	, and be amazingly ignorant of American life as a whole .

		Possibly there is no such thing as American life as a whole , or will be until the ingredients of the melting-pot shall have entered into a fusion of which there are few signs at present .

		It is true that American society has developed upon the basis of a few simple ideas of political and social relationships , but abstract ideas may be potent in shaping the external life of a nation without entering into its temper .

		Perhaps nothing is more noteworthy about our life than the lip-service that it pays to the ideals of the founders of the nation , and the unconcerned way in which it flouts those ideals when they are found to run counter to the primal instincts of greed and self-sufficiency .

		We are in theory a people devoted to the rights of man and opposed to all forms of special privilege ; we are in fact a people willing to ride rough-shod over the rights of man and to foster privilege by the enact - ment of iniquitous laws .

		Still worse , we are a people bound by all our inherited traditions and instincts to insist upon the largest measure of individual liberty , and yet we bow to the fetich of majority rule even when that rule would impair the right of contract and go so far as to regulate our personal habits .

		These remarks about national character have been suggested to us by an article in '' The Fortnightly Review '' which seeks to define `` The Personality of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The article is absolutely insignificant , but is typical of its kind .

		An Englishman comes to this country , spends a few weeks in the four leading cities of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	seaboard , and thinks that he has been able * 4 to decipher some real human pages ''
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 219 of our national life .

		He discovers that we are good-natured and hospitable , that our boots and trousers are admirable , that we are clean-shaven and boisterously patriotic , and that our girls have a good time .

		By way of criticism , he thinks that we work too hard and neglect our wives .

		He learns that Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	is our national hero , and thinks we have done well in choosing him for that part .

		This is a summary of the dozen pages of chatter which have been dignified with the title quoted above .

		Breaking butterflies is not a task to our mind , and it would be ink wasted to enlarge upon the super - ficiality and emptiness of this latest contribution to comparative sociology .

		Such articles may be useful in helping to keep up the entente cordlale , but they have nothing but their good nature to recommend them .

		It is , however , a little sad - dening to think how much of this sort of writing we get , and how little of the kind that bears with it any real message for instruction or chastening reproof .

		And we need both of these things if we are ever truly to know ourselves and resolutely to set about mending our ways .

		THE TRADITIONS AND THE NEW AGE .

		The New Age is always here .

		It is always im - patient of its predecessors , confident that it is the champion of humanity and the culminating epoch of the world .

		It always tries to break with the Past .

		As if it could !

		As if the filaments that run through it had not their root in the Past , as if its flesh were not made and moulded of things gone !

		The very Doppelganger of the Past , it turns and draws its sword upon its own image , threatens it with its own force , challenges it in the tones of tradition .

		Are the arts progressive ?

		Science doubtless is , though we are much in the dark as to the knowl - edge of the ancients .

		In mechanics , at least , they could do things we can not approach .

		But the ex - tension of scientific knowledge seems unquestionable , though even yet we are
Newton	ORGANIZATION	's children , picking up pebbles on the sea-shore .

		Art , however , is the revelation of the human spirit , and as far back as we can trace it has revealed pretty much the same thing .

		There are no such steps rising one above the other , no such culminat - ing growth , in art as in science .

		Doubtless human - ity has never possessed all its faculties complete at one time .

		Doubtless one age has been stronger in one form of art - expression than another .

		There have been strange lapses of forgetfulness and sudden revivals ; but on the whole there has been main - tained a pretty even level .

		The work of antiquity in two of the arts , muic and painting , has perished .

		Its music has been doubted , but the literatures of both the Aryan and Semitic races are saturated with references to music bear witness to their intense delight and preoccupation with it .

		It is hardly conceivable that races so intelligent should have been continually talking of an art that did not exist .

		Painting of course they had .

		Some of their wonderful vase painting remains , and from the excellence of this almost mechanical work we may argue the greatness of the real artists .

		Homer must have seen some marvellous work in relief or mosaic before he wrote the description of Achilles ' shield .

		In the
Hindoo	PERSON	poet
Bhavabhfiti	PERSON	's drama , `` The Latter Acts of Rama , '' the whole of a long act is given up to the description of a set of wall paintings , which , if they were ever realized , must have rivalled anything in modern art .

		But as so little of this past work exists , we are driven in these two arts to near comparisons to see if the New Age has won out and driven tradition from its stronghold .

		The New Age in painting claims landscape for its own .

		Take , it says , to the Past , your figure compositions , your dramas of the doings of men and gods ; take your portraits , your realizations of the soul of man ; I admit that I do not equal you here , but resign the outer world to me .

		Now upon some minds
Ruysdael	PERSON	and
Hobbema	PERSON	and
Claude Lorraine	PERSON	, and even
Salvator Rosa	PERSON	or
Richard Wilson	PERSON	, make as strong impressions as the modern masters .

		Their truths are not quite the recent truths , but they are true enough for illusion , and their pictures bear the stamp of superior minds .

		And the landscape backgrounds of
Titian	ORGANIZATION	,
Rubens	PERSON	,
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	, and
Velasquez	PERSON	are as magnificent as anything in modern art , which indeed they anti- cipate in a remarkable degree .

		Constable , too , is not quite a modern , though he is the father of mod - ern landscape .

		But the last great
French School	ORGANIZATION	claims that it has brought the sun upon the stage , that it has painted light .

		It has theorized , has brought the science of chromatics to its aid , and in practice has actually realized the vibration of light .

		There are pictures of
Degas	LOCATION	and Monet that are absolute incar - nations of shimmering , pulsating light .

		It is not to disparage the often splendid work of this school , or the pioneer courage which its members displayed , if one suggests that much which they have done has been anticipated .

		In
Turner	PERSON	's skies we get much the same broken vibratory light as in Manet or
Monet	ORGANIZATION	.

		And that white sky-mud which
FitzGerald	PERSON	said that Constable 's sun threw up on its revolutions produces a like effect .

		There are sketches of Con - stable which might be signed by
Monet	ORGANIZATION	or Seurat .

		Even the `` pointillisme '' of the latter harks back to
Canaletto	ORGANIZATION	.

		For ages there have been schools both of drawing and engraving based on the use of the dot .

		Many of the Dutchmen , too , have painted artificial life as vividly and as truthfully as
Degas	LOCATION	.

		And there is a wonderful light which , whether truth - ful or not , has fascinated the world , in
Leonardo	LOCATION	's '' Our Lady of the Rocks '' and Rembrandt 's '' Night Watch . ''

		The fact is that as a rule we do not li'JO THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, want to paint light , we want to paint solid bodies of different hues , densities , and distances , illumined with light .

		Against light-colored backgrounds , clouds , white walls or water , the vibrating light of the moderns is a success .

		Against dark backgrounds or scenes much involved in shadow , it is a failure .

		And shadow is the soul of painting , as it is of literature .

		The use of flat painting is another sign of the moderns .

		But this is no new thing , and was in fact learned by them from
Velasquez	PERSON	, who sometimes paints so thinly that the canvass shows through .

		Scorn of the Subject is another note of recent art .

		But it is pretty hard to escape from the Subject The subject of Manet 's Dijetiner sur Vherbe is what caused the scandal and the persecution of that great painter .

		Whistler laughed at the English artist 's preoccupation with story , but his own '' Lady with the Yellow
Buskin	PERSON	'' is a subject picture .

		In its fugitive motion it embodies the idea of woman flying and inviting pursuit If
Whistler	LOCATION	had painted a nude nymph in just that attitude , given a suspicion of foliage to the background , and labelled it ''
Daphne	PERSON	flying from Apollo , '' he would have had a subject picture which everyone would have understood .

		As it is , the meaning is cryptically concealed by the modern dress .

		Gainsborough 's '' Morning Walk , '' though only two portraits , is a subject picture .

		And Constable 's `` Cornfield '' might be labelled Peace '' or '' Fecundity . ''

		One would not wish to say a word against the great modern school of French artists , of whom
Burne-Jones	PERSON	said that they were noble gentlemen working courageously for their ideals without regard for success or even for the necessities of life .

		But they are all fragmentary .

		The great painters of the past ,
Titian	ORGANIZATION	,
Rubens	PERSON	,
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	, are war - riors completely equipped , armed cap-a-pie .

		Each of the moderns would seem to have seized a part of this equipment a helmet , a breastplate , a lance , or a sword ; and though each one may have bur - nished or sharpened up his piece of hardware beyond anything its original owner knew , yet it makes but a poor show against the full armament of the masters .

		Music is a language that has only two words joy and grief .

		Its lively tones excite and interpret the one , its slow and solemn motions the other .

		But just what joy or what grief are associated with the notes we must determine for ourselves .

		Anything can be read into their broad expressions .

		This indef - initeness , this resolution of all existence into the pulsations of the heart , its systole and diastole , is what gives music its universal appeal , and what keeps it from having an intellectual content Again , a musical phrase is like a syllogism , it is a movement that has a beginning , a middle , and an end , and that satisfies us with its com - pleteness .

		But to give us two terms of the syllogism and withhold the third , or to wrench them violently apart , is certainly to deny any such satisfaction .

		Discords are necessary for variety and the shock of surprise ; making a composition of them can hardly be musical .

		But the New Age decided that music must lit * dramatic , that it must express and give the exact equivalent for the sharply defined thoughts , feelings , and actions of humanity .

		Wagner is the great dividing name in music .

		He thought that pure music had reached its climax , and that nothing remained for him to do but to invent a new method of using tones as a mnemonic exercise .

		And his invention the leit-motif has great merit .

		Of course no succession of notes or chords has any re - semblance to a helmet or a sword or the Niblung gold ; but after certain musical phrases had been associated a number of times with these things in the action of the drama , the mind of the hearer began dimly to appreciate the repetition , and to realize the symmetry of the musical architecture .

		It was a little like the game of '' hunt the slipper '' ; but once we were trained to the quest , we could understand in the Wagnerian work a sort of gigan - tic harmony , a titanic thorough bass .

		Of course , with every new work of this kind we have got to learn the harmony over again ; and it is at least questionable if this repays us as do the legitimate forms of music .

		There were six hundred thousand volumes in the Alexandrian library .

		At a mere guess it may be doubted if more than a thousandth part of these remain .

		What did the others contain ?

		What song did the Sirens sing ?

		No one may know ; but we may be sure that , as
Tom Moore	PERSON	said of the Irish epics , those books were not written by fools or for foolish purposes .

		From what remains we must judge that the literature of the ancients subtended as wide an arc of experience as our own .

		Realism and romanti - cism were there , and allegory , the most daring flights of imagination , the most literal reproduction of fact The New Comedy of
Athens	LOCATION	, if we had it , would probably be a fair offset for our whole mass of modern novels .

		And all the forms of literature were then invented , drama , epic , novel , tale , lyric , idyll .

		Mr.
Burbank	PERSON	may create a new flower or vegetable , or we may get a new animal by crossing breeds ; but the modern writer may despair of making a new form or kind of literature .

		Whitman aspired to this sort of originality .

		He took the forms of literature , which are really its living body , to be cerements ; and he essayed to burst these and soar , a new thing .

		But the Greeks had their iin - ^ ular dithyrambic verse .

		It is a legitimate enough species ; though such is the craving of the human mind for recognizable form in poetry , for repetition , recur - rence , symmetry , that such shapeless verse has never made any wide appeal .


Blake	PERSON	, who anti- cipated
Whitman	PERSON	in the use of it .

		as he did to a great extent in thought , has never been mm-h read .

		Nor has the irregular lyrical blank verse of
Milton	LOCATION	and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		Probably the most popular thing Whitman ever wrote is the little lyric .

		My Captain , '' which comes nearer than anything else of his to recognized models of metre and rhyme .

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL , The genius of a language when in its formative period can and does create new forms .

		Modern accented verse differs from the quantitative poetry of the ancients , and each modern race has developed special and favorite variations of its own , as the assonance of the Spanish , the alliteration of Scan - dinavian and Celtic poetry , the alexandrine in French , and the heroic line in English .

		The real originality of every writer lies in the glow and movement and vibration of his spirit .

		If these are vivid and rapid they will certainly differ - entiate him from all others , though he make no effort for originality of thought or newness of form .

		The stronger they are , indeed , the more probability that he will accept the dower of the past , will take what tradition gives him , in order to ease him in his work .

		Let us deal kindly with tradition , and tradition will be good to us .

		Let us not try to push our grand - sires from their thrones .

		Rather , if it is necessary to save them , let us bear them tenderly on , as the pious ^ Eneas carried old Anchises from the wreck of burning Troy .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A CHINESE STUDENT 'S REASONABLE REQUEST that irritating and time - wasting formalities at the port of arrival should be waived in the case of those seekers for knowledge now coming in considerable numbers from
China	LOCATION	to the colleges and universities of our land , appears in a
New York	LOCATION	journal .

		The oriental courtesy and dignity and restraint that mark the style of the letter -LRB- and that incidentally remind one of the gentle phraseology of the author of '' A Japanese Artist in
London	LOCATION	, '' elsewhere re - viewed in this issue -RRB- are highly ingratiating .

		We quote a passage , which will point its own moral : '' I am sorry to confess that my first impression as I reached
America	LOCATION	was unpleasant .

		In order that the students who enjoy the benefit of the kindness of the
United States	LOCATION	in returning the indemnity money may not at the moment of their arrival experience the same disagreeable sensation , in order that no germ of hatred may arise in the proud hearts of these young men coming here for training for important offices in the
New China	LOCATION	, I plead for more simplicity and less restraint in the forms through which they are required to go upon arrival .

		These forms detained me in
San Francisco	LOCATION	against my will for some thirty-six hours , and were it not for subsequent kindness shown me , I fear that I should have kept a while here , and later on carried back to
China	LOCATION	, hatred instead of friendship and good feeling toward
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Let us take a few lessons in manners from the
East	LOCATION	while we are trying to give lessons in some perhaps less important departments .

		HOW TO MAKE THE BOOK-FUND GO THE FUR - THEST , whether in buying for a public or for a private library , is often a question of great impor - tance .

		As a help in answering it , Mr.
Le Roy Jeff	PERSON	ers 's '' List of Editions Selected for Economy in Book Buying , '' published by the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, may profitably be consulted .

		The com - piler 's experience as '' Chief of Book Department '' of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	enables him to deal intelligently with the matter , and his nineteen double-column pages embrace a range of works in polite literature that would alone constitute a re - spectable library for a small town , and a more than respectable library for an individual .

		It is surpris - ing how many good books , well printed and well bound , can be had at
fifty cents	MONEY	each , with a liberal discount in the case of public libraries , while for sixty and seventy-five something approaching to luxury is at one 's command .

		In some points of detail Mr.
Jeffers	PERSON	's list is a little puzzling .

		Why , for instance , does he give only a very few of the excellent '' Astor '' editions of the standard poets ?


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	we find , but many others , far more likely to be in demand , as
Milton	LOCATION	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Keats	PERSON	, appear only in more expensive editions .

		Again , why enter
George Eliot	PERSON	and George Sand under their pseudo - nyms , with cross-reference to their real names , but compel the reader to turn back from u
Twain	LOCATION	,
Mark	PERSON	, '' to ''
Clemens	PERSON	, S. L. '' ?

		However , the little pamphlet is of such worth , and , in its way , of such interest that one ought to enjoy turning its leaves the oftener the better .

		* * THE IMMORAL NOTE IN FICTION can not be de - scribed in definite terms and thereafter invariably recognized from the description .

		Nevertheless a sensible reply to the question , '' What Makes a Novel Immoral ? ''

		has recently been written by Miss
Corinne Bacon	PERSON	of the
Newark	LOCATION	-LRB- N. J. -RRB- Public Library ; and her article , originally published in ``
New York	LOCATION	Libraries , '' has been reprinted in the ''
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Library Bulletin . ''

		Its breadth of view is worthy of all praise , as a few random citations will prove . ''

		A novel may have nothing objection - able about it , so far as its love affairs go , and yet be a thoroughly immoral book .

		For morality includes the whole of life not simply one relation . '' ''

		The sinful woman in the Scarlet Letter is a healthier companion than the blameless
Pamela	PERSON	. ''

		`` The book which degrades our intellect , vulgarizes our emo - tions , kills our faith in our kind , is an immoral book : the book which stimulates thought , quickens our sense of humor , gives us a deeper insight into men and women and a finer sympathy with them , is a moral book , let its subject-matter have as wide a range as life itself . ''

		Is it not the two-edged quality of all criticism that makes the censorship of fiction so odious a task ? ''

		To the pure all things are pure , '' is the disconcerting rejoinder to the one who has carefully run a novel through his moral THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, trainer and caught a few real or fancied impurities .

		And , furthermore , here as elsewhere in literature .

		what is one man 's meat is another man 's poison except that of course there are some books too indubitably bad to be other than poisonous to all readers .

		, , .

		THE SENSUOUS BEAUTY IN WORDS might be dis - coursed on at great length .

		`` The Westminster Gazette '' has been conducting a sort of symposium on the subject of the most beautiful words in En - glish and other languages , and of course examples of such mysteriously haunting vocables have been forthcoming in abundance .

		Who shall say what it is in sounds , sights , tastes , and smells , that conveys the impression of beauty or of ugliness , of sweetness or of sourness , of softness or of harshness , and why it does so ?

		The quality of beauty is one , but its manifestations are countless .

		In the case of words , this appeal of the mere sound to the ear is too often drowned in the associations attached to the word .

		But in a comparatively unfamiliar tongue , as the American Indian dialects are to most of us , the unmodified effect of sounds on the ear and on the inner sense can be studied .

		Are there any more beautiful words than some of those selected by Long - fellow for poetic uses in his `` Song of
Hiawatha	LOCATION	'' ?

		What , for example , could be more liquidly musical than the word Minnehaha '' ?

		Or what invitation could fall more gratefully on the city-dweller 's ear , on a sultry
summer	DATE	day , than one bidding him step on the magic carpet of Prince
Housain	PERSON	and be trans - ported to the Falls of
Minnehaha	LOCATION	?

		Even though he never heard of the Falls of
Minnehaha	LOCATION	, what fragrantly moist and musical delights , what coolness and shady freshness , what babble of laughing waters , are immediately suggested !

		TWO INSTANCES OP INTELLECTUAL PRECOCITY that have attracted some attention of late raise again the old question whether such abnormal development of mental powers at a very early period furnishes promise of later remarkable achievement , or is rather an ominous symptom and one to be dreaded by par - ents .

		The children in question , who need not here be specified by name , are the boy wonder of Har - vard , and the eight-year-old
San Francisco	LOCATION	prodigy who already speaks seven languages and has now begun on that simulacrum of a language , Esperanto .

		Dr.
Andrew D. White	PERSON	in his latest book , `` Seven Great Statesmen , '' has a disparaging word to say of those precociously learned young men who so com - monly sink later , under the weight of their acquisi - tions , into everlasting obscurity .

		But his selected statesmen were rather noted for early display of unusual powers of intellectual acquisition .

		The difficulty in such an inquiry as this lies in the fact that , as a rule , only the infant prodigies who have ** made good '' are available for purposes of investi - gation , while the possible thousands who have failed to fulfill their early promise have left no record behind them .

		We shall watch with interest for any future achievements in the literary or learned world on the part of the two children whose present men - tal equipment is so far above the average .

		EYE-STRAIN AMONG LIBRARIANS ought next to be made the subject of special study , and of a special volume , by Dr.
Gould	PERSON	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, who has - o zealously pursued his quest for eye-strain and it * attendant ills among various sorts of learned and literary workers .

		In a paper on the recreations of librarians prepared for the recent
Mackinac	ORGANIZATION	meeting by Mr.
Samuel H. Ranck	PERSON	, of the Grand Rapids Pub - lic Library , but crowded out of the programme , to the regret of many , he had this to say among other things : `` I believe that the beginning of the dis - organization of the nervous system among librarians is frequently due to eye-strain .

		I have seen many examples of this where nervous indigestion , leading up to nervous prostration , and all the ills that follow , began with eye-strain .

		Library work and library lighting can easily make all of us victims of eye - strain ; and I may add that the lighting in many of our libraries is vicious . ''

		Significant , in this con - nection , is the large number of library workers wear - ing glasses whom one sees in our public libraries .

		Nowhere else , except perhaps in a German univer - sity lecture-room , will one find so many be-spectacled pairs of eyes .

		... THE VOGUE OF OUR LAMENTED PRAGMATIST , the late
William James	PERSON	, has never before been brought home to us as it has since his death .

		From all parts of
Europe	LOCATION	, as well as from every quarter of our own country , come evidences of the esteem in which he was held , the extent to which he was read , and the measure of his influence on the lives and the thinking of his readers .

		Noting the keen regret in
London	LOCATION	over his death , a correspondent ventures the assertion that no philosophical writer of the present generation has been so widely read .

		The far-reaching and beneficial influence of his doctrine of '' what works '' in breaking down senseless con - vention , in overthrowing dogmatism , and in under - mining prejudice , is immeasurable . ''

		Modernism '' in religion , the reform of our penal system , and the radical tone of much recent legislation , must all owe something , however indirectly , to the growth and spread of the pragmatic habit of mind ; and most who have caught the habit have done so from his books , magazine articles , and reported utter - ances .

		His was a message that seems likely to be delivering itself to future ages long after the name of
William James	PERSON	himself shall have been forgotten .

		THE LIBRARIAN WHO WRITES is probably in more perilous case than the librarian who reads .

		`` The librarian who reads is lost , '' runs the aneinit adage ; and any who desire an illustration of its truth should turn to `` The Old Librarian 's Alma - nack '' and see there what befell the admirable
Timothy Mason	PERSON	, a librarian whose love for the in - sides of his books exceeded his love for their out -

		THE DIAL 223 sides .

		Among the writing librarians must be in - cluded the late
Leopold Delisle	PERSON	, whose custody of the literary treasures of the
Bibliotheque Nationale	ORGANIZATION	ended a few weeks ago with his death at
Chantilly	LOCATION	.

		So prolific a writer was he that the number of his books and learned treatises , with the works edited and annotated by him , runs up to nearly two thou - sand
1889	DATE	more exactly .

		A complete bibliography of his literary labors is said to fill a volume of more than five hundred pages .

		But the librarian in him came so near to being lost in the author and scholar that his administration of the famous library under his care was adversely criticized by more than one student who had occasion to use it .

		In view of
Delisle	ORGANIZATION	's long and ardent devotion to his literary and learned labors , it is not surprising that the
French National Library	ORGANIZATION	should now be far less ably man - aged than the library of the British Museum , which in turn can not compete with our great American libraries in practical efficiency as a public institution .

		THE LEFFERTS COLLECTION OF POPE 'S WORKS which has recently been presented to the
Harvard University Library	ORGANIZATION	, through the generosity of an unnamed benefactor -LRB- presumably Mr.
J. Pierpont Morgan	PERSON	-RRB- , contains more than five hundred volumes , none of later date than 1751 , when
Warburton	PERSON	's complete edition was published , and is the largest collection of first and other early editions of Pope in existence .

		It was brought together by
Marshall C. Lefferts	PERSON	, the bibliophile , whose fond hope it was to acquire a copy of every early edition of every one of the poet 's works .

		But forced in his old age to recognize the impossibility of accomplishing his object , he decided to sell the collection , and it was placed in the hands of Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, from whom it has now been bought and given to
Harvard	LOCATION	, which already had about one hundred and fifty Pope volumes in addition to the
Lefferts	LOCATION	lot , so that its present equipment in the editions of that poet 's works is unequalled in this country and , one might confidently assert , in the world .

		AN OCTOGENARIAN COLLEGE STUDENT who has already attracted our admiring attention , and who is undoubtedly the only undergraduate of eighty now climbing the hill of knowledge with the inten - tion of completing the four years ' course and of following it with post-graduate study , is Mrs.
Amy D. Winship	PERSON	of
Racine	LOCATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, widow of the late
E. B. Winship	PERSON	of the
Winship Manufacturing Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		This eighty-y ears-young-collegian -LRB- she is now a sophomore , apparently -RRB- is enrolled at the
Ohio State University	ORGANIZATION	, whence a press despatch announces her chosen studies for the coming winter to be philosophy , psychology , and literature , with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	for a specialty .

		Not content with the regular college year of work , she attends
summer	DATE	school in the long vacation .

		No wonder she is reputed one of the best-read women in
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, as well as one of the closest students .

		THE TRAVELLING LIBRARIES OF
WISCONSIN	LOCATION	now go to some nine hundred towns , or '' stations , '' as they are called in a well-written and well illustrated pamphlet -LRB- `` Traveling Libraries in
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, with Directory of Stations '' -RRB- compiled by Miss
Lutie E. Stearns	PERSON	, chief of this department of educational activity in that energetic commonwealth .

		It appears that the state and the county systems together own nine hundred and forty-four of these peripatetic collections , with a total of nearly forty-five thousand volumes , and that only lack of funds prevents a still more extensive circulation of much-desired reading matter .

		Travelling study libraries , for study clubs , together with typewritten outlines for guidance , go also to the more serious-minded communities .

		A map that forms the frontispiece to the little pamphlet shows that nearly all the counties are well studded with '' stations , '' no county being entirely neglected , and even the lonely lumber camp receiving an appreciated attention .

		As fore-runner to the per - manent library , its itinerant substitute is doing a good work .

		COMM UN 1C A TIONS .

		THE JOURNALIZED SHORT STORY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In a recent number of '' The Athenaeum '' a writer , who signs himself
L. N.	PERSON	, heartily complains of the abuse of the short story in
England	LOCATION	.

		Editors , so he asserts , have desired '' force and body , '' both of a physi - cal kind , writers have been weak enough to respond , and , as a result , that desirable kind of short story which does perfectly what in so brief a space can be perfectly done , has gone down before condensed novellettes cram - med with stereotyped incident and machine-made char - acters .

		As a touchstone to test the inferiority of the contemporary product , he brings forward
Scott	PERSON	's '' Wandering
Willie	PERSON	s Tale , '' and so concludes a criti - cism which deserves circulation on this side of the water .

		It deserves circulation here , whatever its truth for
England	LOCATION	, because it describes admirably the vulgarizing of the short story by the new American magazine .

		The new magazine we all know , and , within limits , admire .

		It is active , it is thoroughly contemporary ; if one is looking for news it is interesting ; it is read to an extent which is astonishing or appalling according to one 's point of view .

		The pamphlets of the eighteenth century were not more effective politically .

		But it is not a magazine .

		A magazine is specifically a storehouse of literature , or of writing which aspires to be literature .

		But the new so-called magazine is not so to be described .

		Ex - cluding the poetry , which remains as a survival , and , in some measure , the short stories , it is sheer journalism , as a rule good journalism .

		Far from representing , as some pessimists think , the decline of the old magazine , it is actually a step forward in the perfection of the newspaper .

		Its leading articles make little attempt to refine upon life as literature must ; on the contrary , their purpose is to emphasize , as journalism should , the '' features '' of the month 's events .

		The new periodical accomplishes its end .

		It accomplishes it so well that it ' 1-24 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	.

		has robbed the dailies of some of their popularity and much of their influence .

		Only the narrow-minded will criticise it because it is journalistic instead of literary , or will insist that it should become a true magazine .

		But , unfortunately , these extra-illustrated newspapers insist upon feeding the hungry for news and the hungry for art oat of one ladle .

		As the dress-coat has kept the sword button , so these periodicals have retained certain appurtenances of the literary magazine , namely , poetry and the short story .

		The poetry was so inef - fective that a great change in setting has only narrowed its already straitened province .

		But the short story has been the sweetening , the ballast , the most popular ele - ment of the new magazine , and , inevitably , it has been journalized .

		The symptoms of the journalized short story are easily distinguished .

		Lack of style is the most evident , and this probably means a failure to mature the thought , to ripen the character-study , to drive observation beneath the drift of occasional happenings .

		It would be easy to name twenty short stories of the last decade in
America	LOCATION	that lack only style to be perilously near greatness .

		Sensationalism , which after all is only ex - aggeration and therefore bad art , is another symptom .

		The journalized short story roars its laughter , bellows its pathos , shouts its strenuosity .

		Or it is crudely realistic , smeared with local color , stuck over with a specialized slang or rare dialect , all in the attempt to make the thing '' go '' with hasty readers , to give it a u challenge , '' as the magazine people say .

		An overplus of '' body '' is probably a symptom also .

		By overplus of '' body '' the '' Athenaeum '' writer means a crowding of incident , an accumulation of climaxes , a stringing together of vivid episodes , so that the purchaser shall feel that he is getting his money 's worth of fiction .

		But this fault is more English than American .

		Since Irving ,
Poe	PERSON	, and
Hawthorne	PERSON	began the cultivation of the fine short narrative among us , the American sense for what should and should not go into a short story seems to have been keener and truer than the English .

		Kipling and
Stevenson	PERSON	are exceptions , but then the one studied
Bret Harte	PERSON	, the other
Hawthorne	LOCATION	.

		Such clever craftsmen as Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	and Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	will blur the lines of a short story whose technique a much lesser American would handle with skill , while even the journalistic short stury is usually well constructed and duly limited in scope when it appears in an American magazine .

		On the other hand , if journalism has not affected our tech - nique it has certainly drawn the short story into the service of the propaganda which gave the new magazine its reason for being and its success .

		These journalistic stories smell of the muck-rake .

		Too often a strained plot and a warped character-study show that they are cut to fit a popular movement , or made to order for the illustration of some social or political defect .

		So far we can hug the Englishman 's grievance to our breasts , and , if that is any satisfaction , feel that '' L. N. '' would add fire , salt , and vinegar to his strictures if he could but spend an hour over a Subway news-stand .

		And yet , however just his words may be for
England	LOCATION	, and however truly they apply to our journalized short stories , there is one group of American narratives which they misfit in an almost ludicrous fashion .

		I do not mean the thoroughly good short stories which , in spite of all evil tendencies whatsoever , are being written here more numerously and , I believe , more excellently than in
England	LOCATION	.

		I mean the feminized short story .

		The sprcl.-s liiij , IHTII toMrrrd l -RRB- V certain of our inorr coli - servative monthlies which still deserve the name of magazine .

		A pale , faint creature this , usually tinged with the local color of some rural neighborhood , or puls - ing gently to the flow of a pathetic sentiment .

		I > rlu .

		i < - \ is carried to the verge of emptiness , suggestiveness to a point where nothing interesting is suggested , the `` spiritual body , '' for which our English critic asks , is attained by starving the physical .

		The authors and editors of such stories are , after all , less dangerous than the journalists they have at worst emasculated an art which should be delicate and graceful , though strong .

		But they have rendered bad service to the cause of fic - tion , for they have led many readers to associate a literary touch with effeminacy and tonelessness , with the tale of a dull farm , and a faded old woman who looks through dingy curtains and talks dully .

		Such tales , since they are literary but unsuccessful , have left open the way for an unliterary narrative which , thanks to a similitude of vigor and masculinity , has attained a con - siderable if not a meritorious success .

		They must share the blame for the journalized short story .

		An American , however , who sought to escape from these unfortunate tendencies , would scarcely instance Wandering
Willie	PERSON	's Tale '' as an example of what one would advise our tellers of short stories to be doing .

		Much water has run under the bridges since
Scott	PERSON	wrote the Tale .

		It has the worthy and sufficient style which many of our stories , for lack of maturity , are wanting in .

		It is written with that subtle interweaving of strand and strand of the narrative which makes consummate art .

		But the mode of its telling is the straightforward , in - cident-by-incident fashion of Chaucer and
Boccaccio	PERSON	.

		In English , to judge by the scarcity of great successes , this has always been a difficult mode for the short story , I do not know why .

		And surely , for the situations or impressions out of which we make so many of our mod - ern short stories , the difficulty is enormously increased .

		It would seem that we must grapple with such material for stories , in the majority of instances , by means of the technique which
Poe	PERSON	gave us , the technique which bends every word towards the end of the story , and arranges tone , setting , and succession of incident so as to throw all emphasis upon the situation or impression which is subject and conclusion of the narrative .

		This technical method is surely not to be neglected when , in
America	LOCATION	certainly , hundreds can use it successfully .

		Nor is it to be neglected because thousands are carrying it into abuse .

		In all probability it is the likeness of this method of story-telling to the methods of the journalists which accounts for the ready abuse .

		Poe developed this tech - nique in search of the power of vividness and immedi - ate effect which journalism , for other purposes , likewise desires .

		Under the whip-lash of demand our moderns seem to be taking it from literature to give it to jour - nalism .

		But if so , the cry for the writers of the American short story is not back to the technique of
Scott	LOCATION	, or to any technique whatsoever .

		It is rather back to litera - ture , and all that literature implies of style , of worthi - ness , and of art .

		Only so can they hope to gather immortelles from an age which offers unexampled op - portunities for the keenly-poised , carefully-wrought short story .

		Otherwise they will be swung along in the wake of the extra-illustrated newspaper , their stories , like canoes lashed to a steamer 's stern , strained and sprung out of art , out of beauty , and out of grace .

		THE DIAL 225 THE WRITING OF HISTORY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A half-century ago ,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, as essayist and his - torian , if not as poet , was all the vogue .

		Indeed , one might say simply as historian ; for most of his essays were on historical subjects , and his very poems were historical .

		In several of his essays he had set forth , years before he undertook his great historical task , his conception of what a history should be .

		In the main he worked up to this ideal , and the result was at the time truly marvel - lous .

		His history was more entertaining than most of the novels of the day , and was read with enthusiasm all over the English-speaking world .

		His clear-cut and vigorous style , as lucid as
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's French and often as caustic , made reading easy and stimulating to the weariest minds .

		His rich allusiveness to the whole known world of literature flattered and delighted those whose general reading permitted them to catch the force and aptness of the allusions , and piqued the curiosity of those who failed to comprehend them .

		The vastness of his knowledge inspired confidence in his judgment ; and his very cocksureness his greatest foible was to many minds a steady support against doubt and vacillation .

		His own enthusiastic optimism was in keeping with the spirit of the age , unaffected as yet to any great extent by the vaticinations of
Carlyle	LOCATION	and
Rusk	PERSON	in ; and he might be said to have found myriads of disciples ready-made , holding his own doctrines and only too glad to have them confirmed and ratified by so plausible a reasoner and set forth by so vivid a narrator .

		He died , and speedily the reaction came .

		His imi - tators had made that facile , forcible , uncompromising style a disgust to many .

		Truth , they argued , could not possibly be so direct and unmistakable ; there must be limitations , modifications , exceptions to almost any state - ment .

		Besides , science had then captured the attention of the public and wholly absorbed it .

		Darwin ,
Wallace	PERSON	,
Spencer	PERSON	,
Huxley	LOCATION	, and their followers , were directing the forms and the trend of thought .

		A craze for explaining everything by scientific analysis and in terms of evolu - tionary progress had seized upon the whole thinking and reading world , and it was seriously believed that history could be made a science .

		There are some who still cherish the delusion .

		Buckle set himself to working the environment hy - pothesis .

		Taine explained literature by climate ; Free - man ,
Stubbs	PERSON	,
Creighton	LOCATION	,
Gardiner	PERSON	swore by documents , and pretty well eliminated the personal human element .

		The new school of Kterary expression also turned its back on
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	.

		His method was rhetorical .

		The younger writers , at the head of whom was
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, disdained rhetoric , and devoted themselves to critical analysis .

		They drowned their thought with an endless tangle of modifications .

		Those who still stood by rhetoric looked on
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's style as crude and sometimes cacophonous , and aimed at effects which we call , after the French , '' precious . ''

		Of these were
Walter Pater	PERSON	and
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Well , what has been the result ?

		Perhaps we have greater exactness as to facts , in many cases new points of view , a more cautious summing up of the evidence ; but nowhere is the clear and flowing current of narra - tive , the allurement of style , the wonderful touch of art in the presentation of truth .

		Many modern historical studies put before us merely ill-digested chunks of material the material for history , not history itself .

		Every crude investigator imagines himself a historian , when he is nothing but a miner digging out facts ; and his facts are either meaningless or else make a wrong impression from lack of proper contrast , relief , or per - spective .

		Every artist knows that there is no greater liar than the sun ; but the camera-fiends do not know this , and can not be brought to understand it .

		The student of history on a large scale knows that it can never be a science .

		Research is admirable , but one may have done excellent work in that line and yet be perfectly incapable of turning into history the mate - rial that he has so industriously gathered .

		This is what has happened in the case of most of the joung doctors turned out by our higher institutions of learning , under the lead of the Germans .

		It is deplorable that they should have been taught to believe that their theses were both science and history , when in point of fact they were neither .

		It is about time that the writers of history should return to the spirit and methods of Macaulay ; that they should try at least to do their digesting of docu - ments before they begin their real work , and then should seek to acquire some skill in the use of his variety of statement , his art in emphasis , his illuminating allusive - ness , his compass of view , his sense of perspective , his sweep and flow of coherent narrative , and , above all , his capacity to breathe into his characters the breath of life .

		The historical writers who superseded Macaulay accused him of partisan bias , and prided themselves on their own impartiality .

		There can be no doubt that their charge against Macaulay was well-grounded ; but neither have they succeeded in writing without bias .

		No thinking man can be wholly impartial ; and since this is so , better a thousand times that a writer having the defect of partisanship should also have the divine gifts of the writer who can make the Past live again for those who read his pages .

		Macaulay not only does this , but he hangs that Past of which he writes upon the chain of human historic development , and links us with the remotest Past of the historic nations , giving us a sense of continuity that assures us of our being a part of the Divine Plan .

		His optimism reaches back as well as forward , and is in its essence a true philosophy of life .

		His ordered thought on the historic sequence of events has for its foundation recorded facts ; for its buttresses the steadiness of law ; for its columns , capitals , and arches , the charm of art ; and for its inner adornment the innumerable delights of literature .

		We appreciate the favorable comment on the
San Francisco Library	LOCATION	which appeared in the
September 1	DATE	issue of THE DIAL , but we have accomplished a little more than you give us credit for .

		Instead of three branches we have six in operation , and in addition there are eleven deposit stations .

		The '' pig-tail '' has been seen in the public library here , though most of the educated Chinese have adopted American customs .

		Our reference room is not infre - quently visited by this class for purposes of study , and they usually call for the best class of books .

		A CHILD OF Tin OKMNT ix THE TURMOIL , OF
LONDON	LOCATION	. ''

		Of the exquisite art and captivating artless - ness of Mr.
Yoshio Markino	PERSON	something is already known from his three large color books , '' The Color of
London	LOCATION	, '' '' The Color of
Paris	LOCATION	, '' and '' The Color of
Rome	LOCATION	, '' to each of which the illustrator 's own pen has added a single chapter of even more arresting quality than the beautiful pictures themselves .

		And now he has written an entire book , '' A Japanese Artist in
London	LOCATION	, '' which is the richest possible treat of its kind .

		Mr.
Wallace Irwin	PERSON	, in his mirth-provoking 44 Letters of a Japanese Schoolboy , '' has some - what familiarized American readers with the peculiar idiom of the visitor from
Dai Nippon	ORGANIZATION	attempting to give in English his impressions of the West ; but the studied drollery of that book must yield precedence to the simple and spon - taneous comicality of Mr.
Yoshio Markino	PERSON	's style .

		It was a rather difficult task for me to go on for a whole book with my terribly deformed English , '' he confesses , '' but my English friend has so kindly dragged me all round to reach the finishing point . ''

		These humorously pathetic pages from his own life begin with a brief account of the writ - er 's harsh experience of
Calif	LOCATION	ornian in hospitality in
San Francisco	LOCATION	, where he arrived as a mere lad from
Japan	LOCATION	in the
summer of 1893	DATE	, and where he stayed four years , having run away from home '' with a hope to become a poet or a writer in English . ''

		But the difficulties of the language in which he had hoped to write his way to fame soon led him to take the advice of friends and turn artist .

		44 So I entered into
Hopkins	PERSON	' Art College .

		Of course I was penniless .

		I had to make livelihood by washing windows and dishes , or a little better thing , making sets of false teeth for some dentists .

		It was awfully difficult for me to pay my school tuition ,
seven dollars	MONEY	a month .

		... The school used to supply French breads to the students for the purpose of charcoal drawing .

		But I used to live on this bread .

		I made it as my luncheon every day .

		What a change from all this to the compar - ative cordiality of
London	LOCATION	! ''

		Nobody shouted me , '' relates the new-comer with surprise .

		44 Then I went near the crowds of people with still more fear .

		But being quite ignorant of the English civilization I anticipated some pebble - showers every minute . ''

		None came , however , and ere long we find him rejoicing in the safety of
London	LOCATION	streets , even in the dead of night , when he frequently sallied forth in quest of new impressions and novel artistic effects .

		Devoted to his art , he scorned delights and lived labori - ous days , or , as he expresses it , he 44 rejected the comfortable life . ''

		The shifts to which In - was reduced to keep body and soul together must have been far less amusing to experience than they are to read about .

		Compelled at one time to accept the position of designer to a tombstone manufacturer , he suffered his admira - tion for the beauty of English women to affect his stone angels , turning them all to the sex where , etymologically , they do not belong ; and so he lost his place , and was reduced , as often both before and afterward , to penniless poverty , as he describes it , and to the position of a starv - ing unemployee .

		44 But only one thing was , '' says this son of a family that could trace its lineage back for a thousand years , 44 1 could not ask any disgraceful money like chips -LSB- tips ? -RSB-

		Even in my hardest time , it seemed to me the Samurai spirit of my dead father above was always demanding me , 4 Keep your own dig - nity .

		* '' The guilelessness of the young artist was more than once imposed upon by unscrupu - lous publishers , and he was both saddened and made to suffer hunger by this dishonorable con - duct .

		Comparing the spirit of the two coun - tries ,
England	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, he writes : The Soul of
Old Japan	LOCATION	is Honor , and the soul of
England	LOCATION	is business .

		For the sake of Honor many Samurais had dend-lieat duels with thi-ir dran-M friend - .

		In
England Business	ORGANIZATION	has the power almost the same witli Honor in .

		I often notice my English friends change their expression and knock the table with their fists and say , ' Ah , but this is Business . '

		For business ' laughter gets serious , drunkards get sober , friends quarrel , and lovers depart each other .

		English husbands would bring their wives to the court , all for the business matter .

		Of course I know that English peoples do much for Honor also , but in
Japan	LOCATION	it is only the merchants who do the business , while in
England	LOCATION	it may be that even Princes have business . ''

		THE DIAL 227 Another passage , showing the writer 's atti - tude toward the religion of his adopted country , furnishes matter for thought : '' One day those friends of hers -LSB- of Mrs.

Japan	LOCATION	.

		That was a very difficult question to me .

		It is fact that I was at an
American Missionary College	ORGANIZATION	in
Japan	LOCATION	and studied the
Bible	LOCATION	lessons for four years .

		But among us , the young schoolboys , the Christians were looked down as ' not highly educated . '

		I think the main reason was that those terribly ignorant and uneducated American missionaries in
Japan	LOCATION	were talking and doing too much nonsences .

		While I was in
America	LOCATION	when anybody asked me if I were a Christian I always an - swered negatively to prove that I was not one of those ' Uneducated . '

		But to my astonishment I was entirely knocked down .

		They called me ' Pagan ' and ' Heathen ' and ' Barbarian , ' and they treated me as if I were not a human .

		Fancy !

		that one whose duty is supposed to be ' to seek the lost sheep ' should act himself not at all humanly ! ''

		But his English friends , on this occasion , applauded him when at last he mustered courage to declare his loyalty to Laotze , Confucius , and Mencius , his `` very best sweethearts in this world , '' as he calls them in his book . ''

		I do not worship them as gods , '' he adds , '' but I heartily love them as my elderly brothers . ''

		Some effects of his early Bible study show themselves here and there in a curious or apt English phrase , as when he explains why he did not present a few bottles of Japanese wine -LRB- sake -RRB- to his landlord , who preferred Scotch whiskey . ''

		It was pearl to a pig .

		Too pity to give away such precious thing which we can not get by money !

		So I finished all seven bottles in one night '' with consequences that were rather startling .

		The injurious effects of poor living , overwork , exposure , and other hard experiences , at one time brought the struggling artist to a condition in which he could have sympathized feelingly with Job .

		But through it all he retained his native cheerfulness and courage , as we infer from passages like the following : '' Blood-poison visited me next as the penalty of the bad food I had .

		Toothache , influenza , and intestine troubles were not modest enough to keep away from me .

		However , the ill-health and the bad weathers never affected on my tempers at all .

		The worst thing was , or is evermore , the insincereness of business peoples .

		Oh , those intentional insincerities on the matter of only a little payment !

		I often sank into most disheartened condition , when i thought how faithless this world was . ''

		Note the delicacy with which the writer refrains from accusing these '' business peoples '' of dis - honesty or cheating .

		It is only '' insincereness . ''

		From first to last , money appears to have been a thing beneath the serious consideration of this high-minded Samurai .

		His art and his ideal of perfection are what he is seriously con - cerned with .

		Again and again he refuses to descend to '' pot-boilers , '' and at all times feels reluctant to sell any of his work , so inferior does he regard it to that which he aspires to execute .

		It is '' studies '' simply that he feels himself to have been engaged in thus far ; the worthy product of his art he sees only far in the future .

		A paragraph from his own pen will show his way of looking at the question : '' At this time I was not at all in ' safe condition of my livelihood . '

		Some kind-hearted person offered me a position as an artist for lithographer firm .

		It was 3 10s .

		a week .

		I absolutely refused this , because I knew it would stop my study altogether .

		Many of my friends were either angry with me or laughing at me .

		I got a name , ' most foolish boy . ' ''

		If it has not already been made plain that Mr.
Markino	PERSON	's book is written from the heart , is in fact the very quintessence of that '' sincere - ness '' which he so justly values , let the conclud - ing words of his volume remove all doubt in the matter . ''

		When I finished writing this book I showed it to some friends : they looked rather amazed because I have written about my friends and everything < too directly , ' and I have come back to my own conscience to think that I might have written too much .

		But I am not clever enough to conceal the fact that I am not hypo - crite enough to tell a lie .

		So this book itself is I myself .

		When Confucius made Shunju , he said , It is this book through which the public will know me .

		It is this book through which the public will condemn me . '

		I must say , too , that it is this book through which I may get bitter enemy .

		It is this book through which I may get real friends .

		Anyhow , it is this book through which the public will know me thoroughly . ''

		The pictures in the book , eight in color and four in black and white , are of a daintiness and delicacy wholly characteristic of Japanese art , but also of a faithfulness in drawing and per - spective that remove them from any such mis - leading classification .

		As the artist himself says , his style is not Japanese ; it is rather European , but he himself would be better pleased to have us simply commend its excellence , since , as he holds , art that is worthy of the name belongs to no one country or one continent .

		He has made a special study of
London	LOCATION	atmospheric effects , and is particularly successful , in these illustrations , in giving the glimmer of electric lights through fog , and in reproducing the veritable rain and slippery wetness of
London	LOCATION	streets in nasty weather ; and all with the trans - figuring touch of art .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, THE INDIAN AND HIS PROBLEM .

		* To those who have followed Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	's administration of Indian affairs , and who have heard him talk as he did at
Mohonk	ORGANIZATION	in
October , 1908	DATE	, the assertion made by his assistant and successor , Mr.
Valentine	PERSON	, before the
Mohonk Conference	ORGANIZATION	in
1909	DATE	that Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	had con - tributed force and virility to the
Indian Service	ORGANIZATION	as no other man had ever done , will meet with a ready endorsement .

		The same assertive , vigor - ous , dominating personality is revealed in the book which Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	has written concerning the Indian problem as he has seen it from both within and without the
Service	ORGANIZATION	.

		His book will probably long remain as the most interesting and popular work dealing with the Indian and the government attitudes and policies in Indian affairs .

		Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	is an adept in combining abstract theory with concrete illustrations .

		In fact , his story of personal experiences , limited in number as those stories have to be , almost obviate the necessity of any formal statement of theory .

		To the casual reader , the book must prove not only absorbing in human quality and dramatic narrative , but equally persuasive and convincing .

		The fundamental proposition of the first chapter , that to understand the problem we must first understand the Indian , both from intimate contact and in perspective , is undoubt - edly correct .

		To a student of the problem it must always seem strange that assertions need be made that the Indian is genial , talkative , honest , artistic , and religious .

		But on these points the reader will turn for fuller and even more convincing information to Mr.
McLaughlin	PERSON	's book on `` My Friend the In - dian . ''

		The author has labored in the
Indian Service	ORGANIZATION	for thirty-eight years , as Agent and Inspector , chiefly among the
Sioux	LOCATION	.

		Know - ing the Indians most intimately , and speaking their language , he has been a potent factor in Indian affairs for more than a third of a century .

		In this book he reveals rather than tells what power he has exerted .

		What he has seen and experienced , as well as what he has learned from the lips of noted and unnoted Indians , pro- vides him with material for a book that is as fascinating as a novel .

		The style may be uneven , but it attains in many places to the beauty of poetry and the power of eloquence .

		of suicide , of murder , and of war , all find ex - pression here .

		The Indian 's side of the Little Big Horn battle and the Ouster tragedy ; the ghost-dancers and the death of Sitting Bull ; Captain
Jack	PERSON	and his Modocs ;
Joseph	PERSON	and the
Nez Perec	LOCATION	's , all these furnish topics of absorb - ing interest .

		But the more important contribu - tion lies in the author 's estimate of Indian character and in his statement concerning the proper treatment of the Indian .

		Mr.
McLaughlin	PERSON	believes that the Indian and his ancestors `` have been treated as liars and cheats by liars and cheats . ''

		He adds , '' I have been asked how I have succeeded in retaining the respect and even regard of the Indians ... I may say now ... that I treated the Indian as an individual as nearly as possible as though he were a white man and capable of coping with white men with their own weapons . ''

		`` When I said I would do a thing I did it . '' ''

		I had con - ceived the idea that the Indian had rights . '' ''

		The making of unfair treaties and the violation of treaty rights are the two things of which the Indian has most right to complain . ''

		The author has in recent decades been a maker of treaties and agreements with Indians .

		Although the reviewer has never met Mr.
McLaughlin	PERSON	, he believes that they were both under the same treaty tent in
Wyoming	LOCATION	in the
year 1904	DATE	, after
the Supreme Oourt	ORGANIZATION	had decided in the
Lone Wolf	LOCATION	case that what was regarded by the Indians as a treaty was not necessary even as an agree - ment .

		Consultation was an act of grace on the part of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Perhaps it was not insignifi - cant that the tent came down upon our heads , and so forced the meeting from the Indian 's outdoors to the government council hall .

		If we may believe Mr.
McLaughlin	PERSON	, he has exercised his large powers in the interest of the red man , and he avers that '' there never was a time in the history of his country when the government could not have obtained any reasonable con - cession from the Indians , if it had treated the red men honestly ; and I know of few Indian outbreaks ... which were not preceded by acts of oppression practiced by the civilized people on the barbarians . ''

		His indisposition to use the troops , his belief in a literal fulfilment of treaty obligations , and his emphasis upon sub - stantial legal rights , are all points worth pondering .

		Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	's second chapter gives us a brief review of the policies which resulted from the conquest of the continent by the whites , and the consequent pushing aside of the Indians .

		The assertion is made that the buffaloes were
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 229 exterminated as a means of reducing the Indians to submission , and that the reservation system , rations , idleness , debauchery , and graft , were the natural outcome .

		Education was at first left to the churches , and to mission schools ; but sectarian jealousies brought an end to govern - ment subsidies , and compelled a great national educational policy .

		The
Government	ORGANIZATION	schools , however , Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	avers , in proportion to out - lay do not begin to equal the mission schools in results , and '' in vital energy must always be lacking . ''

		Here the reader must beware .

		Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	's belief is so strong , and his style so lucid and compelling , that we are apt to forget that there is another side to the question , and that the argument presented is based on a funda - mental premise as yet unexpressed .

		In passing it should be said that mission schools , as schools , are notably inefficient .

		It should further be remembered that we have in our government schools many teachers possessed of an immense `` vital energy '' and the truest devotion .

		More important still , what we lack in school efficiency is due in large part to the miserably small salaries paid the teachers , to the unjust and unnecessary subordination of the school to the general administrative authorities , and in partic - ular to the disastrous military discipline which pervades the whole system .

		The great number of topics discussed by Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	, and the very practical reforms initiated by or under his administration , can not be reviewed here .

		Problems of land , property , inheritance , education , liquor , and administra - tion , are all taken up with a view to the enlight - enment of the public , the justification of self , and criticism of the critics .

		Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	, in spite of a special disclaimer to the contrary , seems to put a majority of his critics in the class of the malevolent or the ignorant .

		As a matter of fact , there are people who are neither , who yet differ radically from him .

		The bottom question at issue is summed up in Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	's striking phrase , '' Improvement , not transfor - mation . ''

		He holds that with all his good qualities , the red man remains essentially a different being from the white , and that there - fore we should cultivate his racial aptitudes , with a view to his continued existence as a separate species until disease and intermarriage remove him from the stage .

		The Indian is and must remain fundamentally incapable of certain of our moral , social , and intellectual standards , and we make him a hypocritical '' hopeless and pathetic nondescript '' when we attempt to introduce him on an even basis into our national life .

		The Indian 's '' unbalanced white friends '' have led a number of the race to professional aspirations , and these have survived , save in three or four instances , only as they have settled in some philanthropic city where they subsist by continuous borrowing , by philanthropic subsidies , and by frauds upon the landlady .

		Without attempting to suggest the sharp disclaimer which might be entered here , it must be recognized that Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	argues very strongly for a `` policy of shrink - age '' long known by the term `` vanishing policy '' which will make the Indian a citizen with the full rights and obligations of all citi - zens .

		Earnestly , however , as he argues for such a policy , he himself has been one of the most serious barriers in the way of its realiza - tion .

		When by his influence the
Burke	PERSON	law superseded the Dawes Act , the possibility of citizenship for most Indians was postponed fully twenty-five years beyond the time when land in sever alty should be granted them .

		True , individual Indians may apply for and may be granted citizenship upon proof of special capa - city , but Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	recognizes that it is only a rare Indian who will voluntarily dissociate him - self from his tribe , and experience in
Canada	LOCATION	has fully demonstrated the fact .

		The Indian will never choose to jump the chasm which separates his stage of civilization from ours , yet his only hope of salvation lies in taking the leap .

		An Indian can survive in our civilization only by living in it and trusting completely to it , just as a man learns to swim only when he casts himself into the water .

		Primitive race after primitive race has died out in the presence of a higher race , under the unpractical theory that gradual improvement rather than quick trans - formation was possible .

		In comparative isola - tion , gradual improvement is possible ; under sharp competition , the less advanced race has a choice between transformation and extinction .

		Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	's plan is more drastic than Senator
Dawes	PERSON	's , for it gives both economic and politi - cal freedom at one time , and it postpones the moment of transition for most Indians a gen - eration in the future , when conditions may be harder and the Indians still less prepared than now .

		If we may not hold to the
Dawes	PERSON	policy , let us at least make self-responsibility compul - sory upon the youth as they emerge from our schools .

		The same philosophy which would early ad - mit the Indian fully into our economic , political , and intellectual life , would insist strongly upon the inculation of ideas of a legal order by an 230 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, administration based upon definitely established law .

		Unfortunately , it would seem that the government from the beginning has essayed to prevent any clear definition of the legal status of the Indian .

		This is one of the fundamental reasons for the great confusion in Indian poli - cies , and for our relative failure in the solution of the Indian problem .

		It is not unfair , then , to suggest that perhaps what Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	regards as a great failure in administrative justice at the close of his official career in the famous Navajo case may prove to be one of the land - marks of progress in Indian affairs and in American law .

		The country owes a debt of gratitude to the
Indian Rights Association	ORGANIZATION	for carrying the case to the courts ; losing in the lower courts , it won in the
Supreme Court of the Territory	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	probably is right in thinking that the government should have car - ried the case to the
national Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, that we might have a final and definite determin - ation of Indian rights and Indian law .

		Congress or some private association should formulate at an early date an Indian code .

		It certainly ought not to be true that if the most definite court decision on this question -LRB- the Standing Bear case -RRB- is sound and of general application , no federal officer who has had charge of the dependent race has got through his administra - tion without violating the law from once to fifty times . ''

		The facts and the law regarding the Navajo case are likely to be matters of dispute and discussion for some years to come .

		If the result be more definite law and a more clearly legal administration , the country will have reason to be thankful .

		In his discussion of missionaries and of phil - anthropic societies , Mr.
Leupp	PERSON	raises some very important questions .

		It is probable that in his citation of unworthy missionaries he misrepre - sents himself to the reader .

		Three or four cases , as he would agree , do not determine the character of the great body of missionaries , any more than government opposition to mission - aries in as many cases demonstrates government antagonism to religious teachers as a class .

		Yet it is well to remember that even a missionary may be indiscreet and unwise .

		But beyond that we should also remember that people of widely different standards , as missionaries and Indian Agents sometimes are , see things in very differ - ent ways , and that the missionary who will fail to protest in certain instances will lose the greater part of his power .

		The efficiency of the national administration depends in large part , not on the suppression , but on the encourage * ment , of independent sources of moral author - ity .

		Pitiful is the case of the missionary who has succumbed and become a reservation sycophant .

		On the other hand , our churches and societies should demand the highest stand - ards of intelligence as a part of character for the men and women it is sending into the field .

		The thousand and one ignorant , petty , inter - ested or malevolent criticisms that come to a Commissioner of Indian Affairs are probably enough to make him question the intelligence or the virtue of the public .

		Nevertheless , they are the price we have to pay for democracy .

		A remedy which would require every person or society to report even its suspicions of wrong first to
Washington	LOCATION	, would be worse than the -LRB- list-as .

		- .

		Such a jHilicy has IM - .

		- M known to havt - absolutely no effect , while a suggestion of a dif - ferent method has brought immediate results .

		Even for a Commissioner of the highest energy , intelligence , and integrity , such a policy would become an intolerable burden .

		If the remedy for democracy is more democracy , the remedy for publicity and public intervention is more publicity and more public intervention .

		The public would be less ignorant if it knew more .

		We have suffered too long from obscuration of principles and suppression of facts .

		These two books make a notable contribution to general knowledge , and so will make criticism more effective because more intelligent .

		For the same reason , they will also make administra - tion , both public and private , more efficient .

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 231 the consideration of life 's ephemeral aspects , the discussion of '' tremendous trifles , '' or even of gay heretics like Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, is not adapted to a serious analysis of the fundamental ills that beset modern society .

		What is wrong with the world , according to Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, is of course too much Progress : too much
G. B. S.	PERSON	with his Fabian Calvinism and his obnoxious Superman , too much of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's imperialism , too much Mr.
Wells	PERSON	romancing easily of a capricious future , too much heresy , too much talk of expediency and efficiency , too much business , too much special - ization , too much muddle-headedness , all resulting in too little sensible , democratic , definite understanding of what sort of world most of us really want . ''

		What is wrong is that we do not ask what is right , '' explains Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	airily , meaning , possibly , that we can not agree about what is right .

		At any rate , having put `` What 's Wrong '' in his title , Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	makes it his chief care to depict the world as it would please himself and '' the man in the street '' that omnipresent , inar - ticulate creature who is left out of most socio - logical theorizings , but who has found so staunch and so brilliant an advocate in G. K. C .

		The paradox of the Chestertonian manner explain - ing and defending the habits , tastes , beliefs , and hopes of the Average Man is of course the ultimate basis for the Chestertonian charm .

		If Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's conclusions were as subtle and esoteric as his reasons , he would be a cult for the few , like the second manner of Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	.

		But everybody enjoys speculat - ing on the subtlety and complexity of common things , so long as they remain common .

		Fireworks are fascinating , when they do not set anything on fire .

		Thus Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	begins by brilliantly demonstrating the fallacy of a few idols of pop - ular thought .

		He proves that idealists are the only practical men , that the current insistence on that maxim of hope , '' Look forward and not back , '' is responsible for many current evils and misapprehensions , that wealth and not poverty is the great social canker , that compromise is ever the great foe to getting something done .

		All this in order that he may clear the way for his remedy , or rather for his picture of an ideal world , which is to be founded on the simple facts that every normal man wants a home of his own not a model tenement with com - munal cooking , but a house ; that every normal woman prefers the '' wildness of domesticity '' to the tame routine of manly labor in factory and office , or even to the wildness of being a suffragette ; that every child might be healthy and happy if its education were directed by its mother and not by a schoolmaster with require - ments alien to the traditions and possibilities of the home .

		In brief , Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	considers the institution of the Family more important if possible than the institution of
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		If the Socialist agrees with him to the extent of wishing to preserve the family , he is warned that he must stop talking nonsense about women ; if the Tory is of the same mind , he must be willing to help equalize property .

		What is to be done with the women , otherwise normal , whom Socialism , or some other ism , or the goad of necessity , has already turned against '' the wild - ness of domesticity '' is not specified .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	is evidently quite convinced that the suffragists are an inconsiderable minority , and he implies an easy assurance that the same is true of voluntary wage-earners among women .

		But it is idle to criticize Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	for not having written a practical guide to the re-domesticating of woman .

		The thing to do with Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	is , always , to enjoy him , to be waked up by him , to grasp at the distinc - tions and analyses that fit in with one 's own consciousness of life , and not to be irritated more than is quite pleasant by those which seem absurd .

		If this attitude is impossible , it would appear that the best thing to do with Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	is to leave him alone .

		For example , Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	does not know all about women , but he puts many of his theories very cleverly .

		This , for instance , about the supposed subjection of women : '' Some impatient trader , some superficial missionary , walks across an island and sees the squaw digging in the fields while the man is playing a flute ; and immedi - ately says that the man is a mere lord of creation and the woman a mere serf .

		He does not remember that he might see the same thing in half the back gardens in
Brixton	LOCATION	, merely because women are at once more conscientious and more impatient , while men are at once more quiescent and more greedy for pleasure .

		It may often be in
Hawaii	LOCATION	simply as it is in
Hoxton	LOCATION	.

		That is , the woman does not work because the man tells her to work and she obeys .

		On the contrary , the woman works because she has told the man to work , and he hasn ' t obeyed . ''

		Another good bit is this , about human pleas - ure in property : `` The mass of men have neither time nor aptitude for the invention of invisible beauty .

		For the mass of men the idea of artistic creation can only be expressed by an idea unpopular in present discussions the idea of property .

		The average man can not cut clay into the shape of a man ; but he can cut earth into the shape of a garden ; and though he arranges it with red THE DIAL , -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, geraniums and blue potatoes in alternate straight lines , he is still an artist ; because he has chosen .

		The average man can not paint the .

		sunset whose colon he admires ; but he can paint his own house with what color he chooses , and though he paints it pea green with pink spots , he is still an artist ; because that is his choice .

		Property is merely the art of the democracy .

		It means that every man should have something that he can shape in his own image , as he is shaped in the image of heaven . ''

		We should like to go on with passages about the economic dependence of woman and the dullness of domesticity , both treated as fallacies generated by `` mere wealth '' ; with Mr.
Ches	PERSON	- terton 's ideas about the despotism of modern business , and the essential difference between umbrellas and walking-sticks , as paralleling the difference between communal laundries and com - munal kitchens .

		But the quotability of his ideas is less a warrant for quoting them than for going to the original source , where juxtaposition gives a delightful sense of sprightliness and inex - haustible energy , and where close-knit logic adds cogency and point .

Oscar Browning	PERSON	has for many years been a familiar figure in English education .

		He has written much , but his most important work has been done as a teacher .

		His fidelity to this task has had the natural result that his repu - tation is mainly English , and that in
America	LOCATION	, except to those who know King 's College , Cam - bridge , and the older
Eton	LOCATION	, he is hardly more than a name on the title-page of several interest - ing books .

		As these books belong to two or three different fields , one does not always re - member that the

		Oscar
Browning	PERSON	was born in
1837	DATE	, and was educated at
Eton	ORGANIZATION	and at the
King 's College	ORGANIZATION	.

		His description of the older
Eton	ORGANIZATION	is vivid .

		The material comforts for the young aristocrats were certainly not excessive .

		For food , the '' juniors had to content themselves with 4 cabobed breast , ' a dish I never saw on any other table .

		It was composed of bones , a thin layer of flesh and a thick layer of ` cabob , ' which looked to the uninitiated like boiled chickweed ... There were not enough plates to go round , and knives , forks , and glasses had to be struggled for .

		One left the table as hungry as one had approached it . ''

		Mr.
Browning	PERSON	believes that if he had been fed properly at
Eton	LOCATION	he would have been several inches taller .

		The arrangements for washing were so primitive that it was no wonder if '' little washing was done and less drying , if their hands were begrimed with dirt and seamed with bleeding cracks .

		How often was I kicked at my tutor 's for being a ` dirty tug ' ! ''

		Many of these recollections are no more than statements of passing contact as , for example , that he saw the Emperor
Napoleon III	PERSON	.

		on the street several times .

		Others contain impressions which will add something to our knowledge of
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Robert Browning	PERSON	, and certain lesser personalities .

		He looked upon
George Eliot	PERSON	as an oracle , whose pronouncements he obeyed always , except once when she told him not to come again until he had gotten himself married .

		Even in this case he offered to obey , if she would indicate the person .

		Her influence over him was so great that he was drifting into positivism , when an acquaintance with the Tennysons , which ripened into intimacy , and the influence of Mrs.
Tennyson	PERSON	, whom he re - garded as a woman ideally beautiful , turned his '' thought in a spiritual direction . ''

		Apropos of
Tennyson	PERSON	's `` Lucretius , '' which he notes '' was written to show how an indelicate subject might be treated delicately , '' he says that while
Tennyson	PERSON	was reading it to him , the poet ex - claimed : '' What a mess little
Swinburne	PERSON	would have made of this ! ''

		Although he does not think
Tennyson	PERSON	exaggerated
Arthur Hallam	PERSON	's abilities and promise , he reports a remark of
General Fox	ORGANIZATION	to the effect that
Hallam	PERSON	`` was the most conceited and priggish young man he had ever met . ''

		What Mr.
Browning	PERSON	says about education pos - sesses an interest for those who are baffled by the confusion of much talking on this problem and by the inadequacy of the solutions that are offered .

		He thinks the older
Eton	ORGANIZATION	gave an excellent edu - cation , in spite of its shortcomings , because it was founded on the study of literature , and because it combined a '' firm and uniform course ' ' with an element which was '' adaptable , fitted for every kind of mind and capacity . ''

		This adaptable element was the '' private business '' which was done in the '' pupil room of the tutor , and consisted mainly of reading Greek and Latin authors apart from the regular course . ''

		He describes the scene in
William Johnson	PERSON	's pupil-room : `` Some dozen fourth-form boys are seated at the desks doing their weekly copy of Latin verses .

		He has allowed each to choose a different subject , which , with their cooperation , he elaborates as they proceed ... He calls out to each in turn , stimulating their invention and their humours .

		Each copy of verse when com - pleted is a gem , full of fancy and wit and supreme in scholarship .

		While he is driving a not always very orderly team ... he is seated at his desk correcting with perfect ease copies of sixth-form Greek Iambics , translated from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and whistling in a tone very sweet and low an air from '
Lucia	LOCATION	, ' or something like his own Eton boating-song . ''

		When a master Mr.
Browning	PERSON	endeavored to treat each pupil individually , on the theory that every boy 's mind has its own order of develop - ment , and shows a real desire for knowledge , if only the appropriate knowledge be offered at the right time .

		This sounds like an echo from
Rousseau	PERSON	, but is none the less worth remarking .

		It was in the pupil-room , or in the houses where the boys lived , that their growth could be studied carefully and the method of treatment be adapted to their requirements .

		The secret of Mr.
Brown	PERSON	- ing 's success was his devotion to his pupils .

		With him , teaching was not a means of income , or an opportunity to pursue favorite studies , or to write .

		His great ambition was to train states - men .

		He believes that the study of literature furnishes the true basis for the development of public spirit , because of the suggestiveness of writings like those of
Cicero	LOCATION	,
Livy	PERSON	, and
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	.

		Although he had a share in introducing the study of science into
Eton	LOCATION	, he regards its edu - cational value as now over-emphasized .

		The chief difficulty of the present situation comes , however , from the exaggerated interest in ath - letics , which , he believes , amounts to a national peril .

		When he was at
Eton	ORGANIZATION	, he resisted the encroachments of athletics , and his efforts divided the school into two parties , the '' High Souls '' and the '' Bludgers . ''

		234 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, MEANINGS OF Music .

		* Music , being the latest of the arts to arrive at maturity , has not given as long a time to the theorist for the discovery of its substance and the explanation of its achievements as the others have done .

		Moreover , the theorist in the new field has had some special difficulties to overcome .

		A painting evidently reproduces a scene or a person ; a cathedral is designed to afford a place for a ritual and a worship ; a statue presents a figure that delivers a ready message ; a poem often tells a definite story ; the symphonies of the masters , what are they ?

		and how do they relate themselves to the essen - tial life of mankind ?

		Professor Combarieu , in his '' Music , its Laws and Evolution , '' has an answer ready , which he presents in pages of entertaining and often eloquent argument .

		The matter is carried through with the clearness and simplicity char - acteristic of the French mind ; but there are not wanting indications that some exceptional diffi - culties in the subject have been treated with a deft lightness t hat is far from being entirely convincing .

		Among his definitive statements we find the following : Music is the only popular art .

		It draws its sub - stance from social life , as a plant draws its substance from the soil into which its roots plunge .

		There is no popular painting , no popular sculpture .

		Architecture is too complicated an art , too loaded with technical knowl - edge and archeology , and too much subjected to the prejudices of luxury or to special needs , to be the spon - taneous product of a community .

		To music alone , and to its younger sister , poetry , belongs this privilege . '

		Such are the principles we shall elucidate when re - viewing different peoples and ages .

		Taking as our basis the first proposition , that music u the art of thinking in founds , we shall reserve to ourselves the right of adding this , which is founded on observation : Musical thought is the manifestation of a general and deep instinct , more or less hidden , but everywhere recognizable in humanity . ''

		After the definitions , we have this summary : Music a synthesis of sounds not to be confused with purely sonorous phenomena has a meaning un - translatable into verbal language ; it is formed by a thought without concepts , rhythmically constructed , of which we can not anywhere find the equivalent . ''

		The claims here set up for music are those that are now generally upheld by students as well as enthusiasts .

		The author 's aim is to give these claims a more complete and scientific expression .

		The day is evidently gone by when music can be considered merely as a succession of agreeable ` ounds , whose sole object is to while away a Music , m LAWS AND EVOLUTION .

		period of time that perhaps might be otherwise given over to more questionable pleasures .

		Bach ,
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, and
Wagner	PERSON	, have made such con - clusions impossible .

		The message of music is essentially that of the other arts ; and probably none of them has preswnt ^ l it with inoiv iulm > s or greater allurement .

		The theory above cited is a starting-point for the explanation of music in all its forms and manifestations .

		Melody , harmony , the develop - ment of instruments , the relation to language , the universality of the musical appeal , the pro- gress of the art from its incoherent appearances in savagery to its maturest creations in modern times , are all shown to lie in a comprehension of it as thinking in sounds without the inter - vention of concepts .

		As such , it spans the whole of thought and is competent to bring to light the whole of experience .

		It is susceptible , in our opinion , notwithstanding the stateim-nt of our author , of translation into picture or poetry ; but it has , of course , elements of ex - pression peculiar to itself which constitute its special charm .


Wagner	PERSON	's idea of the Opera as the unification of the arts , in which they mutu - ally reinforce the total effect , is thus shown in consonance with inherent possibilities of the case .

		Professor
Combarieu	PERSON	develops the relation of music to the various sciences , and to the social organization , at full length .

		The mathematical side of music , its physiological aspects , its re - markable prevalence and power among primitive tribes , its many and remarkable analogies with the institutional life of man all these are dis - cussed with the learning and system that pertain to a comprehensive treatment of the subject .

		One may possibly have doubts about a form of thinking that goes on without the intervention of concepts ; the truth about music leads , it would seem , to a satisfactory exposition of the emo - tional nature of mankind , and the adequate ex - pression therefor , and should answer completely certain questions that for a long time have ob - truded themselves .

		Nevertheless , the subject is here treated with a clearness , a fulness , a re - cognition of its importance , that deserve praise .

		Music has now reached the point where it can turn back upon itself , and study its own mean - ings and processes .

		That music has essentially the same substance and message as the other arts can hardly call for discussion ; that it treats profoundly and with inspiration the meaning of this intelligible world in its large aspects , no longer requires debate .

		Professor Combarieu gives us a - sympathetic exposition from this point

		THE DIAL 235 of view , and does it with singular directness and finish .

		The work is not merely a technical treatise , it is also an appeal to the general reader , and should have immediate interest for everybody who cares about the great art of which it treats .

		A HISTORY OF LABOR ix
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		* Nearly a quarter of a century ago , Professor
Kichard T. Ely	PERSON	published his history of '' The Labor Movement in
America	LOCATION	, '' a pioneer work in its field , and one which has enjoyed great popularity , but which was intended by its author only as an earnest of a greater work to come , one which should constitute when finished noth - ing less than a complete
History of Labor	ORGANIZATION	in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		The task of preparing this larger work proved , however , too great an undertaking for a single investigator ; and the scantiness of the material which was so arranged as to be available for the compiler was brought so forcibly to Dr.
Ely	PERSON	's attention that he deter - mined to organize a force of collaborators and endeavor to secure a fund for the prosecution of this task of industrial research .

		He was fortunate enough to succeed in both these pre - liminary undertakings .

		A portion said by the editors to be the most valuable part of the fruits of the inves - tigation conducted by the collaborators is now being shared with the public in the form of ten large volumes entitled '' A Documentary His - tory of
American Industrial Society	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		While it is nowhere directly so stated , it is probable that the editors have not abandoned their orig - inal intention of producing a narrative history of the labor movement , but that they are offer - ing those interested an opportunity to judge of the thoroughness with which they are pro- ceeding by furnishing them , in advance of the final work , with a partial survey of the mate - rials with which they have to deal .

		publication will prove invaluable to other inves - tigators in the same field , and that it deserves the gratitude of all scholars , will hardly require demonstration .

		The title of the work is somewhat mislead - ing ; for while the material contained in these volumes throws much light on other subjects than those pertaining to labor , the undisguised purpose of the editors has been to present docu - ments which in one way or another deal with the labor problem .

		Some exception to this rule may perhaps be allowed in the case of the first two volumes , entitled '' Plantation and
Frontier	ORGANIZATION	, '' although here too the main purpose has been to throw light on such subjects as the use of coerced labor , whether that of the negro slaves or that of the indentured whites , and to deal with certain aspects of free labor when used either on the plantation or at the frontier .

		Of the other vol - umes , two deal with '' Labor Conspiracy Cases , '' while the remaining six will reveal the efforts that have been made by free laborers to better their conditions by means of association , organi - zation , and political propaganda .

		To the first volume , Professor
Ely	PERSON	contributes a `` General Preface '' to the entire work , setting forth the history of its inception and the diffi - culties that have been met with in collecting and collating the material .

		He also describes in a general way the character of the material which has been gathered by the ''
Bureau of Industrial Research	ORGANIZATION	, '' which is the name of the organi - zation established to further the work of prepar - ing this history of labor .

		Much of the material gathered by the
Bureau	ORGANIZATION	is not included in the contents of the work now being published .

		Dr.
Ely	PERSON	's Preface is followed by a '' General Introduction , '' written by Professor
John B. Clark	PERSON	, who figures as one of the `` advisory editors '' of the work .

		Professor
Clark	PERSON	mentions what he considers to be the significant economic characteristics of American history , and attempts not very successfully , it must be said to formulate a philosophy of American history based on the inter-relation of these leading characteristics .

		The foremost of American eco - nomic theorists is clearly not at home in the domain of history , and we hardly need the testimony of the last page of this Introduction -LRB- which is numbered 53-65 -RRB- to convince us that this '' General Introduction '' was intended by the editors as a `` filler , '' a service which it rather inadequately performs .

		The real Introduction to the first two volumes is furnished by their editor , Dr.
Ulrich B. Phillips	PERSON	of
Tulane University	ORGANIZATION	, one of the most 236 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, scholarly investigators in the field of Southern history .

		As already stated , the subject matter of these two volumes is the '' Plantation and Frontier '' ; and Dr.
Phillips	PERSON	's Introduction per - forms a real service in showing us the part played by these historic institutions in our social and economic development .

		He claims that the South offers the best examples not only of plantation life but of that of the frontier as well .

		The frontier in the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	was pro- tected by the
United States	LOCATION	army , and the government of this region was under Federal authority .

		In the South , on the other hand , little was done to assist the frontiersmen to develop their resources , and the people were consequently left free to develop their own forms of legislation , administration , and military con - trol .

		Dr.
Phillips	PERSON	further shows how both the plantation and the farming systems spread in the South , the conflict between the two systems , the development of their respective fields of enterprise , and the peculiar fitness of each type for the task to be performed .

		Taking in its turn each of the great industrial areas of the South , Dr.
Phillips	PERSON	traces the growth of popula - tion , the history of the selection of staple crops suited to the area in question , and the gradual adaptation of the form of landholdings and of agricultural methods to meet the conditions imposed by these crops .

		It would be impossible to mention , let alone discuss , most of the nearly 400 documents which Dr.
Phillips	PERSON	has elected to give us , either in full or in part , as his selections for illustrat - ing the history of the South between the years
1649	DATE	and
1863	DATE	.

		In making his selection , the editor tells us that he has sought to combine in each instance the three qualities of rareness , unconsciousness , and faithful illustration .

		To say that he has succeeded in doing this in every instance would be to claim for him the impos - sible ; and doubtless any investigator in this field will be able to criticize with justice some of the selections made , and to point to others which in his judgment would have better illus - trated the tendencies or institutions which it is sought to depict .

		Yet it may be said with fair - ness that in no other single work has so much material been collected tending to reveal to us the real character of the Southern people and the problems which they had to solve in the days of slavery and the plantation regime y as is to be found within the covers of these two volumes .

		An economic history of the South could not be written from the material contained in these volumes alone , but at the same time many mis - takes made by historians who have sought to interpret for us the story of the Old South would have been prevented could the writers have had access to the material now placed before us as a result of Dr.
Phillips	PERSON	's careful research .

		For the printed materials , political speeches , news - paper and magazine articles and editorials , pub - lished sermons , even the governmental reports and statistics with which historians have in the main had to satisfy themselves , were prepared by men who were conscious of the fact that their work was to receive publication ; and even though these men were honest in their convic - tions , and earnestly desirous of setting forth the truth concerning the subjects with which they had to deal , they were hampered by the fact that they had a thesis to defend , and they knew that what they had to say was likely to be used by others as evidence for certain pro- positions which they desired should be believed .

		On the other hand , of the documents which Dr.
Phillips	PERSON	here offers , many not all consist of extracts from letters written to members of the family or to personal friends , never intended for publication : directions from plantation own - ers to their overseers and reports from overseers to the owners , extracts from diaries and personal memoranda kept for the exclusive use of the writers , newspaper advertisements , and the like , all of which unconsciously describe the real situ - ation in the ante-bellum South and enable us to understand somewhat of the life of a by-gone age which few of us , in the North at least , have ever been able to comprehend .

		The documents in the first volume have to do entirely with the
Plantation	ORGANIZATION	, describing its management , routine , staple crops , vicissitudes , supplies and factorage , overseers , and white labor , whether free or indentured .

		Particularly interesting are those which deal with the experi - ence of planters and overseers with slave labor and that of the bond - servants .

		It is from these documents that one gets the most accurate infor - mation concerning the real advantages and dis - advantages of coerced labor ; and no abolitionist could have better pictured the economic evils resulting from trying to carry on agricultural operations with slave labor and absentee owner - ship than do many of these letters and planta - tion reports .

		The reader is quite prepared to sympathize with the brother-in-law of Ho well
Cobb	PERSON	, who wishes that he could trade his negroes for lands .

		The lands would lie still , and not bother one like the negroes . ''

		The section dealing with '' Plantation
Vicissi	PERSON	- tudes '' shows us the fear which constantly pos -
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 237 sessed the slaveowner that his most valuable property might at any time be lost , by running away , by theft , by disease , or by suicide .

		The cholera in particular was a subject of dread .

		Other documents of much interest in the first volume are those in which redemptioners in colonial days give the results of their experience in selling themselves into service .

		Two of these which deserve especial mention are the accounts furnished by an intelligent schoolmaster and by a confessed criminal .

		The selections contained in the second volume cover a wider range than do those in the first .

		About half of the volume contains documents having to do , in one way or another , with slavery and slave labor .

		Other subjects treated are the free negroes , whose presence in the South was always a thorn in the flesh to the slave-owner , the poor whites , immigration and western migra - tion , frontier settlement and frontier society , manufacturing and town labor , and public reg - ulation of industry and commerce .

		Both the bright and the dark sides of slavery are well presented by these documents , and the editor , although a Southerner , has held no brief for either side .

		Some of the documents contain an element of real pathos , as , for example , the letter of
Billy Proctor	PERSON	to
John Lamar	PERSON	, urg - ing the latter to purchase him until he can buy his own freedom .

		On the other hand , the easy , care-free life of the
Jamaica	LOCATION	slave is indicated by this statement of an English planter : '' As far as I can judge , if I were now standing on the banks of
Vergil	ORGANIZATION	's
Lethe	LOCATION	, with a goblet of waters of oblivion in my hand , and asked whether I choose to enter life anew as an English labourer or a
Jamaica	LOCATION	negro , I should have no hesitation in preferring the latter . ''

		Probably the most interesting document in either volume is the one which purports to be a description by an intelligent slave of his experiences as a member of a slave-gang being taken from
Maryland	LOCATION	to
South Carolina	LOCATION	.

		The description of the journey may be a tolerably correct pic - ture of what was likely to occur , but the inter - nal evidence is against the authenticity of the document itself .

		The documents that describe frontier condi - tions are not numerous , but are selected with a view to illustrating conditions in various parts of the South as the frontier was gradually pushed westward and northward .

		There is an interesting description of a
Georgia	LOCATION	camp-meet - ing held in the year
1807	DATE	, in which `` thirty-seven Methodist preachers '' participated .

		Preaching occured four times a day , with usually an ex - hortation following the sermon , and all-night sessions were not infrequent .

		The meetings lasted five days , and the average attendance was from three to four thousand .

		If a statistical estimate of the results of the meetings be not out of place , it may be safe to venture the remark that only `` eighty souls converted , including black and white people '' seem to be rather scanty returns from such strenuous efforts .

		In volumes three and four , and in the sup - plementary volume , Professors Commons and
Gilmore	PERSON	have reprinted the court proceedings in seven important cases , occuring between the years
1806	DATE	and
1842	DATE	, in which combinations of laborers were indicted and tried for conspiring to raise their wages .

		Several other cases of the same sort are given briefer notice by the editors .

		All of these cases have to do with what is to-day known as the '' closed shop '' controversy .

		The earliest and perhaps the most important of these cases is that of the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	cord - wainers of
1806	DATE	.

		Eight journeymen boot and shoe makers of that city were tried and found guilty of entering into a conspiracy to raise their wages , and each of the defendants was fined eight dollars and costs .

		The chief point at issue in this and the subsequent trials was as to whether the English common law , according to which combinations of laborers to raise wages were illegal , was applicable to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Notwithstanding a strong showing by the de - fense , who argued that there was no precedent for such a trial in the history of our colonies , and that the spirit of American constitutions and laws was opposed to this idea of conspiracy , the Recorder in his charge to the jury practi - cally left that body no alternative but to render a verdict of guilty .

		The original pamphlet report of this case is very rare , being found in few libraries .

		How scarce it had become is shown by the fact that only
twenty-two years later	DATE	in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	itself , when the record was wanted in a similar trial of the journeymen tailors , the counsel for the prosecution said that he had been unable to find any record of the proceedings in the earlier trial .

		It is a somewhat curious fact that the copy from which the editors have secured their reprint was found in the library of the
State University of Iowa	ORGANIZATION	.

		The later cases reported in these volumes are very much similar to the one just described , with the difference that as time passes both court and jury become somewhat more lenient concerning the offence of the laboring men , un - til in one or two of the later cases , particularly 238 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	in that of the
Thompson	PERSON	ville -LRB-
Conn.	LOCATION	-RRB- weavers , the verdict turned in favor of the workers .

		How far the legal question at issue is from being a dead one even today , however , is shown by the recent decision of Judge
Richardson	PERSON	of the
Massachusetts Superior Court	ORGANIZATION	, that a strike called for the purpose of compelling an em - ployer to unionize his shop is illegal .

		In a splendid introduction to these three vol - umes Professor Commons has utilized the facts brought out in these cases and elsewhere to trace the development of industrial organization in the boot and shoe industry .

Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is made up of the recent chapters of personal reminiscence published in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine , '' sundry ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' reviews of early books by
Mark Twain	PERSON	, and a few later appre - ciations of the man and his work from other period - icals .

		The poem , `` The American Joke , '' read by Mr.
Howells	PERSON	at the birthday dinner given to his friend in
1905	DATE	, agreeably closes the book .

		That the author of ''
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	'' was a boy to the end of his days , and that as a humorist he is to be ranked with
Cervantes	PERSON	and with Swift , neither of whom , however , was his equal in humanity ; and , further , that as an orator or lecturer he was '' the most consummate public performer '' Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has ever seen , being , on the platform , `` the great and finished actor which he probably would not have been on the stage '' these are some of the terms in which are expressed a warm appreciation and hearty admiration of him concerning whose death
Johnson	PERSON	's famous words on the death of Garrick might have been uttered with far less of hyperbole than in their original application .

		Even above his scrupulous honesty in discharging that mountain of debt which was none of his contracting , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	rates his friend 's '' abhorrence of the Spanish War , and the destruction of the South-African republics , and our deceit of the Filipinos , and his hate of slav - ery , ... and his support of a poor artist for three years in
Paris	LOCATION	, and his loan of opportunity to the youth who became the most brilliant of our actor - dramatists , '' and `` even his pity for the wounded bird throbbing out its little life on the grass for the pleasure of the cruel fool who shot it . ''

		The book is an instructive and engrossing study of a noble and unique character , and no one can read it with - out being the better for it Its fine portraits and views add much to its attractiveness .

		Shall one be a sober chronicler of ^ or * Merr y Andrew of liter * ture ?

		Or can one unite the two func - tions as a critic ?

		These thoughts come naturally to the mind in reading Mr.
James Huneker	PERSON	's latest book of essays , '' Promenades of an Impressionist '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , a study of painters , etchers , sculptors of to-day , yesterday , or forever ,
Rodin	LOCATION	, Rops ,
Botti	PERSON	- celli .

		Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	, in the matter of style , scintil - lates , challenges , and alternately provokes and de - lights .

		He forgets that while cleverness arouses , only beauty of manner satisfies in the long run .

		Like Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, he falls over his own smartness again and again ; and , if you happen to know something whereof he speaks , you have an uneasy sense that he seizes on the eccentrics and extremists of art or liter - ature or music and uses them for what they offer him as picturesque material .

		You fear that he will sacri - fice a fact to an epigram , or at least that effect with him always comes first Yet hardly have you said this , when your eye encounters some plangent phrase or some search-light of penetrative opinion , and you feel apologetic .

		One thing is sure , anyway , with regard to Mr.
Hnneker	PERSON	: he is neither negative nor neuter .

		If it be the business of the impressionist not only to receive impressions , but to impress , he cer - tainly does his duty .

		He offers a kind of sauce piquante to the literary feast The way to read liim is to get your humdrum facts from Dr.
Dryasdust	PERSON	then turn to this cocksure art-for-art 's - sakist , and respond to his stimulation and suggestiveness .

		He has sympathy , that precious quality , and love for those he writes of ; read him on
Degas	LOCATION	, or
Monticelli	PERSON	, for example , what a tender-ironic lovely note is that with which he closes his brief study of the last - named colorist : '' Alas , poor Fada ! ''

		Stimulation , suggestion , sympathy , egoistic bias , and a harlequin 's pleasure in the fine phrase , these are all here and make the volume at once a delight an irritation , and a danger .

		In `` The Psychology of Reasoning '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- Professor
W. B. Pills	PERSON	- bury has made available a useful guide to a useful subject .

		The title of his volume suggests either of two references ; and it is import - ant to state that its content refers to the psycho - logical analysis of the logical procedures , and not to the general consideration of the wealth of psycho - logical processes that go on in the human mind when it is on reasoning bent The appeal of the volume is to the student It sets before him as psychology what has been most commonly considered as logic .

		Reasoning as an instrument , both in its operation and in the securing of the wherewithal to work upon , is dependent upon a fair range of mental procedure .

		Experience would be reacted too formlessly and un - protitably were it not that through the mind 's logical temper it coalesces in a system , a system of mean - ings .

		The justification of reasoning belongs to logic ; the description of the contributory tendencies belongs to psychology .

		Naturally the latter follows the well -
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 239 marked path of the former ; and the several chap - ters of the present volume undertake to set forth what is involved on the psychological side when the mind believes and judges , when it infers and syllo - gizes , when it proves and generalises and applies .

		The discussion drifts at times into finer distinctions that seem urgent ; but at bottom the only difference between the plain man 's account of these processes and the academic one is a more disciplined realisa - tion of the implications .

		The plain man , like the logician , uses a system to make of his mental rumina - tion a real progressive digestion .

		He feels less keenly the satisfaction that comes from an inward analysis and justification ; but , the student interest once as - sumed , the expositions furnished by Professor Pills - bury may be warmly commended as a safe and sane guide to the understanding of a technical but import - ant chapter in the mind 's productions and processes .

		In Mr.
H. J. Moors	PERSON	's agreeably anec - dotal volume , `` With
Stevenson	PERSON	in
Samoa	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , are a number of corrections of false impressions .

		At least , the author evidently believes in the correct - ness of his corrections , and he certainly had full opportunity to become acquainted with the real
Stevenson	PERSON	, being his first host and his constant intimate in
Samoa	LOCATION	, besides acting as his agent and banker in business and pecuniary matters .

		u It has been said , '' writes Mr.
Moors	PERSON	, '' that he took his ill health cheerfully ; that is wrong , it was his good health that he took cheerfully . ''

		As to the novelist 's flageolet-playing , we read : `` My friend
Carruthers	PERSON	, who had him for a neighbor , averred positively that he played so dolefully upon the instrument as to be a menace to one 's enjoyment of life . ''

		According to the author 's account and he seems to have been in a position to know , being purchasing agent for the family enough cigarettes and coffee were con - sumed at
Vailima	LOCATION	to shorten the lives of several strong men , to say nothing of one invalid .

		But the Stevensons were lavish entertainers , and spent a small fortune in enlarging and keeping up their island villa .

		That they cleared , however , the whole of the four hundred acres attached to it , as at least one biographer has asserted , is declared by Mr.
Moors	PERSON	to be false , since only fifteen acres were thus reclaimed from the wilderness .

		The author 's strong disapproval of
Stevenson	PERSON	's collaborating with another in story-writing was openly expressed to him at the time of this perversion of his genius , and will be heartily endorsed by all true lovers of K. L. S .

		Mr.
Moors	PERSON	's book is fully illustrated and forms a welcome addition to the already long list of reminiscences of a most winsome personality .

		The rather unaccountable lack of of * '' vttthll . ''

		any Previous biography of
William Beckford	PERSON	, excepting the unsatisfac - tory compilation given to the world in
1859	DATE	by
Cyrus Redding	PERSON	, makes unusually welcome '' The Life and Letters of
William Beckford	PERSON	of Fonthill '' -LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- from the competent pen of Mr.
Lewis Melville	PERSON	.

		By permission of the
Duke of Hamilton	ORGANIZATION	, in whose possession , by reason of the marriage of
Beckford	PERSON	's daughter Susan to the tenth Duke , are many letters and other papers of
Beckford	PERSON	's , much manuscript material of value has been at the biog - rapher 's disposal ; and the book abounds in extracts from these and other equally important original documents .

		The many letters , printed entire or in part , tell much of
Beckford	PERSON	's life-story in his own words .

		They are the letters of a man never un mindful of his own dignity , somewhat pompous in style , but revealing great vigor of intellect , a wide range of interests and tastes , varied and extensive learning , and remarkable strength of character and force of will . ''

		He was inclined , especially in his later days , to take himself seriously , '' we read , `` but his sense of honour always saved him from becoming ridiculous '' a timely rescue that the rest of us generally owe to our sense of humor .

		The most interesting chapters in the book are those relating the genesis and history of `` Vathek '' and the build - ing of
Fonthill Abbey	ORGANIZATION	.

		Numerous characters of note appear as
Beckford	PERSON	's friends and correspond - ents , despite the literally walled-in life he led at
Fonthill	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Melville	PERSON	's '' Bibliography , '' with its long list of successive editions of '' Vathek , '' attests the former popularity of that now little-read romance , and it also calls attention to the now never-read other works from the same pen .

		A contemporary description of
Fonthill	ORGANIZATION	recalls , in twelve closely printed pages , the splendors of that costly piece of architecture .

		The French passages in the book are not free from typographical errors , but otherwise the workmanship of the volume is admirable .

		Ten portraits and two views of the Abbey are inserted .

		This is a biographical work not likely ever to be superseded .

		Fortunately , it is quite impossible to of Flor ^ L. write a duU book about
Florence	LOCATION	, not only does the subject forbid , but even a dull person , under the spell of
Florence	LOCATION	, be - comes to a certain extent an inspired one .

		Hence , in taking up a new addition to the already long list of books about the city , one is pretty nearly certain that while he will find nothing new the chances are that he will not be bored .

		Such proves to be the case with Mr.
Max Vernon	PERSON	's `` In and Out of
Florence	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		``
Florence	LOCATION	, Mecca of that sect of believers , persistent even in these breathless days of machines and money-madness , the believers in the reality of the ideal , '' the author exclaims on the first page of his book .

		But he recognizes also that one can not live on wonder and inspiration alone ; even
John	PERSON	in the desert had his locusts and wild honey .

		Many are the persons who , like Mr.
Vernon	PERSON	, wish to become temporarily Florentines .

		Neither hotel nor pension will satisfy ; they must take a house or villa , or at least a villino , in order to come into closer touch with the community .

		All such will be grateful for the opening chapters , deal - 240 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, ing with such practical matters as house-hunting , servants , marketing , housekeeping , garden and village -LRB-
Settignano	LOCATION	, in this case . -RRB-

		These details being happily adjusted , the author becomes a chatty but never tedious guide to the usual sights , the churches , the galleries , the courts and palaces , stray pictures on monastery walls , the streets , the shops , the festas , the nearby excursions to
Vallombrosa	LOCATION	,
Prato	LOCATION	,
Pistoja	LOCATION	,
Lucca	LOCATION	, and
Pisa	LOCATION	.

		The book does not pretend to take the place either of general guide like
Baedeker	PERSON	,
Gardner	PERSON	, or
Hare	PERSON	, or yet of the specialist like
Berenson	PERSON	,
Hewlett	LOCATION	,
Hyett	PERSON	, or Zim - mern .

		Rather it is to be commended as agreeable reading for a first-tripper , either before going or after his return .

		Not the least of its charm is its copious and artistic illustrations of Italian scenery from the drawings of Miss
Maud Lanktree	PERSON	, besides the good reproductions from photographs of famous paintings , sculpture , and architecture .

		WoolrowiH The P '' ^ 6 of Mr ' C ' W
Wright	PERSON	's at affected by volume on '' Wool-Growing and the the tariff .

		Tariff '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is '' to examine the history of the wool-growing industry in this country with a view to finding out what influences have shaped its development and especially to what extent it has been affected by the tariff . ''

		The task has been well done , especially the first part of it ; and although the author disavows any intention of attempting to state in detail the effect of the tariff at different periods , yet the intelligent reader will not be in much doubt as to the author 's opinion in this particular .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	very properly realizes that economic results are the product of many vari - able forces , and he refuses to attempt to assign to each force its weight in bringing about the result .

		The study shows familiar acquaintance with the original and secondary sources of material .

		Foot - notes and references are numerous , and at the close of each chapter a summary is given on excellent feature of a study in economic history .

		The develop - ment of the industry is divided into eight periods ,
viz.	LOCATION	, wool-growing before
1800	DATE	; the advent of the Merino , 1800-1815 ; commercial wool-growing , 1816-1830 ; the supremacy of the
East	LOCATION	,
1830	DATE	-
1840	DATE	; the rise of the middle west , 1840-1860 ; the Civil War period , 1860-1870 ; the rise of the far west , 1870-1890 ; free wool and the end of the westward movement , 1890-1907 .

		It may be ques - tioned whether there is in each case logical reasons for such absolute divisions , but the plan adds interest and definiteness to the subject .

		The author considers the protective duties to have benefitted the manu - facturers more than the growers of wool .

		The study shows the effect of the tutelage of Professor
Taussig	PERSON	, and no better guarantee of its value could be given .

		A number of interesting charts add much to the value of the book .

		It is the type of a study which is all too rare , and its contents should be made gen - erally known in this period of wide-spread interest in the question of what shall be the characteristics of our future tariff legislation .

		Something more than a literary com - f - .

		wo mans ' rights document , is Miss
Ethel Rolt Wheeler	PERSON	's book entitled Famous Blue - Stockings '' -LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The group of brilliant women who formed the kernel of cultured
London	LOCATION	society between
1770	DATE	and
1785	DATE	were by no means noisy advocates of woman suffrage , but they proved by their own accomplishment that wit and learning in women are not inconsistent with domestic Hli - ciency and sound common sense , nor even with the retention of feminine charm .

		More than this , they even raised their voices in calm and gentle criticism of the position assigned their sex , although leaving to their great-granddaughters all forcible efforts to right such wrongs .

		The arrangement of Miss
Wheeler	PERSON	's book is peculiar .

		Alternating with the general chapters on manners and customsare separate biographies of the leading '' Blue-Stockings , '' Mrs.
Montagu	PERSON	, the brilliant and lavish hostess ; Mrs.
Delany	PERSON	, the marvellous artist in '' paper mosaics '' ; Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	, the somewhat melodramatic enthusiast ; Mrs.
Vesey	PERSON	, the sweet and sympathetic friend of humankind ; Mrs.
Chapone	PERSON	, the exponent of straight - laced propriety ;
Fanny Burney	PERSON	, the gifted egoist ;
Elizabeth Carter	PERSON	, the learned but unassuming translator of
Epictetus	ORGANIZATION	;
Hannah More	PERSON	, the ver - satile - writer , the educational and social reformer .

		A proem sketches the striking characteristics of the age , and a conclusion treats of its influence on later generations .

		The author makes dexterous use of the points of contact between these gifted ladies and the more familiar names from the other sex ,
Johnson	PERSON	,
Richardson	PERSON	,
Garrick	PERSON	,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Scott	PERSON	, Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	,
Goldsmith	PERSON	,
John Wesley	PERSON	, and a long list of others .

		The fascinating spirit of the eighteenth century is caught most delightfully in these lively pages .

		Vocation * for Recent agitations and activities the trained among women have caused the dis - coiieue woman .

		Cug8 i on o f their particular problems to assume a place not inconspicuous in current litera - ture .

		A recent publication of the Women 's Educa - tional and
Industrial Union	ORGANIZATION	of
Boston	LOCATION	, entitled '' Vocations for the Trained Woman Opportunities other than Teaching , '' answers , with conciseness , many questions necessarily put by the educated woman about to earn her living , and is valuable since it deals with fact rather than with speculation , and is free from sentimentality .

		The book , we are told , is an outcome of the conviction that many women who are unfitted for teaching drift into that vocation as the one with which they are most famil - iar ; that the teaching which results is poor ; and that unsuccessful teachers might become able work - ers in other fields .

		In order to suggest what these fields are , and to indicate to what extent a college education helps a woman to attain positions and promotions therein , this series of articles has been prepared by specialists , men and women actively interested in the subject they are presenting .

		The
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 241 conditions described are largely those now existent in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, but the conclusions deduced therefrom are presumably applicable to a more extended area .

		Seventy articles or thereabouts are grouped under the eight headings of Social and
Economic Service	ORGANIZATION	, Scientific Work , Domestic Science and Arts , Agriculture , Business , Clerical and Secre - tarial Work , Literary Work , Art -LRB- Illustrating and Designing -RRB- , and
Special Forms of Teaching	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each contributor has endeavored to set forth the qualifi - cations and training necessary efficiently to follow such vocations as he describes , and to take account of the compensations therein and the opportunities for advancement .

		One is impressed with the fact that nowadays either specialized education or a long apprenticeship is requisite for success in any given field .

		In presenting these facts , no false lure is held out to the woman about to earn her living ; she need , however , find no occasion for discouragement ; the search-light has been turned helpfully upon the occupations which are open to her .

		can village of
Dolores	LOCATION	, there arose from the motley crowd of villagers , armed and un - armed , gathered about their priest ,
Miguel Hidalgo	PERSON	y Costilla , a great shout , '' Viva Independence !

		Viva America !

		Muera el mat gobierno ! ''

		This battle cry of freedom , known ever since as `` el Grito de Dolores '' is annually commemorated by fitting ceremonies throughout the Republic of
Mexico	LOCATION	, and has this year had its centennial celebration .

		Almost simultaneously with that celebration there has ap - peared in this country a biography of the priest and patriot , the originator of the movement for Mexican independence . ''

		The Life and Times of
Miguel Hidalgo	PERSON	y Costilla '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- is the joint work of Dr.
Arthur Howard Noll	PERSON	and Mr.
A. Philip McMahon	PERSON	, and is the first complete account of that famous man in our language , if not indeed in any language .

		At all events there seems to be no adequate biography of him in his own country , and the authors have shown diligence and zeal in getting together , from sources none too abundant , so many facts concerning one whose life in full detail can now probably never be told .

		Their book , of two hundred pages , is a noteworthy contribution to the history of Mexican independence .

		A portrait of the patriot , '' from a rare print , '' forms the frontis - piece .

		Professor
J. Arthur Thomson	PERSON	justly .

		writers on biological subjects .

		He has the rare ability to present the concrete data of science on the one hand , and the theoretical discus - sion of such data on the other hand , in a manner that is at once technically correct and untechnically comprehensible and interesting .

		His latest book , '' Darwinism and Human Life '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , consists of a series of lectures delivered in
1909	DATE	under the auspi - ces of the
South African Association	ORGANIZATION	for the Ad - vancement of Science .

		In the Preface the author states : '' It was the chief aim of the lectures to ex - plain the gist of Darwinism what problems
Darwin	PERSON	set himself to solve , and what solutions he arrived at , and to indicate what progress has been made as regards the problems of Organic Evolution since
Darwin	PERSON	's day what has been added to Darwinism , what , if anything , has been taken away , and , especially , what is now being reconsidered . ''

		As was to be expected from the quality of Professor
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's previous writings , the task thus set has been well done .

		The book is especially to be com - mended to college and university teachers who wish to put into the hands of students a brief account of what has been accomplished in the study of evolu - tion , which shall be authoritative and at the same time of a sort to stimulate and hold interest .

		No better book for such a purpose is available .

		The last chapter , '' Selection : Organic and Social , '' deals in a sane way with the problems and possibilities of eugenics .

		A brief but well chosen list of recent books on evolutionary topics closes the volume .

		It is a pity that so good a book , containing such a wealth of detailed facts to which many a reader will want to refer , should not have been deemed worthy of an index .

Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		o f northwestern
British America	LOCATION	, the stern task confronting this gallant force , and divers incidents and adventures from its history , together with the writer 's personal experiences as the policemen 's guest , in the barracks and on the prairie , are fully and graphically related by Mr.
A. L. Haydon	PERSON	in a substantial octavo entitled '' The Riders of the Plains : Adventures and Romance with the
North-West Mounted Police	ORGANIZATION	, 18731910 , '' published by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author writes that it has been his '' good fortune and privilege to be admitted into the confidence of the corps , and thus to acquire exclusive and accurate information . ''

		Instances proving the efficiency of this carefully selected and well trained police force abound in Mr.
Haydon	PERSON	's pages , interspersed with stories and adventures of a diverting character , and also agreeably diversified with numerous illustra - tions , chiefly from photographs , and with four maps and diagrams .

		A chapter entitled '' Horse Thieves and ` Cattle Rustlers ' '' contains some especially striking instances of prompt and successful action on the part of the
Mounted Police	ORGANIZATION	, and one on `` Indian Problems '' is of no less interest .

		In describing the ruthless practices that have cleared the buffalo herds from the prairie , the author uses a far too mild word -LRB- '' decimation '' -RRB- to denote their rapid deple - tion .

		If our buffalo-hunters had been content with decimation the bison -LRB- to give the animal its proper name -RRB- would still abound in the great
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		The present awakened interest in that land of promise makes timely and acceptable such a work as Mr.
Haydon	PERSON	's .

Humphry Ward	PERSON	has written a new novel , '' The Case of

Emerson Journals	ORGANIZATION	are shortly to be issued by
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		They will contain virtually all the hitherto unprinted matter written bj

		New editions of two of Mr.
E. Phillips Oppenheim	PERSON	's earlier novels , `` The Mystery of Mr.
Bernard Brown	PERSON	'' and `` A Daughter of the Marionis , '' have just been issued by
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the authorized publishers in
America	LOCATION	for all of Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	's work .

		During the autumn the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish the first volume of the
Life of Lord BeaconsBeld	ORGANIZATION	, based on his private papers , that Mr.
W. F. Monypenny	PERSON	has been engaged upon for some years past .

		This volume covers the period from
Disraeli	PERSON	's birth to his entry into
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	in
1837	DATE	.

		The general interest aroused by the publication of
M. Romain Holland	PERSON	's romance in ten volumes entitled ''
Jean Christophe	PERSON	'' has led
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	to prepare a translation of the first two , which they will pub - lish in one volume under the title of ``
John Christopher	PERSON	: Dawn and Morning . ''

		Mr.
Harry Peyton Steger	PERSON	, literary executor of the late
W. S. Porter	PERSON	-LRB- '' O. Henry '' -RRB- , would be glad to have copies of any letters or documents from this writer , or to hear from anybody who is interested in a biography of
O. Henry	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Communications should be addressed to Mr.
Steger	PERSON	at

New York	LOCATION	.

spring of 1911	DATE	Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons are planning to bring out The Letters of
Eliza	LOCATION	- beth

		The work will be edited by Mr.
Theodore Stanton	PERSON	and Mrs.
Stanton Blatch	PERSON	.

		The editors would be glad to receive copies or the originals of any of Mrs.
Stanton	PERSON	's letters , which could be addressed to Mr.
Theodore Stanton	PERSON	,
Rue Raynouard	ORGANIZATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Among the materials to be used as explanatory of Mrs.
Stanton	PERSON	's letters will be extracts from inedited letters of many of the leaders of the old
Abolition Movement	ORGANIZATION	.

		4 Knight 's Dramatic Reader for Grammar Grades , '' by Miss
Marietta Knight	PERSON	, embodies a novel idea in school reading .

		The selections are all in dialogue form , sometimes taken directly from such works as ``
Julius Cesar	PERSON	, '' ''
Wilhelm Tell	PERSON	, '' and ``
Giles Corey	PERSON	of the Salem Farms , '' and sometimes adapted from such nar - rative sources as '' Alice in
Wonderland	LOCATION	, '' '' Tanglewood Tales , '' and ''
Kenilworth	LOCATION	. ''

		Every teacher knows that children like this sort of reading better than any other , and the book ought to be particularly welcome .

		It is sent us by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who also publish '' Nature Myths of Many Lands , '' by
Miss Florence V. Farmer	PERSON	, and ''
Stephen	PERSON	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, '' a story of the old days in
Penn	LOCATION	's
Colony	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	.

		The importance of publicity for public institutions , and more particularly for public libraries , is briefly treated by Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	, librarian of the
Newark	LOCATION	-LRB- N. J. -RRB- Public Library , in Part IV .

		of his `` Modern American Library Economy '' -LRB-
Elui Tree Press	ORGANIZATION	,
Newark	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		As in the other issues of this series , it is the the
Newark	LOCATION	library 's methods and their results that are presented .

		Many modes of attracting public attention to its varied educational activities have been tried by this progressive institution , and what Mr.
Dana	PERSON	has to say of their comparative effectiveness is of interest and value to other library workers . ''

		Try all things ; keep everlastingly at it ; and especial !

		y keep everlastingly at it in the newspapers , '' are his closing words .

		It is announced that the
Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	has taken over the control and copyright of the eleventh edition of '' The Encyclopedia Britannica , '' which is to appear about the end of the year .

		The Syndics of the Press have thought it wise to explain in a pamphlet the circumstances that have led to this novel departure .

		` Do - main point is this : that the association of the
University	ORGANIZATION	with the publication amounts to a guarantee that it is a trustworthy guide to sound learning , being not only up-to-date , but also the work of experts who are en - titled to speak on their several subjects .

		The new vol - umes represent the elaborate organization and arduous labour of eight years , and the editor , while retaining certain articles of permanent value , has been constantly employed in securing authoritative contributions from new hands in many countries .

		The whole edition will be issued as a complete work .

		A current Index has been in use throughout , and special pains have been taken to avoid mere verbosity , duplications , and incon - sistencies .

		So , though the
Eleventh Edition	ORGANIZATION	occupies but little more space than the Ninth twenty-eight volumes , including one devoted to the Index , as against twenty-five it is believed that it will contain twice as much independent information .

		In the practical ques - tion of form there will be a great advance .

		The use of
India	LOCATION	paper will reduce the size and weight of the vol - umes to less than one-third of the average of ordinary paper , and this edition will be provided with limp bind - ings , so that the difficulties experienced in handling the old cumbrous volumes will entirely disappear .

		Four interesting anthologies soon to be issued by the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	are '' The Oxford Book of Ballads , '' chosen and edited by Sir
Arthur Quiller	PERSON	- Couch ; '' The Oxford Book of Italian Verse , '' chosen by St.
John Lucas	PERSON	; '' The Englishman in
Greece	LOCATION	, '' with an introduction by Sir
J. Reunell Rodd	PERSON	; and A Book of Light Verse , '' edited by Mr.
R. M. Leonard	PERSON	.

Swinburne	PERSON	, intro - ductory studies by Professor
Dowden	PERSON	, and a note by Mr.

1820	DATE	;

		THE DIAL 255 The Finest Edition of Shakespeare at Less than
Half Price STRATFORD TOWN SHAKESPEARE	ORGANIZATION	, ranking with the finest of editions de luxe , was printed at the
Shakespeare Head Press	ORGANIZATION	at
Stratford	LOCATION	, which was especially established , under the direction of Mr.
A. H. Bullen	PERSON	, to do honor to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's memory by printing a worthy edition of his works in his native town .

		It is the only complete edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Works ever printed and published in his native town , and so will have for all time an interest and distinction placing it entirely apart from any other existing or future edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Format Editorial Features Press	ORGANIZATION	Opinions The set comprises ten royal octavo volumes .

		One thousand numbered sets , on English hand - made paper , have been printed , of which two hundred and fifty are for
America	LOCATION	.

		Each vol - ume contains a photogravure frontispiece , eight being portraits of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, one of
Richard Burbage	PERSON	, the chief actor of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's time , and one of the
Earl of Southampton	LOCATION	, Shake - speare 's patron , to whom his Sonnets are supposed to have been dedicated .

		The type is the original Old Face type cut by
William Caslon	PERSON	in the early part of the eighteenth century .

		For the text is used the size known as '' English , '' the songs , etc. , being printed in small pica .

		The lines are numbered at the side .

		An English hand-made paper , with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's crest and coat-of-arms for a water-mark , has been specially manufactured for this edition .

		The edition has been carefully produced under the supervision of Mr.
A. H. Bullen	PERSON	, whose scholarly researches in the field of Elizabethan Literature have peculiarly qualified him for the task .

		A unique feature is the elimination of the great mass of notes which usually clog the pages of our great classic and impede the reader .

		Instead , the last volume contains new and original essays which supply in a comprehensive and readable form all the information that the student or private reader requires for the proper appreciation of the great dramatist .

		These essays are as follows : A Memoir of

		It is the busy person 's paper , the paper for those who though busy want to know what is going on in the world .

		It keeps its readers well informed on what men and women are Saying , Doing , and Think - ing the world over about things that matter .

		It puts on record in a lucid way , in good print , and in the most convenient shape possible in a newspaper , the ideas which make for Social , Religious , and In - tellectual progress .

		Each week it gives lengthy and informing sum - maries of two of the most important new books , and so in the course of a year the reader is put in possession by direct quotation of the main features of over one hundred books .

		PUBLIC OPINION , therefore , saves time , labor , and money , for in all these ways it acts as -LRB- 1 -RRB- A NEWSPAPER ROOM .

Oct. 16	DATE	NOW READY SIGURD A Poem By
ARTHUR PETERSON	PERSON	HpHE story of
Sigurd	PERSON	, or Siegfried -LRB- of which the best-known * versions are probably the old Nibelungenlied , and
Wagner	PERSON	's famous tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen -RRB- , is one of the most celebrated of the world 's epics .

		In the following version
Sigurd	PERSON	is depicted as a young Norse rover , a wanderer not only by land but by sea , this latter innovation seeming to lend itself quite naturally to the established legend .

		The action takes place about the middle of the fifth century , that eventful period which may be said to mark the end of the ancient , and the beginning of the modern world .

		The Hon.
RASMUS B. ANDERSON	PERSON	, formerly Professor of Scandinavian languages in the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	and Ex .

		U. S. Minister to

Brynhild	PERSON	are our ancestral hero and heroine , and every American lad and lass should know the story by heart .

		294 DOING SOMETHING FOE THE DRAMA .

		That the drama -LRB- in this country -RRB- needs to have something done for it is an opinion wide - spread among thinking people .

		That its pres - ent state is parlous is a fact too obvious to need any detailed demonstration .

		Its diseased condition is marked -LRB- among other things -RRB- by anaemia , high temperature , congestion , impeded circulation -LRB- of ideas -RRB- , flatulency , and dyspepsia , to say nothing of malignant growths in the vital parts .

		This congeries of ailments may make the physician smile , but the elasticity of meta - phor suffices to justify every one of the elements of this complicated diagnosis .

		One might even particularize by saying that the sex drama is neurotic , the sociological drama atrabilious , and comedy -LRB- especially musical comedy -RRB- afflicted with locomotor ataxia .

		The remedies suggested are as various as the diseases , but the public lacks either the courage to apply them , or the means to make them effective .

		We seem to need both a self-denying ordinance and a practicable plan for constructive work ; thus far neither need is fairly on the way toward being satisfied .

		The craving which makes men yield to their desire for unwholesome food and deleterious drink is much like the craving which makes them the supporters of imbecile or mischievous stage-productions .

		They know that these things are harmful in the end , but they know also that they are just what will satisfy the immediate appetite .

		It takes a pretty serious danger signal to make the glutton or the drunkard pull up , and it takes an uncommon degree of resolution to impel the debauched theatre-goer to mend his ways .

		In both cases also there is , besides the element of personal responsibility , an element of social responsibility that has even less chance of being properly heeded .

		The appetite grows by what it feeds on , no less in the moral than in the gross material sense .

		The allurement of cakes and ale is not noticeably lessened by the presence of the virtuous ab - stainer , and his attitude seems more of a matter for jest than for profitable example .

		If the self-denying ordinance is too drastic a way of reforming our weak human nature -LRB- dramatically speaking -RRB- , there is at least a con - siderable measure of hope in the constructive 270 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, plan .

		There is surely a fringe of play-goers who might be lured from the altars of their false gods if temples of a purer worship were provided for them .

		All play-goers are not wedded unto their present idols , and many of them are restive under their bondage .

		It is the salvation of this fringe that should be the immediate object of workers in the interests of a better drama , and it constitutes a more numer - ous body than most people suspect .

		When it has become detached from the following of the vulgar commercialized theatre , there will be another fringe just inside it made ready for further missionary enterprise , and thus the good work may go on indefinitely .

		Festina lente must be the motto of all such efforts for dramatic regeneration , and it is not reasonable to expect that the syndicate will find its occupa - tion gone for a long time to come , but it is already attentive to certain ominous notes of warning that have been heard of late .

		The constructive problem -LRB- which is essentially a problem of education -RRB- may be attacked in two ways .

		The first of these , and the most obvious , is that of providing good theatres , animated by a higher purpose than that of money-getting , and letting the leaven of their influence work silently upon the public .

		If public support of the stage is a policy too alien to the spirit of our institutions to be hoped for , there is still the possibility of private support , in the form of guaranty or endowment , which may easily match the achievements of the European subsidized playhouse .

		We have urged this sort of enter - prise in and out of season , and our faith in its potentiality for good has within a year received notable confirmation in the deserved success of the New Theatre .

		We have also applauded the worthy aims which have characterized !

		Mr.
Donald Robertson	PERSON	in his interesting experiments of the last three years .

		Moreover , there is a sign of promise wherever a good stock company is brought together , or wherever an individual manager sets resolutely to work in raising the standard of taste in his community .

		Mr.
J. K. Williams	PERSON	, of S treat or ,
Illinois	LOCATION	, is such a manager , and bears witness to his faith in these striking terms : I give it as the testimony of twenty-five yean of theatre management that nothing permanently pays except the building up of a sound and healthy taste in the patrons of a theatre .

		The flashy and trashy ' shows ' that merely entertain leave no after draft ; they only exhaust and dissipate , create satiety and surfeit , and a craving for more and more spice , sensation , and vacu - ous excitement .

		The drama of merit alone creates a desire for more and better drama , and out of my twenty - five years of experience with one constituency I bring you the conviction that nothing but the best will last .

		\ V I ifii I began my management twenty-five yean ago , to amioiuu-c : ui artistic performniift * in my town w : i - likt > putting up a sign for people to keep away .

		Now my chief perplexity is that I can not get performances that are good enough for those who have been with me through these years . ''

		So much for the method of creating a place of repair , and attracting the public to it by degrees .

		The other constructive method is that of building up the right kind of audience for serious dramatic performances , thus creating a demand so pronounced that the managers most hardened in the old commercial ways will re - spond to it .

		Work in this direction is being silently fostered all over the country by lecture - courses and study-classes and university instruc - tion .

		It is being helped on by every dramatic reviewer who has a free hand and puts conscience into his writing .

		It is encouraged by every pub - lisher who ventures to print plays in the form of books .

		It is the avowed aim of the
Drama League of America	ORGANIZATION	, organized this year for the express purpose of organizing the theatre-going public in the interest of plays that are worth while .

		There is much evidence that the public is ready to be thus organized , and upon this point we may quote from an article in the
London	LOCATION	'' Nation '' written in advocacy of an Ibsen season . ''

		Nothing really stands in the way save the contem - porary passion for pageantry .

		Ibsen 's middle-class in - teriors , his rigid adherence to the unities , his refusal to court variety by so much as a needless change of scene from one room to another , his choice of characters whom it would be a desecration to set forth with showy clothes or dashing manners these are probably still the chief drawbacks to his popularity .

		But we are nearing a phase of civilisation in which there is a public for the actor and actress who represent .

		A debased stage asks only for violent passions exhibited with a certain virtuosity .

		An actress must be able to play an hysterical movement as a violinist must play his cadenza .

		Or , if it esca -RSB- > es that worse phase of vulgarity , its aim is to display a charm - ing woman or a gallant man . ''

		The League of which mention has just been made came into existence as a woman 's club movement , and was launched
last April	DATE	at a meeting of delegates from no less than sixty - three such clubs in and about
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Its declared aims are '' to co-ordinate the work of all associations and individuals already inter - ested in educating the public to appreciate and demand the best drama , '' and to awaken the public to the importance of the theatre as a social force and to its great educative value , if maintained on the high level of art and morals . ''

		Its most important work is to be done by the simple process of singling out the most praise - worthy plays visible at a given time , and urging
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE 271 its members to see them .

		The recommendations take the form of bulletins sent to its members as promptly as possible after a first performance , which means , for example , that in the present month , something like ten thousand members of women 's clubs in this city and its suburbs are being directly urged to see Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	in '' Becky Sharp '' and '' The Pillars of Society '' and ''
Hannele	PERSON	. ''

		Since the predisposition to take such advice already exists , it ought to be fairly evident to the most obtuse of managers that here is a force to be reckoned with , and that support of this kind is worth making some effort to gain .

		Such a plan of organizing , by no means the whole public , but a considerable section of it , in the interest of a high theatrical ideal , cer - tainly seems feasible , and we can see how there may be created by its agency '' a body which shall faithfully support all plays receiving the
League	ORGANIZATION	's , stamp of approval a body which shall consider itself pledged to ignore all plays deliberately catering to indecencies or that are of no literary or structural value . ''

		There are doubtless pitfalls in the path of such a move - ment , and the chief of these dangers is that the standards adopted may become too feminized or too finical .

		There must be a good deal of tolerance , of a kind , in such a propoganda not the tolerance which makes concessions to showiness or vulgarity , but that which does not balk at virility or the freest forms of portrayal of life , provided only they be sincere .

		The pres - sure of public taste has shaped the American novel into a shape so flabby , and given it a con - tent so devoid of vitality , that it offers a hor - rible example of what fiction ought not to be .

		The pressure to be applied to the American play must be of a very different nature , if our last case is to be any better than our first .

		The aim must be nothing less than truth , coupled with entire freedom of expression ; otherwise the effort will be futile , and the outcome not worth striving for .

		We must , for a long time to come , go to the schools of the Continent for our instruction , slowly and painfully learning from them the lesson that life itself , and not the trappings of life , is what the stage should exhibit .

FRIDTJOF NANSEN	PERSON	has completed a large work on the exploration of the Northern and Arctic regions from the earliest times .

		CHATEAUBRIAND IN
ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		I .

		A good while ago , one of the many writers about Chateaubriand ,
M. Victor Giraud	PERSON	, observed that there remained an interesting chapter in literary history to be written on the English origins of Chateaubriand 's thought . ''

		Let us not forget , '' he said , `` that it was in
England	LOCATION	that Chateaubriand remained for seven years ; there that his religious crisis occured . ''

		At one time it seemed probable that the great romanticist would have an English biographer in the Rev.
John Mitford	PERSON	, who would certainly not have failed to trace the English influ - ence upon him ; but that book seems never to have been written .

		Nor need we any longer greatly deplore the circumstance ; for a French writer well known to American readers ,
M. Anatole Le Braz	PERSON	, has , in a charming style that is neither trivial nor too erudite , inscribed this '' interesting chapter . ''

		* M. Le Braz justly complains that most of the critics and biographers who have occupied themselves with his hero have not kept the fact well before them that from
1793	DATE	to
1800	DATE	, at the very turning-point of his career , Chateaubriand lived either in
London	LOCATION	or in the environs of
London	LOCATION	, without revisiting
France	LOCATION	.

		In determining the dates of that long sojourn , little heed is to be paid to
Chateaubriand	LOCATION	's own statements : as Professor
Dick	PERSON	has it , the author of u Memoires d'Outre-tombe '' savait apprecier le vague des dates non moins que le vague des passions .

		^ It is very certain that , if '' the American forest may be said to dominate the writer 's works , `` $ the years passed in
England	LOCATION	were fully as rich in meaning as the months spent on our own side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		It was , indeed , in the library of the Rev.
John Ives	PERSON	, at
Bungay	LOCATION	, in
Suffolk	LOCATION	, that Chateaubriand received many of those impressions which he `` worked up '' later , in the sonorous prose of the ''
Natchez	LOCATION	, '' the '' M e ` moires , '' and the '' Voyage en Ame ` rique . ''

		For the Rev.
Ives	PERSON	was not merely a Hellenist and a mathematician , an excellent father and a genial host , a man of the cloth and a famous bottle com - panion , he was also a former missionary to the Americans .

		Like Rene '' , the good clergyman had feasted his eyes upon the grandest spectacles of the New World .

		`` He had penetrated the savanas ; he had descended the rivers in his canoe ; he had lived in wigwams and had smoked the calumet ; he had practised at length the wild life of which the author of the '
Natchez	LOCATION	, ' -LRB- partially blocked out at this epoch -RRB- , proposed to write the ' epic . '

		His was , in fine , the prowess that the cadet of
Brittany	PERSON	had realised only in his dreams . ''

		As
John Ives	PERSON	's guest , then , did Chateaubriand first make a close study of the narratives of Carver * `` Au Pays d'Exil de Chateaubriand , '' par Anatole Le Braz .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, and
Bartram	PERSON	; perhaps , too , of
Raynal	PERSON	and
Charle	PERSON	- voix and the rest And yet it is surely too much to say , as does the latest writer on Chateaubriand , Mr.
Francis Gribble	PERSON	, that everything in the French romanticist 's writings about
America	LOCATION	belongs to
Bartram	PERSON	, '' nothing to Chateaubriand nothing , that is , except the flowing periods . ''

		* What should at least be evident to the most casual follower of Chateaubriand 's career is that the chapters '' Amer - ica '' and `` England '' are associated in more than temporal sequence .

		II .

		Chateaubriand 's return from the Western World is an old story .

		In a cabin somewhere in the
Blue Mountains	LOCATION	, an English newspaper fell into his hands .

		Its edges were frayed , but its contents were far from stale reading for the wanderer .

		By the candle of a
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	mountaineer , the traveller read of the French King 's flight , and of his arrest at
Varennes	LOCATION	.

		In spite of all his vagaries and contradictions , Chateaubriand was ever loyal to his order , to his
King	PERSON	, and to
France	LOCATION	: it was in the nature of things that he should return to
Europe	LOCATION	, to serve in the ranks of the emigres .

		He suffered as well as served , as it fell out .

		It was his fate to be left for dead on the battlefield , and to pass through many another adventure before , ragged and broken in health , he made his way to
England	LOCATION	, the haven of the ci-devants .

		Meantime , Ren had made a marriage of convenience ; his bride was one Mile ,
de Lavigne	PERSON	, an heiress .

		f Let us try to remember the existence of Mme. de Chateaubriand a grain more faithfully than did her unfortunate husband .

		Unfortunate he surely was , one may glance , in passing , at the picture which he has left of the life he led in his lodgings in Holborn : '' I was devoured with hunger ; I burned with fever ; sleep had deserted me ; I sucked pieces of linen which I had soaked in water ; I chewed grass and paper .

		When I passed the bakers ' shops , the torment I endured was hor - rible ... I could have eaten not only the provisions , but the boxes and baskets in which they were packed . ''

		Even so , Chateaubriand 's plight was no worse than many a compatriot 's .

		There is no reason for doubting his tale that he landed at
Southampton	LOCATION	with only thirty louis in his pocket .

		Had Chateau - * '' Chateaubriand and his Court of Women . ''

		By
Francis Gribble	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , 190 ! -RRB-

		.

		In the earlier chapters of this interesting book Mr.
Qribble	PERSON	is in too great haste to get Chateaubriand out of
America	LOCATION	, out < > f
England	LOCATION	, that he may ensconce him in his `` Court of Women .

		1 ' Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	coolly denies -LRB- pp. 35-37 -RRB- that Chateaubriand ever called upon
George Washington	PERSON	, at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, though telling evidence of that visit has been found at the
Congressional Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	, and twice laid before the reading public -LRB- '' Publications of the
Modern Language Association	ORGANIZATION	, 11
June , 1907	DATE	-RRB- .

		t There has very recently appeared -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Emile-Panl -RRB- volume , '' Les Cahiers de Madame de Chateaubriand Pub - lic 's Inte * gralement avec Introduction et Notes , par J. Ladreit de Lacharriere . ''

		It is almost twenty years since M. I ` uilhes discovered these memoirs , which remained in the hands of Chateaubriand 's descendants ; but even M. Pailhes never published them in their entirety .

		That act was left to
M. de Lacharriere	ORGANIZATION	.

		The `` Cahiers '' make a readable supple - ment to the '' Me ` moires d'Outre-tombe . ''

		briand been '' romanticising '' this part of his own life , he would have made the amount smaller by at least one-half .

		And yet , on occasion , the writer did unmistakably '' touch up '' the record of his English exile .

		Story-tellers by profession seem almost always to forget that the plain truth is as romantic as their fairest and remotest fancies .

		But Chateaubriand had always too high a regard for appearances ; and , besides , he had more preoccupations than that of the writer who seeks only to interest his public .

		Most of all he sought to prove Ren unique , as different from other men as
Rousseau	PERSON	himself , and no less different from
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		England teemed , in post-revolutionary times , with French gentlemen reduced to giving language les - sons ; most of them , according to Chateaubriand himself , were thoroughly incompetent .

		And did he not write in the ''
Essai	PERSON	sur les Revolutions , '' in the chapter , '' Aux InfortuneV ' that he who is of high rank -LRB- d'un ordre superieur -RRB- must regard as the greatest of all possible misfortunes to be obliged to renounce the free exercise of his faculties -LRB- de renoncer aux facultes de son dme -RRB- and to .

		pass his days in teaching his neighbor 's stupid children their a , b , c 's -LRB- a faire des mots aux stupides enfants de son voisin -RRB- ?

		`` Such a man would sooner die of hunger than procure , at such a price , the necessaries of life . ''

		Holding these views , it is small wonder that li.Tir concealed the true nature of his occupa - tion during the years of his obscurity .

		Let us not , however , dwell upon the bad taste of that concealment It must have seenu-d to him a too banal matter , his going down from
London	LOCATION	to take a place in Mr.
Brightley	PERSON	's private school at
Becles	LOCATION	, in sleepy old Suffolk : a county that was to remind him almost startlingly of his own
Brittany	PERSON	.

		He spins , then , a yarn about a society of Suffolk gentlemen , headed by the Rev. `` B. S. '' -LRB-
Bence Sparrow	PERSON	-RRB- , who were engaged in antiquarian re - search .

		These supposititious antiquarians engaged Chateaubriand to decipher the thirteenth-century manuscripts , composed in French , which formed one part of the collections .

		This , at least , is one of the romances to be found in the '' Me ` moires . ''

		The true story of Chateaubriand 's stay at Becles is set down in the new book by M. Le lira / .

		.

		and it is interesting enough to have engaged Chateaubriand himself .

		Here one may read -LRB- not for the first time -RRB- that Chateaubriand 's incorrigible pupils called him '' Monsieur Shatter brain . ''

		Other pupils were the ladies of the nearby country-seats , all of them incontinent to have their French pronunciation polished off by the well-born and handsome young man who called himself in
America	LOCATION	, `` M. de Combourg . ''

		The tale of his little flirtations at Becles is inno - cent enough .

		Ren was , however , more than a pro- fessor of French conversation and French literature .

		He posed , too , as an amateur disciple of Lavater .

		The ladies at
Bence Sparrow	ORGANIZATION	's rectory gave him unsigned specimens of their handwriting , and he amused them with the characters he deduced .

		He
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 273 numbered the sheets of paper on which the samples of handwriting were offered him ; he then drew pleasing portraits of the various numbers .

		Num - ber two was , he said , '' a very pretty young woman .

		Something of the levity and the elegance of the Nymph .

		Witty ; a lover of pleasure , a sa mode ; sometimes capricious ; a little peevish , even .

		Capable of hate and of love .

		Generous and good .

		No great talker . ''

		What woman would not be delighted to be found by so charming a French teacher and graphologue , capable de haine et d'amour , witty , withal , and combining the levity and the elegance of the Nymph ?

		III .

		Chateaubriand 's traffic with the fair women of
Suffolk	LOCATION	was not confined to readings of their chiro - graphy .

		-LRB- His stay there had , too , its interludes of botanising , for , like
Rousseau	PERSON	andBernardin before him , he occupied himself with herborizing : `` armed with his scissors , style , and glass . '' -RRB-

		For , after
Becles	PERSON	, came Bungay : '' twin-village '' to
Becles	LOCATION	; and at
Bungay	LOCATION	was enacted the comedy which is at once the most absorbing and the most serious of all the English comedies in which Chateaubriand was a principal .

		It was at
Bungay	LOCATION	that
John Ives	PERSON	dwelled , the clergyman already spoken of : he whose earlier parish had lain over-seas , the father of the
Charlotte	LOCATION	whom Chateaubriand immortalized by loving ; and
Charlotte	LOCATION	was , beyond a doubt , the ''
Clarisse	PERSON	'' of one of Chateaubriand 's rare poems : '' Oui , je me plais ,
Clarisse	PERSON	& la saison tardive , Image de cet age ou le temps m ' a conduit ; Du vent k tes foyers j' aime ta voix plaintive
Durant	PERSON	la longue nuit ... '' Chateaubriand was twenty-seven when he wrote his verses .

		Clarisse -LRB-
Charlotte Ives	LOCATION	, that is -RRB- was but fifteen , ''
Juliet	PERSON	's age , '' M. Le Braz reminds us .

		To the Juliet of the clergyman 's daughter , Chateaubriand played Romeo .

		Those who know the portraits of the Frenchman need not be told how well he looked the part .

		And doubtless he acted it as well as if there were no Madame Romeo pining for him somewhere in
Brittany	LOCATION	.

		IV .

		At
Bungay	LOCATION	, as at
Becles	LOCATION	, Chateaubriand sup - ported himself by teaching his language to the Islanders .

		It was , doubtless , this occupation of his that brought him into intimate relations with the Vicar 's daughter ; though long before the climac - teric winter of 1795-1796 he was , if one may believe his own story , hospitably received in the Vicar 's home .

		`` The young lady questioned me about
France	LOCATION	, about literature ; and she asked me to indi - cate a course of reading for her .

		She wished partic - ularly to know the Italian authors , and begged me to give her some notes on the ' Divine Comedy ' and the '
Jerusalem	LOCATION	. ' ''

		So the '' Mdmoires . ''

		We have seen that at
BeclesRectory Chateaubriand	ORGANIZATION	came to give lessons in French conversation and remained to demonstrate his proficiency in chiro - graphy .

		At the
Vicarage	LOCATION	, he went a stage further .

		Everything conspired to establish the young man on terms of peculiar intimacy with this household .

		There was a triple bond between the young stranger and the bibulous parson : literature , port wine , and
America	LOCATION	.

		And the Vicar 's family was in the goodness of its heart disposed to shelter and repose the stranger fallen on his seven lean years .

		Seated at the Vicar 's table , where there was always plenty , and never a touch of ostentation , the exile found himself at home as nowhere else .

		Ensconced in the snug ingle - nook , he felt that true contentment which belongs to us only when we are sure of our welcome .

		He felt himself no longer '' an object of curiosity . ''

		At his ease there , he was in a mood to be delighted by every action , every trait , every expression , of his generous hosts . ''

		If I could have been told that I was to spend all the rest of my days buried in the bosom of this retiring family , I should have died of pleasure , '' he confessed in his '' Mdmoires , '' many years after .

		The Vicar 's daughter joined to the charm of youth the quality of intelligence . ''

		Like the
Francesca	PERSON	and the Paolo of the ` Divine Comedy ' that they pored over , it was in bending their heads over the same book that they took pos - session of one another 's heart . ''

		Sinful , all this , on the part of the Paolo the Romeo the
Rene	PERSON	' who had a wife in
France	LOCATION	-LRB- albeit a wife only in name -RRB- .

		Still , it is worth while to remember that Chateaubriand regarded himself at this period as a doomed man .

		Had not Dr.
Goodwyn	PERSON	, author of the ''
Dissertatio Medica	ORGANIZATION	de morte Submersorum , '' in some sort abridged his responsibilities , in warning him that his life was to be a short one ?

		But , what is most significant of all , Rend was Rend !

		For these were the days when Chateaubriand was working at his American novels , and elaborating the histories of Rend and
Cdluta	ORGANIZATION	.

		Perhaps he was hardly deceived in feeling that a curse lay upon him and on all he loved . ''

		To love and to suffer was the double fatality that he imposed upon whomsoever approached his person .

		Cast into the world like a great misfortune , his pernicious influ - ence was communicated to those about him .

		It is thus that there are trees , beautiful to the eye , to breathe whose air or to enjoy whose shade is death . ''

		* Chateaubriand was fully persuaded of this fatality ; fully convinced that he exerted his baneful influ - ence , willy-nilly .

		II y avoit dans Rene quelque chose de dominateur , qui s 'em paroit fortement de I ` dme .

		It would seem that the obsession of self was so strong with Rend that he believed it to extend to all those in his circle : nor was he altogether wrong .

		And , just as his readings in the library of the re - turned missionary may well have spurred him on to the production of his pseudo-scientific chapters , and furnished him with much of the material for his narratives of American travels , real and imagined , so would his relations with
Charlotte	LOCATION	seem to have suggested more than one passage of those same travels and of his American novels . ''

		In my opin - ion , '' Professor
Dick	PERSON	has written , '' a great part of the idyll of Bungay passed over into the novel of * `` Les
Natchez	LOCATION	, '' e `` d. Pourrat -LRB- 1836 -RRB- , 1 .

Lucile	LOCATION	, and confusing itself with her to form the strange personage of Amelie .

		Ame ` lie , in so far as she is Rent 's sister , is
Lucile	LOCATION	; in so far as she is his sweetheart , she is
Charlotte	LOCATION	. ''

		And at the conclusion of his hook on Chateaubriand in
England	LOCATION	, M. Le Braz expresses , quite without presumption , his hope '' to have established that AtaU u
Charlotte	LOCATION	, and that ' Lei Amours de deux Sanvages dans le Desert , ' if they had , per - haps , the original object of ' painting ' the fraternal ardours of Lncile and of Francois-Ren ^ in the desert of Combourg , did not find their essential theme , and were not fixed in their definitive form till Love , Love without epithet , Lore in the singular , had enriched the heart and the genius of Chactas , returned from

		M. Le
Braz	PERSON	is , like Chateaubriand , a Breton like him , a poet .

		V .

		In following the fortunes of
Charlotte Ives	LOCATION	as a literary inspiration , we must not altogether forget the unlucky
Charlotte	LOCATION	of real experience .

		Chateau - briand never lost the memory of
Charlotte	LOCATION	's large dark eyes .

		Memory , indeed , was all that was left to him after the denouement of the little tragi - comedy .

		A fall from a horse from his favorite white pony , it may well be laid him up toward the end of the winter of 1795-1796 .

		An accident to your hero , a not too serious accident , is ever a finish - ing touch to your romantic pieces .

		U ne faut jurer de rlen ... And the young French teacher , suf - fering from his unhorsing , was cared for at the Vicarage .

		By turns they nursed him , the worthy port-soaked clergyman , the gentle mother , and brown-eyed
Charlotte	LOCATION	, '' who was an excellent music - ian . ''

		The clergyman told all over again the tale of his American adventures .

		Mrs.
Ives	PERSON	took the place of the aged woman who was so soon , in dying , to lead back into the fold this erring sheep -LRB- J'ni pleure , etj ` ai cru -RRB- .

		Charlotte
Ives	PERSON	read to him sang to him listened to phrase-making out of the ''
Natchez	LOCATION	. ''

		It was as pretty a diversion on a penny whistle as anything in ''
Richard Feverel	PERSON	'' while it lasted .

		Without being wealthy , the Vicar of St. Mar - garet 's was removed from want .

		Like his wife , too , he seems to have been unworldly in his plans for his daughter .

		Her happiness came first : that much is certain .

		Nor did this couple forget -LRB- nor their daughter , either -RRB- that the young Frenchman whom they befriended was , while a pedagogue by trade , a peer of
France	LOCATION	by birth .

		In fine , they were resolved to make it a happy family an eighteenth - century entente cordiale .

		Chateaubriand was on the point of going to
London	LOCATION	to read the proof of his first book .

		Let us turn to the '' Mlmoires '' : '' ` Sir . '

		she -LSB- Mrs. Ires -RSB- said in English , youbehold my confusion : I do not know if
Charlotte	LOCATION	pleases you , but ... my daughter has certainly conceived an attachment fur yon .

		Mr.
Ives	PERSON	and I have consulted together : yon suit us in every respect .

		We believe yon will make onr daughter happy .

		Von no longer possess a country ... what is there to take you back to
France	LOCATION	?

		Until you inherit what we have , yon will live with us . ' ''

		Of all the sorrows that I had undergone , this was the sorest and the greatest .

		I threw myself at Mrs.
Ives	PERSON	's feet ; I covered her hands with my kisses and my tears .

		> h > - thought that I was weeping for joy , and ... stretched her arm out to pull the bell-rope ; she called her husband and daughter . '

		Stop ! '

		I cried . '

		I am a married man ! ' ''

		Thackeray wrote , it will be remembered , '' Now
Charlotte	LOCATION	was a married lady , And a moral man was Werther . ''

		In Chateaubriand 's romantic case , the situation was reversed .

		VI .

		A sordid ending for the tragi-comedy , an ending not without grim humor .

		But let us proceed to the anti-climax .

		Life is seldom without a variety of these .

		Let us , then , look in upon the wedding of
Charlotte Ives	LOCATION	, on the seventh of
April , 1806	DATE	, to
Samuel Sutton	PERSON	, later Rear-Admiral .

		No , on second thought we will do well to absent ourselves .

		We will not attend , either , the subsequent meetings of Mrs.
Sutton	PERSON	a widow with three sons and her first lover : school-teacher no longer , but now Ambassador of
France	LOCATION	.

		The romance is deflowered ; if it be true that
George Crabbe	PERSON	, the
Suffolk	LOCATION	poet , had it in mind when he composed his poem of '' The Deserted Wife , '' that need not surprise us , what subject would n't
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	have used , had the fancy possessed him ?

		* But one does not care to linger over this subject .

		Who would contribute to those inky streams of sentimentality and pruriency poured out by latter-day writers about Chateau - briand ?

		I have exceeded the limits of a review , yet started only to review the book with mention of which this paper was begun .

		For it is pleasant to see it de - monstrated as demonstrated it is on every page of M. Le

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A SIMPLE TEST OF WIT AND HUMOR has been dis - covered by the
Simplified Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the current issue of the '' Simplified Spelling Bulletin '' occurs an editorial entitled '' Their Penury of Wit , '' which gives one to understand that advocacy of simplified spelling argues a capacity for wit and humor in the advocate , whereas opposition is indi - cative of a lack thereof in the opponent ; for '' humor implies a tolerance of mind , a sense of human limi - tations , an absence of conceit , a kindly , genial atmosfere , in which understanding and good nature unite to keep the mind level and democratic , but undeluded . ''

		Therefore , `` persons who commit themselvs to the wholly unintellectual idea that a common human invention and custom like English spelling , can not be , and ought not to be , improved in any way , are by the very conditions of their ex - istence deprived of wit and humor . ''

		Fortunately the same editorial page contains by chance an ex - ample of wit , or at least of sarcasm , as conceived by the genially tolerant simplified speller .

		Referring to the
summer	DATE	session of the
Iowa State Teachers College	ORGANIZATION	, the good-natured , level-minded , and demo - cratic writer says : '' In the Bulletin giving the courses for the Summer Term of
1910	DATE	twelv pro- fessors are enterd each as ' hed of the department ' in which he works , and one lady is described as ' hed critic ' in the department of training and teaching .

		Can such things be , and overcome us in the Summer Term , without our special wonder ?

		Can it be that these teachers use their heds learn with their heds , criticize with their heds ?

		What will become of a college where the teachers use their heds even in spelling ? ''

		We ourselves are `` over - come , '' and shall henceforth rarely attempt to be facetious at the expense of simplified spelling .

		THE NEW OXFORD MOVEMENT , as it may prove worthy of being called , under its present masterful Chancellor .

		Lord
Curzon	PERSON	of
Kedleston	LOCATION	, promises to put fresh life into that ancient seat of learning , to do away with some of the time-honored absurdities in its administration , and to bring it more closely in touch with the outside world .

		The Chancellor 's `` Principles and
Methods of University Reform	ORGANIZATION	, '' issued seven or eight months ago , has been followed , after thorough study of the subject on the part of the
Hebdomadal Council	ORGANIZATION	, the supreme governing body of the
University	ORGANIZATION	, by a hundred-page volume of recommendations of its own .

		Between the two , the Chancellor and the
Council	ORGANIZATION	, many rumors have come into being concerning possible future technical and commercial courses to be offered at
Oxford	LOCATION	, and concerning the more than possible dropping of Greek as a compulsory study .

		But we still hope that the remorseless march of `` progress , '' industrial and practical , impatient of tradition and abhorrent of sentiment , will spare for a few generations longer the venerable honors course in litterae humaniores that is thought to-day to have equipped for their present high and influential positions many men prominent in both houses of
Parliament	LOCATION	, in the civil service at home and abroad , and in journalism , to say nothing of those more strictly devoted to learning and literature .


London	LOCATION	and
Leeds	LOCATION	and
Birmingham	LOCATION	have schools and colleges for scientific and technical and commercial studies ; let
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	preserve as long as possible the atmosphere and the traditions that are of so much more value to the world than any '' get-there-quick '' curriculum of bread-winning electives .

		A QUESTION OF BRISKNESS IN BOOK CIRCULATION is involved in the
Grand Rapids Public Library	ORGANIZATION	's report of book renewals for the past year .

		Only a little more than three and
one-half per cent	MONEY	of the books issued for home use were renewed at the end of two weeks for a like period ; and yet the librarian adds : '' It is the unanimous opinion of the heads of the departments that it would be advisable to abolish the renewing of books , and to issue all books , except 7-day books , for a straight period of four weeks , without renewal . ''

		Would not this considerably increase the number of unsuccessful applications for desired works ?

		The bulk of the books that circulate at all are drawn , at one time or another , by the '' general reader , '' as we like to call him ; and to lengthen the retention period would be to curtail the general usefulness of the books .

		Moreover , would it not also prove , in some degree , a discourager of diligence and an encourager of waste of time ?

		With a month before one in which to read a book , the chances are more than a few that it will not be even opened until the
third week	DATE	, and perhaps not opened at all .

		Long ago the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	abol - ished renewals altogether , making two weeks the inexorable limit , with results apparently not un - satisfactory .

		... THE JAPANESE CONCEPTION OF POETRY , as expressed by
Baron Takasaki	PERSON	, who for twenty-five years has held the high position of chief of the poetry office , or , as we should say , poet laureate , merits attention .

		He says : ''
Uta	PERSON	, or poetry , is nothing but the human heart ; poetry is born with man , the Japanese uta with the Japanese and
Japan	LOCATION	.

		There is nothing more absurd than to try to learn how to write poetry ; we have only to make our own soul nobler and truer , and that is poetry .

		To give it a voice seems to me a secondary sort of thing ; if we have our own voice , we should sing , 27. ; THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, as simply and truly as the bird or the wind ... Poetry is not an art : I protest against its becoming artificial .

		Poetry is not to be made , but sung .

		Poetry is nothing but the true heart . ''

		The short poem of thirty-one syllables , so common in Japanese literature , has a simplicity and spontaneity in accord with this definition of poetry , and seems to be writ - ten , or uttered , by persons in all walks of life , as the natural and inevitable mode of expressing a striking or beautiful thought .

		The Mikado himself is said to be a skilled maker of these bits of verse , some thousands of which are now credited to him .

		But
Baron Takasaki	PERSON	's definition of poetry as '' noth - ing but the true heart '' is , with all its fine sugges - tiveness , rather too vague to be useful .

		TUB CLOSE OP A FORTY-YEARS LIBRARY RECORD came with the recent death of
James L. Whitney	PERSON	, who for almost forty-one years had been connected with the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and had held the office of librarian for four years , from
1899	DATE	to

		A college graduate -LRB-
Yale	ORGANIZATION	' 50 -RRB- and throughout his long life a close student and something of a writer and editor , he trained himself for librarianship , so far as he had any training , in the book business , being for years one of the proprietors of the Old Corner Bookstore in
Springfield	LOCATION	,

		Entering the service of the
Boston	LOCATION	library in

		His catalogue of the Ticknor lib - rary of Spanish works is widely known and is highly valued for its scholarly excellence .

May	DATE	tree in bloom , in a garden restaurant at
Weimar	LOCATION	.

		By the judicious bestowal of a thaler upon a waiter he had obtained the privilege of don - ning the servant 's white apron and ministering to the wants of those two famous men as they sat , in court dress , with wigs and swords , at a damask - covered table .

		To have seen
Shelley	PERSON	plain has , we know , been accounted a scarcely believable happi - ness .

		To have seen
Schiller	PERSON	and Goethe plain , and to be privileged to speak to them , if only as a waiter , and to have them speak to you again , or even do nothing more than graciously nod in reply and per - haps bestow a modest trinkgeld , must be almost the pinnacle of bliss .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		MACAULAY AND THE WRITING OF HISTORY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The communication in your issue of
October 1	DATE	, regarding the present-day writing of history , in which the writer holds a strong brief for Macaulay as against the modern historian , has much of truth in it so far as it goes .

		The charm and effectiveness of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's style are universally admitted .

		It is true that under the sway of
Darwin	PERSON	and his followers , there were some historical writers who once believed that history could be made a science .

		But there is a difference between history as a science and scientific methods in history .

		The intense specialization of research to-day has un - doubtedly resulted in the production of much dry read - ing material ; and the disposition of the universities to print every doctor 's dissertation is burdening library book shelves with many works which are of value chiefly as evidence of their authors ' elementary training in the science of historical research , rather than as original contributions to historical knowledge .

		The weak point in your correspondent 's communica - tion is not what he asserts , but what he omits .

		In the first place ,
Macaulay	PERSON	was a great literary artist , and an artist is the favored child of genius .

		There are few like unto him in many generations .

		Greece had but one Thucydides ,
Rome	LOCATION	but one
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	,
England	LOCATION	has had but one
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	.

		The criticisms of Mr.
Hutson	PERSON	lie at the threshold of the generation of the middle of the nineteenth century quite as much as at the feet of historical writers to-day .

		What of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's contem - poraries ?


Grote	PERSON	was a great and conscientious scholar , but his style is dull and pedestrian when compared with the vivid and vigorous style of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	.

		What of the overladen , turgid rhetoric of Sir
Francis Palgrave	PERSON	?

		And the labored rhetorical form of Merivale ?

		Is
Hallam	PERSON	brilliant or solid ?

		Again , the point of view of historical writing has changed since
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's time .

		The thoughts of men have widened with the process of the suns .

		With the exception of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's brilliant third chapter , upon the condition of
England	LOCATION	in
1685	DATE	, his history is purely political history .

		Now perhaps the most striking char - acteristic of historiography since
Macaulay	PERSON	died in
1859	DATE	is the fact that the bearing of economic and social phenomena upon history has been so largely recognized .

		The economic and social interpretation of history suc - ceeded the political interpretation of history during the
last half of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		The point of view , as well as the things seen from it , have changed , and it was inevitable that the change should revolutionize the method and form of historical composition .

		Since
Darwin	PERSON	, it has not been possible to write history as
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	and
Michelet	PERSON	wrote it .

		Despite Mr.
Hutson	PERSON	's strictures , the small obscure investigator of local history and of the fine points of history has his iises .

		Darwin 's famous work upon '' The Origin of Vegetable Mould '' proved the wonderful importance of earthworms iu the economy of nature .

		So , too , the patient historical investigator of small things has his part in the larger economy of historical writing .

		The day has gone by of purely political or dynastic or military history .

		The ideal history would be the history of all the activities of an entire nation or people within a given period or country .

		Economic and social history is the response to this demand , and the end is not yet .

		Signs are not wanting that we are upon the verge of a psychological interpretation of history .

		The present vogue of
Ferrero	PERSON	is largely due to this element in his Roman history .

		The late Professor
William James	PERSON	's '' Varieties of Relig - ious Experience '' has already exerted an influence upon French and German historical investigation .

		It is cer - tain that an immense field of research along psycho - logical lines is open before the student of history in the future .

		It is to the young historian that this work must fall .

		How far the trained historian of the present can go astray in historical interpretation is shown by the late Father Denifle 's failure to write the history of German mysticism in the sixteenth century .

		His '' Luther und Luthertum in der Ersten Entwicklung , '' though written by a highly-trained historian , has serious THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, shortcomings , not so much because the author was a Catholic but because of bis lack of psychological insight .

		In the sphere of mediteval history in particular , the psychological interpretation of history will
Hud	ORGANIZATION	a great field of activity .

		We yet know very imperfectly the history of
Europe	LOCATION	from the fifth to the eleventh cen - turies so far as the great mass of the people is concerned .

		The Laves of the
Saints	ORGANIZATION	must furnish us information as to how the mitiares and minocres of the barbaric codes and the millions in serfdom looked at life in these great centuries of transition .

		Mr.
Hutson	PERSON	seems to think that
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	has been cast down from his high eminence .

		I think it may be safely said that this is not so , and that he still retains the homage of the historical world .

		Freeman admired him greatly and endeavored to form his style after that of Macaulay , and Mr.
James Ford Rhodes	PERSON	, in his recent volume of Historical Essays , has most interestingly re - counted his attempts to form his style of composition particularly after that of
Macaulay	LOCATION	.

		It comes back to what was said in the beginning .

		Macaulay was bom with the gift of consummate literary expression , even as the poet is born with high qualities of imagination and an exquisite sense of rhythm .

		The breed of modern historical writers has not degenerated -LRB- to go no further than the English-speaking world -RRB- in the persons of Lecky and
Creighton	PERSON	and
Hodgkin	ORGANIZATION	and
Maitland	PERSON	and Parkinan and Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	.

		If we pass to
France	LOCATION	we are on even firmer footing .

		United with an inherited grace of style , modern French historio - graphy possesses a scientific thoroughness that is the peer of the scholarly world of to-day .

		There are pages of Renan that seem almost a miracle of literary expres - sion combined with patient scientific effort .

		Who that has read his marvellous character-sketch of the emperor
Hadrian	PERSON	can doubt this ?

		Only the most careful analy - sis reveals the thoroughness of the research , so exquisite is the literary style .

		The first paragraph establishes the historical and geographical milieu , the information in which is borrowed from the life of
Hadrian	LOCATION	, Chapter XIX , in the Historiae Augustae .

		Then follows the unfold - ing of the general idea which Renan wishes to develop , that of the reintegration of the Roman world under the Antonines .

		The facts he cites to prove it are all derived from documents or monuments , especially the latter the remains of
Hadrian	PERSON	's villa near
Tivoli	ORGANIZATION	, the inscriptions and other vestiges of Roman culture in
Africa	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Phoenicia	LOCATION	.

		The activity of Roman municipal life in the
second century A. D.	DATE	is proved from the vast number of inscriptions in the Corpus In - scriptionum Graecarum .

		Finally , the entire account is closed with a masterly paragraph summarizing the whole .

		Macaulay himself would have envied the pre - cision of Renan 's analysis , his constructive synthesis , the cogency of his reasoning , the exquisite grace of his style .

		Nowhere in historical literature , I venture to say , is there a finer example of the perfect combination of scientific historical research with the art of literary expression .

		The same observations are true also , though perhaps in less degree , of
Fustel de Coulanges	ORGANIZATION	,
Alfred Rambaud	PERSON	,
Achille Luchaire	PERSON	, and
Ernest Lavisse	PERSON	.

		These character - istics are universally recognized in the case of the first and the last .

		But who that has read Luchaire 's four volumes upon Pope Innocent III .

		will forget his picture of the greatest of the pontiffs , or the description of medieval
Toulouse	LOCATION	?

		In these volumes Luchaire con - cealed a remarkable erudition under the garment of a style woven without seam and almost matchless in texture .

		Even when we pass to
Germany	LOCATION	, proverbially the home of dry - as-dust historical prose , tin - writing of vivid and powerful history has its example .


Ranke	PERSON	's prose is classic .

		Treitschke 's Deuttche GcachichU is almost as brilliant and quite as partisan as
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's History of
England	LOCATION	.

		The limpidity of
Giesebrecht	ORGANIZATION	's Kaiscrztit is equalled by the thoroughness of his scholarship .

		To sum up .

		English poetry has had but one Shake - speare ; English prose has had but one
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	.

		An art like unto theirs was a gift of the gods .

		But is there not as great a charm in some sense a gi eater charm in that conscientious endeavor minutely to present his - torical truth without fear and without reproach , which is , as Coulanges finely said , the chastity of history ?

		The spirit of historical research was never broader or deeper than now , and that spirit is the spirit of truth . ''

		Human affairs , '' said Richter , '' are neither to be laughed at nor wept over , but to be understood . ''

		And to the truth of that utterance a host of historical scholars to-day are testifying , both in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		THE JOURNALIZED SHORT-STORY : A MAGAZINE EDITOR 'S VIEW .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I am not pessimistic regarding the present state of the short-story in
America	LOCATION	.

		It seems to me that it is rapidly moving forward in an evolution which is clmr - acteristic of nil literary development .

		Speaking broadly , and not forgetting considerable noteworthy individual attainment , the short-story is now in its period of power ; later will come the beauty of fineness .

		Just because the modern short-story differs from mere fictional nar - rative -LRB- whether sketch or tale -RRB- the story plot , with its emphasis upon complication and denouement , is quite primary and essential .

		The story is the big thing .

		Finish , style , literary appeal , are not fundamental to a yarn of grip and movement , but are superstructuraL They are , however , vital to a perfect , or even to a really good , short-story , whether its '' body '' be robust or delicate .

		If we must often choose between story and style , we choose story and turn elsewhere for style .

		Now and then we get both .

		Now here is where the journalistic short-story , so characteristic of the `` new '' magazine , is of value as a part in the general progress of the short-story teller 's art : it exhibits a rapidly growing sense of what is vital , and hence interesting , in plot , in situation , in surprise , in character , in all the groundwork of a good -LRB- by which I now mean well-constructed , sincere , and interesting -RRB- short-story .

		So I do not decry the present-day emphasis upon structural vigor and movement .

		It is a very important youthful step which shall soon lead the short - story on to the height of literature .

		What I do decry is the opinion of many that this journalistic short-story , concoction of swift intrigue , of robustious tragedy , of loud comicality , is the best kind of short-story .

		It is only a good kind imperfectly wrought , through too great insistence upon power at the expense of truth and beauty an indictment which is justly chargeable to our whole national life .

		Let the '' successful '' writer of to-day add to plot and movement that charm of style , that purity of dic - tion , that inner spiritual light , which alone can infuse vigor with fineness .

		It is the next step and a necessary one if the American short-story is to be literature .

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 279 There are not enough delicately wrought yet vital stories to go around .

		Not all editors are victims of bad taste .

		But I am confident that we are moving surely in the right direction .

		All of this present-day seeking for '' body , '' for vigor and action , must be regarded as our intense American desire to do a thing forcefully .

		By and by will come , for the short-story as for the novel , a general appreciation of and striving after the finer literary qualities , to which some of our writers of light and leading have already attained a few of them , alas , to the complete attenuation of '' the story '' itself .

		IMAGINATION AND THE MODERN SHORT-STORY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In returning to me recently a few tales in which I had attempted to treat some South American experi - ences with a large blend of imagination , the editor of a widely-circulated journal stated that he could not use three classes of matter , fairy stories -LRB- meaning the supernatural -RRB- , romance , and tragedy .

		It seems to me that this statement is a good comment on Mr.
Canby	PERSON	's interesting and able communication in your last issue .

		What in the world is there left to make short stories out of when the above things are eliminated ?

		There is really left only Fact .

		I think when Mr.
Gradgrind	PERSON	died he was cut up like Romeo into twenty thousand bits and each one of these bits is now , not a star , but an American Editor .

		The failure of imagination , that accounts for the decline in the art of short story-writing , for style fol - lows imagination as daylight does the sun .

		Buloz , the great French editor , was once offered an article on God . ''

		God ! ''

		he said . ''

		There is no actuality in that . ''

		The American Editor only sees actuality in what is under his nose .

		Imagine
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	's '' Monarch of Dreams , '' one of the greatest short stories ever written , being offered to the editor of any present American magazine .

		It would certainly be returned to the author with pitying commiseration , and the advice to get in touch with the people .

		But humanity can not get along without imagination .

		Expel it with a pitchfork , it will return .

		So our short - story writers stretch and dilate their facts until our magazines are a wild whirl of college Amadises ,
Ameri	PERSON	- can princesses , dress suits , automobiles , slumming , and
Rockefeller	ORGANIZATION	millions .

		The total result is as unveracious as the Arabian Nights , and infinitely less full of meaning .

		There was a gradual culmination in the American short-story through
Irving	LOCATION	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, and
Poe	PERSON	.

		There has been an accelerating decline ever since , save where the lift of
Bret Harte	PERSON	came in .

		He gave the world a new school , compounding his art , as all the masters have done , out of a few grains of fact and an immense proportion of fancy .

		A GREAT FRENCH LIBRARIAN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Permit me to add a few words to your comment on the death of
Leopold Delisle	PERSON	.

		He was , at the time of his death , librarian of the library at
Chantilly	LOCATION	, which was bequeathed to the
Institut de France	ORGANIZATION	by the late due D'Aumale , and had served in this capacity since he , in
1905	DATE	, was dismissed from the office of administrator of the
Bibliotheque Nationale	ORGANIZATION	, after thirty-four years of faithful , assiduous , and successful administration .

		His dismissal came like a bolt from a clear sky , and astounded his numerous personal friends as well as all whom he had assisted in his official capacity , by its quite apparent injustice .

		So far from being the cause of the difficulties which surround workers at the
Bibliotheque Nationale	ORGANIZATION	,
Leopold Delisle	PERSON	was directly responsible for the reforms that were introduced there during the years of his incum - bency , reforms that tended to make the vast collec - tions of that library available .

		It may truly be said of
Leopold Delisle	PERSON	that he found the
Bibliotheque Nationale	ORGANIZATION	a mob of books and left it a library indeed .

		He was a great administrator , a great librarian , one of the few whose names will go down to coming generations .

		But he was also a great scholar .

		To quote
Fritz Milkan	PERSON	, in his necrology of
Delisle	PERSON	in the
September	DATE	number of the Zentralblatt fur Bibliothekswesen : '' It has long been an acknowledged fact , acknowledged by the consensus , not of
France	LOCATION	alone , but of the world , that the enormous progress of historical science during the latter half of the nineteenth century is due to no one else in so high a degree as it is to him . ''

		He was an example of the librarian and scholar combined , to whom the world of scholarship is indebted , not only for important contribu - tions to the advancement of knowledge , but for a suc - cessful administration of the world 's largest library , an administration which resulted in opening to scholars resources which before his incumbency were inaccessible .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the past few months you have had occasion to record the deaths of five distinguished men
David J. Brewer	PERSON	,
Wm. T. Harris	PERSON	,
R. W. Gilder	PERSON	,
William James	PERSON	, and ''
Mark Twain	PERSON	. ''

		You have paid them fit tribute as they severally departed .

		But you have failed to mention that they were all of them members of the
Simplified Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	, ardent advocates of a rational endeavor to make the English language fitter for service thruout the world .

		No doubt this oversight was accidental .

		No doubt it was due to the fact that they had each of them many other titles to public regard .

		But as you have more than once exprest your own desire to leave English spelling alone in its present chaotic condition , and as your comments on our efforts to remove a few of its more obvious absurdities have sometimes seemed to suggest that all simplified spellers were cranks and freaks , I ask your permission to remind your readers that men of the wisdom and of the varied attainments that you have credited to these five leaders of American life were willing to stand up to be counted in behalf of our cause .

		To THE POLE WITH COMMANDER PEAKY .

		* From the tropical jungles and sun-scorched plains of equatorial
Africa	LOCATION	, of which
Colonel Roosevelt	ORGANIZATION	's latest book has been telling an inter - ested public many wonderful things , the atten - tion of that public is now called to the icy ter - rors and marvels of the Arctic by Commander
Peary	PERSON	's account of his crowning achievement , the attainment , after almost a quarter-century of yearning and striving , of latitude ninety north . ''

		The
North Pole	LOCATION	, '' as he entitles his record of this achievement , forms a fitting and satisfying sequel to those earlier narratives of his that have kept the world informed of his gradual approaches toward the final realization of his life 's dream .

		It is such a book as could only be written once in the history of the world , just as the exploit it chronicles is one that is not likely to be repeated though any predic - tion as to this would manifestly be rash .

		At any rate , no first discovery of the
North Pole	ORGANIZATION	will ever again be possible , and the publishers ' chosen adjective for the book , '' unique , '' is not out of place .

		The plan for this last and triumphant assault on the
Pole	LOCATION	embraced four principal features .

		First , the
Smith Sound	ORGANIZATION	or American route , offering a land base one hundred miles nearer the goal than is otherwise attainable , was chosen ; and , secondly ,
Cape Sheridan	PERSON	was selected to serve as a winter base , the ``
Roose	PERSON	- velt '' being anchored there after her perilous passage of the Sound .

		The same choice of route and winter base was made , it will be re - membered , three years earlier , when the coveted prize was all but won in a dash to the then '' farthest North . ''

		Third on this list of essen - tials comes the sledge with its team of Eskimo dogs , and fourth the Eskimo himself '' for the rank and file of the sledge party . ''

		Besides the indispensable presence of a strong company of these hardy natives from
Cape York	LOCATION	onward , a smaller number served in the auxiliary sledg - ing parties when the final move northward over the ice began , and four actually accompanied Commander
Peary	PERSON	to the Pole itself .

		These , with
Matthew Henson	PERSON	, the faithful and experien - ced colored assistant , were the only sharers in the glory of their leader 's success at the v.-ry TuK NORTH POLK .

		last .

		Of his band as a whole , all of whom but one -LRB- the lamented Professor
Marvin	PERSON	, drowned in a lead covered with thin ice -RRB- he brought home in safety , the author writes : I was extremely fortunate in the personnel of this last and successful expedition , for in choosing the men 1 had the membership of the previous expedition to draw from .

		A season in the Arctic is a great test of char - acter .

		One may know a man better after six months with him beyond the Arctic circle than after a lifetime of acquaintance in cities .

		There is something I know not what to call it in those frozen spaces that brings a man face to face with himself and with his companions ; if he is a man , the man comes out ; and , if he is a cur , the cur shows as quickly . ''

		The story of the expedition , from the ''
Roose	PERSON	- velt 's '' leaving
New York	LOCATION	,
July 6 , 1908	DATE	, to Commander
Peary	PERSON	's arrival at the pole ,
April > , 1909	DATE	, and the return of the party in tin - sum - mer of the latter year , is familiar in outline to every newspaper-reader .

		In more detail it is known to readers of the magazine that lias already published the greater part of the ex - plorer 's narrative .

		But for the complete ac - count , with its one hundred and ten striking illustrations from photographs taken on the spot , eight of them skilfully colored , one must go to the book itself , a few further extracts from which will here be given .

		Again and again is the reader made to admire the grim determination and cool courage of the Arctic explorer .

		Not that any formal and deliberate accounts are given of obstacles overcome or dangers faced ; these things are to be read mostly between the lines , now and then in a passing reference or casual mention .

		For example , the fact that the author has for the last eleven years been obliged to make the best of his way about on feet that northern frosts have reduced literally to stumps , transpires in a natural if not unavoidable explanation of less than a line of print .

		And again , in a short passage , a few of the negative delights of Arctic sledging are brought within the reader 's appre - hension . ''

		It was so cold much of the time on this last journey that the brandy was frozen solid , the petroleum was white and viscid , and the dogs could hardly be seen for the steam of their breath .

		The minor discomfort of building every night our narrow and uncomfortable snow houses , and the cold bed platform of that igloo on which we must snatch such hours of rest as the exigencies of our desperate enterprise permitted us , seem hardly worth mentioning in comparison with the difficulties of the main proposition itself . ''

		On nights of especial danger , when the parting of the ice under the sleeper 's chilly bed might precipitate him into the still more chilly water , the party slept with mittens on ; otherwise the
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 281 undressing for the night seems to have consisted of removing the mittens , which were then placed within instant reach .

		Not infrequently the only pause between two marches was for eating and a short rest , without sleep .

		Darkness there was none , of course , after the start had fairly been made for the
Pole	LOCATION	.

		The number and variety of mischances that had to be as far as possible guarded against , any one of which might have summarily defeated the object of the expedition , are something appalling to think of , so that it seems little short of a miracle that success was actually achieved .

		Such a conjunction of favorable , or not too adverse , conditions might not , even with the best of planning and foresight , be encountered again in centuries ; and only a man of long special training and of indomitable purpose would be able to take advantage of the opportunity .

		Colonel
Roosevelt	PERSON	well says in his brief Introduction : '' Probably few outsiders realize the well-nigh incredi - ble toil and hardship entailed in such an achievement as
Peary	PERSON	's ; and fewer still understand how many years of careful training and preparation there must be before the feat can be even attempted with any chance of suc - cess .

		A ' dash for the pole ' can be successful only if there have been many preliminary years of painstaking , patient toil .

		Great physical hardihood and endurance , an iron will and unflinching courage , the power of com - mand , the thirst for adventure , and a keen and far - sighted intelligence all these must go to the make-up of the successful arctic explorer ; and these , and more than these , have gone to the make-up of the chief of successful arctic explorers , of the man who succeeded where hitherto even the best and the bravest had failed . ''

		The Foreword contributed by the editor of the `` National Geographic Magazine '' concludes a useful eighteen-page sketch of north-polar exploration from the first part of the sixteenth century , with a well-considered tribute to Com - mander
Peary	PERSON	. ''

		The prize of four centuries of striving yielded at last to the most persistent and scientific attack ever waged against it .

		Peary 's success was made possible by long experience , which gave him a thorough knowl - edge of the difficulties to be overcome , and by an un - usual combination of mental and physical power a resourcefulness which enabled him to find a way to sur - mount all obstacles , a tenacity and courage which knew no defeat , and a physical endowment such as nature gives to few men . ''

		The author himself modestly ascribes his suc - cess '' to experience ; to the courage , endurance and devotion of the members of the expedition , who put all there was in them into the work ; and to the unswerving faith and loyalty of the officers , members , and friends of the
Peary Arctic Club	ORGANIZATION	, who furnished the sinews of war , without which nothing could have been accomplished . ''

		In addition to the attainment of the
Pole	LOCATION	, a small contribution was made to geography by the exploration of
Clements Markham Inlet	ORGANIZATION	to its head , this being but a few days ' journey along the coast of Grant Land from the winter quarters .

		Another minor event of considerable interest is related in the closing chapter .

		`` MacMillan while taking tidal observations at
Fort Conger	LOCATION	on
Lady Franklin Bay	LOCATION	, to connect our work at
Capes Sheridan	PERSON	,
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	,
Bryant	PERSON	, and
Jesup	ORGANIZATION	with the observations of the Lady
Franklin Bay	PERSON	expedition of 1881-83 , found still some remains of the supplies of the disastrous Greely expedition of 1881-84 .

		They included canned vegetables , potatoes , hominy , rhubarb , pemmi - can , tea , and coffee .

		Strange to say , after the lapse of a quarter of a century , many of these supplies were still in good condition , and some of them were eaten with relish by various members of our party .

		One of the finds was a text book which had belonged to Lieutenant
Kislingbury	PERSON	, who lost his life with the Greely party .

		Upon its flyleaf it bore this inscription : ' To my dear father , from his affectionate son ,
Harry Kislingbury	PERSON	.

		May God be with you and return you safely to us . '

		Greely 's old coat was also found lying on the ground .

		This also was in good condition and I believe
MacMillan	PERSON	wore it for some days . ''

		One notes with approval that the book con - tains only two references , brief and colorless , to Dr.
Frederick A. Cook	PERSON	; and Mr.
Harry Whitney	PERSON	's name likewise occurs twice .

		Three appended papers give tidal and other observa - tions ; facsimiles of certain other important observations , and of original certificates relating to the polar sledge journey ; and a '' Report of the sub-committee of the
National Geographic Society on Peary 's Records	ORGANIZATION	, and Some of the Honors Awarded for the Attainment of the Pole . ''

		An index and a large map conclude the volume .

		The handsome workmanship of the book , with its many fine illustrations , obtained in some cases under unusual difficulties , calls for unstinted praise .

		It is indeed a '' unique '' record of a heroic achievement .

		THE LAW AND GOSPEL , or ART .

		* The difficulty of finding an appropriate and effective title has kept many a worthy book from coming to the attention of the class of readers who would find most profit in reading it .

		In naming his masterly analysis of the philosophy of art in its application to pictorial composition , `` Notes on the Science of Picture - Making , '' the Director of the
National Portrait Gallery	ORGANIZATION	has heavily handicapped a work which * NOTES ON THE SCIENCE OF PICTURE-MAKING .

Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		282 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, should be read by everyone interested in the fine arts .

		It is not , as the title would indicate , a technical treatise for the instruction of art students .

		Nor is its appeal solely to artists and art critics , though they may read it with advantage .

		The truth is , Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	has writ - ten a very remarkable book .

		In it he has set forth the whole law and gospel of art , carrying the analysis further than other authors have done .

		* , and applying it with simple directness to the practical questions involved in making pic - tures and in forming an intelligent opinion of their merit .

		Such technical matters as enter into the discussion are dealt with in plain language requiring no special education or familiarity with studio terminology for its comprehension .

		A significant note is struck in the opening sentence of the Introduction : `` The blunders which we continually make in our estimates of contemporary painting , and the incessant squabbles between painters themselves , do not argue that art criticism so far has been of much practical use , either to the world in general , or to the limited class of persons who might be expected to read it . ''

		Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	then goes on to say : `` So far as the general public is concerned , the -LRB- esthetic philosopher may be absolved for his non - success .

		If he has failed to teach it the principles of reason , judgment , and good taste , no other kind of a philosopher has been much more successful .

		Yet when we come to the restricted class of educated persons who have been closely connected with the Fine Arts in some capacity or other , the -LCB- esthetic philosopher has been more conspicuously ineffective .

		The musician and the man of letters no longer dispute except over trifles , but artists are still at open war over what would seem to be the very rudiments of taste : School fights with
School	ORGANIZATION	and Society with Society . ''

		The reasons for this are admittedly not easy to give , and Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	perhaps overlooks some of them in ascribing as the principal one the endeavor to formulate a canon of perfect ideal beauty as the foundation of artistic - ac - cess .

		There can be little room for doubt , how - ever , of the effect upon ideas respecting the fine arts , of reliance upon such a canon .

		Not only does the relativity of beauty result in great divergence of views as to the type itself , but , as is pertinently asserted in the book before us , the secondary effects of regarding a fixed canon of ideal beauty as a criterion have been '' no less calamitous than its primary statement . '' ''

		It was soon recognized by thoughtful minds that this canon not only failed to account for the admitted excellencies of many great works of art but was actually inconsistent with them .

		To explain the discrepancy < Truth to
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, ' interpreted in a thousand different senses , was called in ; and until the
latter half of the nineteenth century	DATE	-LRB- when Truth to Nature ' began to occupy the field alone -RRB- , the efforts of painters and critics alike were devoted to reconciling somehow these shifting opposites .

		The result has been utter .

		- liaos , disastrous to artists both directly and indirectly . ''

		Another stumbling block is found in the appeal to tradition : '' The revival of any past tradition , however splendid its record , is a perilous business ; for unless it can be adapted to the decorative and intellectual needs of the period of its renaissance , it will be futile and pedantic . ''

		These words are eminently sound .

		So also are those with which the introduction closes : The true logical foundation of the Fine Arts is inex - tricably connected with their concrete function , mate - rials , and processes : and no abstract philosophising which has neglected these essential factors has produ - ced any fruit but fine words , conflicting judgments , and bad painting .

		It is upon the practical sciences of picture-making , of sculpture-making and the like , and not upon any group of abstract ideas , that the aesthetic philosopher of the future will have to erect the com - plete all-embracing theory which will enable artists to be peaceable , art patrons to be confident , and art critics to be unanimous . ''

		Though the time when such unanimity of opinion will prevail is seemingly far in the future , and widely varying views may be heard on every hand , those expressed by Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	in this book are nevertheless in accord with those held by the small circle of the most emi - nent critics and connoisseurs of the present day .

		It is not the novelty of the views but the novelty and clarity of their presentment that make the book notable .

		The cogency of the reasoning is helped by the modesty with which these views are stated : the orderly plan upon which the work is laid out make the answers to many perplexing and oft controverted questions easy to be understood .

		In no other way can so accurate an impres - sion of the quality of the book be conveyed as by letting the author speak for himself .

		What could be more true than the following words ?

		Do they not go to the very root of the ques - tions , how should we paint ?

		and how should we appreciate and judge paintings ?

		`` The true painter 's emotion sums up and concen - trates his experiences in terms of paint , as the poet sums up his experiences in terms of rhythm .

		It seizes on the facts of the subject that are essential to pictorial expression and rejects all others .

		It emphasises these selected facts by all the devices of the painter 's art , by rhythm of line , by the spacing and disposition of the masses , by light and shade , by colour , and by the very handling of the paint , till the result is a harmonious pictorial statement in which the various elements unite to serve the artist 's purpose .

		`` To make good pictures the painter needs the stim - ulus of emotion just as does the poet ... We must never forget that the emotion which the painter has to cultivate is not tin - emotion of the poet , the musician , or the archaeologist , but the emotion which is stirred by
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 283 the pictorial aspect of things , and by that aspect alone .

		Whatever charm his subject may have for him by reason of its association with life or literature , he will make a bad picture of it if he allows the thought of this charm to come between him and the thought of its pictorial aspect . ''

		These conclusions are not mere dicta .

		They are the result of an extended inquiry that neglects neither the point of view of the artist nor that of the observer , that takes into consideration materials and technical processes as well as the metaphysical basis upon which sound thought must rest .

		Two more of them insistently invite quotation : '' There is a constant hesitation in the popular mind as to whether the subject-matter of a picture , its inner significance , is more important than its technical expres - sion , its outward decorative aspect .

		There can be no real doubt as to the truth .

		As music conveys its mean - ing to us through the ear , so a picture must convey its meaning to us through the eye .

		It is through the visible attractiveness of its pattern of interwoven lines and tones and colours that we must be introduced to the significance of the images which the pattern includes .

		Decoration therefore has always a definite precedence over Significance in all good pictures .

		The moment the position is reversed ; when a canvas appeals to the mind rather than to the eye ; when we think of the story it tells before our eyes have been gladdened by the attractiveness of its general appearance when Signifi - cance in short , has taken precedence of Decoration the thing is an Illustration , not a Picture . ''

		The great problem in connection with the subject matter of painting is the relation of art to nature .

		Truth to
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, ' as we have seen , is one of those phrases which people are apt to use as if it were an infallible touchstone for works of art , without consider - ing for a moment that , had this been so absolutely , the great masters would not be great , and the best works of art would be those which most nearly resemble our modern colour-photography . ''

		It remains to be said that profound though the book is , it is most pleasant to read .

		Clear - ness of thought finds expression in unusual felicity of statement .

		Few of those who dip into Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	's pages will be content to lay the volume aside without going through it more than once .

New York	LOCATION	:
John Lane Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	has written a characteristically entertaining critical biography , which Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	appraised most divertingly in the
London	LOCATION	'' Nation '' ; and now Miss
Renee M. Deacon	PERSON	has produced a sort of student 's primer of Shavian philosophy , in which Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's dramatic theory , conception of life , and artistic function are laid down with an uncritical admiration unfortunate for the book but interesting as show - ing the complete recognition which its gifted subject has received .

		Heretic and Iconoclast of course , but also prophet ; to be defined in simple terms for those who read -LRB- because it is the thing -RRB- and run .

		Meanwhile , '' Getting Married , '' '' The Doc - tor 's Dilemma , '' and '' Blanco Posnet '' are , according to the publishers , '' in press , '' where they have remained , for reasons best known , probably , to Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, through divers pub - lishing seasons .

		The only play of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's that has appeared recently in print is a suffra - gette farce in one act , intended for amateur production , entitled `` Press Cuttings '' ; and even that has not been brought out on this side of the water .

		But in the meantime the staid columns of '' The Times '' have been often leavened by Shavian controversy .

		There have been tilts with Mr.
Frohman	PERSON	over the Repertory Theatre , tilts with the tax-collector over Mrs.
Shaw	PERSON	's income tax , tilts with various persons about Socialism , tilts with musical critics about
Strauss	PERSON	, tilts , most frequent and most diverting , over the stage censorship .

		Sometime , per - haps , a book will be made of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's contro - versies , and like
Whistler	LOCATION	's '' Gentle Art '' it will be a classic in its kind .

		For if nobody else can write
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	plays , so nobody can match Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	for keen , merciless , compact argument whirlwind argument , which states its adversary 's position with cool , cruel irony , characterizes it with frank , brilliant impertinence , and proves the contrary with a sweep of splendid general izations supported by an almost impregnabi : array of detail .

		As Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	puts it : `` Why can not a man write bad political econom t without coupling it with an attack on the
Fabiai Society	ORGANIZATION	?

		The profit is naught ; the retribution sudden , swift , and fearful . '' ''

		Sudden , swift , and fearful '' also the retribu tion exacted from those who fall foul of Mr
Shaw	PERSON	's other favorite doctrines and institutions A brilliant example of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's contro - versial writings is the little book entitled '' Socialism and Superior Brains , '' which is all , it appears , that we are to have from him at present .

		It began in '' The Times , '' as a reply THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, to Mr.
W. H. Mallock	PERSON	and a defence of Mr.
Keir Hardie	PERSON	; it has grown to a Fabian publi - cation , containing the original correspondence , with explanations , and also an earlier reply to Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	, on the same issues , first printed in
1894	DATE	in the '' Fortnightly Review . ''

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's blunder , as stated by Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, is to conclude '' that because ability can produce wealth and is rare , and men who are rich are also rare , these rich and rare ones must also be the able ones / ' Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	shows , with his customary cheerful completeness , that there is indeed no connection between the possession of wealth and `` Superior Brains , '' that truly '' Superior Brains '' demand no such connection , that '' Superior Brains '' are at once wasted and overpaid , under present conditions , by the idle rich , and that they will find their paradise in Social-Democracy , where selfishness and stupid - ity will be disqualified , and ability may shine forth exactly as now , for a small salary and other valuable considerations .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	has pointed out , among Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's character - istic merits , the rare union of intelligence with intelligibility .

		It is the wide recognition of this delightful quality that will cause many persons not particularly interested in '' the rent of ability '' or in the Fabian Socialist Series , to read Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's reply to Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	just because it is Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's .

		To return for a moment to Miss Deacon 's study of the `` artist-philosopher '' : it has glaring faults , but it will serve , possibly better than more critical and comprehensive accounts of the matter , to equip the bewildered beginner with some idea of what this very modern drama - tist is driving at .

		It is an attempt , evidently , at purely objective treatment , an attitude rendered difficult to maintain by the peculiarities of the
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	dramas .

		It is an attempt , also , to explain Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	out of his own prefaces , a method not without disadvantages , particularly when indiscriminately followed .

		For instance , Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	drops the truism that conflict is essential to drama , merely to lead up to the characteri - zation of the especial sort of conflict that he is interested in ; but
Miss Deacon	LOCATION	confines herself to showing that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's plays involve con - flict .

		Here , as in other cases , a background of comparative criticism would have saved the situation .

		Miss Deacon is also fond of danger - ous superlatives such as that no dramatic author has insisted so strongly on the social side of life , '' or that the Shaw '' view of woman is at once the most practical and the most trans - cendentally spiritual . ''

		But she emphasizes thoroughly some salient points of the
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	gospel ; and persons who have read the plays , the prefaces , and the Chesterton biognphy , and still want more light or tho.se \ \ liom Un - popular outcry over the complexity of the
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	paradox has frightened are hopefully referred to this most recent presentation of the subject .

		THE DIAL 285 on

		It is somewhat curious that it has taken two biog - raphers to write a brief sketch of

		It is disappointing that the joint effort is inadequate and superficial , and throws no light upon the ability of the great conductor , his musicianship , his achievements , or his early labors as the pioneer of orchestral music in the

		Furthermore , it is somewhat exasperating that the inconsequential collabor - ation is accompanied by the poorest of Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	's portraits .

		The only remaining
Ameri	PERSON	- can topic , which is not American except by adoption , is '' Yankee Doodle , '' and this gives Mr.
Carl Sonneck	PERSON	, the learned pundit who presides over the
Musical Department	ORGANIZATION	of the
Congressional Library	ORGANIZATION	, an opportunity to in - dulge in nearly four pages of queries and con - jectures that leave the reader at last in a fog about a subject which could be of no great consequence even if the truth about it were known .

		As many countries claim the nativity of `` Yankee Doodle '' as cities did that of Homer .

		Fortunately our own is the most shadowy of all .

		Ax AMERICAN SERIES OF GENERAL , HISTORY .

		* The unquestioned success of the ''
American Science Series	ORGANIZATION	, '' and its recognized usefulness in presenting the various fields of science in a simple yet thorough manner , have led to an attempt to perform a like service to the realm of history .

		According to the publishers ' an - nouncement , the `` American Historical Series '' is to consist of eight text-books written by American scholars under the editorial super - vision of Professor
Charles H. Haskins	PERSON	, of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, containing `` comprehen - sive , systematic , and authoritative '' informa - tion , and , while preserving '' descriptive as well as narrative '' form , giving due atten - tion to `` economic and social conditions and to institutional development . ''

		The plan is certainly ambitious , but the design is excel - lent and if successfully executed will not only present an evidence of American scholarship , but will offer the educational and reading public a series of very useful handy reference works on history .

		The first volume to appear is ''
Europe	LOCATION	since
1815	DATE	, '' by Professor
Charles D. Hazen	PERSON	, of
Smith College	ORGANIZATION	.

		If Mr.
Hazen	PERSON	's work were to be rated upon the basis of comparison with the older and standard brief histories of the period , it would in most cases suffer by its inferiority in vividness , or in picturesqueness of presen tation .

		Fyffe offers a rounded and attractive style , Miiller a journalistic and vigorously lib - eral interpretation ,
Andrews	PERSON	trustworthy facts from a fluent pen , and Seignobos an unusual lucidity that redeems his work from heaviness .

		The present volume can not compete with these older works in their special excellencies ; and it does not pretend to do so .

		Its claim to recog - nition is rather that as a college text-book or a convenient reference book it supplies certain deficiencies of the works above-mentioned , and that for the student or the busy man it presents a readable and handy compendium for a defi - nite period of history .

		Briefly , this purpose is well fulfilled .

		The arrangement of the work is good ; chapter-headings and page-headings are well chosen ; marginal headings on each page aid in the search for a given topic ; fourteen unusually clear maps explain the text ; the index is in every way adequate ; and a well-selected bibliography refers to the better-known sources * EUROPE SINCE

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, and secondary works .

		The author has a faculty for clear , simple , and direct statement , and a condensation that at first glance is so smooth as to forbid realization of what must have been a tremendous labor , but that excites admiration as one comes to understand how well essential facts have been retained while the unessential have been eliminated .

		Mr.
Hazen	PERSON	's work is unquestionably `` comprehensive and systematic , '' and in so far as we have tested his facts it is '' authoritative . ''

		The book begins with
Europe	LOCATION	at the close of the Napoleonic era , carries the story of national and international activities to the end of the century , and concludes with three chapters on
Russia	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	, and the Far East .

		It does not touch upon
United States	LOCATION	history .

		In so gen - eral a field , so briefly treated , no author could by any possibility be at once comprehensive and steadily entertaining .

		Thus , for the most part literary expression has been sacrificed to ac - curacy and detail .

		Nevertheless , Mr.
Hazen	PERSON	is distinctly clever in brief characterizations of men , and there are many striking pen-pictures that should serve to fix a personality in the reader 's mind .

		One may not always agree with these necessarily concise estimates , yet they show familiarity with biographies and in addi - tion are frequently original and always judicial .

		Much space is given , very properly , to English political movements , as well as to the wonder - ful colonial development of the
last half of the nineteenth century	DATE	; and here the work seems less a compendium and more a living story .

		For , on the whole , the book is really a com - pendium , excellent in itself and likely to be very serviceable to teachers who use it as a base for more expanded description , but after all a great storehouse of fact .

		The history presented is largely on traditional models , mainly political , somewhat social where social movements have affected politics , treating the more obvious causes and effects , ignoring largely inner causes and relations , and devoting less attention than the publishers ' announce - ment would indicate to economic and indus - trial development .

		The real merit of the work is that , taken all in all , it accomplishes the purpose of the series in offering a convenient and accurate hand-book .

		Certainly the series should prove acceptable and useful if the volumes in preparation maintain the standard set by the present one .

		\ \ - regret to say , far less interesting than the earlier ones .

		We trust that when we next meet the author , it will be again in the Victorian environment which is so peculiarly fitted to his genius . ''

		An Affair of Dishonor '' deals with the early years of the Restor - ation , and the
London	LOCATION	Plague , of which we hear at a distance , serves to fit the date exactly .

		Sir
Oliver Raydon	PERSON	is an English country gentleman who has seduced the daughter of a neighbor .

		Challenged to a duel by the outraged father .

		Sir
Oliver	PERSON	meets his antagonist , and kills him .

		The slaying is not hon - orable , even from the peculiar ethical standpoint of the duellist , for the mortal thrust is given after the enemy has already received a wound that should have ended hostilities .

		The murderer then wrestles with the problem of breaking the news to his mis - tress , and solves it by a cowardly evasion .

		Before she can learn of it , he has carried her off to another of his estates a remote and desolate place on the coast of the
North Sea	LOCATION	and there keeps her in ignorance of what has happened .

		The means of dis - closure is provided by the woman 's brother , return - ing from
Virginia	LOCATION	, wounded and temporarily blinded in a sea fight with the Dutch , and cast upon the very shores of Sir
Oliver	PERSON	's estate .

		Here he is nursed back to life and sight by his sister , who does not reveal to him the bond that is between them .

		Finally she lets the secret out , and it transpires also that she is the mistress of his host and not the wife .

		Even then neither of them knows of the father 's murder , and it is only when the brother returns to his ancestral home that he learns the full extent of Sir
Oliver	PERSON	's villainy .

		When the dreadful news at last reaches the woman , she takes flight from the man whom she must henceforth hate , although she can not root out from her heart all of the old affec - tion .

		Then there is a duel between the brother and Sir
Oliver	PERSON	, in which the latter is generously spared , then the death of Sir
Oliver	PERSON	's wife makes possible a partial and tardy reparation , and the wronged AM AFFAIR OF DISHONOR .

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE JDIAJ , 287 woman consents to marry him for the sake of their unborn child .

		Sir
Oliver	PERSON	, who is an epileptic , comes to a miserable end , and the story trickles out to a conclusion reached in Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	's favorite way of indirection .

		The work has considerable power as a psychological study , but the theme chosen demands a much larger proportion of action than it gets , and the total effect is inclined to be wearisome .

		Probably the author could not write a poor novel if he tried , but the present production brings with it an acute sense of disappointment , so inadequately does it exhibit the gifts of humor and tender senti - ment that are the charm of ''
Joseph Vance	PERSON	'' and '' Somehow Good . ''

		It is an artificial piece of work at best , and the spontaneous geniality of the earlier novels is sadly missing from its pages .

		Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's '' Rest Harrow '' is the third section of the delectable comedy -LRB- previously comprising '' Open Country '' and '' Halfway House '' -RRB- in which the vagaries of
Jack Senhouse	PERSON	are described for us , and illuminated by copious outpourings of his thought in the form of monologue and epistle .

		We imagine it to be the conclusion of the whole matter , as far as the public is concerned , and it is just as well that it should be , because his eccentric individualism begins to pall , and his philosophy of conduct if it may be given so pretentious a designation has now been expounded with some superfluity of iteration .

		The present story , which is not much of a story at best , carries on the tale of his philanderings with
Sanchia	PERSON	to the culminating night in the open , when she has come to him for a final refuge from the influences that seek to shape her life in the conventional mould . ''

		They talked long and late , walking down the valley to the farmstead for bread .

		On this , with milk and fruit , they supped after
Sanchia	PERSON	had bathed , and clad herself in one of his Moorish robes .

		Hooded and folded in this she sat at meat , and
Senhouse	PERSON	, filled with the
Holy Ghost	ORGANIZATION	, discoursed at large .

		The past they took for granted , the present was but a golden frame for the throbbing blue of the days to come . ''

		We can well believe the statement that Senhouse '' discoursed at large . ''

		Coleridge once said to Lamb : ''
Charles	PERSON	, did you ever hear me preach ? ''

		`` I never heard you do anything else , '' was the prompt reply .

		We trust that the '' blue of the days to come '' is to be taken poetically , and not as indicating the hue of
Sanchia	LOCATION	's musings after her final break with society .

		We are of course glad that she is quit of
Ingram	PERSON	, who is a brute , and no sort of mate for her , but we can not help wondering if `` the days to come '' will not reduce her to
Tennyson	PERSON	's condition after his ten weeks ' sojourn at
Fitz Gerald	PERSON	's `` table of Pythagoras , '' seeming at first '' a thing enskied , '' and finally fall - ing '' from that half-spiritual height chill 'd , '' and turning to the fleshpots with zest .

		The author of '' A Man 's Man '' has a marked talent for humorous description , and he is apt to let it get the better of his narrative intent .

		His picture of
Coney Island	LOCATION	may be given as a brief example . ''

		Take
Margate	LOCATION	and
Douglas	PERSON	and
Blackpool	LOCATION	, and pile them into an untidy heap ; throw in a dozen Fun-Cities from
Olympia	LOCATION	and half a score of World 's Fairs from the Agri - cultural Hall ; add some of the less reputable features of
Earl 's Court	ORGANIZATION	and
Neuilly	LOCATION	Fair ; include a race-course of the baser sort ; case the whole in wood , and people it with sallow gentlemen in striped jerseys and ladies answering exclusively to such names as
Hattie	LOCATION	,
Sadie	PERSON	, and
Mamie	ORGANIZATION	, reared up appar - ently upon an exclusive diet of peanuts and clam-chowder ; keep the whole multitude duly controlled and disciplined by a police force which , if appearances go for anything , has been recruited entirely from the criminal classes , and you will be able faintly to realize what
Coney Island	LOCATION	can do when it tries on a fine
Sunday	DATE	in
summer	DATE	. ''

		This choice bit of characterization is only one out of many ; the story as a whole is consequently dis - jointed and episodical .

		Nevertheless , there is enough of a continuous story to hold the attention , while the author 's cleverness and unfailing humor make us quite willing to forgo what would otherwise be our demand for a more closely-knit tale .

		Mr.
Hay	PERSON	recounts for us the fortunes of one
Hughie Marrable	PERSON	, who first appears as a student at Cam - bridge , and qualifies as a hero by an exploit at Bumps , whereby his crew wins the Head of the
River	LOCATION	.

		Hughie then knocks about the world for ten years , working his way for the fun of the thing , and mingling for choice in the most disreputable society he can find .

		All this is lightly passed over , and when we meet him at
Coney Island	LOCATION	he is on his way home to settle down as an English gentleman .

		His Quixotic championship of a distressed damsel results in his being shanghaied in
New York	LOCATION	, and shipped on board a tramp freighter which is to be scuttled in mid-ocean for the insurance .

		The scuttling is duly started , and the rascally crew take to the boats , but
Hughie	ORGANIZATION	is left on board with three other men , the holes are plugged up , and the freighter , still good for about four knots , is taken to port .

		Thus end
Hughie	ORGANIZATION	's Wanderjahre .

		After attending to the captain and his owner , and seeing them retired from society for a term of yea.rs , he finds himself confronted with a new sort of problem .

		He has been made the guardian of a girl a child when he had last seen her , a beau - tiful but wayward young woman upon his return and falls in love with her .

		He bungles the affair a good deal , so that the entire latter half of the book is needed to set things to rights .

		After keeping him on tenter-hooks long enongh to get the full en - joyment of the sport ,
Joey	PERSON	capitulates , and all is well .

		It is a very joyous book , and the writer 's powers of characterization are much out of the common .

		`` There was nothing in contemporary literature to compare with the serene , inspired audacity of
Jane Holland	PERSON	. ''

		One might take this quotation from '' The Creators '' as a reasonably accurate character - ization of Miss
Sinclair	PERSON	, who combines audacity with serenity in a fashion somewhat startling even to this liberal-minded generation of novel-readers . ''

		The Creators '' does not go quite so far in the direction of frankness as '' The Helpmate '' did , but it says a good many things that are usually left unspoken .

		In a way it takes us back to Miss
Sinclair	PERSON	's great success , '' The Divine Fire '' for it has to do with 288 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, the mental processes and manifestations of genius , bat instead of a single example it gives us half a dozen -LRB- reckoning
Nicky	PERSON	, a genius manqut , as one of the number -RRB- , equally divided between the sexes .

		And its moral seems to be that genius takes heavy chances when it mates .

		The inherent difficulty in the problem of taking great novelists and poets for heroes and heroines is that it is so hard to make them live up to their imputed characters .

		No amount of assertion , however vehement , will convince us that anyone is a genius unless his own reported speech bears the unmistakable signs of inspir - ation .

		Miss
Sinclair	PERSON	came within measurable dis - tance of solving this problem successfully in `` The Divine Fire , '' but she comes considerably short of her aim in the new venture .

		Our chief impression of these writing-folk is that they are an irritable and neurotic set , conspicuously devoid of balance and common sense , rather than that they are the creative artists the author would like to have us think them .

		The book is immensely clever as to dialogue and personal description , and keeps free from long analytical divagations .

		These qualities make it un - usually readable , but something more than little touches are required for vital portraiture , and that something more Miss
Sinclair	PERSON	is not quite able to command .

		The two important characters who are not geniuses -LRB- unfortunately married to the two who are -RRB- seem to be the most authentic examples of human nature in the whole book .

		Miss
Louise Gerard	PERSON	is the author of a weird African romance called `` The Golden Centipede , '' which in point of invention should make Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	anxious about his laurels .

		In point of description , it is rather suggestive of the African tales of Mr.
Harold Bindloss	PERSON	; and even recalls at times the masterly pages of Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	.

		Unfortunately the book is badly-written , with fre - quent lapses from good grammar , and a most con - fusing use of pronouns .

		Over and over again the reader is puzzled to determine the antecedent of a `` he '' or a `` him . ''

		The golden centipede of the title is only a symbol , but there are real centipedes in the story , of the most venomous and loathsome sort .

		There are other horrors , also , piled one upon another until we have something more than a surfeit of them .

		In fact , the story is one of the creepiest that we can recall , but the plot , ingenious although wildly extravagant , has a certain fascination which partly atones for the book 's many defects of prolixity , cheap sentiment , and general literary shapelessness .

		Miss
Wylie	PERSON	's `` The Native Born '' is a tale of modern
India	LOCATION	which , while it is lacking in the penetrative power of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	and Mrs. Steel , is fairly comparable with the works of those writers in its evidence of acquaintance with the conditions of Indian life , and in its successful working-out of an intricate plot .

		A brief prologue describes an attack upon an outpost , stubbornly but hopelessly defended by a handful of soldiers , ending with the last stand and final massacre of the whites .

		Then , after an interval of a score of years , the real story begins in the same place , once more an English station .

		Retributive justice , although tardy , had been effective , and a stern hand had dealt with the revolting natives .

		The present
Rajah	PERSON	is a young man who had been rescued as an infant from the scene of vengeance , and retained in power under an English protectorate .

		When we meet him , he is a deeply interesting figure , a dreamy idealist , know - ing little of the conquering race by actual contact , but much by reading and reflection .

		He sees in the English a race of heroes , and when advances are made to him by the society of the station , is only too ready to receive his new friends with open arms .

		He speedidly falls victim to the wiles of a designing woman and the intrigues of a speculative adventurer .

		He dares to love the one innocent of the social gulf between black and white while with the other he engages in a mining scheme which he is persuaded to look upon as a philan - thropic enterprise for the uplifting of his people .

		When his eyes are opened , and he learns that the woman has tricked him , and that the man has plunged him into personal dishonor , he becomes once more the Indian prince , implacable in his hatred , and fierce in his fanatical zeal for revenge .

		He determines to sweep the English settlement out of existence , and it seems that their doom is sealed , when the extraordinary fact is revealed to him that he is himself partly of English blood .

		Thus is the final catastrophe averted , for with the
Rajah	ORGANIZATION	's revulsion of feeling the revolt becomes powerless .

		Even the woman who has played with him expe - riences a change of heart , and her better self is aroused as she learns to appreciate his inherent nobility of character .

		The secondary interest of the narrative is provided by the relations of a man and woman , both English , who had also been pre - served as children from the massacre that had orphaned them both twenty years earlier .

		The whole plot is too intricate to be outlined in a few words , and so many revelations are crowded into the closing chapters that the effect is too confusing for the most satisfactory sort of story-telling .

		But the novel has both interest and power , and its tense dramatic climaxes indicate an unusual measure of literary skill .

		Our Civil War will doubtless provide subjects for the novelist for many years to come , and its possibilities still remain largely unexplored .

		In its superficial aspects , indeed , it has become fairly hackneyed , but the novels devoted to it that ex - hibit insight and breadth of treatment may alnmst be counted upon one 's fiiipT - . ''

		Ailsa Paige '' comes very near to being included in this small group ; its claim would be indisputable were it not for its extravagant emotional coloring and its exces - sive sentimentalism .

		Mr.

		THE DIAL 289 indulgence in over-violent contrasts of light and shade .

		The blend of brute and idealist that he gives us in his hero is not exactly calculated to appeal to the judicious , although his youthful read - ers will probably think it adorable .

		He is at his best in such a bit of dialogue as the following : ''
Curt	PERSON	? '' ''

		Yes , dear . '' ''

		If he surrenders '' It makes no difference what he does now , child . '' ''

		I know it .

		... They 've dishonoured the flag .

		This is war is n't it ? '' ''

		Yes . ''

		`` Will it be a long war ? '' ''

		I think not . '' ''

		Who will go ? '' ''

		I do n't know ... Soldiers . '' ''

		I did n't suppose we had enough .

		Where are we going to get more ? ''

		`` The people '' he said absently `` everybody , I sup - pose .

		How do I know , child ? ''

		`` Just ordinary people ? '' ''

		Just ordinary people '' he responded quietly .

		If only the author had heeded the lesson of sim - plicity and restraint thus set himself he might have given us a masterpiece .

		As it is , he has given us a stirring story , told with much tenderness and sympathy , in which poetic suggestiveness jostles with harsh realism , and a group of intimately related and particularly interesting characters hold our attention closely .

		Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	is at his best when writing romance with a historical background , and the present work is the best he has given us since his trilogy of novels dealing with the
Ameri	PERSON	- can Revolution .

		Mr.
David Graham Phillips	PERSON	'' has it in '' for the American woman .

		To readers of his earlier novels , this statement will not be a surprise , although most of them will probably gasp at the lengths to which the author has permitted himself to go in `` The Husband 's Story , '' his latest diatribe against the despised and abhorred sex .

		The following blossoms are culled from a single early chapter . ''

		As a rule , women systematically lie to their husbands about big things and little . '' ''

		Our women take incidental in - terest or no interest in their homes , in their husbands , in their children . '' ''

		The American woman fancies she is growing away from the American man .

		The truth is that while she is sitting still , playing with a lapf ul of the artificial flowers of fake culture , like a poor doodle-wit , the American man is growing away from her . '' ''

		The American woman is responsible for the dishonesty of American commercial life . '' ''

		Is there any line of serious endeavor in which an American woman is interesting and helpful and com - panionable to a man ? ''

		Later on , when the writer gets really warmed up to his task , the indictment is continued under other counts , so numerous and varied that we may at least admire the ingenuity that can think of so many mean things to say .

		Unfor - tunately , Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	has not the equipment of the Juvenal he would like to appear ; his generalizations are too sweeping to be impressive , and the incurable vulgarity of his expresssion excites nothing but dis - gust .

		Posing as an indignant satirist , he is in fact nothing more than a common scold .

		The particular story which he tells here -LRB- or has told for him in the first person -RRB- is so utterly untypical even of the pluto - cratic society which he holds up to reprobation , and is given us with such crude coloring and strident emphasis , that it can make no appeal to any order of intelligence higher than that which is moved by the revivalist exhorter or the writer of yellow editorials .

		Of course , there are many people of that low order of intelligence by whom he may be taken seriously , and to such he must look for his public .

		There is no more mischievous kind of writing than that which thus uses a moral purpose to cloak an unbridled sensationalism based upon a wild distortion of actual human character .

		Glimpses of BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS . ''

		The * & * the C0met S. T. C. '' a grand-niece was what some one once called the of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	.

		late
Mary E Coleridge	PERSON	, who said of herself , '' I have no fairy godmother , but lay claim to a fairy great-great-uncle . ''

		In the memoir pre - fixed to '' Gathered Leaves from the Prose of
Mary E. Coleridge	PERSON	'' -LRB- Button -RRB- Miss
Edith Sichel	PERSON	speaks of
Mary	PERSON	as the great-niece of
Samuel Taylor Coleridge	PERSON	, and of the latter as the great-uncle of
Mary	PERSON	.

		Whatever the exact degree of kinship , some - thing of the Coleridgean genius for both creative and critical work reappeared in the niece , whose short life of forty-six years -LRB- 1861-1907 -RRB- is memor - able to us for the novels , stories , essays , and poems that attested her lively imagination , her love of beauty , her warmth of feeling , and her pure delight in the creations of genius .

		To those who knew her personally she seems to have possessed , with all her shyness and whimsicality , great charm and many graces .

		The warmth of heart that made her the truest of friends was not inferior to the bright - ness of intelligence that enabled her to master Hebrew before she was nineteen and to become an early and ardent lover of Greek literature in the original .

		The short stories printed in '' Gathered Leaves '' are reproduced from '' The Cornhill Magazine '' and other sources , and , while they illus - trate her liveliness of fancy , her '' human insight and poetic oversight , '' they also prove the truth of the criticism that her genius lacked sufficient talent to render it adequate support .

		Abruptness and obscurity and lack of construction mar her fiction .

		Her poems , mostly short and of slight texture , do her better justice .

		In literary criticism she knows what is good and how to commend it .

		Examples of these three kinds of writing are presented by her editor , and also
Miss Coleridge	PERSON	's `` Notes of the Table Talk of
William Cory	PERSON	, '' the inspired teacher and erratic scholar of genius , as Miss

Oct. 16	DATE	, beautiful was her character , and these qualities mark the memorial volume edited with such loving sympathy by her friend .

		The application of the principles of and the irith .

		organic evolution to the explanation of human activities , especially those of a social character , is usually somewhat indirect and inferential .

		In a volume of the '' International Scientific Series '' bearing the title `` Tin - Evolution and Function of Living Purposive Matter '' -LRB- Apple - ton -RRB- , Professor
N. C. Macnamara	PERSON	attempts to make this application direct and specific .

		After tracing the structural evolution of the nervous system and the purposive behavior which this organ system subserves , through the animal series from Amoeba to man , the attempt is made to show that the activ - ities social , economic , and religious of a parti - cular group of the Irish people are the direct out - come of their evolutionary history .

		The result is interesting if not altogether convincing .

		The author 's argument is developed in the following way .

		Roughly the first two-thirds of the book is devoted to an analysis of the biological literature on the progres - sive evolution of the higher `` purposive '' types of animal behavior .

		Beginning with the simple reflex activities of unicellular organisms concerned in the getting of food and the avoidance of harmful situa - tions , it is shown that as we ascend the animal series there is a continual and gradual increase in com - plexity of behavior , culminating in the higher animals in '' conscious '' action .

		Associated with the increasing complexity of behavior is an increase in the complexity of the so-called '' purposive '' structural elements -LRB- nervous system -RRB- of the body .

		It is then maintained that the accumulated effect of this evolution in the case of the end product man leads to the result that '' the personal character or inherited instincts of human beings form a kind of substratum -LRB- unconscious -RRB- to their mental life , and constitute the real cause of most of their ac - tions . ''

		The last third of the book is given to an attempt to substantiate this claim by a detailed and very interesting account of the history of the Clan - cuilein Sept , a division of the Dalcasian tribe of Celts .

		Here the author is at his best .

		He writes of stirring events in a stirring way .

		One forgets the biological theory , which after all is rather intangible in its concrete application , in the joy of a well-told story of an interesting people .

		Incident of In hi '' ch * tty and rambling `` Acci - dente of an Antiquary 's Life '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- Mr.

Asia	LOCATION	Minor ,
Egypt	LOCATION	, and
Syria	LOCATION	.

		The most important achievement of his that these miscellaneous reminis - cences touch upon seems to have been the toilsome but richly remunerative exploration of the site of the great Artemisium , or
Temple of Diana	ORGANIZATION	, at
Ephesus	LOCATION	, which Wood , it * di-covi-rcr thirty years earlier , had left but partially explored .

		Gruesomely sensational are some passages of the author 's description of his tomb-hunting and body-snatching adventures in
Egypt	LOCATION	, when , crawling on all fours in the dark , one often found the passage barred by a heap of dim swaddled mummies turned out of their coffins by some earlier snatcher of bodies ; and over these one had to go , feeling their breast-bones crack under one 's knees and their swathed heads shift horribly this way or that under one 's hands .

		Lucky was the temerarious grave - robber to escape with his life and no treasure from a stifling burrow '' where rock was rotten and screes of loose chips , thrown down from plundered tombs above , might slip at any moment over the only channels of air and escape , and condemn us to the death of trapped rats in a most unworthy cause and most unpleasant company . ''

		The usual and highly acceptable accompaniment of pictures from photo - graphs , to the number of forty , is found in the vol - ume .

		As the informal record of a restless seeker for ancient relics , pursuing his quest somewhat in the spirit of the gamester or the mining prospector , the book is by no means so dry and dusty as the typical antiquary is supposed to be .

		Practical work Besides the repressive measures , in humane mainly in the nature of police duties , education .

		directed against cruelty to animals and to unprotected children , a greater need is for that educational work which will make repressive measures few or needless .

		Much has been done in this direction in the
last decade	DATE	, both by organiza - tions and individuals ; and much more is likely to be done in the future .

		In this noble work the name of
Henry Bergh	ORGANIZATION	stands preeminent in this country ; and it is fitting that Mr.
Roswell C. McCrea	PERSON	's ex - cellent report on '' The Humane Movement in
America	LOCATION	'' should have been '' prepared on the
Henry Bergh Foundation	ORGANIZATION	for the
Promotion of Humane Education	ORGANIZATION	in
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, '' and published at the
University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is a substan - tial one of 450 pages , and presents , besides a short biography of
Henry Bergh	PERSON	and an account of his work , a considerable amount of matter relating to similar activities in this country .

		We are surprised at the omission of the very important work of the
Humane Alliance	ORGANIZATION	, a chartered and still active organ - ization in
New York City	LOCATION	, founded and endowed by
Hermon Lee Ensign	ORGANIZATION	, a genuine lover and protector of animals , who at his death ten years ago left his entire estate , of something like two hundred thous - and dollars , to the cause of the
Humane Alliance	ORGANIZATION	.

		This society has done a remarkable work in the
last decade	DATE	in erecting marble drinking fountains , of artistic and serviceable design , costing about a thousand dollars each , in various towns , villages and cities throughout the country .

		Between one and two hundred of these beautiful fountains have now been given to the public or , rather , to thirsty

		THE DIAL 291 dogs and horses by this well-planned and well - administered benefaction .

		Some of Mr.
Ensign	PERSON	's writings occupy a creditable place in humane liter - ature , and should have been included in the ample bibliographies in this volume .

		We are glad to see the unmistakable utterance of Dr.
William James	PERSON	on the subject of animal vivisection given promin - ence here .

		The various State laws for the protec - tion of animals and children are summarized in a 96-page appendix .

		The work is a valuable one , and can be made still more so by a needed revision , should a new edition be called for .

		New glimpses Two mo f \ interesting and charming of a charming personalities are disclosed in the late perionaiitv .


Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	's volume en - titled `` Grover
Cleveland	LOCATION	: A Record of Friendship '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The term charming would have appeared absurd as applied to Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	fifteen years ago , so far as his personal self had become known to the world .

		He .

		was counted honest , cap - able , and obstinate ; he made enemies with the greatest ease , and seemed to have but few friends .

		His party was forced to accept him for its leader as the only man who had a chance to win , and did it with a wry face .

		But this stern , reserved , pugna - cious politician has been shown , since he retired to private life , to be a lovable man with charming so - cial qualities and what may almost be called a genius for friendship .

		Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's book is delightful in what it shows of his friend , and equally delightful in what it shows of himself , and the workmanship is that of the literary artist that we knew him to be .

		It consists of eighty-two brief anecdotes or sketches , most of them only a page or two long , with no connection except that each one illustrates some characteristic or quality or opinion or senti - ment of Mr.
Cleveland	LOCATION	; and there is not one of them that is trivial or over-laudatory in tone , or unillum - inating .

		As one reads he seems to be brought into personal acquaintance with the subject , and both admiration and love grow with the reading .

		Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	's foibles and idiosyncrasies are shown , but they only set off his manliness , his true dignity , and his greatness .

		His reputation is meeting the great test , that of steady growth ; unlike many who have stood high during their active lives , he stands higher in general esteem as more is known of him and as his career is studied .

		Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's beauti - ful little book will help on that growth and appre - ciation .

		Familiar letters A S eniu .

		8 for friendship and for eli - of mh century citing friendly letters from his absent celebritiei .

		friends seems to have belonged to
Sanderson Miller	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	, of Radway in
Warwick	LOCATION	- shire , man of letters , architect , and antiquary .

		`` An Eighteenth-Century Correspondence '' -LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , edited by Miss
Lilian Dickins	PERSON	and Miss
Mary Stanton	PERSON	, is made up of carefully preserved but never before published letters and parts of letters to
Miller	PERSON	from such men of note as the elder
Pitt	PERSON	, the
Lyttel	PERSON	- tons , the
Grenvilles	PERSON	,
Lord Dacre	PERSON	, the
Earls	LOCATION	of Guil - ford ,
Coventry	ORGANIZATION	, ' and
Hardwicke	PERSON	, and many others .

		A sufficient account of
Miller	PERSON	himself , with other editorial matter , is acceptably furnished by the careful editors .

		Inevitably there are many para - graphs , and even pages , in the four hundred and more of correspondence , that savor of the common - place .

		On the other hand an occasional new light is thrown on a historic character , as in
Pitt	PERSON	's play - ful and sprightly style of addressing his dear friend , which shows him to have been more genial and less stern and formal than our mental picture of the great man .

		To
Miller	PERSON	on the eve of a visit to Wroxton he writes : '' May the grand Landskip Painter , the Sun , spread his highest colouring o'er the sweet scene , and the fairest Naiad of the Lake frisk all her frolick Fancy at the
Cascade	ORGANIZATION	, and be , what you must ever think a pretty Girl , most charming in her Fall . ''

		From
Deane Swift	ORGANIZATION	, near kinsman and biographer of the
Dean of St. Patrick	ORGANIZATION	's , many lively letters are given .

		But the attractions of the book , to readers fond of familiar correspond - ence , are too many to specify in detail .

		By a natural and perhaps unconscious assimilation of eighteenth - century style , the editors allow themselves to use an occasional obsolete term , as in calling
Miller	PERSON	an '' antiquarian , '' and in referring to '' an Austrian General of Irish extract . ''

		The work is fully illus - trated and indexed .

		It is almost impossible for an Amer - ican to ex P ress his fi f fc impressions of
England	LOCATION	.

		In vain he tries to convey to his untravelled countrymen the effect of English landscape , with its smooth velvety enclos - ures , lush hedgerows , old-fashioned villages , grey church-towers , ancient farm and manor houses , stately castles , and winding white roads .

		He is forced to admit that our own rural districts are as substantially built upon , covered with virtually the same crops , laid out in fields of the English pattern , and diversified with about the same amount of woodland .

		Yet even apart from buildings ordinary , gracious , ornate
England	LOCATION	differs abso - lutely not only from our own country but from almost all others in the world , with a quality and prodigious contrast almost indescribable .

		It so hap - pens that the English shrine most visited by Amer - ericans , the birthplace of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is also in the heart of some of the most characteristic and beautiful of English scenery .

		Hence , many Amer - icans make their first , and sometimes their last , acquaintance with
England	LOCATION	by way of
Stratford	LOCATION	, on the banks of the river Avon .

		Accordingly , Mr.
A. G. Bradley	PERSON	's book entitled `` The Avon and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Country '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- bears a name to conjure with .

		Nevertheless , in his preface , the author acknowledges that he has given more space to the lower and less-known shores of the Avon than to the higher and more familiar reaches in the immediate
Stratford	LOCATION	district , and that he has done this with the transatlantic reader especially in mind .

		29-2 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, Even more consistently engaging , associated with more inspiring landscape and no less rich in historic association , is the
Avon	LOCATION	near its mouth than the
Avon	LOCATION	at its source .

		Beginning with
Tewkesbury	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	continues up-stream to
Bredon	LOCATION	,
Eves	LOCATION	- ham , and below the
Cotswolds	LOCATION	, with much historic detail and many alluring tales before reaching the town of
Stratford	LOCATION	and thence to
Warwick	LOCATION	,
Kenil	PERSON	- wortli , and Rugby .

		Even if the text were less engaging than it really is , no one could be insen - sible to the thirty charming illustrations in color by Mr.
A. R. Quinton	PERSON	.

		From the familiar view of
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	at
Stratford	LOCATION	, which serves as frontis - piece , to the quaint Bubbenhall Mill of the closing chapter on Rugby , these pictures are full of the intimate feeling for English scenery that is so diffi - cult to put into words .

		The inauguration of a series like KtSSSL Me - '' .

		Duffield 's Plays of To-day and To-Morrow '' is a significant sign of the times .

		It means that the play is growing popular , like play-going ; that people who do not go to the theatre insist upon having plays to read , while those who do go often hear something worthy of more than an evening 's casual attention .

		The series opens auspiciously with two volumes contain - ing Mr.
Rudolf Besier	PERSON	's '' Don , '' and Mr.
James Bernard Pagan	PERSON	's '' The Earth . '' ''

		Don '' was the modern light comedy offering on
last winter	DATE	's pro- gramme at the
New Theatre	ORGANIZATION	.

		The hero is a quix - otic young poet who , having taken a foolish wife away from her husband , brings her to his father 's house , where his fiancee and her family are visiting , with the pleasing expectation that everybody will understand and sympathize .

		The characters in the two older generations are all types , and all amusing .

		If the comedy verges towards farce , there is no hint of melodrama .

		The four leading figures are closely studied , the dialogue is by turns amusing and mov - ing , and the central situation sincerely and vividly presented .

		Like '' Don , '' '' The Earth '' is of En - glish origin our native drama seems to be more talked about than in evidence .

		It is a newspaper play based on the political aspirations of the head of a gigantic newspaper trust .

		Gaily ironic and brilliant is the presentation , vital the grip on real issues , masterly in utter absence of theatricality the denouement .

		Realism seems to be the note of the new school of dramatists truth to life , combined with a searching inquiry into life 's problems .

		It is to adherence to this tradition that `` Tin - Earth '' owes its success as a stage-play both in
London	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, and finally its place in a series like the one under discussion .

		Th , , torvo/an u > rhe History of the Telephone '' epoch-making -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , by that experienced his - torian of American inventions , Mr.
Herbert N. Casson	PERSON	, gives in three hundred highly readable pages an untechnical account of the birth , growth , and flourishing maturity of this indispens - able aid to quick communication .

		It was in a small machine shop in
Boston	LOCATION	, in the
summer of 1875	DATE	, that young
Alexander Graham Bell	PERSON	, professor of elocution and '' visible speech , '' hit on the missing mechanism to his device for producing audible speech at an indefinite distance from the speaker .

		It was because he was more of an acoustician than an electrician that he was able to accomplish what professional electricians had pronounced to be im - possible .

		Dr.
Clarence J. Blake	PERSON	, the noted
Boston	LOCATION	aurist , had given him the valuable suggestion of t In - human ear as a model to study and imitate in perfect - ing his instrument , and from this marriage of the two sciences of acoustics and electricity the hopeful offspring now known as the
Bell	ORGANIZATION	telephone was born .

		The stormy history of the
Bell Telephone Company	ORGANIZATION	, its winning of thirteen important law - suits , five of which were carried up to the
Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, and of nearly six hundred lesser suits , with only two trivial contract cases decided against it , and its enormous growth in prosperity and activity of recent years , are all related in sufficient detail .

		Some account , too , of the chief men who have nidoi in building up this powerful corporation is given , and portraits and other illustrations are provided in abundance .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Good health is simply a matter of physical and mental culture , declares Mrs.
Emily M. Bishop	PERSON	, with all the amplifications that this assertion implies , in a handy , buckram-bound volume entitled '' Daily Ways to Health '' -LRB-
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- , which she begs the reader to allow `` to be left around anywhere on the office desk , the kitchen shelf , the couch , the sewing table or the window seat , '' for hap-hazard perusal in spare momenta .

		Simple home gymnastics and breathing exercises , with helpful hints on the will to be well , '' make up the bulk of the book .

		Mrs.
Bishop	PERSON	is an experienced teacher of health ex - ercises , well known to Chautauqua pupils , and her doc - trine is one to which most of us give too little heed .

		The
Wisconsin History Commission	ORGANIZATION	publishes , as number three in its series of '' Original Papers , '' a small volume by Mr.
Theron W. Haight	PERSON	containing about all that can be learned concerning the careers of three broth - ers ,
Howard B.	PERSON	,
Alouzo H.	PERSON	, and
William B. Gushing	PERSON	.

		`` Three Wisconsin Cushings '' is the book 's title .

		The first of the three , after creditable service in the Civil War , distinguished himself in fighting the Apaches in
Arizona	LOCATION	, where he was killed in action in
1871	DATE	.

		The second was graduated from the
U. S. Military Academy	ORGANIZATION	and acquitted himself well as artillery officer in the Civil War , rising to lieutenant colonel and rendering conspicuous service at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, where he fell .

		The third brother received his training at the
U. S. Naval Academy	ORGANIZATION	, and served brilliantly throughout most of the Civil War , especially distinguishing himself by sinking the Confederate ironclad ,
Aibemarle	ORGANIZATION	.

		He continued in the
navy	ORGANIZATION	, with occasional promotions , until his death in
1874	DATE	at the
Government Hospital	ORGANIZATION	for the Insane .

		Por - traits , with facsimiles of letters , are provided , and the somewhat meagre annals attainable in regard to these brothers make a book of particular interest to war veterans .

JOSEPH VANCE	PERSON	. '' ''

		ALICE - FOR - SHORT . ''

		`` SOMEHOW GOOD . ''

		Etc. -RRB- tl .76 .

		This romance of the
17th century England	ORGANIZATION	shows a new phase of iu author 's undoubted genius .

		`` An artistic triumph .

		A novel unlike any other ever written in English .

		It is leisurely , without any of the defects of slowness , discursive without any of the disasters of incoherence , satirical without doing : injustice to humanity , and plausible without re - nouncing : the claims of fantasy .

		Moreover , for all it is a story of fearsome deeds and of fatality , its humor is so abundant and pervasive that there is not a shudder in any of its pares . ''

		Button
Tranter	PERSON	ifi .

		`` A better story than any of the others , so far as sustained interest is concerned ... I ts style is the rich , suggestive , highly meta - phorical style of the De Morgan we have known .

		` An Affair of Dishonor ' shines as a romance quite as much as '
Joseph Vance	PERSON	' does among realistic novels .

		There is not a dull line or vapid sentence .

		... Its psychological phases lend it a depth and vitality seldom found in a romance .

		It may easily become the most popular , for it is pure story throughout , rippling along from event to event on a dimpling stream of narrative as full of imagery as a forest book is of dancing shadows . ''

		Chicago Record -
Herald	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Of more than sufficient merit to make another reputation , this book will make a new circle of readers for him . ''

		Saturday Review -LRB-
London	LOCATION	-RRB- . ''

		In a way , especially by those who are not too fond of Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	's former manner , this latest book may be considered the triumph of his career . ''

		THE DIAL 305 The Office of a Publisher LL good literature uplifts and draws out , the best that is in humanity , office of the Publisher should be to further that aim .

		The Seventy - two years ago
John Cassell	PERSON	came to
London	LOCATION	with three half - pence in his pocket , but with high ideals .

		In
1848	DATE	he founded the
House of Cassell	ORGANIZATION	.

		Travelling widely through
England	LOCATION	he realized the cruelty of all taxes on knowledge . ''

		You can never be low , '' he said , '' unless you make yourself so by ignorance and vice . ''

		He made up his mind that knowledge should be placed within reach of the people . ''

		Let the people read and think ; let them have good and cheap books . ''

		Fifty-eight years ago
John Cassell	PERSON	's
National System of Education	ORGANIZATION	became famous .

		When the Great Exhibition of
1851	DATE	opened , the
Cassell Library of History	ORGANIZATION	, Biography , and Science was issued at
seven pence	MONEY	a volume .

		That same year he popularized Art by publishing '' The Magazine of Art , '' which became famous for notable editors like the late
W. E. Henley	PERSON	and Mr.
M. H. Spielmann	PERSON	.

		As a publisher ,
John Cassell	PERSON	's chief joy was in his work .

		His forthright sincerity of purpose beat down all obstacles .

		Endowed with strong common sense , he wasted no words on rhetoric ; a saving sense of humor helped him to avoid cranks .

		That the name of
Cassell	ORGANIZATION	appears on many books which have now become classics is an earnest of his literary judgment .

		A broad-minded man withal the world was his country .

		The friend of
Louis Kossuth	LOCATION	, he was on visiting terms with
Lurette	PERSON	and
Hachette	ORGANIZATION	, the French publishers .

		There was one thing he would not suffer gladly : the morbid and superficial in literature .

		What he demanded of a book was that it should be clean , sound , and honest literature .

		The
House of Cassell	ORGANIZATION	to-day aims to carry on that tradition .

		It aspires to purvey wholesome literature which shall be informing as well as entertaining .

		To this
House	ORGANIZATION	the word '' literature '' has a wide significance .

		It means not only supplying literary entertainment which is meant to amuse in the higher sense , fiction that bears the mark of good-humored sanity throughout , but educational works written by those best reputed to instruct in a phrase , every activity of the human family calculated to cultivate the best that is in them , '' the utmost for the highest . ''

		The
House	ORGANIZATION	to-day provides the sanest , soundest , and most wholesome of literary fare for all English-speaking readers .

		The sale , within two years , of 1,250,000 volumes of their '' People 's Library '' of 120 complete classics of fiction and literature , printed from a new and specially designed type and published at
25 cents	MONEY	per volume in cloth , and
60 cents	MONEY	in leather , represents a recent enterprise in keeping with the best traditions of the
House	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Life of Tolstoy By
Aylmer Maude Author	PERSON	of '' Tolstoy and his Problems , '' etc. .

		There is probably no one in
England	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	to-day so well qualified as Mr.
Maude	PERSON	to be a competent biographer of the great Russian idealist and teacher .

		Not merely has he , in company with his wife , under - taken the translation into English of the major portion of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's writings , but in addition he has had the advantage of knowing the Russian writer intimately for years , and of visiting him frequently .

		His plan , in the present work , has been so far as possible to allow
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's words to tell their own story .

		The result is a series of literary vignettes , admirable in point of style and particularly so in portraying those events and those mental developments which to the great writer himself have seemed of crucial importance .

		THE DIAL 315 NOW READY SIGURD A Poem By
ARTHUR PETERSON	PERSON	' 1 A HE story of
Sigurd	PERSON	, or Siegfried -LRB- of which the best-known versions are probably the old Nibelungenlied , and
Wagner	PERSON	's famous tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen -RRB- , is one of the most celebrated of the world 's epics .

		In the following version
Sigurd	PERSON	is depicted as a young Norse rover , a wanderer not only by land but by sea , this latter innovation seeming to lend itself quite naturally to the established legend .

		The action takes place about the middle of the fifth century , that eventful period which may be said to mark the end of the ancient , and the beginning of the modern world .

		The Hon.
RASMUS B. ANDERSON	PERSON	, formerly Professor of Scandinavian languages in the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	and Ex .

		U. S. Minister to
Denmark	LOCATION	, says of this book , in a letter to the author : '' The book is a gem ... Your language is simply brilliant and your metre perfect .

		What delightful reading !

		How I wish you would get millions of readers ; for
Sigurd	PERSON	and
Brynhild	PERSON	are our ancestral hero and heroine , and every American lad and lass should know the story by heart .

		You have surely rendered the public a distinct service , that should not fail of eminent appreciation . ''

		340 TWO POETS .

		When
Swinburne	PERSON	made his famous pilgrim - age to Landor in
Florence	LOCATION	, he spoke of it as a visit from '' The youngest to the eldest singer That
England	LOCATION	bore . ''

		When we learned that death had claimed on the same day -LRB-
October	DATE	IT -RRB- both Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	and Mr.
William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	, we could not refrain from thinking of them , in paraphrase , as The youngest and the eldest singer Our country bore .

		^ They were just half a century apart , for the one was in her ninety-second year , and the other in his forty-second only .

		The one died after a life of the ripest achievement ; the other was cruelly cut off , an '' inheritor of unfulfilled re - nown , '' not indeed before his genius had been amply declared , but before he had accomplished more than a small part of what the world ex - pected of him .

		The two lives offer tempting contrasts : woman and man , age and youth , East and West , past and present , the passion of a nation aflame with zeal for the rights of man , and the spectacle of the same nation , breathing an air grown thick and fat with avarice , brutally trampling upon those rights , and glossing its degradation with the cant phrases of a pinchbeck philanthropy , concealing its greed beneath the comfortable cloak of hypocrisy .

		We may not now enlarge upon these contrasts , for the present obligation is to set forth in a few words the lives and characters of these two notable figures in our literature , one of them almost the sole remaining figure from the swiftly receding old century , the other the most import - ant figure in our literature of the young new century .

		Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	was born in
New York	LOCATION	, but upon her marriage in
1843	DATE	removed to
Boston	LOCATION	, henceforth to be reckoned a
New Englander	LOCATION	in spirit and associations .

		Her life long devotion to philanthropic endeavor of the noblest sort , even more than her literary per - formance , made her the '' grand old woman '' of
America	LOCATION	, if we may call her old who was the end youthful in feeling , and , despite physic infirmity , active in all good works .

		Married to a man who had fought in the Greek war of liber - ation and had been
Byron	PERSON	's tent-mate , she gave 318 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, her own unstinted sympathies to all peoples struggling to be free , in turn to Hungarians and Italians and American slaves ; when these conflicts had faded into the past , she gave her - self with equally unstinted devotion to the less spectacular causes of prison reform and woman 's suffrage and the peace movement .

		She once summed up her career in these modest words : I have written one poem which , although composed in the stress and strain of civil war , is now sung
South and North	ORGANIZATION	by the champions of free government .

		I have been accounted worthy to listen and to speak at the
Boston Radical Club	ORGANIZATION	and at the
Concord School of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lastly and chiefly I have had the honor of pleading for the slave when he was a slave , of helping to initiate the woman 's movement in many states of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and of standing with the illustrious champions of justice and freedom for woman 's suffrage when to do so was a thankless office , involving public ridicule and private avoidance . ''

		Perhaps there is no more significant single fact in her biography than that she was the only woman elected to membership in the
National Institute of Arts and Letters	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	the poet , it seems to be fated that she should be remembered almost solely as the author of a single piece .

		This sort of memory , desirable but inadequate , is hers by virtue of '' The Battle Hymn of the Republic , '' which is undoubtedly one of the noblest lyrics of our Civil War .

		But she wrote other verse to the extent of several volumes , and in them the judicious may discover treasure-trove worthy to be contained in the casket that holds the one famous poem .

		She was also the author of a number of dramas and much miscellaneous prose , from her contributions to the early volumes of `` The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' to her `` Reminis - cences , '' published late in life .

		She came into contact with great numbers of people , both here and abroad , through her activity as a preacher in Unitarian pulpits and as an occupant of the lecture platform .

		Her last appearance in public was only a few days before her death , when
Smith College	ORGANIZATION	honored her with its highest degree , bestowed upon her with the following words : ''
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	, poet and patriot , lover of letters and learning , advocate for over half a century , in print and living speech , of great causes of human liberty , sincere friend of all that makes for the elevation and enrichment of womanhood ; who having in former yean 4 read a fiery gospel , writ in burnished rows of steel , ' quickened in the nation the imperishable faith in the triumph of beneficent right and the ardor of sacrifice for its winning ; to whom now in her serene , gracious , and venerated age we offer felicitation and pay grateful homage . ''

		And when the ceremony was ended , the whole assembly rose and sang the `` Hymn . ''

		and the whole affair is pleasant to think about in our time of mourning .

		The feeling that a noble life has been fully rounded out enables us to accept with something like equanimity the loss of such a writer as Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	.

		But the loss of such a man as Mr.
Moody	PERSON	is well-nigh intolerable .

		He had given us only ten years of creative work , and should liave been good for twenty or thirty in addition .

		More - over , his work was of such quality that it had already made him the foremost figure among our younger poets the most remarkable appear - ance in the American literature of the twentieth century .

		He alone , or almost alone , spoke in our time with the authentic accent of the great elder singers , and brought back into poetry the high seriousness and lofty utterance of the mas - ters .

		That such a force should cease , that such an inspiration should thus untimely fail , is cause for the most poignant regret .

		It is hard to become reconciled to an ordering of human affairs that frustrates such endeavor as was his , and dashes such hopes as were ours in the pres - ence of so fair a promise .

		The story of Mr.
Moody	PERSON	's life is briefly told .

		He was born in a small
Indiana	LOCATION	town in
1869	DATE	, was graduated from
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1898	DATE	, was for a time an instructor at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and was then called to the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		There he did active work until
1907	DATE	, afterwards retain - ing only a nominal connection with the institu - tion .

		Happily married a little more than a year ago , he was soon thereafter attacked by the insidious malady that was to prove fatal , and the closing chapter of his life was a record of efforts and wanderings in the vain pursuit of health .

		It was a desperate fight for life , and it ended a fortnight ago in
Colorado	LOCATION	.

		The decade of Mr.
Moody	PERSON	's literary produc - tiveness has enriched our literature with two superb poems in dramatic form , '' The Masque of Judgment '' and `` The Fire-Bringer , '' with two prose dramas written for the actual stage , `` The Great Divide '' -LRB- at first called `` The Sabine Woman '' -RRB- and '' The Faith Healer , '' and with a volume of '' Poems '' that contains one of the noblest odes in the English language , and a number of lyrics that will henceforth be included in every `` golden treasury '' of
Kn	ORGANIZATION	^ lish poetry .

		To th - journeyman work of literature he contributed an essay on
Milton	LOCATION	, introductory to the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	'' edition of the poet , and a text-book of English literature -LRB- written in collaboration with Mr.
K. M. Lovett	PERSON	-RRB- for the use of schools .

		This is the sum total of Mr.
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 319
Moody	ORGANIZATION	's work , except for a few uncollected periodical writings , and whatever manuscripts he may have left behind him .

		Of this work , the immortal part will be found in the verse rather than the prose . ''

		The Great Divide '' made an astonishing success upon the stage , and is the one production by which the author became known to the general public .

		It is a fine play , one of the best produced in our time ; but a scale of absolute values must reckon it comparatively unimportant by the side of '' The Masque of Judgment '' and '' The Fire - Bringer . ''

		These two poems were planned to constitute -LRB- together with an unwritten third -RRB- a trilogy of human destiny , and the deepest of our present sorrows is that he could not have lived to complete the work .

		The wonder of these poems is that with a mythological or fan - tastic framework , and with a beauty of expres - sion now wistful and now sublime , challenging comparison with the measures of
Milton	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	, suggesting even in their largeness of conception the world-poems of '' The Divine Comedy '' and ''
Faust	PERSON	, '' they are neither imita - tive studies nor antiquarian revivals , but are fairly throbbing with the vital issues of the modern consciousness .

		The reader who does not feel this to be their essential characteristic will peruse them in vain .

		No American poet , old or young , has penned finer lines than those of this apostrophe to mankind : '' O Dreamer !

		O Desirer !

		Goer down Unto untravelled seas in untried ships !

		O crusher of the unimagined grape On unconceived lips !

		O player upon a lordly instrument No man or god hath had in mind to invent ; O cunning how to shape
Effulgent Heaven	ORGANIZATION	and scoop out bitter Hell From the little shine and saltness of a tear ;
Sieger	PERSON	and harrier Beyond the moon , of thine own builded town , Each morning won , each eve impregnable , Each noon evanished sheer ! ''

		For certain of the poems such as ''
Glou	PERSON	- cester Moors , '' `` A Grey Day , '' and `` At
Assisi	LOCATION	'' one must reserve a peculiar tender - ness of affection ; but the great feature of the volume is that `` Ode in Time of Hesitation '' which scourges as with scorpions the recreant
America	LOCATION	of our wanton Spanish war and our Philippine conquest , and our shameless repu - diation , by the dark deeds done a decade ago , of the sacred principles upon which the Republic was founded .

		In some fairer time to come , when we shall have rehabilitated our national character by what restitution and atonement are yet possible , when '' The cup of trembling shall be drained quite , Eaten the sour bread of astonishment , '' when '' With ashes of the hearth shall be made white Our heads , and wailing shall be in the tent , '' it will be gratifying to turn to this poem , and to realize that in our blackest hour genuine Americanism found one voice equal to the task of expressing all the passionate indignation aroused in patriotic breasts by the misstep that turned our faces from the shining mountain upon which our old ideals were set , and left us battening upon a pestilential moor .

		ORIGINALITY IN LITERATURE .


James Payn	PERSON	, the novelist , told the story of an old English scholar who insisted that all modern literature was contained in Pindar . ''

		What ! ''

		asked Mr.
Payn	PERSON	, '' you do n't mean to say that
Browning	PERSON	's 4 Ring and the Book , ' is in Pindar ? '' ''

		Yes , '' said the scholar , '' in the highest and truest sense ; the ' Ring and the Book ' is implicit in Pindar . ''

		Without going as far as this , it may be asserted that real originality is a very rare bird .

		It is not a question of the invention or discovery of new material .

		The first part of ' `` Faust '' is a patchwork of plagiarisms .

		Almost everything in it is begged , borrowed , or stolen from various sources .

		Yet it is the most original master-work of modern times .

		Nor is originality a question of who wrote the first play or novel , or who heralded romanticism or realism .

		There have probably always been plays and novels ; the ancients had their romanticists and realists .

		JEschylus was banished from
Athens	LOCATION	as a revolutionary , as irreverent to the gods ; and wise heads wagged over
Euripides	LOCATION	' new notions and his break with tradition .

		Aristophanes and Plautus and Petronius plunged as deep into realism as any modern .

		Nor is this thing originality a matter of literary superiority or inferiority .

		Many writers are great who are not original , and others have a kind of originality wha are doubtful in their greatness .

		Milton and
Keats	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	are in the first class , and
Blake	PERSON	and
Browning	PERSON	in the second .

		Gray and
Arnold	LOCATION	and
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	can hardly be called original poets at all ; but how great they are !

		Nor does the advocacy of isms and causes and movements , all warranted brand-new by their makers , constitute originality .

		Pretty much all that can affect mankind has been threshed out again and again .

		There have been
Schillers	PERSON	and Shelleys in every age . ''

		I have known twenty leaders of revolt , '' says the old Cardinal in
Browning	ORGANIZATION	's play .

		Nor do new views of morality , pronouncements of independ - ence , make for originality .

		Moses may break the tablets of the law , but they always come together THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, again , as
Milton	LOCATION	's angels , divided by sword or cannon shot , reunite .

		Not even temperament and personality , and the manner of looking at things and the style and way of work arising from them , are sure breeders of originality , though they come nearest of all to being so .

		Human nature is cast in types , and it is doubt - ful if there are as many distinct varieties as there are letters of the alphabet .

		Of course , as there are no two leaves in a forest exactly alike , there are minor differences in men and women ; and it is to these that literature owes its variety and inexhaust - ibleness .

		But they are hardly distinct enough to constitute complete originality .

		Milton reproduced ^ Bschylus and
Dante	LOCATION	;
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	repeats Menander and
Horace	PERSON	and
Hafiz	LOCATION	.

		The truest originality is perhaps what is called in biology a sport a variation by which life develops in an unexpected direction .

		Or it is as if a new and powerful element were suddenly introduced into the world , making all the other elements change their relations , producing strange and spectacular reactions .

		In literature it produces something which is not in
Pindar	ORGANIZATION	, something which , while not greater than the stock work of the world , is novel and charm - ing , and possesses a power to compel men to follow after it Of this kind of originality it seems to me there are three great examples in English literature : the Shakespearian comedy ,
Sterne	PERSON	's ''
Tristram Shandy	PERSON	, '' and
Coleridge	PERSON	's best poems , the four great pieces on which his fame rests .

		There are , of course , many other lesser exhibitions of this quality
Burns	PERSON	's and
Shelley	PERSON	's poetry , the essays of
Hazlitt	PERSON	, the
Bronte	PERSON	novels , to name a few .

		None of these , however , are as unique and powerful in their action as those I have first named .

		In tragedy , in tragic poetry ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	must take his chances with a half-dozen other poets .

		He is certainly not greater here than the author of the Book of Job , or Homer , or .

		ZEschylus , or
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		He does the same kind of work that these do , in much the same way , and to the same effect And this kind of work is doubtless the most important that man has ever done .

		An attempt has been made recently in
America	LOCATION	to displace these master minds of the world whose works include ethics as they include all other human interests in favor of the professed moralists and ethical writers .

		This is very much as if we should thrust aside the great painters the Angelos , the Titian s , the Rembrandt * , who have painted us the picture of all life and set up in their places the industrious artisans who have drawn us our maps .

		Even in
Hamlet	LOCATION	, '' where Shakespeare 's tragedy seems most novel , and in which his influence has been so great as almost to shadow the modern world , he has been anticipated .

		Prometheus and Orestes are ancient prototypes of that character , and perhaps
Don Quixote	PERSON	has carried it to a higher power .

		But
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's comedies are things apart .

		In them a dreamer is either looking forward with eager eyes , over-estimating the beauty and splendor and goodness of the world , or else he has retired in disenchanted disgust into the fortress of his own soul which he furnishes with visions to console him for the disappointments of outward fate .

		In either case he has produced a new world , an orb within the earth .

		Only in the
Nausicaa	LOCATION	scenes in Homer , or in
Kalidasa	LOCATION	's Shakuntala , had there been a touch of the same creation . ''

		The Tempest , '' ''
Midsum	PERSON	- mer Night 's Dream , '' ''
Twelfth Night	PERSON	, '' '' As You Like It , '' `` Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' `` Much Ado about Nothing , '' `` Cymbeline , '' `` The
Winter	DATE	's Tale , '' what is there in all literature to compete with this complete and perfect world of ideal beauty and magnificence ?

		The effect of this magical creation has been over - whelming .

		Poets and novelists in crowds have followed the shining Shakespearian track .

		Scott , who decanted
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	into his own bottles ,
Goethe	PERSON	, Hugo in his plays , Musset ,
Tennyson	PERSON	, how much of all that is distinguished and delightful in modern literature bears the impress of Shake - speare 's work .

		In particular , the latter may almost be said to have created woman , or , rather , he interposed between the eyes of men and the real , faulty , though still interesting creature , the splendid or poignant visions of his perfect mates of men .

		And ever since , men have been falling in love with his creations or those propagated by his followers by cuttings from the plays .

		Women know very well that there is no such being as the Shakespearian woman .

		The girls of
Jane Austen	PERSON	are the keenest and cleverest satire on their sex .


Sterne	PERSON	's originality certainly does not exist in his materials .

		The germ idea of his work conies from the
Martinus Scriblerus	PERSON	of Pope , Swift , and
Arbuthnot	PERSON	The two central characters have more than a reflection of
Don Quixote	PERSON	and his
Squire	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sterne imitated Rabelais and other French humorists .

		Yet when all was done the work was revealed as startlingly original .

		It almost deserves
Mark Pattison	PERSON	's praise of it as the most perfect piece of pure humor in the world .

		Its effect in English literature has been diffusive rather than concen - trated .

		Most later humorists have had a Shandean touch ; but few have been full initiates .

		THE DIAL 321
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's poetry is the most absolutely original thing in English literature .

		Shakespeare in his comedy took his raw materials from Lodge and
Greene	PERSON	and Lyly , and from the Italian novelists .

		But except some hints from old English ballads , or from German works on Demonology and Witch - craft ,
Coleridge	PERSON	's great pieces '' The Ancient Mariner , '' ''
Christabel	PERSON	, '' ''
Kubla Khan	PERSON	, '' and `` Gen - evieve '' are without parentage , celestial estrays , as it were , descended in a dream .

		In conception , tone , phrase , music , they are flawless .

		Language obtains in them to a simple perfection beyond the reach of conscious art .

		That they have nothing to do with life as it is lived , that they are further removed from the world of prose than even Shake - speare 's comedy , is no fault , rather it makes them full examples of what we dimly discern to be ideal poetry .

		And the influence of these poems has been com - mensurate with their worth .

		Before `` Christabel '' was published , it was imitated by
Scott	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	, and
Shelley	PERSON	.

		A good part of
Keats	PERSON	is pure
Coleridge	PERSON	. ''

		La Belle Dame Sans Merci '' is almost as good as ''
Genevieve	PERSON	, '' but it is palpably an imitation .

		The fragment of '' The Eve of St. Mark '' is a milder ''

		The Eve of
St. Agnes	LOCATION	'' is drenched with
Coleridge	PERSON	's glamor and color .

		Keats is indeed the unrivalled mocking-bird of literature .

		He could take anyone 's note
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's ,
Milton	PERSON	's , Dry - den 's ,
Collins	PERSON	's ,
Chatterton	PERSON	's and return it back with the truest ring , yet embellished with variations which make the strain his own .

		More recently ,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	,
Rossetti	PERSON	, and many others , have continued the Coleridgean tradition .

		As a long-time champion of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	, I will not be sus - pected of depreciating his originality .

		In comparison with other American writers , or even his English contemporaries , he is an explorer and a discoverer .

		But his relations to
Coleridge	PERSON	are those of a pupil to a master .

		He is more vigorous and versatile .

		He left fifty masterpieces where
Coleridge	PERSON	left but four .

		He is more profound in his appeal to human passions and emotions more vEschylean in his handling .

		But the fact remains that his work is inconceivable without the previous existence of that of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	, and he never quite matched his teacher in loveliness , magic , or thrilling awe .

		It is obvious , I think , that originality is not a prime literary requisite .

		Everything is in
Pindar	LOCATION	which is really necessary for us , love of the gods , of country and of home , heroism , disdain of death or meanness , activity of mind and body .

		The great and permanent works of mankind are too true to be very new .

		Everything over is in the nature of a luxury : something outside of our staple diet .

		We do not boast of having soup and roast beef and bread for dinner , though there is nothing better ; if we get terrapin and ptarmigan and rare
Madeira	LOCATION	we may be betrayed into enthusiasm .

		The writer who has this gift of originality is more followed than any other .

		He bears a branch of holly in his hands which draws the crowd after him , which presses near him to discern his secret .

		It is really not truth that he deals in , but enchantment . ''

		Weave a circle round him thrice , And close your eyes with holy dread , For he on honey-dew hath fed , And drunk the milk of Paradise . ''

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE DISPERSAL OF A GREAT LIBRARY will OCCUr in
February	DATE	next , when the collection of the late
Robert Hoe	ORGANIZATION	will be sold by the
Anderson Auction Company	ORGANIZATION	in
New York City	LOCATION	.

		The Hoe library is said to be not only the largest private library in existence , but probably the largest and most valu - able ever collected by a private citizen .

		Its estimated value is
$ 1,500,000	MONEY	.


Robert Hoe	PERSON	was born in
New York	LOCATION	in
1839	DATE	, and lived to the age of seventy , dying last year in
London	LOCATION	after a long and successful business career as a printing-press manufacturer and inventor .

		When only nineteen years of age he be - came interested in the history and development of printing , and at that early age began to buy books on the subject , constantly improving his library by substituting better copies than those already in his possession .

		Shortly before his death Mr.
Hoe	PERSON	issued the final volume of his Library Catalogue .

		This is now complete in fifteen octavo volumes , and de - scribes 6,993 titles of English literature ; 6.574 titles of books printed in foreign languages , includ - ing his marvellous collection of Incunabula , crowned by a copy of that great treasure , the first book printed with movable types , the
Bible	LOCATION	on vellum , issued from
Gutenberg	ORGANIZATION	's press at
Moguntia	LOCATION	be - tween
1450	DATE	and
1455	DATE	; also a list of Books of Emblems of 463 titles .

		The collection includes the finest copy in existence of
Higden	PERSON	's `` Polychronicon , '' printed by
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	in
1482	DATE	, a perfect copy of
Malory	ORGANIZATION	's `` Morte d' Arthur '' in the
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	edition of
1485	DATE	, and
Gower	PERSON	's `` Confessio Amantis '' of
1483	DATE	.

		There are also many examples of the earliest presses of
Germany	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	,
Books of Hours	ORGANIZATION	,
Aldines	PERSON	and Elzevirs , thousands of volumes devoted to the literature of
France	LOCATION	, many examples of early English literature , particularly of the
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan period , including Shakespeare folios , the splendid
Chaucer Collection	ORGANIZATION	, the
Kilmarnock Burns	PERSON	with an inserted letter , Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	's own copy of the Prayer Book , such rare Americana as all three Latin editions of
Columbus	LOCATION	's first letter , all printed in
1493	DATE	,
Denton	LOCATION	's
New York	LOCATION	-LRB- 1670 -RRB- in perfect condition uncut , Eden 's '' Decades , '' and a little pamphlet of four leaves from the press of
Stephen Daye	PERSON	'' in
Cambridge	LOCATION	in
New England	LOCATION	'' of the `` Proceedings betwixt the English and the Narrow gansets '' -LRB- 1645 -RRB- .

		At the time of his death Mr.
Hoe	PERSON	was preparing a catalogue of his illumin - ated and other manuscripts on vellum and paper , of which he has over 130 single titles , the most im - -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, portant of which is doubtless an English manuscript of the fifteenth century called `` The Pembroke Hours , '' written for
William Herbert	PERSON	, first
Earl of Pembroke	ORGANIZATION	, about
1440	DATE	.

		THE ADVENT OF THE COLLEGE-BRED JOURNALIST was hailed with scoffs and jeers in certain quarters , and with applause in others .

		Professor
Frank W. Scott	PERSON	, in charge of the courses leading to journalism at
the University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, has some interesting things to say about `` College Training for Jour - nalism '' in a late number of `` The Independent '' `` Twenty-five or thirty years ago , '' he writes , `` a college training was a handicap to the young man applying for a job as reporter .

		A
Yale	ORGANIZATION	graduate , now the oldest reporter on a great
Chicago	LOCATION	daily , secured his present job , he asserts , only by conceal - ing the blot on his educational ` scutcheon .

		He was the only college man in the reporters ' room then ; now there are but two in the room who are not col - lege men , and neither of those is the city editor . ''

		Encouraging has been the recent growth of '' intel - ligent public interest in the press as an institution .

		Journalism has long been a profession that everyone out of it could improve if he were in it .

		and every - one in it could improve if he did not have to stay in it . ''

		It has been not inaptly said that the chief use of a college education in general is to prove to the college man how short a distance his academic training will carry him in the great outside world .

		Probably even the best of schools of journalism turn out graduates who will learn , with the sadness that often accompanies an access of wisdom , that they do not yet '' know it all , '' or even the quarter part of it .

		... THE PARTNERSHIP NOVEL , or work of fiction exe - cuted by two collaborating writers , such as Mr. and Mrs.
Egerton Castle	ORGANIZATION	and Mr. and Mrs.
C. N. Williamson	PERSON	are now abundantly producing , and such as Messrs.
Besant	PERSON	and Rice and Messrs.
Erck	PERSON	- mann and Chatrian used to favor us with , must always seem to some readers less satisfying , less `` convincing , '' than the work of literary art con - ceived by one mind in a moment of inspiration , and finished by one hand ere the flush of that first enthusiasm has faded from the cheek .

		The appear - ance of two authors ' names on a novel 's title-page is a virtual confession that the plot has been labor - iously pieced together by two workmen in consul - tation , that each chapter has been deliberately as - signed to this or that one of the literary firm , that the fate of each character has been wordily dis - cussed and finally determined , and that after the patchwork has at last been completed a finishing hand has had to go over it all to pull out the bast - ing threads and fell the seams .

		Such work must lack unity and homogeneity .

		What lover of
Steven	PERSON	- son has ever thoroughly enjoyed the stories he wrote in collaboration with his stepson ?

		A recent literary letter from
London	LOCATION	suggests that an interesting book might be written about literary partnerships .

		An instructive inquiry might indeed be made into the comparative success of one-author and two-author novels .

		Is there a single first-rate novel of double authorship ?

		... THE SEASON 'S PROSPECTS IN THE BOOK BUSINESS interest others beside booksellers .

		Promise of a brisk demand for good reading is always a gratify - ing indication that the cause of civilization is not a losing one ; and it is pleasant to learn from
London	LOCATION	, the great centre of trade for books printed in our language , as well as for some other commodities , that there is every likelihood of a record-breaking season in the production and dispensing of literature .

		At any rate , publishers ' autumn announcements were never superior in quantity , while as to quality they certainly inspire hope of many good things to be forthcoming .

		So much in the way of supply implies confidence in the demand . ''

		A market for products is products in market , '' as that famous political economist and free-trader , Professor
Perry	PERSON	of
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	, used to teach his classes .

		That purchasers will not be lacking when the goods are displayed , is to be hoped , and , for certain reasons , to be predicted .

		Our material prosperity leaves not a very great deal to be desired at least among the book-reading classes ; and after the inevitable Christmas purchases of jewelry and motor-cars and similar toys and knickknacks have been made , there ought to be a handsome surplus left for the things of the intellectual life including , first and fore - most , books and plenty of them .

		... SPECIALIZING IN LIBRARIES is very sure to in - crease with the increasing spread of printed matter over all departments of human interest and activity .

		The professions and the trades have each its con - siderable and ever-growing volume of technical lit - erature , and the time will come , if it be not already here , when few libraries for the general public can undertake to meet the demand for books and peri - odicals of this special character .

		This matter , in some of its bearings at least , will come under dis - cussion at the meeting of the
Special Libraries Association	ORGANIZATION	to be held in the
Boston Chamber of Commerce	ORGANIZATION	on the llth of
November	DATE	.

		Other sub - jects announced for treatment by various speakers are , '' The
Chamber of Commerce Library	ORGANIZATION	and the Facilities it Affords , '' '' The Statistical Department of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	and What it Offers the Business Man , '' `` The Earning Power of Libraries , '' and the question of
Boston	LOCATION	's need of a business and professional men 's branch to its public library .

		Various special and business libraries in
Boston	LOCATION	will be visited by the attending members between the afternoon and the evening sessions .

		... RAW MATERIAL FOR ROMANCE presents itself on every side to the eye trained in discovering it .

		A choice bit of such material , containing fine possi - bilities for the novelist or the playwright , is now waiting to be converted into tin - finished product .

		A few weeks ago there was married in
Washington	LOCATION	a couple who separated within an hour of their nup -
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 323 tials , presumably intending never to meet again .

		Miss
Eugenie Sauer	PERSON	, of
Vienna	LOCATION	, found herself heiress to a fortune left her by an old uncle in her native land , but with a strange proviso attached to the legacy .

		Only by becoming a wife within forty-eight hours of receiving word of her inheritance could she hope to become its actual possessor .

		Being without any particular matrimonial intentions , the thrifty heiress advertised for a temporary husband , offering two hundred dollars for his services at the altar in the capacity of a bridegroom , and stipulating that he should desert her immediately after the wedding .

		A man -LRB- if such he be worthy of being called -RRB- was selected from the large number of those who an - swered the advertisement , and as soon as the mock marriage was performed he abandoned the woman whom he had just promised to love and cherish until death should part the two .

		But as he had previously promised to break this latter promise , possibly a casuist could make out something of a case in his defense , and also in hers .

		At any rate , here is ma - terial for a new romance under the old title , '' Maid , Wife , or Widow ? ''

		... THE GROWING MARKET FOR READING-MATTER one need not call it all literature ought to be encour - aging to the large class of those who earn their liv - ing by plying the pen or pounding the type-writer .

		Note the new and cheap illustrated magazines con - tinually springing into being ; and although many of them soon subside again into non-being , the total result is an astonishing increase in the number of periodicals clamoring , not so very unsuccessfully , for popular patronage .

		The modern news-stand , with its polychromatic display of interest-compelling magazines , is a very different thing from the news - stand of fifty or even twenty-five years ago .

		And material , more or less literary , has to be found to fill all these competing publications , which have learned to rely with considerable confidence on the pecuniary support of the advertiser to keep them - selves afloat .

		By a beautiful interplay of differing interests , the safety-razor and the cigarette help to circulate the poem and the love-story ; and while commerce thus generously subsidizes dubious liter - ature , an additional subsidy is granted by the gov - ernment in the cheap rates of postage for all period - icals , circulating between
Maine	LOCATION	and
California	LOCATION	, between
Canada	LOCATION	and
Mexico	LOCATION	, and even to the dis - tant islands of the
East	LOCATION	.

		It is no wonder that foreigners envy us our vast literary market .

		THE first number of a new monthly periodical called '' The Crisis , '' planned as an organ of the
National Association	ORGANIZATION	for the
Advancement of Colored People	ORGANIZATION	, will appear from
New York	LOCATION	early this month .

		The periodical will be edited by Dr.
W. E. Burghardt	PERSON	Du -

		THE '' JOURNALIZED SHORT STORY '' AGAIN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Perhaps `` journalized '' is as convenient a label as any for ticketing the brand of short fiction which fills the pages of American periodicals and evidently harrows the soul of your correspondent in your issue of
October 1	DATE	.

		My own soul , it seems , or at least that portion of it which is concerned with its inheritance of letters , is made of less friable stuff ; for not a scratch mars its cheerful surface , despite the fact that I agree with him in regarding the bulk of the short stories published to - day as wholly undistinguished .

		Undistinguished : is n't that a word which goes to the root of the matter ?

		For , after all , the trouble is con - stitutional rather than local .

		A story , long or short , may be as sensational as you please , may fairly drip with smeared-on color , or be a hurly-burly of incident , to the exclusion of characterization and atmosphere , and still hold a kernel of literary -LRB- which in the end means only lasting -RRB- worth .

		Dumas ,
Dickens	LOCATION	,
Kipling	LOCATION	, Field - ing ,
Charles Reade	PERSON	,
Wilkie Collins	PERSON	, there 's a plentiful array of men whose personal attractiveness makes their faults seem of small account .

		But when a story has no personality at all , is simply one more yard cut off the bolt and hemmed -LRB- a fair description of our current fiction -RRB- , its fate is sealed , whether or no it violate the canons .

		But why get excited over that ?

		The mass of all the stuff that blackened good white paper since What-ever - his-name-was stumbled on the seductive art of printing , has been equally undistinguished .

		Shall we therefore devote ourselves to lamenting the artistic sterility of our times ?

		What a set of lamentful Jeremiahs that would make of us !

		And why blame the good newspaper men who have gone to making magazines ?

		To be sure , they also make a wider market than ever was before for the stuff we are talking of .

		But what is the connection between them and the dearth of literature ?

		Literature has never been dependent on magazines to get itself printed .

		It always manages to stagger through to the light somehow , and soon or late people learn of it .

		So , if a man comes in our day with something really worth while to say and the everlasting knack of saying it , he '11 manage to get it out without help or hindrance of all the editors between here and the ultimate bourne of editors .

		That will be literature .

		And while we are waiting for him if we have nothing else to do surely we may amuse ourselves with reading rattling good yarns ; and no one , so far as I can see , will be the worse for it , while publisher and writer will be the better off by our dimes .

		That , dear Mr.
Editor	PERSON	, is my feeling about the condition of which your correspondent speaks .

		I wish I had leisure and you had patience for a little closer analysis of his position .

		For he seems to me to exhibit both the excellences and the defects of the academic spirit , an admirable keeper of what is already proved to be good , but a somewhat stolid listener to unidentified applicants for approval , tending to judge them by very rigid standards .

		Witness the hushed tones in which he speaks of certain stuff as `` literary '' ; the placid assurance with which he sets down the writ - ing of short narrative as '' an art which should be deli - cate and graceful , though strong '' -LRB- how Meredith would have snapped a phrase and a notion like that at the end 324 TIIK DIAL -LSB-

		MAKING HISTORY INTERESTING .

		-LRB- To the Editor of TUB DIAL . -RRB-

		To the pleading of Dr.
Crothers	PERSON	and Professor Trent that '' History should be interesting , '' Professor
Charles Woodward Hutson	PERSON	adds , in THE DIAL for
October 1	DATE	, the advice that modern students of history should go back for their model to
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, whose vastness of knowledge was happily combined with a wonderful style and with the ability to give us '' a sense of con - tinuity that assures us of our being a part of the Divine Plan . ''

		Incidentally , Professor
Hutson	PERSON	takes a shot at our modern doctors ' theses , and the misguided unfortu - nates who perpetrate them .

		In the minds of those who present this point of view there seems to us to lie a serious misapprehension .

		The men of letters seem to have a lurking suspicion that the historical workers have formed a Union for the Promo - tion of Uninteresting English .

		This is really not the case : we do not know of a single uninteresting writer of history who would not like to write as Macaulay wrote , if he could .

		But , unfortunately , this is not a matter of will , but a matter of genius ; and if the younger generation of American students of history were to try literally to copy
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's style , the result would be the same as that which Professor
Hutson	PERSON	tells of in the case of imitators who immediately succeeded the mas - ter , who `` made that facile , forcible , uncompromising style a disgust to many . ''

		Leaving out the question of personal endowments , however , we agree with Professor
Hutson	PERSON	that much historical work is expressed in unnecessarily bad English .

		But does this indictment lie against writers of history only ?

		or is the criticism to be applied to all forms of what may be called learned writing ?

		In this matter of style , are doctors ' theses in English much superior to those in history ?

		We have heard of one , at least , accepted by a leading university , which is nothing more or less than a catalogue of books ; a compilation which does not give much opportunity for the divine style of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	.

		So perhaps it is the doctoral dissertation , and not history , that is at fanlt .

		If this is so , is it a necessary evil ?

		The fact that some theses are much better written than others , and that the dissertations of the French , for example , show a commendable degree of form with - out deficiencies in scholarship , would seem to afford room for the hope that , with better school and college instruction in English , the careless and inaccurate writing of the average graduate student may improve .

		But we doubt whether even a great improvement in this respect would meet the criticisms of Professor
Hutson	PERSON	and those who share his views .

		They have a grievance against the modern-trained student of history which goes deeper than mere split infinitives or incorrect paragraphing .

		The fundamental difference in view-point may , we think , be expressed somewhat as follows : Our critics insist upon regarding the doctor 's disser - tation as something which , intending to be literature , fails through negligence and lack of literary ideals .

		The historical students , however , would reply to the effect that the doctor 's dissertation makes no claim to be literature .

		It is not written for public consumption .

		It is printed and published -LRB- or ought to be -RRB- that its eon - tents may not escape the criticism , not of men-of-letters , but of experts in the field which the thesis covers .

		Except for the needs of these specialists , the whole importance of the thesis lies not in its interest to those who read it , but in what has gone before , in the produc - tion of it .

		It should stand as witness of the fact that , for at least once in his life , the student has left the beaten track and worked in the fields with the raw > tutV .

		He is very fortunate indeed if he succeeds in making some important contribution to knowledge ; but success in this respect is not the raison d'etre of his work .

		It is not the result , but the methods , not the gift to the world , but the discipline of the man , which is the end in view .

		Having given utterance to this literary heterodoxy , we are glad to revise the statement somewhat .

		It is neither desirable nor necessary that a man should spend his life in writing dissertations ; the production of theses is not all the work of historical students .

		The scientific method once established -LRB- our apologies to Professor
Hutson	PERSON	for the use of the term ! -RRB-

		the writer of History should not forget the art of literature .

		The implication of Professor
Hutson	PERSON	and others is not , we think , quite fair .

		Macaulays , like other great artists , are not horn every day .

		But here in the
United States	LOCATION	at the pre - sent time the feeling that attention to form is necessary to good work is on the increase ; and not only in the larger histories like those of Channing or
Rhodes	LOCATION	, but in single volumes like some in the ''
American Nation	ORGANIZATION	'' series , there is much historical writing that is as good literature as any other American prose .

		If this is so , surely it will be better to let our history writing pursue its own native development , without a forced return to the methods of that master of literature to whose his - torical work , magnificent as it is , the beginner must be directed with words of warning .

		It is true , as Professor
Hutson	PERSON	remarks , that no man can escape the influence of his own bias or attain absolute impartiality .

		But he can wish to do so , and learn how to approximate to this end .

		To accomplish this is the effort of the scientific '' student of history .

		He strives ` to make his work inter - esting if possible , but at all events to tell the truth .

		By all means let us have a return to the spirit and methods of Macaulay , '' provided that the aspiring his - torian has also the equipment and genius of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	.

		But that the earnest , truth-seeking historian of to-day should withhold his pen until so skilled in '' variety of statement , '' `` art in emphasis , '' `` illuminating alluM \ r - ness , '' etc. , as to make his history `` more entertaining than most novels , '' would be to defer indefinitely the exposition of much important historic truth .

		And , indeed , modern historical writing is not all deadly ; much of it is both readable and scholarly .

		Present-day investiga - tors doubtless envy the fluency and eloquence of the great poet and essayist ; yet truth and accuracy must comejir.it with real lovers of history .

		Absolute impar - tiality may not be possible , since no historian can wholly escape his environment ; but it can be honestly aimed at and coMcitnu partisanxhip avoided .

		THE DIAL 325 Cjxe Jltto ILLUSTRIOUS FAXATIC .

		* It is a rare gift to be able duly to appreciate the fanatic .

		The sober thinker can never adopt his methods in practice or approve them in theory , however noble and useful the end in view may have been .

		Absorbed in his ruling purpose , the fanatic either has never developed the power of logical reasoning or has thrust it aside as an encumbrance upon his freedom of action .

		His moral and intellectual compass thus out of sight , it is not strange that in his efforts to get at his goal at any cost he is occasionally found in paths which , to the observer who does not thoroughly understand him , seem to classify him with the fool or the knave .

		Either as one or both ,
John Brown	PERSON	, the anti-slavery fanatic , was honestly regarded by hundreds of thousands of his fellow-citizens , when the
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry catastrophe brought his career so vividly into the consciousness of the American people in the
autumn of 1859	DATE	.

		And at the expiration of fifty years one will not go far to find critics who still refuse to assign to
John Brown	PERSON	any posi - tion of utility or honor in the great work of redeeming
America	LOCATION	from the crime of human slavery .

		In
1859	DATE	, opinion was so generally adverse that
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	, as editor of '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' felt obliged to write to Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	, '' Editorially I am a little afraid of
Brown	PERSON	, and
Tickner	PERSON	would be more so . ''

		The Civil War , of course , turned many to the side of
Brown	PERSON	from motives of passionate partisan - ship for anything aimed against the tyranny of slavery , and led some to a really sympathetic comprehension of his true position .

		We take the following paragraph from an address of
George William Curtis	PERSON	, delivered more than fifty times , and to large and sympathetic audiences , during
1864	DATE	and
1865	DATE	: '' The two most illustrious fanatics in our history were
John C. Calhoun	PERSON	and old
John Brown	PERSON	.

		They re - presented the inevitable tendencies of American civili - zation .

		One died in his bed , honored and deplored as a great statesman .

		The other was hung upon a gallows , derided as a fanatic .

		The statesman struggles with his last strength to keep millions of human beings degraded .

		The felon stoops beneath the gallows , and , tenderly lifting a child of the degraded race , kisses her in the soft winter sun .

		Peace !

		Peace !

		History and the human heart will judge between them .

		Both their bodies lie mouldering in the grave ; whose soul is marching on ?

		Some , however , were carried so far by the sympathetic swing of the pendulum as to make it impossible for them to admit the truth of certain facts in
Brown	PERSON	's anti-slavery career which are absolutely necessary to any final estimate of his character and work .

		And as public opinion in the North has been largely colored by some of these very men , there was a real need for such a re-hearing of the entire case as this thoroughgoing biography by Mr.

1856	DATE	; that he intentionally made statements of such a nature as to lead his friends to disbelieve and deny that responsibility , thus misleading public opinion ; that he sanctioned and aided in the carrying off of horses and other private property belonging to pro-slavery men , in
Kansas	LOCATION	and
Missouri	LOCATION	, under such circumstances and in such a manner that his action must be branded as indefensible under any consistent code of moral principles ; that in private business relations he was occasionally lacking in that frankness and straightforwardness usually considered essential to any high standard of honor ; and that he showed a surprising lack of ordinary judgment as to the relation of means to end in many of his enterprises , and preeminently so in the
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry affair , which brought his earthly career to such a tragic termination .

		And yet , with all these forbidding facts duly accepted and estimated at their full weight , Mr.
Villard	PERSON	sees and convinces the reader that the real
John Brown	PERSON	was neither knave nor fool , but one of the great moral forces of human history , always consciously striving for a great moral end , even in those misguided actions that tended to deprive the anti-slavery cause of moral advantage which it might otherwise have possessed .

		To have brought out the real greatness of
Brown	PERSON	, with no attempt at evasion or denial of such facts in his life as sound moral judgment must inevitably condemn , is an achievement for the successful accomplishment of which the author deserves the highest credit .

		Great moral harm has been done , and is being done to-day , by the too easy assumption that deeds which nobody would THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, excuse in an ordinary man are allowable when done by one who can impress himself upon the imagination as acting under some great moral impulse .

		The value of such a book as Mr.
Villard	PERSON	has written is that it brings the reader down to a realization of the inconsistencies and contradictions which may mar the work even of the most single-minded laborer for the righting of any great wrong , and impresses upon him the crying need that trained intelligence and moral fervor shall go hand in hand in the amelioration of untoward conditions of human existence .

		We must commend also the unflagging zeal in the search for materials which has character - ized the preparation of this biography .

		Not only have all available written sources been studied , but the country has been traversed from
Atlantic	LOCATION	to
Pacific	LOCATION	, either by the author himself or by others working under his direction and at his expense , in order to secure personal inter - views with
Brown	PERSON	's still living relatives and associates and get whatever light they might be able to throw upon his character and career .

		How important it was that this should be done without further delay , is evident from the fact that the present writer has incidentally noticed newspaper accounts of the death of several of these witnesses within the short interval since Mr.
Villard	PERSON	's book went to the press .

		The desire and need for a copious presentation of facts , especially upon such controverted points as the murders on the
Pottawatomie	LOCATION	, stood somewhat in the way of the most attractive literary presentation ; and yet no serious defect on that score can be alleged against the volume .

		Mr.
Villard	PERSON	's English is always clear and effec - tive , eloquent when the subject-matter is of a nature to inspire and justify eloquence , as in various parts of the last three chapters , in which the noble dignity of
Brown	PERSON	after his capture , and the solemn scene of his execution , are finely portrayed .

		If
Brown	PERSON	's specific purposes had been hindered or brought to naught all along the way by the want of insight , the gift of clear vision was surely bestowed upon him in double measure at the end .

		As the blow of a hatchet in the sheriff 's hand left his body dangling in the air , the stillness was broken by the voice of Colonel
Preston	PERSON	, solemnly declaring , '' So perish all such enemies of
Virginia	LOCATION	!

		All such enemies of the Union !

		All such foes of the human race ! ''

		As Mr.
Villard	PERSON	tells us : '' It was said , without a shade of animosity , without a note of exultation ; but the blind man was not he who swung from the rope above .

		For his eyes had seen , long before his light had failed , the coming of the blue - clad masses of the North who were to make a mockery of Colonel
Preston	PERSON	's words and strike down the destroy - ing tyranny of slavery , to free
Virginia	LOCATION	from the most hateful of self-imposed bonds .

		As the troops now solemnly tramped away , with all decorum and without any demonstrations , in far-off
Albany	LOCATION	they were firing one hundred guns as the dirge of the martyr .

		And meanwhile ,
John Brown	PERSON	's soul was marching on , and all in the North who had a conscience and a heart knew that
John A. Andrew	PERSON	voiced the truth when he de - clared , Whether the enterprise of
John Brown	PERSON	and his associates in
Virginia	LOCATION	was wise or foolish , right or wrong ; I only know that , whether the enterprise itself was the one or the other ,
John Brown	PERSON	himself is right . ' ''

		On the day after the execution ,
George Hoadley	PERSON	wrote to Salmon P. Chase : `` Poor old
John Brown	PERSON	, God sanctify his death to our good , and give us a little of his courage , piety , and self-sacrificing spirit , with more brains . ''

		It was
Brown	PERSON	's foresight of the tremendous impression his death was to make upon the heretofore slumbering consciences of countless thousands of his fellow-men that closed his ear irrevocably to the many suggestions of rescue which earnest friends found the means to con - vey to him .

		With the sword of violence now broken and useless at his feet , the truth dawned upon his mind too clearly to allow him to fling away by cowardly escape the one weapon now left to him the sword of the spirit . ''

		Not often in history is there recorded such a rise to spiritual greatness of one whose hands were so stained with blood , whose judgment was ever so faulty , whose public career was so brief ... And so , wherever there is battling against injustice and oppression , the
Charles	PERSON	- town gallows that became a cross will help men to live and die .

		The story of
John Brown	PERSON	will ever confront the spirit of despotism , when men are struggling to throw off the shackles of social or political or physical slavery . ''

		We are all acquainted with that type of biog - raphy which hides every defect of a great man and unfolds to the eye of the reader a record so flawless that its very perfection stamps it as humanly impossible .

		And of late years we know , too , the pseudo-biographer , too little in spirit and intellect to understand greatness when he sees it , who magnifies the petty flaws of a great life until all its glory and usefulness are lost to view in the malarial fog of misrepresenta - tion thus stirred up .

		And fortunately for human progress based upon the study of human life as it is , we have now and then a biographer who can bring out the real greatness of a life in the only true way , by picturing to us faithfully aff the difficulties with which that life had to con - tend , within as well as without .

		Such a service
John T. Morse	PERSON	did for us in his life of
Lincoln	LOCATION	; and such a service Mr.
Villard	PERSON	has now rendered a decidedly more difficult task in this life of
John Brown	PERSON	.

		THE DIAL 327 THE STORY or A DUAL , PERSONALITY .

		* '' Almost encumbered by the infinity of his perceptions , '' as Mrs.
Mona Caird	PERSON	once said of him ,
William Sharp	PERSON	lived a life abounding in wealth of vivid experience , intensity of varied sensation , splendor of glorious visions , unfailing cheer of high hopes , and actual achievement of things eminently worth while .

		Sufferings enough , it is true , fell to his lot ; but neverthe - less , or perhaps for that very reason , he cher - ished throughout `` a great sense of sunshine and boyish freshness , '' an unfading joy in all good things , a spirit ever ready for any adven - ture , and a keen delight in the poetry and romance of this our earthly pilgrimage , at the end of which he , for his part , was ready to cry : '' Farewell to the known and exhausted , Welcome the unknown and illimitable ! ''

		Five years have passed since the death of him who for a decade and more had puzzled a large part of the literary world with his assumption of the pseudonym ''
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	, '' and his perpetration of an innocent Ossianic hoax by which our literature became the gainer ; and now his widow , herself a poet and the collabor - ator with her husband in their ''
Lyra Celtica	PERSON	, '' has prepared a biography with the simple title `` William Sharp -LRB-
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	-RRB- : A Me - moir . ''

		The added words , '' Compiled by his wife , '' indicate the large use she has made of his letters and diaries , as also of letters written to him .

		The gifted man , dual if not multiple in his personality , is made to tell his own life - story , as far as possible , from its beginning on the 12th of
September 1855	DATE	, at
Paisley	LOCATION	, to its premature close on a wild
December afternoon of 1905	DATE	, in the mountains of
Sicily	LOCATION	.

		It is the penalty of genius that it must , with much striving and stumbling , find itself before it can enjoy any measure of calm content .

		The vicissitudes of
William Sharp	ORGANIZATION	's restless youth are very much what might have been expected in his case .

		The regular walks of life , the emi - nently respectable and honorable pursuits and callings of those around him , were none of them for him .

		Uncertain health and misunderstood aptitudes were the cause of many futilities and failures in his efforts to strike into the road along which he was finally destined to journey .

		For some not too intelligible reason , he did not even equip himself with a good education in the fundamentals before beginning his battle * WILLIAM SHARP -LRB-

		with the world .

		For two years he studied at
Glasgow University	ORGANIZATION	, and of course was especially drawn to English literature , then taught by Professor
John Nichol	PERSON	, whose valued friendship Sharp long afterward retained ; but in
1874	DATE	he was placed by his father , with a view to ascer - taining where the young man 's capabilities lay , in the law office of Messrs.
Maclure	PERSON	and Han - ney , of
Glasgow	LOCATION	, where he gave to his profes - sional studies only a languid attention as com - pared with his interest in those private literary pursuits that he allowed to rob him of all but four hours of what should have been his sleeping time .

		Naturally he broke down under the strain , and was sent to
Australia	LOCATION	to recuperate .

		It was not long , however , before he was back in
London	LOCATION	, intent on making a way for himself into the charmed world of letters , and greatly encouraged in his undertaking by the generous kindness and hearty appreciation of
Rossetti	PERSON	.

		Before that friendly hand was extended to him he had been well-nigh driven to despair by a cruelly candid letter from
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	, some of whose literary work had been en - thusiastically admired by young Sharp so sympathetically enjoyed , in fact , that he had felt prompted to send a few of his own poems to its author , asking for criticism and hoping for praise .

		Perhaps it was inevitable , at any rate it was characteristic of
Buchanan	PERSON	, that he should send back a harshly discouraging word to the young poet , whom he strongly urged not to dream of literature as a career .

		From the long and deep depression caused by that untactful letter , only the reiterated expressions of confidence and hope from her who afterward became his wife succeeded in arousing him .

		As it is the literary likings and dislikings of an author that throw the strongest light on his own genius , and indicate the character of his work , let us quote from Sharp 's unstudied words of praise lavished upon the poet
Dante Gabriel Rossetti	PERSON	in a letter to a friend . ''

		I had a splendid
evening last night	TIME	, and
Rossetti	PERSON	read a lot more of his latest work .

		Splendid as his published work is , it is surpassed by what has yet to be published .

		The more I look into and hear his poems the more I am struck with the incomparable power and depth of his genius his almost magical perfection and mastery of language his magnificent spiritual strength and subtlety .

		He read some things
last night	TIME	, lines in which almost took my breath away .

		No sonnet-writer in the past has equalled him , and it is almost inconceiv - able to imagine any one doing so in the future .

		His influence is already deep and strong , but I believe in time to come he will be looked back to as we now look to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, to
Milton	LOCATION	, and in one sense to
Keats	PERSON	.

		I can find no language to express my admiration of his 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, supreme gifts , and it is with an almost painful ecstasy that I receive from time to time fresh revelations of his intellectual , spiritual , and artistic splendour . ''

		This was written nearly thirty years ago , ere the fine flush of youth had begun to fade from the writer 's check ; and it reminds one of Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	's expressions of passionate admira - tion for
Rossetti	PERSON	, who to him also had played the part of cordial friend and helpful adviser .

		Concerning Sharp 's adoption of the pseu - donym ``
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	, '' and the writings signed therewith , an interesting chapter occurs at the opening of Part II .

		of this memoir .

		It was in
1898	DATE	, while Mr. and Mrs. Sharp were in
Rome	LOCATION	for the
spring	DATE	months , that he found the desired incentive toward a true expression of himself , in the stimulus and sympathetic understanding of the friend to whom he dedi - cated the first of the books published under his JIM in loin \ in . ''

		To this unnamed friend , whom he first met at that time , Sharp declared he owed his development as ''
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	, '' although in a sense , as he himself adds , that had begun long before he knew her , and indeed while he was still a child .

		But '' without her there would have been no '
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	. ' ''

		In a friendly letter to the mysterious
Fiona	PERSON	,
Grant Allen	ORGANIZATION	gave expression to some criticism that may voice sentiments of others beside the writer .

		He says of '' Pharais , '' which had been sent to him by the author : '' It is instinct with the dreamy Celtic genius , and seems to come to us straight from the Isles of the Dead .

		That shadowy Ossianic spirit , as of your misty straits and your floating islands , reminds me exactly of the outlook from the western mountains over the summer-blue belted sea as I saw it once on an
August	DATE
morning	TIME	at
Oban	LOCATION	.

		Too shadowy , sometimes , and too purely poetical , I fear , for your Saxon readers .

		But the opening sentences are beautiful , and the nature - studies and the sense of colour throughout are charming .

		Now , after so much praise , will you forgive a few ques - tions and a word of criticism ?

		You are , I take it , a young writer , and so an older hand may give you a hint or two .

		Do n't another time interlard your English with Gaelic .

		Even a confirmed Celtomaniac like myself finds it a trifle distracting .

		Do n't say ' the English ' and ' the Gaelic . '

		Give a little more story to less pure poetry .

		Of course I recognize that your work is an idyll , not a novel , a cameo , not a woodcut ; but even so , it seems to me a trifle too dreamy .

		Forgive this frank - ness , and remember that success still lies in the lap of the
Saxon	LOCATION	.

		And that we Celts have our besetting sins , and that perfection in literature lies in avoiding excess in any direction , even that of one 's own best qualities . ''

		The so-called Celtic Revival of about ten years ago receives adequate attention in Mrs. Sharp 's pages .

		Among the '' six Celtic nations '' forming the
Celtic Association	ORGANIZATION	, various discord - ant opinions were held as to the proper aims of the federation ; but ''
William Sharp	PERSON	's great desire was that the Celtic spirit should be kept alive , and be a moulding influence toward the expression of the racial approach to and yearn - ing after spiritual beauty , whether expressed in Gaelic or hi the English tongue .

		He knew that there is a tendency , with the young of those people in
Scotland	LOCATION	at least , to put aside the beautiful old thoughts , or at all events their outward expression , with the disuse of the older language which had clothed those thoughts ; he feared that to put silence on them would be to lose them after a generation or two . ''

		But with the various little misunderstandings , and more or less heated discussions of questions relating to language and other details , we need not here further concern ourselves .

		The cause was a worthy one , and Sharp was its vigorous sup - porter .

		Three visits to this country were made by Sharp , and his biographer 's account of them is of especial interest to us .

		His enjoyment of these new experiences , and his readiness to be pleased with the new friends and the new scenes , are manifest in his letters .

		In one giving his first impressions of
New England	LOCATION	he says : ``
Boston	LOCATION	is a beautiful place an exceedingly tine city with lovely environs .

		Prof.
A. S. Hardy	PERSON	-LRB- Passe Rose , ' etc. -RRB- was most kind ...
Cambridge	LOCATION	and
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	are also very fine .

		I enjoyed seeing Long - fellow 's house -LRB- Miss L. still occupies it -RRB- , and those of
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, etc. .

		I spent brief visits to Prof.
Wright	PERSON	of
Harvard	LOCATION	, to Winsor the historian , etc. .

		On
Sunday	DATE
afternoon	TIME	I drove with
A. S. H.	PERSON	to Behnont in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and spent the afternoon with
Howells	PERSON	, the novelist .

		He was most interesting and genial .

		I had the best of welcomes from the Stedmaus .

		They are kindness personified .

		The house is lovely , and full of beautiful things and multitudes of books .

		I have already more invitations than I can accept : everyone is most hospitable . ''

		There is much else in the book to which the reviewer would gladly call attention .

		Sharp 's friendship with
Walter Pater	PERSON	, and the corre - spondence between the two , are of csjM-cial inter - est , as are also the relations between Sharp and
Philip Bourke Marston	PERSON	, and
George Meredith	PERSON	, and countless others of note .

		His many-sided largeness of mind and soul required many and different friends .

		Something of this richness of spiritual endowment may be read in the por - traits of Sharp that occur in the book .

		They bear little resemblance to one another .

		In every change of pose and with every passing moment he is a different man , though always the same .

		His life , as told and compiled by his wife and life-long friend and comrade , is a biography of unusual variety of interest .

PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		ROMANTICISM ix LITERATURE AXD Every year the delvers in the French archives are increasing in number , and year by year the study of Romanticism is growing less Romantic .

		Files of letters in the Bibliothe ` que
Nationale	ORGANIZATION	, long withheld from publication for personal reasons , have been turned over to the printers ; old desks and family records are being opened to student and savant .

		The doctor 's degree and the fureur de Vinedit the phrase is hardly translatable are filling the bookstores with volumes of literary antiquarianism ; and , if the present rate of publication continues , the seekers after '' sources '' will soon be without resource .

		One class of books , however , we have always with us , and shall have : secondary works , books about books .

		Of these the most inter - esting the most valuable too , perhaps , in an age tending all too swiftly toward a purely uni - lingual culture are the books which make available in English , facts or fiction originally published in another tongue .

		Whatever the scholar may think of such productions , their popular value can not be denied , especially when they are written with the wit and cleverness which characterize Mr.
Francis Gribble	PERSON	's studies in French literary history . ''

		Passions of the French Romantics '' -LRB- sic -RRB- is the latest of a series of several volumes deal - ing with the personal life one might almost say the amative life of various French writers , from
Rousseau	PERSON	to the great Romanticists .

		Why Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	calls them '' Romantics '' we can - not imagine , unless he is attempting to anglicize the French romantiques .

		The authors con - sidered are Bernardin de Saint-Pierre -LRB- que diable allait-il faire dans cette galere ! -RRB-

		,
Lamartine	LOCATION	,
Vigny	LOCATION	, Musset , Hugo ,
Sainte	LOCATION	- Beuve ,
Dumas	PERSON	pere , and
Merimee	PERSON	; Balzac and
Gautier	PERSON	being excluded for no very evident reason , while George Sand finds an immoral immortality in an earlier volume of the series .

		The sources used , most of which Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	mentions in his preface , are recent French biographies ; how closely he has followed them may be judged from the present reviewer 's letter in a recent number of THE DIAL -LRB-
June 16	DATE	, * THE PASSIONS OF THE FRENCH ROMANTICS .

Francis Gribble	PERSON	.

New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		1910 , p. 416 -RRB- .

		Yet stories , whatever their origin , '' ought to be entertaining if properly told '' ; so we may accept this statement of the preface in lieu of apology , seeing that the im - proper properly told constitutes a really difficult type of art .

		And Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	tells his stories with all the propriety permitted by his subjects .

		The half - cynical detachment of his attitude is only sur - passed by the sprightly humor which never fails to lend interest to his pages .

		A richly allusive style is his , teeming with parody , irregular , full of suspensions and antitheses , a style conforming to no rule save that of interest .

		For a chronique scandaleuse such a style would be perfection ; yet there are passages in the loves of the Romantic school that can not be seriously treated as parts of a chronique scan - daleuse .

		Here at least , it must be admitted , Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	fails .

		The tragedy of
Vigny	ORGANIZATION	's disillusionment , the pathos of Sainte-Beuve 's love for Mme. Hugo , the lyrical devotion of
Lamartine	LOCATION	, are things as far beyond his com - prehension as the style that could adequately portray them is beyond his power .

		Comedy speaks with one voice , one mask ; Tragedy with another .

		Clever and sprightly , nevertheless , the vol - ume certainly is ; and if picturesqueness be oc - casionally obtained by the sacrifice of important detail , as comparison with
M. Seche	PERSON	's careful studies will show , we need not complain of it in a work of this sort .

		For the volume should stir up popular interest in the French Romanticists ; and it should undoubtedly correct some false impressions .

		One of these latter is the popular opinion of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	as a man .

		What Americans know of the arch-Romanticist is derived mainly from
Barbou	ORGANIZATION	's book , ``
Victor Hugo	PERSON	and his Times , '' long since translated into English , and the life of the poet written by his wife .

		Now both of these biographies were written under the eye of the master , the second one being dictated to Mme. Hugo by the poet himself ; and although extremely interesting , they are in a sense works of fiction , and the truth is not in them .

		It was reserved for a later scholar ,
M. Edmond Bire	PERSON	, to give us the negative side in a series of studies , as remarkable for their stinging irony as for their scholarly acumen .

		With this material to draw from , Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	shows us how
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, when he came to dictate his autobiog - raphy , was carried away by his poet 's imagina - tion ; how he falsified his genealogy to prove himself of noble family , how he magnified his 330 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, precocity by antedating his earlier works , how he invented the phrase '' enfant sublime '' and attributed it to Chateaubriand for his greater glory . ''

		That fact , '' as Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	remarks , '' is more sublime even than the eulogy itself . ''

		He tells us how Hugo concealed his failures , how he made twelve editions out of 1500 copies of Han cTIslande , how he published
Amy Robsart	PERSON	under the name of his eighteen-year-old brother-in-law , who had nothing to lose , and lost nothing by the failure of the play .

		He pictures Hugo stepping out on his balcony , at a certain hour every day , to show himself , monarch-like , to the curious throng , and quotes , as further proof of the poet 's megalomania , this incident from the Souvenirs sur Turgueneff : `` One evening Hugo 's admirers , assembled in his drawing-room , were competing with one another in the eulogy of his genius ; and the idea was thrown out , among others , that the street in which he lived ought to bear his name . ''

		Some one suggested that the street was too small to be worthy of so great a poet , and that the honour of bearing his name ought to be assigned to some more important thoroughfare .

		Then they proceeded to enumerate the most popular quarters of
Paris	LOCATION	, in an ascending scale , until one man exclaimed with enthusiasm that it would be an honour for the city of
Paris	LOCATION	itself to be renamed after the man of genius .

		`` Hugo , leaning against the mantelpiece , listened complacently to his flatterers outbidding each other .

		Then with the air of one engaged in deep thought , he turned to the young man , and said to him in his grand style '' ' Even that will come , my friend .

		Even that will come . ' ''

		`` Not one of us , were he even a little dog , but feels himself the centre of the universe , '' says
M. Anatole France	PERSON	.

		Few men , however , imagine that the universe is so becogged into the axis of their own genius .

		Yet the disclosure of Hugo 's relations with the fair sex surpasses even this , and proves con - clusively that the building of the Hugo legend was the poet 's greatest work of art .

		To make a muse out of a mistress , even when she be orig - inally another man 's mistress , was not uncom - mon in the age of Romanticism , but to make of such a mistress a
Madonna Beatrice	ORGANIZATION	, and force the world to swallow her , halo and all , is indubitably beyond the capacity of all but the highest type of genius .

		Yet this is what
Hugo	PERSON	did for his Egeria ,
Juliette Drouet	PERSON	.

		And Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	shows us the whole stupendous process of the apotheosis : Hugo collecting a public sub - scription to reclaim the repentant
Magdalen	ORGANIZATION	she was , by the way , the artist 's model immor - talized in the statue of
Strasbourg	LOCATION	, employing the proceeds of this subscription to set up a second establishment , printing verses to her in the same volume with verses to his wife ; while
Madame HiiijM	PERSON	, in the meantime , was consoling herself with Sainte-Beuve , whose services as herald of Hugo 's glory prevented for years a definite rupture .

		He shows us Hugo in after years , unfaithful even in his infidelity , caught in flagrante delicto by an irate husband , and obliged to show the medal which proved him Peer of
France	LOCATION	to escape arrest .

		He pictures him laying siege to
Juliette	ORGANIZATION	's maids , and setting up a third establishment for one of them in his seventies .

		But most wonderful of all , perhaps , he shows us Mme.
Hugo	PERSON	and her relatives recon - ciled with
Juliette	PERSON	, so that the mistress-muse accompanies the Hugos in their exile , and sat at the poet 's side in a banquet given in their honor , while Mme. Hugo , voluntarily -LRB- ? -RRB-

		and in exquisitely chosen words proposed a toast to her forgiven rival .

		Well !

		we should find it all pretty hard to believe , did we not know that they order these things differently in
France	LOCATION	.

		And lastly , Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	shows us Hugo , the author of Uart d'etre grand-pere , taking his muse into his own household after his wife 's decease , to be a companion to his grandchildren ; and when she died there a few years later ,
Paris	LOCATION	had crowned her , as Mme.
Hugo	PERSON	's cousin had crowned her long before , '' the poet 's immortal
Beatrice	PERSON	, the sceptre-bearer of his glory . ''

		Scarcely less interesting , though for different reasons , is the story of MerimeVs Incoitt/nc and the narration of Musset 's love-affairs sub - sequent to George Sand .

		The '' grande passion '' of
Lamartine	PERSON	and the disillusionment of Vigny are , on the other hand , no subjects for Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	's pen , and the lover of these poets would do well to pass them by .

		It is clever to say that
Lamartine	PERSON	`` was prone , like all the Romantics , to confuse the love of God with the love of his neighbour 's wife , '' but epi - grams will not pay us for everything .

		There is a certain disillusionment in the thought that
Vigny	ORGANIZATION	's sorrow was caused by the betrayal of an actress like
Marie Dorval	PERSON	, and even the thought of Musset consoling himself with the Pandemians of the pavement will tarnish , for some of us , the splendor of the Xtiit * .

		Alas !

		as long as we are Anglo-Saxons we shall rejoice that there exists no contemporary biography of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Wherein , then , apart from the sempiternal interest of gossip , lies the justification of such studies ?

		The need of some justification our author evidently feels , and he indicates it at
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 331 the conclusion of his preface . ''

		The Romantic school was a period of experiments in life as well as in literature , '' says Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	, '' and there is nothing unnatural in a curiosity to know whether they failed or succeeded . ''

		This is why he has collected these stories , `` to help students to consider for themselves whether or how far the Romantics -LSB- quel tic / -RSB- really served the cause of the liberty of the human spirit by that anarchism in their amours which was their common characteristic . ''

		But no Con - clusion helps the student in his conclusions ; and no analysis tells us how the principle of Romanticism developed and why it was bound to fail .

		Is the whole matter , after all , so perfectly obvious ?

		That
Rousseau	PERSON	inaugurated a new literature , a new conception of love , an apothe - osis of sentiment which was to culminate in the vagaries of ''
1830	DATE	, '' we all know ; but it is not so easy to trace the development of that earlier conception into the confusion of love and re - ligion which was the ruin of Musset and many another .


M. Lasserre	PERSON	has done it , in his Roman - tismefranqais , a book which the serious student of this period can not afford to miss .

		The mis - take of the great Romantic poets was their at - tempt to live out their dreams , a mistake which led to the most humiliating contacts with reality .

		Nor was this all .

		The Romanticists suffered one and all , as some of us are suffering to-day , from that self-poisoning through liter - ature , which , like opium , spoils for us the flavor of all natural food .

		Nordau has analyzed the habit in his '' Paradoxen , '' and La Rochefou - cauld has stated the axiom in its extreme form . ''

		There are men , '' says the great French mor - alist , '' '' who never would have loved , if they had not heard others speak of love . ''

		And
M. Lasserre	PERSON	shows us how this mania of love , of passion as the supreme end of life , spread its virus in a world wherein the bounds of conven - tional self-expression had been overthrown by the French Revolution and the coming of the
Third Estate	ORGANIZATION	into literature and life .

		For the essentially bourgeois character of Romanticism may be verified in the vogue of Miss
Marie Corelli	PERSON	, and its constant qualities may be noted in the love-letters of any maid-servant who has learned to read .

		A false conception of human life , it is no wonder that the Romantic theory came to the ground .

		Those who grasp at soap-bubbles will get only a drop of dirty suds , and they are indeed lucky who do not receive it in their eyes . ''

		Almost all the passions of the Romantics , '' remarks Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	, `` ended in some sort of disappointment or some sort of anti-climax . ''

		So our experimenters found out that the theory of passion per se , or even the theory of love per se , does not square with any of the facts of life .

		The social organism may exist because of love , but it does not in any sense exist for the sake of love .

		With this we may return to Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	's book , to add a final word .

		The volume is well illustrated , and the type large and pleasant to the eye .

		All in all , one could find far worse reading for a vacation trip than '' Passions of the French Romantics . ''

		It reads very easily , this clever collection of literary gossip perhaps because it was undoubtedly written very easily .

		And in respect of its humorous qualities at least , no higher praise could be conceived .

		A LITERARY HISTORY OF THE SOUTH .

		* The complaint is sometimes heard among Southerners that the South has been slow to recognize the worth of its own writers , and particularly that it has neglected to publish their merits abroad through the medium of the printed page .

		But certainly there is no longer any ground for such a reproach .

		During the
last decade and a half	DATE	there has come from the South no end of books about Southern writers .

		First , there was Miss Manly 's '' Southern Lit - erature '' -LRB- 1895 -RRB- ; then came in rapid succession Miss
Clark	PERSON	's '' Songs of the South '' -LRB-
1896	DATE	-RRB- , Pro- fessor BaskervilTs '' Southern Writers '' -LRB- 1897 -RRB- ,
S. A. Link	PERSON	's `` Pioneers of Southern Literature '' -LRB- 1899 -RRB- , Professor
Bradshaw	PERSON	's '' Southern Poetry Prior to 1860 '' -LRB-
1900	DATE	-RRB- , Professor
Weber	PERSON	's '' Se - lections from the Southern Poets '' -LRB-
1901	DATE	-RRB- , a second volume of '' Southern Writers '' by Pro- fessor
Baskervill	PERSON	's pupils -LRB-
1903	DATE	-RRB- , Professor Trent 's '' Southern Writers '' -LRB-
1905	DATE	-RRB- , Professor
Holliday	PERSON	's `` A History of Southern Literature '' -LRB-
1906	DATE	-RRB- , and a year ago an encyclopaedic work entitled `` The South in the Building of the Nation , '' in which several volumes are devoted to '' The Literary and Intellectual Life of the South . ''

		Last
spring	DATE	saw the completion of '' A Library of Southern Literature , '' another encyclopaedic undertaking , in fifteen large vol - umes .

		Since then , another volume of selections from Southern writers , by Professors
Mims	PERSON	and

THK	ORGANIZATION	LITERATURE OF THE SOUTH .

		By
Montrose J	ORGANIZATION	,
Moses	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Thomas Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		332 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, history of the literature or , more precisely , a literary history of the South from the pen of Mr.
Montrose J. Moses	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Moses	PERSON	is not a native of the South , but his antecedents are
Southern	ORGANIZATION	, and he writes with full sympathy for the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	people and their literature and traditions .

		His attitude , however , is not at all that of '' unreasoning idolatry . ''

		Of the literature of the Ante-Bellum South , for instance , he does not scruple to say -LRB- p. 456 -RRB- that it was '' at its best ... provincial , over-florid , and over-sentimental '' ; and he admits -LRB- p. 431 -RRB- that there is no great writing being done in the South to-day , '' though he promptly adds , and justly , that we have no right to believe that what is being done is not as excellent as the average elsewhere . ''

		The special contribution which Mr.
Moses	PERSON	makes to his subject is in his consideration of the social , political , and economic forces out of which a Southern literature has developed .

		Indeed , it is upon this that chief emphasis is laid .

		He begins his book by insisting upon the intimate relationship between literature and life ; each of the five main divisions of his book devoted respectively to the Colonial ,
Revolu	PERSON	- tionary , Ante-Bellum , Civil War , and New South periods he introduces with a chapter on '' Social Forces '' ; and throughout the re - maining chapters he keeps constantly in view the interplay between life and letters .

		Of this aspect of his subject it is clear that he has made an industrious and intelligent study , familiarizing himself not only with the literature of the South but also with its history , and par - ticularly with the multitude of magazine articles bearing on conditions that have obtained at the South .

		It is not too much to say that his treat - ment of Southern literature in relation to its social and political origins is the fullest and the most satisfactory that has so far been made .

		In his enthusiasm for social origins , however , Mr.
Moses	PERSON	has neglected somewhat the purely critical side of his subject .

		In his discussion of Colonial and Revolutionary literature , for example , he but rarely vouchsafes an opinion as to the actual worth of it all as literature ; he also excuses himself from any extended appre - ciation of the writers of the New South on the plea that '' it is unwise to utter strictures at close view '' ; and when in his consideration of the Ante-Bellum and Civil War writers he does go more into detail , his appreciation is , as a rule , neither systematic nor very full .

		Nor are his critical judgments always convincing .

		Few students of
Lanier	PERSON	would concur in the opinion that
Lanier	PERSON	's poems are without `` strength '' -LRB- see p. 875 -RRB- .

		If `` Sunrise '' and `` The Marshes of Glynn '' do not possess this quality , where else in all the poetry of the South shall wo find it ?

		And , admire
Hayne	PERSON	though we must , we shall scarcely be willing to admit that he was `` at times the equal of
Lanier	ORGANIZATION	in color and value of words '' -LRB- see p. 396 -RRB- .

		There will be few , moreover , who will subscribe to the high estimate which Mr.
Moses	PERSON	places upon the gift of Mrs.
Augusta Evans Wilson	PERSON	to American letters .

		The volume is also open to criticism for sun - dry inaccuracies in minor details .

		The section devoted to
Poe	ORGANIZATION	will serve for illustration .

		Here we are told -LRB- p. 277 -RRB- that
Poe	PERSON	`` always con - tended ' that he was a Virginian ; in reality he advertised himself as a Bostonian on the title - page of his first volume of poems .

		Again , we are told -LRB- p. 279 -RRB- that
Poe	PERSON	sang of Mrs.
Stanard	PERSON	not only in '' To
Helen	PERSON	, '' but in ''
Lenore	PERSON	, '' '' Ulalume , '' and ''
Annabel Lee	PERSON	'' as well ; whereas we can be reasonably certain that his wife was the inspiration of both `` Ulalume '' and ''
Annabel Lee	PERSON	. ''

		The novel which
Poe	ORGANIZATION	is reputed to have written on the occasion of a visit to
France	LOCATION	-LRB- see p. 282 -RRB- is , of course , altogether mythical .

		The title of his manu - script volume of tales for which he endeavored to find a publisher in the middle thirties was not '' Tales of a Folio '' -LRB- see p. 282 -RRB- , but '' Tales of the
Folio Club	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Poe was not married to
Virginia	LOCATION	in
1834	DATE	-LRB- see p. 283 -RRB- , but in
1836	DATE	.

		And it is not clear that
Poe	PERSON	, before going to
Richmond	LOCATION	in
1849	DATE	, wrote to
Griswold	PERSON	asking him to be his literary executor -LRB- see p. 289 -RRB- ; this is the testimony of Mrs.
Clemm	PERSON	and Mrs.
Weiss	PERSON	, but
Griswold	PERSON	denied having received any letter , maintaining that the first information of his appointment came to him from
Poe	PERSON	's friends `` some ten days '' after the poet 's death .

		The style of Mr.
Moses	PERSON	's work also has its imperfections .

		Though fairly brisk and enter - taining , it is not remarkable for its directness or for compression .

		And it is occasionally marred by lapses in idiom or in syntax .

		On page 344 , for instance , occurs the locution '' different ... than '' ; at least twice a noun is made to refer appositively to an adjective -LRB- see pp. 71 , 74 -RRB- ; and there are several in - stances of the so-called `` misrelated participle . ''

		The awkwardness of the sentence beginning '' It maybe was this fitful humor which lost him the secretaryship to
Virginia	LOCATION	'' -LRB- p. 32 -RRB- is obvious .

		But , despite its limitations , the book makes an important contribution to our kiiowl -

		CAMPBELL > Music IN
ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		* It is on the whole a fortunate thing that men are seldom satisfied with what they have achieved .

		The incentive to renewed effort is thus perennial .

		Judging from Mr.
Galloway	PERSON	's book on '' Musical England , '' the author is by no means inclined to believe that his country - men have accomplished as much in the great art with which he deals as might reasonably be expected of them .

		He makes an exhaustive survey of the field , and , spurred by the deficien - cies which he discovers , points out the mani - fold opportunities for progress and improvement .

		This is not to say that he is discouraged with what he finds , or that he does not recognize how much has been done ; but he evidently has before him visions of a combined and varied activity which he hopes to see in full swing in the near future .

		It has been somewhat the practice to look with a sort of lenient depreciation on what
England	LOCATION	has produced in music .

		Comparisons have been made with her sister European nations , and the account has not been altogether in her favor .

		Yet
England	LOCATION	has done a distinc - tive work in music , and has never been without representatives to do her credit .

		Her madrigals and songs , her ballad operas , her
Purcell	PERSON	,
Arne	PERSON	,
Sullivan	PERSON	, and
Elgar	ORGANIZATION	, her Irish and Scotch melodies , are sufficient to ensure her place and recognition .

		Moreover ,
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's great career is part of her glory , and
England	LOCATION	has a right to claim his oratorios as her own .

		Mendelssohn is deeply indebted to her , and she has always been munificent to deserving composers calling with the artist 's eagerness for recognition .

		This much needs to be said in deprecation of the somewhat apologetic tone which is found in Mr.
Galloway	PERSON	's presentation of his subject .

		It is no easy task to disclose the widespread energies of a nation in an art which makes so deep a popular appeal as music .

		The canvas has to be stretched to take on the great picture , and the details begin to accumulate to such an extent that the unity of the representation is in danger of being lost to sight .

		Mr.
Galloway	PERSON	, in the main , escapes the difficulty very well ; and * MusiCAL ENGLAND .

		By
William Johnson Galloway	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
John Lane Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		in the end we see how numerous are the instru - mentalities in working order , how coordinated they are , how intelligent and determined are the forces which are bound to bring decisive results .

		Mr.
Galloway	PERSON	proceeds with the discussion of Music in the Universities , in the Great Schools , in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, in the Festivals ; he has much to say of the Competitions , which , having had small and obscure beginnings , are now among the organized means of developing musical intelligence and of reaching the larger public with compositions of a high order in ways not hitherto possible .

		He describes the work of the
Musical Societies	ORGANIZATION	with which En - gland abounds , and shows how extensive their efforts have been .

		He repeats in substance what he has unfolded at length in his book , '' The Operatic Problem , '' and grapples with the proposition how to establish the Music Drama on a firm basis in his country , how to bring it into genuine relation with the life of the people , translating it into the vernacular , and elevating it from its position as a mere amusement for the rich into a source of education for the great body of the nation .

		The picture is , on the whole , an inspiriting one .

		The universities are awakening to their responsibilities in this important concern .

		They are making increased demands on their students , requiring residence as conditional for degrees , asking original works of the successful winners of honors .

		As was to be expected ,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	remain more or less conservative , and the pronounced advances have been made at less ancient institutions ,
Manchester	ORGANIZATION	and
Birmingham	LOCATION	.

		There are great music schools in
England	LOCATION	, the
Trinity College of Music	ORGANIZATION	, the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	, and others , but none under the direction of the State as on the continent , and Mr.
Galloway	PERSON	deplores to some extent the situation which he finds before him .

		The question , perhaps , is an open one .

		On all sides are to be found the indications of real interest and progress .

		The great Festivals have re ceived encouraging additions to their number , and the management of the new-comers has shown decided liberality in methods and arrange - ments over the time-honored ones .

		Mr.Galloway , moreover , puts great stress on the competitive movement ; a history of the movement is given and its present status outlined ; the competi - tions bring together musical societies , and prizes are awarded .

		They now are orchestral as well as vocal .

		Sir
Hubert Parry	PERSON	says of them : '' Competitions are quite among the most hope - ful signs of the times in this country .

		They 334 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, aim at spreading a knowledge of music in all its branches all over the country . ''

		In his closing chapter Mr.
Galloway	PERSON	makes the following statement : I have tried to show how at home every form of musical activity , except opera , is flourishing and vigor - ous , while even the care for national opera is getting gradually stronger with the growth of public knowledge and responsiveness .

		But though it is certainly the widest and possibly the highest form of musical art , and though for these and other reasons already disclosed it offers the strongest claims for official support , the
State Establishment of Opera	ORGANIZATION	is only a part of the largest possible conclusion that can be reached ; for if
the State	ORGANIZATION	is to interfere with music at all , there should be no limit in scope if not in detail to the measure of its control .

		There are many manifestations of musi - cal energy in this country ; but the several forms of activity , whether due to private or corporate enterprise , are isolated and independent , and many of them are suffering from a lack of adequate support Only a suitable degree of control by a central authority can increase their individual efficiency and coordinate the separate parts into an interrelated and completely effec - tive whole ; and as to national opera , its establishment will be hastened and assured if
the State	ORGANIZATION	once assumes its responsibilities to the entire field of music . ''

		It is not necessary to have Mr.
Galloway	PERSON	's remarkable confidence in the contemporary State as the chosen power for establishing music firmly in
England	LOCATION	, or any other country , as a great living factor in the amelioration of mankind .

		Musical
England	LOCATION	, as set forth in this book , seems really in a prosperous condition , quite able to take care of itself , and not needing to make apologies to anyone .

		Mr.
Galloway	PERSON	has a curious faculty of conjoining two con - tradictory estimates of the same matter in the same sentence .

		At first blush , this gives a somewhat depressing air to his whole discussion ; but one soon finds out his secret , and the result is a hopeful view revealing at the same time certain limitations requiring to be remembered .

		The author unfolds his subject thoroughly and comprehensively .

		Musical
England	LOCATION	, whether in the past or present , claims its meed of con - sideration , and the future appears in colors reasonably bright and inspiring .

		A HANDBOOK OF RELIGIOUS HISTOKY .

		The treatment is in

Q. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		many respects clear , concise , catholic , and com - prehensive , but such subjects as Free Masonry , Mormonism , Mesmerism , Zionism , Spiritualism , and `` Christian Science , '' seem rather out of place here , and the brief paragraph devoted to each is necessarily inadequate .

		Besides , these matters are too near us for historical treatment .

		But if recent movements are to be included in such a survey , surely modern Missions should receive more than a slight and unfriendly men - tion ; while organizations like the
Young Men 's Christian Association	ORGANIZATION	, and great reformatory and humanitarian enterprises so characteristic of our age -LRB- significant expressions of Applied Christianity -RRB- , ought not to be ignored as they are in these pages .

		This treatise is not so apologetic as
Clarke	PERSON	's '' Ten Great Religions , '' which , however , had a powerful influence for good some forty years ago .

		The author is very appreciative of all forms of religious belief , with a slight tendency toward prejudice when papal matters are dis - cussed .

		The treatment is much fuller than in
Tiele	LOCATION	's Outline , but not so suggestive .

		It takes a wider range than
Jordan	PERSON	's Comparative Re - ligion , but its descriptions of Buddhism and Brahman ism are all too brief , while Christianity occupies half its pages .

		The reviewer of this work is called to an un - pleasant task .

		The author has studied his general subject widely ; he is earnest in spirit ; he writes with much literary skill ; his chapters are interesting reading .

		But he attempts too large an undertaking .

		As a result , in many places his brief statements are unsatisfactory ; in some cases , quite erroneous .

		Such an asser - tion , for instance , as that the Anglican chim-h '' is Calvinistic in spirit and Romanist in form '' -LRB- p. 364 -RRB- , would hardly meet the approval of the Archbishop of
Canterbury !	ORGANIZATION

		And the author surely indulges in fiction when he claims -LRB- p. 69 -RRB- that Christianity and Mithraism had a com - mon origin in one of those old Asiatic religions . ''

		A Baptist would hardly agree with him that his church has three grades of officers , '' Elders , doctors -LSB- preachers -RSB- , and deacons '' -LRB- p. 361 -RRB- .

		Certainly there is little warrant for his putting
Milton	PERSON	-LRB- p. 361 -RRB- among the Baptists !

		His curt reference to the Book of
Daniel	PERSON	as a '' literary fraud '' -LRB- p. 196 -RRB- is hardly to his credit .

		The date of
Swedenborg	ORGANIZATION	's birth -LRB- 1688 -RRB- is errone - ously given as
1680	DATE	-LRB- p. 391 -RRB- .

		To belittle
Paul	PERSON	's interest in the man Jesus , by writing -LRB- p. 231 -RRB- that the apostle may have talked with persons who knew him , is surely most inexcusable .

		To assert that '' the historic
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 335 Jesus is essentially intangible '' -LRB- p. 226 -RRB- is to join the modern myth-makers like Pastor
Kalt	PERSON	- hoff .

		To state that Dr.
Channing	PERSON	became a Unitarian in
1819	DATE	-LRB- p. 367 -RRB- , the date of his celebrated
Baltimore	LOCATION	sermon , is inaccurate ; to represent
Emerson	PERSON	as the chief advocate of
American Unitarianism	ORGANIZATION	is still more so .

		The description of the various Presbyterian churches of
Scotland	LOCATION	-LRB- p. 360 -RRB- is confused .

		The followers of Ebenezer Erskine -LRB- 1733 -RRB- were not called Reformed Presbyterians , but '' Seceders . ''

		Dr.
Reinach	PERSON	represents Lalius and Faustus Socinus as teaching Unitarianism in
Switzerland	LOCATION	, which carries a false impression -LRB- p. 331 -RRB- .

		The remark that the Socinians fled from
Poland	LOCATION	and found refuge in
Transylvania	LOCATION	-LRB- p. 332 -RRB- is not accurate .

		The Anabaptists did not become Unitarians -LRB- p. 317 -RRB- , and
Priestley	PERSON	was in no sense responsible for
Boston Unitarianism	ORGANIZATION	as implied -LRB- p. 367 -RRB- .

		To assert -LRB- p. 363 -RRB- that the founder of ''
Chris	PERSON	- tian Science '' was Mrs.
Eddy	PERSON	, is to hurry the aged mystic into her grave prematurely .

		In his references to the problem discussed at the Coun - cil of Nica3a -LRB- p. 260 -RRB- , the author is not clear ; and he does not quote the Nicene Creed with exactness .

		The passing allusion to the
Salva	PERSON	- tion
Army	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- p. 403 -RRB- is certainly inadequate , and
General Booth	ORGANIZATION	will hardly relish the statement that at present the spirit of the organization is '' almost that of Unitarians '' !

		These , it may be said , are not major mistakes ; but they illustrate that lack of clearness of per - ception which mars many of the author 's pages .

		Many subjects have not been sufficiently mas - tered to afford a firm grasp on details .

		These are serious defects in a historical work .

		But the treatise as a whole has some decided merits .

		The earlier chapters , where the totem , the taboo , and fetichism are discussed -LRB- Chap .

JOSEPH H. CROOKER	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		For collectors '' A History of Japanese Colour - of Japanese Prints '' by Dr.
W. von Seidlitz	PERSON	was color-print * .

		first published in
Dresden	LOCATION	in
1897	DATE	.

		It was an attempt to put together in connected and coherent form the mass of valuable data scattered through the pages of various monographs , exhibi - tion catalogues , sale catalogues , and other sources not generally accessible .

		This was well done .

		The author showed excellent judgment and discrimina - tion in his reliance upon authorities , and the book at once took rank as the best popular work upon the subject .

		It is now reissued in an English trans - lation -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		For this edition the text has been revised throughout and considerable new matter has been incorporated with the intention of bringing it up to date .

		That aim , however , has been attained in part only ; it could not have been completely achieved without rewriting the entire work , for to a large extent it is a compilation , the views of the author being based upon the writings of
Fenollosa	ORGANIZATION	,
Anderson	PERSON	, De Goncourt , and others , more especially upon
Fenollosa	PERSON	's epoch-making book , '' The Masters of Ukioye , '' and apparently to a limited extent only upon personal study of the prints .

		In a measure the resultant lack of propor - tion is felt by Dr.
von Seidlitz	PERSON	, but he does not seem to realize the extent to which his estimates of the leading print designers are colored by impres - sions derived from the examination of a compara - tively small number of their works ; at least it is difficult on any other theory to account for his not ranking
Okumura Masanobu	PERSON	much higher than he does , and for his altogether inadequate appreciation of Shunsho and
Shigemasa	ORGANIZATION	.

		For his undue depre - ciation of Hokusai another explanation must be sought : it arises , in all probability , from
Fenollosa	PERSON	's protest against the exaggerated estimate in Gonse 's '' L'Art Japonais , '' made not long after the publica - tion of that work in
1883	DATE	.

		Harunobu ,
Kiyonaga	LOCATION	, and
Utamaro	PERSON	receive full meed of praise , but not as extended comment as is called for by the quality of their works and their importance in the history of the Ukiyoe school .

		Notwithstanding these and other shortcomings , the book gives the best general account of the color prints that has yet been pub - lished .

		It does not pretend to be a treatise for the collector which will do away with the need for independent research .

		Instead it is characterized by its author as '' a provisional essay in the synthetic presentment of our knowledge of Japanese Colour - Printing , '' and as such it may be warmly com - mended .

		The uninformed reader , however , needs to be warned against the printer 's errors , which are numerous and misleading .

		Even the list of errata on page xvi .

		contains a mistake , Shunko being printed '' Shunki '' !

		Not the least attractive feature of the volume is the illustrations , of which there are nearly a hundred .

		While not in all cases well chosen , they include reproductions of a number of very important prints .

		Sixteen are in color ; of these , two are especially noteworthy , a remarkable fan by
Shunsho	PERSON	and a striking print of an actor by
Sharaku	ORGANIZATION	.

		Three subjects of interest nowadays are the position of woman , the object of education , and religion .

		There must be a good many men who are perplexed at finding that their wives dislike domestic life and wish to vote , or that their children go to school for years and learn little of what used to be important , or that they themselves like to play golf on
Sunday	DATE	336 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, morning and to go motoring in the afternoon much better than they like to go to church .

		Many a man may think that women , children , church are not what they used to be .

		Such * one will perhaps like to read Mr.
Andrew Macphail	PERSON	's '' Essays in Fallacy '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , which deal with these sub - jects .

		If by reading such essays a man were able to manage his affairs any better , we are sure there would be a large market for the book .

		Unfortun - ately , such discussions are usually effective only in a large way , in forming public opinion , so that their results are rarely discernible in one 's own experience .

		Still the essays are interesting .

		They have something of a difficulty in that , though the author 's general opinion in each case is pretty clear , one does not always know just how he gets to it .

		We saw in the publishers ' announcement that the essay on `` The Psychology of the Suffra - gette '' was '' a logical plea for the extension of the suffrage to women . ''

		On a first reading we had supposed that its tendency was to show that the idea of extending the suffrage to women was erroneous and delusive .

		On re-reading it we found the logical plea to be as follows : the female desires to keep to herself the genuine type which the male , by reason of her charm , is always tending to assume ; if women vote they are free , if free they lose their charm , if they lose their charm men will not desire to approximate to them , which was the end to be desired .

		That such a result endangers the continu - ance of the human race is noted by Mr.
Macphail	PERSON	, who adds that this does not invalidate the chain of argument .

		While pursuing his logical course , Mr.
Macphail	PERSON	finds proof and illustration from a wide range of knowledge of the history of mankind .

		Indeed , his range is so wide that one sometimes has no idea of the connection of any given point with the general trend of the discussion .

		This makes hard reading now and then , but study will usually put one on the right track .

		If everyone would correct the fallacies or vulgar errors pointed out in this book , the world would be much better .

		It is to be hoped that Mr.
Macphail	PERSON	's treatment will tend to this result Inasmuch as we have long desired a consecutive and comprehensive treatment of athletics among the gifted people who have taught the western world so much , we are glad to welcome Mr.
E. Norman Gardiner	PERSON	's '' Greek Athletic Sports and Festivals '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book gives a scholarly presen - tation by a man who has both a genuine concern forathletics and a sound knowledgeof the sources for his study .

		The general reader will turn very rapidly many pages of the first part , which is mainly his - torical ; but he will doubtless linger over the second part , which takes up the principal athletic exercises one by one .

		However , the difference between the two main divisions is due rather to the nature of the themes than to inequality of execution , and the scholar will appreciate both .

		The il lustrations are admirably chosen and give valuable help at every A thletict in ancient
Greece	LOCATION	.

		turn .

		A good bibliography and an accurate index also deserve commendation .

		The volume is the latest of the '' Handbooks of Archaeology ami Anti- quities , '' and has the general mechanical excellence of the series .

		It is a little old-fashioned now to learn any lesson from the past ; but any thoughtful person with a care for the present and future of athletics will find in these pages a few stimulating suggestions , either implicit or offered directly .

		For instance : `` The nemesis of excess in athletics is specialization , '' sounds very pertinent today ; and there are many other examples .

		Moreover the book recalls the thought , so familiar to any student of his - tory , that for at least a few decades in
Greece	LOCATION	athletics were a genuine glory , the human frame an inspiration and delight .

		And a few of us dream that once more a popular life of physical exercise and athletic games may rise to such an excellence and efficiency as to inspire the pen of the poet and the chisel of the sculptor .

		But Greek history makes it convincingly clear that such a development is not to be expected as long as students are contented to take their exercises by `` rooting '' for their sturdy champions , and the general public by watching professional baseball and reading the colossal , grotesquely-written accounts thereof in the `` sport - ing '' columns of our newspapers .

		Mr.Doolev surprising how Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	's vein of humor holds out Familiar as we all have long sine ** become with the workings of his spacious intellect some fresh oddity of utterance is continually drop - ping from his lips of wisdom , and one is forced to smile in spite of oneself , if not to laugh outright `` Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	Says '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is the latest collection of his winged words , and in it of course are to be found comments and judgments on a great variety of current questions , such as divorces , the proposed tax on bachelors , woman suffrage , financial panics , expert testimony , and the Japanese war-scare .

		Even Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	and his five-foot book-shelf are brought under Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	's scrutiny .

		Of the works selected to fill that shelf he says : They are sthrong it is thrue .

		They will go to th ' head .

		An ' he done it He has th ' right idee .

		He real-izes that th ' first thing to have in a libry is a shelf .

		Fr ` ra time to time this can be decorated with lithrachure .

		But th ' shelf is the main thing . ''

		His comments on
Milton	PERSON	's '' Arryopatigica '' reveal the breadth and depth of Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	's education .

		On great ques - tions of international significance he has decided opinions of his own . ''


Hogan	PERSON	says we 've got to fight f ' r th ' supreemacy in th ' Passyfic .

		Much fightin ' I 'd do f ' r an ocean , but bavin ' taken th ' IMiilippeens , which ar-re a blamed nuisance , an ' th '
Iwich Islands	LOCATION	, that 're about as vallyable as a
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 337 toy balloon to a horse-shoer , we 've got to grab a lot iv th ' surroundin ' dampness to protect thim . ''

		Truly , Mr.
Dunnes	PERSON	' fund of Dooleyisms is inex - haustible .

		Nearly every book-lover and even '' and then bibliophile - keeps tucked away in a corner of his shelves the volume which first filled him with the love of reading and the passion for acquiring a library .

		Sometimes it is '' Sesame and Lilies '' ; sometimes Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's essay , or a battered old Disraeli ; sometimes a work of a totally different sort .

		But whatever its title , we can not help prizing such a volume as the virtual grandfather of our well-filled shelves ; and memories of its inspiration will lead us , if we be true lovers of books , to the purchase of
Burton	PERSON	and Mr.
Ireland	PERSON	's `` Enchiridion , '' and that great avatar of this class of literature , still supreme after the lapse of five centuries , the '' Philobiblon '' of
Richard de Bury	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Oscar Kuhns	PERSON	' '' Love of Books and Reading '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- is a welcome addition to this book-shelf ; and lucky will be the student who comes upon it in his forma - tive years .

		It can not fail to stimulate , inspired as it is by broad reading and a real enthusiasm for literature ; and it will serve to remind us all of many books we have missed . ''

		Read the great books '' is the gist of its counsel `` the books which make for humanistic culture '' ; but its wealth of literary anec - dote and its personal tone banish all triteness from a text which , after all , can not be over-emphasized in this age of periodical-reading .

		We need to be re - minded of the riches of our great literary classics .

		We need to be told of the gems that time can not destroy , now that so many are content to gather the surface outcrop of a baser carbon in the fields of contemporary literature ; and hence we can scarcely have too many books like this charming volume of Professor
Kuhns	PERSON	' , with its widely-gathered tributes to the love of books and the joys of reading .

		It is to be hoped that an index to the proper names may be added in a second printing .

		The Premier Prof essor
Edward E. Hale , Jr.	PERSON	, has of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's written for the interesting series administration .

		of `` American Crisis Biographies '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , a short life of
William H. Seward	PERSON	, who surely can be classed as a leader in some of our greatest national affairs .

		The book differs from other brief biographies of
Seward	ORGANIZATION	in its fuller account of the political movements and struggles in
New York	LOCATION	from
1830	DATE	, the author thinking , rightly , that he could make his work most useful as a study of
Seward	ORGANIZATION	's life and a contribution to the history of his times , by setting forth clearly the interesting and significant conditions in the state which has been the great political cauldron of the North ever since the government was established .

		The development of
Seward	ORGANIZATION	's political principles is traced clearly with his growth in influence and power until he became a figure of national prominence .

		When he is transferred to
Washington	LOCATION	as senator , the treatment becomes broader , and we are given a general sketch of the anti-slavery movement and its issue in the Civil War , with
Seward	ORGANIZATION	's part in the movement clearly set forth .

		And when he becomes what is sometimes called '' the Premier of Lincoln 's admin - istration , '' his part in affairs and his relations to his chief are fully and fairly given .

		It is possible that a perusal of the more recently published Diary of
Gideon Welles	PERSON	, whose distrust of Seward appears not altogether without foundation , might have modi - fied some of the positions taken by Professor
Hale	PERSON	.

		His book is well written , and the treatment is well balanced and comprehensive .

		Two literary ^ ne ^ tn6 ^ ar ^ est ; tas ^ s ^ at con - anthologies front the teacher of English litera - ture is that of persuading his students to do enough reading to get some sort of first-hand acquaintance with the authors they are supposed to be studying .

		The school or college library is apt to be a delusion , often providing a single copy of a work that is needed by a hundred students at the same time .

		Other accessible libraries do not help much , and few students have the necessary books at home .

		There appears to be no way out of the difficulty unless the literature can somehow be put into the hands of all the students at the same time .

		No text-book can be more welcome , then , than one that provides a great deal of well-selected literature at a moderate price , and two such books are now before us .

		The
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish `` Century Readings for a Course in English Literature , '' edited by Messrs.
Cunliffe	PERSON	, Pyre , and
Young	PERSON	, of the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	; and Messrs.
Scott	PERSON	,
Fores - man & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish `` Twelve Centuries of English Poetry and Prose , '' edited by Professor Newcomer and Miss
Alice Andrews	PERSON	.

		Both are big books , which is the main consideration , and neither is over - burdened with editorial matter , which is also a merit .

		The former extends to over eleven hundred , and the latter to over seven hundred two-columned pages .

		The only very noticeable difference between the two books is that the latter gives a larger pro- portion of space than the former to Old English literature .

		No better works of their class have yet been provided for their common purpose , but we still await the publishing enterprise that shall offer a still larger amount of matter for a still lower price .

		Somewhere between a book of this sort and the daily newspaper that can be purchased for
one cent	MONEY	there is an ideal mean of plentitude combined with cheapness that we hope will yet be reached .

		Socialistic leaders and tendencies .

		Though histories of socialism and books on socialistic writers are nu - merous , the little volume entitled `` Leaders of Socialism '' -LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
G. R. S. Taylor	PERSON	, will have its place , and this for three reasons .

		It is written in a pleasing style ; it describes the work and opinions of thirteen of the more recent socialists , beginning with
Owen	PERSON	and ending with
Blatchford	PERSON	; and , finally , it contains an introductory THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, esay of considerable though not great merit on leaders and leadership .

		Some readers will regret that French writers on socialism are represented only by Saint-Simon ,
Fourier	PERSON	, and
Jaures	PERSON	; while of the Germans there are only
Karl Marx	PERSON	and
Lassalle	LOCATION	.

		Such limitation of subject-matter is the more notice - able in view of the inclusion of the Belgian dreamer ,
Louis Blanc	LOCATION	.

		The English writers treated , besides those previously mentioned , are
William Morris	PERSON	, H. M. 1 1 v in 1 man .


Sidney Webb	PERSON	,
J. Kier Hardie	PERSON	, and
G. Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.

		The author regards
Owen	PERSON	as the true founder of socialism , and considers
Hyndman	PERSON	as the most important living English socialist The standpoint in this volume may be regarded as truly orthodox .

		The author does not appear to realize that the latest trends in socialism are to extol private property in the personal relationships of life and to regard the monogamous family as a social necessity .

		The scientifically-minded reader will find the book too much suffused with the spirit of Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	; the average reader will find it bright and entertaining .

		The second and third series of the & . ''

		Memoirs '' or journal of the
Duch	PERSON	- esse de
Dino	PERSON	-LRB- afterward Duchesse de
Talleyrand	LOCATION	et de
Sagan	PERSON	-RRB- , edited with notes and a biographical index by the
Princesse Radziwill	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- nte Castellane -RRB- , and published in this country by the
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	, fill each a closely-printed octavo of more than four hundred pages .

		The second volume covers the years 1836-40 , and the third the years 1841-50 .

		The diary entries are generally short , touch on contemporary politics and on persons of note , and were jotted down in various towns and large cities of
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
Austria	LOCATION	, the French and the German capitals being apparently the writer 's favorite resorts .

		The revolutionary scenes of
1848	DATE	naturally affect the Duchesse with horror , and inspire all sorts of gloomy forebodings .

		Her prejudices and friendships , and her nearness to the stirring events noted by her pen , of course incapacitate her for the office of dispassionate his - torian , although her pages are of the stuff from which histories are made .

		The notes , indices , and appended matter , written or selected by the careful editor , are of use for a scholarly mastery of the volume * .

		\ OM > .

		`` Anti-Matrimony ^ '' Mr.
Percy Mackaye	PERSON	's satirical drama now nmning in
New York	LOCATION	, will be issued in book form this month by the
Frederick A. Stokes Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		An important literary biography is announced in Mr.
Frederick Lawton	PERSON	's '' Balzac , '' soon to be issued by the
Wessels & Bissell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume will contain a number of interesting illustrations .

		To the series of '' Little Books on Art '' -LRB- McClnrg -RRB- , a miniature treatise on '' Christian Symbolism '' has just been added .

		The author is Mrs.
Henry Jenner	PERSON	, and there are twoscore of well-chosen illustrations .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's new collection of stories , `` Rewards and Fairies , '' wakes a prompt appearance in the hand - some ' Outward Bound '' edition , published by Messrs. Si-nhiicr .

		It constitutes
Volume XXV	ORGANIZATION	.

		of the set .

		It is some time since we had a new book from Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	.

		He has been engaged for a year or so past on a new story that is now nearing completion , and will make its appearance presently under the title of '' Razunov . ''

		Mr.
Edgar Beecher Bronson	PERSON	's entertaining '' Reminis - cences of a Ranchman , '' formerly published by the
McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	, now appears in a new edition , with some added chapters , bearing the imprint of
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume called '' Vanitas : Polite Stories '' is added by the
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	to their reissue of the books of ''
Vernon Lee	PERSON	. ''

		Besides the three stories hitherto included under the title , there is now a fourth , `` A Frivolous Conversion , '' here printed for the first time .

		The perennially popular German-American dialect verses of Mr.
Charles Follen Adams	PERSON	have lately been put forth by the
Lothrop	LOCATION	,
Lee & Shepard Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a new edition entitled
Yawcob Strauss	PERSON	and Other Poems . ''

		The familiar line drawings of the earlier editions are retained in this .

		`` The Book Monthly `` of
London	LOCATION	signalizes its seventh birthday by a considerable enlargement in size and improvement in editorial and mechanical features .

		We can cordially recommend this sprightly magazine to every American reader who cares to keep in touch with affairs of the English book world .

		Professor
F. W. Taussig	PERSON	's `` The Tariff History of the
United States	LOCATION	'' is the soundest discussion of the subject ever written , and has had frequent revisions .

		The latest of them -LRB- the fifth -RRB- is brought down to date by a chapter on the Aldrich-Payne Act of
1909	DATE	.

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons are the publishers .

		`` The American Jewish Year Book '' for
5671	DATE	, sent us by the
Jewish Publication Society of America	ORGANIZATION	, has for its special feature this year an eighty-page article In Defense of the Immigrant . ''

		The other contents of the work remain much the same as in previous annual issues .

		Mr.
Herbert Friedenwald	PERSON	is the editor .

		It is interesting to note in connection with the Hon.
John Redmond	PERSON	's tour in this country in the interests of Irish Home Rule , that the
Frederick A. Stokes Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		announces for publication his new book '' Home Rule , '' containing all the speeches delivered during his entire parliamentary career .

		An introduction gives a short summary of the history of
Ireland	LOCATION	's struggle .

		Lovers of the late
Sarah Orne Jewett	PERSON	's inimitable
New England	LOCATION	stories will be grateful for the attractive new edition of her best work just issued by the
Houghton Miftlin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The edition is in seven small volumes , handsomely printed and bound , and containing photo - gravure frontispieces .

		A hitherto unpublished story of Miss
Jewett	PERSON	's is included in the last volume of the set .

		In view of the approaching centenary of the birth of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	special interest attaches to the ''
Centen	PERSON	- ary Edition '' of the novelist 's complete works , which Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons are bringing out , in conjunction with
Messrs. Chapman & Hall , Ltd.	ORGANIZATION	, of
London	LOCATION	.

		In this edition all the prefaces , dedications , and notices which appeared in the various editions dur - ing the author 's lifetime will be given , together with all the original illustrations to which he gave his approval .

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 339 The illustrations are being reproduced by a special new process from the original steel plates and wood-blocks , and will number close upon seven hundred .

		The type used is large and readable , the paper of excellent quality , the binding handsome , and the price unusually reasonable .

		Mr.
Prentiss Cummings	PERSON	is the latest translator of the '' Iliad . ''

		He chooses the hexameter verse , a procedure which he defends at length aud with considerable skill .

		The maiu novelty of his translation is that he has made it frankly an abridgment , omitting all the dull and otherwise inferior parts .

		By this heroic measure , he has reduced the epic to about one-half its full dimensions .

		The work occupies two volumes , and is published by
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		School reading books recently published by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	include ''
Peter	PERSON	of
New Amster	LOCATION	- dam , '' by Mr.
James Otis ; Cooper	PERSON	's '' The Last of the Mohicans , '' adapted to the use of children by Miss
Margaret N. Haight	PERSON	; and `` Stories of American Dis - coverers for Little Americans , '' by
Miss Rose Lucia	ORGANIZATION	.

		From the same publishers we have a book of '' Easy French Prose Composition , '' by
Miss H. A. Guerber	PERSON	.

		As a companion to the various '' Standard '' musical guides that he has published from time to time , and that have been so helpful to concert and opera-goers , Mr.
George	PERSON	,
P. Upton	PERSON	has now given us a volume of '' Standard Musical Biographies , '' dealing with over a hundred composers , and very interestingly illustrated .

		Messrs.
A. C. McClurg	PERSON	publish this work , as well as its numerous predecessors .

		A new volume of the '' Original Narratives of Early American History '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- gives us a selection of `` Narratives of
Early Maryland	LOCATION	, 1633-1684 , '' edited by Mr.
Clayton Colman Hall	PERSON	.

		There are sixteen num - bers in the volume , beginning with Lord
Baltimore	LOCATION	's '' Instructions '' and Father White 's '' Brief e Relation , '' and ending with extracts from the journal of
George Fox	ORGANIZATION	and reports of the negotiations between the third
Baron Baltimore	PERSON	and
William Penn.	PERSON	.

		Miss
Clara Sherwood Stevens	PERSON	must be an ardent admirer of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, for only to such would the thought have occurred to ransack his writings for '' elegant extracts , '' as if he were a brilliant stylist instead of being a writer of very dull and uninspired prose .

		The result of this undertaking is given us in '' Passages from the Philosophy of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, '' a volume published by Mr.
Thomas B. Mosher	PERSON	in the distinctive form which he has made his own .

		The
Neale Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, are engaged in producing a ten-volume edition of '' The Collected Works of
Ambrose Bierce	PERSON	, '' an imperfectly appreciated genius of the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	.

		His admirers go far in praising him , Mr.
Markham	PERSON	saying that '' he has his seat in the remote and ruby-litten chamber of
Hoffman	PERSON	and
Poe	PERSON	, '' and Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	that he '' has the best brutal imagination of any man in the English-speaking race . ''

		Mr.
Bierce	PERSON	is editing his own works , which makes the publication authentic .

		The first volume , now at hand , is certainly a handsome and dignified piece of book - making .

		It was only in
1900	DATE	that Mr.
Bertram Dobell	PERSON	announ - ced his discovery of the unpublished works of the seventeenth century author
Thomas Traherne	PERSON	.

		Now Mr.
H. I. Bell	PERSON	has had the good fortune to discover an unknown and unpublished MS. of Traherne in the British , Museum , evidently prepared by the poet 's brother for publication .

		The MS. , which is entitled '' Poems of Felicity : Vol .

		I. , containing Divine Reflections on the Native Objects of the Infant-Ey , '' contains thirty - nine new poems .

		The '' Poems of Felicity '' will be issued immediately by the
Oxford Press	ORGANIZATION	in its '' Tudor and Stuart Library . ''

		The
November	DATE	issue of '' The Century '' marks the fortieth anniversary of the magazine , and contains as a special feature twenty pages of text and pictures , mar - shalling some of the magazine 's more notable contribu - tions to the progress of illustration during its history .

		There is also an interesting `` Retrospect of the Century '' in the '' Topics of the Times '' department .

		The open - ing chapters of Mr.
Robert Hichens	PERSON	's new novel , `` The Dweller on the Threshold '' appear in this issue .

		Of the late
Russell Sturgis	PERSON	's numerous contributions to the literature of his chosen field , no other made so varied and direct an appeal to the art lover as his two - volume work entitled `` The Artist 's Way of Working , '' published in
1905	DATE	.

		In reissuing this work at one-third of the original price ,
Messrs. Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have now provided an opportunity which should not fail to be liberally taken advantage of .

		The entire text and all of the illustrations are retained in the present reprint .

		Mr.
E. K. Chambers	PERSON	, one of the foremost Shake - spearian scholars of
England	LOCATION	, has now completed his edi - tion of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, a task of ten years .

		The
H. M. Cald	PERSON	- well Company have secured the American rights of this '' Red Letter Edition , '' as it is called , and will issue it at once in thirty-nine dainty pocket volumes .

		An ex - cellent feature , both useful and ornamental , of this edition is that the names of the characters are printed in full in red-lettering , so that the reader is spared the task of deciphering clumsy abbreviations .

		To each play Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	has contributed an introduction .

		The latest volume of
Bohn	PERSON	's Library -LRB- Bell-Macmillan -RRB- consists of More 's '' Utopia '' in the contemporary trans - lation of
Ralph Robinson	PERSON	, with
Roper 's Life of More	ORGANIZATION	and a selection from his letters .

		The text , edited by Mr.
George Sampson	PERSON	, is practically identical with that of the folio reprint in the ''
Chiswick Library of Noble Authors	ORGANIZATION	, '' issued in
1903	DATE	.

		To the present edition a rather trite introduction is contributed by Mr.
A. Guth	PERSON	- kelch , who also supplies a useful bibliography .

		The Latin text of the first edition is given in an appendix .

		Like all of Messrs.
Bell	PERSON	's publications , the volume is very attractively produced .

		Our ambassadors to
England	LOCATION	have usually been men who could represent worthily the best of
America	LOCATION	, and it has been taken as an important part of their duty to interpret their country to Englishmen .

		Mr.
Choate	PERSON	went to
England	LOCATION	with a fine reputation as a graceful and eloquent speaker , and was called on to speak on many important occasions .

		The addresses that he gave are now collected under the title ``
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, and Other Addresses in
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The address on
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	is already on the way to become a classic , both for substance and for form .

		The addresses on
Franklin and Hamilton	PERSON	, and on the
Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, accomplish the writer 's purpose of making the people of another country acquainted in a general way with those great Americans and with our greatest political inven - tion .

		There are eleven papers in all ; besides those named , those on
Emerson , Education	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	, and other subjects , are slighter in structure , well adapted to the occasions when they were given , but hardly of per - manent value .

		The story is inexpressibly sad , but sadder still is the knowledge that it is true to life true not only in the exceptional case , but in hundreds and doubtless thousands of cases .

		The author has handled a difficult subject with the utmost of delicacy consistent with perfect frankness .

		While telling his story fearlessly , he does so without sensationalism .

		I believe that the conditions with which the book deals must be generally known before they will be improved , and that the publicity thus given them will be of great value . ''

		This great , sincere novel is making the profoundest impression all over the country .

		Its sales are steadily growing in every direction ; it is making the whole nation think .

		It presents us wtth the first adequate treatment of many neglected parts of our literary history , and it throws new light on many old themes ... The editors deserve all thanks , and the critic who feels inclined to quarrel with this point or that in their methods or conclusions will be humilated and silenced when he remembers that this is the first attempt by a body of scholars to tell the story of our literature on a scale worthy of its greatness .

		`` A clear and convincing estimate , and one in which everything that is of outstanding significance is skillfully disentangled from the vast mass of subsidiary clues to interpretation .

		It seems to us that this is the supreme merit of the volume , the discrimination and judgment with which it brings to a focus the gradual evolution of a language and the wonderful outburst of creative achievement in letters under the Tudors . ''

		THE LITERATURE OF THE SOUTH By
MONTROSE J. MOSES	PERSON	`` This splendid volume of 500 page * is the first complete , vital , honest recapitulation of the achievement of the South in American letters that we have yet had , and , as a work of interpretative criticism , it is one of the sanest , most wholesome , most convincing books that has appeared in this country for some time .

		Mr.
Moses	PERSON	, while confining himself to a small section of our literature , has set a noble example of how literary history should be written and of how literary valuations should be established ... '' His book is earnest and spirited , marked by fine judgment , by clear insight , by a wholesomeness of candor and a fairness of verdict which leaves finally a just conception on the mind of the reader ... '' To read this book in its completeness is to get a fine idea of the harmony of life and literature in the South , and a more perfect understanding of the men and women who with splendid enthusiasm sought to build up a literature out of their lives and interests , to get an understanding of the handicap which was placed upon them by the fixedness of their lives and the imperviousness of their condition to in - novation by the too placid and satisfied intellectual foundations of their environment .

		389 A PROPHET OF RIGHTEOUSNESS .

		The great preacher and even greater citizen whose half - century of life was ended half a cen - tury ago is commemorated during the present week by exercises held in
Chicago	LOCATION	, enlisting the services of leaders of religious and secular thought gathered from far and wide to honor a great spiritual force .

		If ever a man deserved well of his fellows , it was
Theodore Parker	PERSON	, whose strong and noble personality shines in an ever clearer light as the age in which he lived and labored recedes from our view .

		The pre - sent celebration is significant of several things .

		It betokens the posthumous reward of which a good man is assured however prejudice may withhold it during his lifetime .

		It shows the softening of old animosities under the healing influence of the years .

		It indicates the widen - ing of the thoughts of men with the process of the suns and the slow but sure advance of liberalism in the sphere of religious discussion .

		The work of such men is like the ministry of the Red Cross upon the battle-field , forecasting the transition of the world from the age in which warfare is possible to the age in which smiling harvests shall enter into lasting possession of the erst ensanguined meadows .

		Incidentally , the fact that
Chicago	LOCATION	rather than
Boston	LOCATION	is the place in which
Parker	PERSON	's memory is this week chiefly honored is highly significant , denoting as it does the occupancy by the idealism which he preached of what was to him only a frontier outpost of the national civilization .

		Prejudice dies hard , and the bitterness with which
Parker	PERSON	was assailed while he lived still finds an occasional echo .

		The invitation to join in the celebration sent to such as might pre - sumably wish to cooperate elicited a curious variety of responses .

		About fifteen per cent of the whole number invited replied with an uncompromising '' No . ''

		The others expressed approval with varying degrees of cordiality , ranging from unqualified enthusiasm to very reserved and guarded forms of acceptance .

		One clergyman wrote : '' The world owes a vast debt to
Theodore Parker	PERSON	.

		He was the prophet of everything large and catholic and beautiful in the religious consciousness and life .

		He richly deserves our reverence and love . ''

		But another member of the clerical profession -LRB- evidently THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, turning one eye in thought upon the congrega - tion -RRB- wrote : '' I would be misunderstood if I should sign the call .

		Kindly excuse me , and allow me to attend as many sessions as I may be able when the meetings are held . ''

		Between these two expressions of opinion there is a con - siderable difference , but a still wider gulf exists between either of them and the following truly '' moss-back '' clerical utterance : My convic - tion is that the world would be better off if
Theodore Parker	PERSON	had never lived nor written .

		His denial of the fundamentals of historic Christianity has , in my judgment , been a curse to
New England	LOCATION	, and all who have been in - fluenced by it .

		While
New England	LOCATION	has grown in head , it has decayed at heart , through the influence of leaders like
Theodore Parker	PERSON	. ''

		Such words as these , which the prodigious Cot - ton Mather would feelingly endorse , could he revisit the glimpses of the moon and learn the degenerate doctrines now preached in his own pulpit , show that the missionary opportunities of liberalism are still considerable .

		But we are not sure that we are not more in sympathy with this attitude than with that of the man who , for the sake of appearances , would rather not stand up and be counted .

		The student who delights in historical paral - lels will find it interesting to compare the cases of
Theodore Parker	PERSON	and
Thomas Paine	PERSON	.

		Both professed substantially the same form of Unit - arian belief ; both boldly proclaimed the Rights of Man and served -LRB- like
Heine	PERSON	-RRB- as valiant sol - diers in the War of Liberation ; both incurred that odium theologicum which holds no slander too vile , and no weapon too base , to direct against the assailants of the citadel of orthodoxy .

		And both now have their meed of honor , tardily bestowed and not yet in full measure , as patriots and thinkers who lived before the time was ripe for them , who knew ingratitude and mis - representation and calumny , and who gladly suffered these things for the faith that was theirs .

		It has taken a long while for the mists to clear away from their figures , and for their com - manding stature to become fully revealed .

		That fine old specimen of the crusted Tory , Governor
Berkeley	LOCATION	of
Virginia	LOCATION	, complained of those among the clergy who indulged in the pernicious practice of applying their pulpit teachings to practical affairs and questions of the day .

		His advice to them was that they should pray more and preach less .

		The
New Englanders	LOCATION	who found their consciences un - comfortably troubled by
Theodore Parker	PERSON	's exhortations would have thought Governor
Berkeley	LOCATION	a very fountain-head of wisdom .

		For
Parker	PERSON	always went straight to the point .

		`` I have preached against intemperance , showing the monstrous evil of drunkeness , the material and moral ruin it works so widely .

		My first offence in preaching came when I first spoke on the misery occasioned by this ghastly vice .

		The victims of it sat before me , and were in great wrath ; they never forgave me . ''

		And so it was with the sin of covetousness , and the tyranny of the rich over the poor , and the lack of in - spiring ideals in education , and the subjection of women , and the exaltation of law above justice , and the worship of political idols with feet of clay , and the wickedness of war , and the infamy of slavery , that '' sum of all villainies , '' and the errors of the ecclesiastical theology , the most fatal mischiefs in the land . ''

		These matters are in their nature contentious , and their discussion in the light of truth and reason during the forties and fifties was a braver thing than it would be now .

		But
Parker	PERSON	never shrank from what he believed to be his duty as a spiritual leader , and while angry passions rose and surged about him , held steadily to his course .

		It is for this forthright manliness and sincerity that we honor him to-day , and realize how much he helped in the crusade against the evils which chiefly enlisted his voice and pen .

		We have called
Parker	PERSON	a prophet of right - eousness , for in that character he may now clearly be viewed .

		We hear much mouthing about righteousness in our own day and in one notable instance but what lip-service it often appears when we attempt to square it with the practice of those who preach it !

		In
Parker	PERSON	's case there was no such antagonism between thought and act , and his life was the exemplifi - cation of his creed .

		He not only declaimed against intemperance and corrupt politics and evil social conditions , but he was an active worker in the cause of reform .

		He was not content to inveigh against slavery from the pulpit , but when occasion offered he aided with his own arm in the rescue of the fugitive slave .

		And he was a prophet because the eternal verities were apparent to him .

		In every cause for which he wrought , time has shown more and more distinctly that his judgment was sound and his vision clear ; the path of progress has been ever since , and still remains , in almost every case that which he indicated to a stubborn and incredulous public .

		A bare twelvemonth before his death , he could make the proud boast that a subsequent half-century has amply justi - fied : '' In the last dozen years , I think scarcely

		THE DIAL 363 any American , not holding a political office , has touched the minds of so many men , by freely speaking on matters of the greatest importance , for this day and for ages to come .

		I am sure I have uttered great truths , and such are never spoken in vain . ''

		In his discourse upon the life of
Webster	PERSON	,
Parker	PERSON	said : '' The two chief forms of American action are Business and Politics , the commer - cial and the political form .

		The two humbler forms of our activity , the Church and the Press , the ecclesiastic and the literary form , are subservient to the others . ''

		When near the end of his days , he amplified this statement as follows : 1 .

		There is the organized trading power having its home in the great towns , which seeks gain with small regard to that large justice which represents alike the mutual interests and duties of all men , and to that humanity which interposes the affectional instinct when conscience is asleep .

		This power seems to control all things , amenable only to the all-mighty dollar .

		2 .

		The organized political power , the parties in office , or seeking to become so .

		This makes the stat - utes , but is commonly controlled by the trading power , and has all of its faults often intensified ; yet it seems amenable to the instincts of the people , who , on great occasions , sometimes interfere and change the traders ' rule .

		3 .

		The organized ecclesiastical power , the various sects which , though quite unlike , yet all mainly agree in their fundamental principle of vicariousness an alleged revelation , instead of actual human faculties , salvation from God 's wrath and eternal ruin , by the atoning blood of crucified God .

		This is more able than either of the others ; and though often despised , in a few years can control them both .

		In this generation no American politician dares affront it .

		4 .

		The organized literary power , the endowed colleges , the periodical press , with its triple multitude of journals commercial , political , theological and sectarian tracts .

		This has no original ideas , but diffuses the opinions of the other powers whom it represents , whose will it serves , whose kaleidoscope it is . ''

		Could anyone make a keener and truer analysis than this of the
America	LOCATION	of our own day ?

		We point to it in justification -LRB- if any be needed -RRB- of the present celebration of the life of
Theodore Parker	PERSON	, preacher , patriot , and prophet of right - eousness .

		A number of the eminent men who replied to the invitation which asked for their cooperation in the memorial exercises of this week confessed that they knew next to nothing at first hand of
Parker	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		We would like to suggest , in closing these remarks , that the new centennial edition of his collected writings consists largely of matter which is by no means outdated by the lapse of years , and which is still capable of serving as a fountain of inspiration for all generous souls .

		THE CENTENARY OF MUSSET * All the dreams of French Romanticism are re - called by the centenary of
Alfred de Musset	ORGANIZATION	; for the life of this poet might be said to typify the history of the
Romantic School	ORGANIZATION	.

		Never did the genius of '' Young
France	LOCATION	'' come to such a sudden flowering as in
1830	DATE	; and this spirit of youth Musset person - ifies in all its vivid brevity .

		A nervous , precociously brilliant boy , he recited his first verses , at seventeen , in the salon of
Charles Nodier	PERSON	; and the long-haired Romanticists petted and spoiled the youth , uncon - scious that he was to become their enfant terrible .

		Famous at twenty , Musset lived the life of a dandy , dividing his time between society , his cafe '' , and the writing of Byronic verses .

		A gay young Epicurean , he remained heart-whole and fancy-free until he met
George Sand	PERSON	, in his twenty-second year .

		How he fell in love with that passionate
Egeria	LOCATION	, eight years his senior , and how his fickle muse betrayed and abandoned him within the year , everyone knows in this age of literary gossip ; and everyone knows how this catastrophe gave usMusset 's greatest poems , written in anguish and blotted with his tears .

		The permanent effects of this experience upon the poet 's character have been variously estimated , some critics entirely absolving George Sand from blame ; but however that may be , it is true that Musset never outgrew his disillusionment .

		A victim of Romantic ideals , we find him , at thirty , exhausted in mind and shipwrecked in morals , yet destined none the less to drag his genius for sixteen years through
Paris	LOCATION	gut - ters , until the curtain fell upon the sordid tragedy .

		It is not an edifying story , especially in its piti - ful ending .

		A veritable spoiled child , as M. Faguet calls him ,
Alfred de Musset	PERSON	remained a spoiled child to the end of his days .

		To a nature such as his , life itself could teach little or nothing .

		A voluptuary as well as a dreamer , all that he got out of his search after happiness was a philosophy of disillu - sion ; and his was a despair which lacked the force to take refuge in the objective world .

		He could not cry with Candide , '' II faut cultiver notre jardin . ''

		And so we feel that one thing was lacking to his destiny the early death which consecrates a poet as dear to the gods .

		Why was he not taken away at thirty , to join the immortal company of Chatter - ton ,
Keats	PERSON	, and
Shelley	PERSON	?

		Alas for Musset , in his later years his poetic muse had all but left him , and the muse of debauch rarely beguiled his pen .

		In a life begun under such brilliant auspices , one can not but regret so sordid an ending .

		Yet for all this , for all that he died at forty-six ,
Alfred de Musset	PERSON	takes his place in the history of French literature as the poet of Youth .

		It wells up in his early plays and verses like the sap of
April	DATE	, youth in all its exuberance , effervescent with energy , over - flowing with the restless fancies of an awakened imagination and a quenchless curiosity . ''

		One must love many things in life , '' cries the poet , uncon - * Born
December 11 , 1810	DATE	.

		THE DIAL -LSB- Nor , 16 , sciously paraphrasing the Italian street-song trans - lated by
Rossetti	PERSON	`` II faut dans oe bM monde aimer beaucoup de choaea , Pour savoir , aprea tout , ee qu'on aime le inieux ; Lea bonbons , 1 ` Ocean , le jeu , 1 ` axur de * cieux , Le * femmea , lea chevaux , lea lanriers et lea roaea . ''

		All of youth 's thirst for experience burns in the early work of
Alfred de Mussel	ORGANIZATION	.

		All of youth 's changing moods are there sentiment , passion , and revolt ; and , playing over all , the prankish humor of a young faun .

		Even opposite * find place in its variety of moods , for in that first volume are revealed a lighter hearted
Don Juan	PERSON	and a lesser Lamartine . ''

		En litterature on est toujours fils de quelqu'un '' ; and
Byron	PERSON	, we must remember , lay beside
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Schiller	PERSON	on the table de rut it of the French Romanticists .

		Mussel , however , never consciously imitated anyone ; indeed , he did not need to .

		There were so many themes to weave into plays or poems : love and life , and all the emo - tions of youth .

		There were so many moods , so many measures ; and his lute knew them all in turn .

		All the wit and mischief of the
Paris	LOCATION	gamin bubble up in the '' Ballade a la Lune '' ; all the fervor of a boy 's revolt against convention overflows in `` Mardoche '' and `` Les Marrons du feu . ''

		There is melancholy , too , in some of his verses ; but we need not take it very seriously . ''

		It is so pleasant to think oneself unhappy , '' says Musset in his auto - biographical novel , - when one is only empty and bored . ''

		Lamartine , of course , had made pessimism fashionable , and no one could escape it in
1830	DATE	; but if our young poet yielded a moment to its spell , his real attitude may be seen in his hero
Rafael	PERSON	, who has rejected melancholy and u given his life to the lazy god of Fancy . ''

		In fact ,
Don Rafael	PERSON	is no other than his creator Musset , in all the pride and spirit of his twentieth year .

		Of course , all of these early poems deal with love .

		Inexperienced as yet , Musset already reveals his temperament ; through all the objectless passion of these verses we see the disillusionment that must come .

		At twenty-two , his knowledge of love is mainly literary ; and if we turn for its sources to his favorite books , we shall find that they were the Decameron and ''
Manon Lescaut	PERSON	, '' the novels of Cn ` billon and
Louvet de Couvray	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such , alas , was Mussel 's early reading ; and this is why our poet 's ideal of love , as it appears throughout his plays and poems , reveals itself as a curious mixture of Romantic aspiration and the pagan spirit of the Regency or of the Renaissance .

		`` An Italian of the Renaissance , '' M. Se ` che ' calls him ; and the frontispiece of Mme.
Barine	PERSON	's biography represents the young poet in the costume of an Italian page .

		Let us retain this phrase , admirably borne out as it is by
Mussel	ORGANIZATION	's preference for Italian subjects in his plays ; for it becomes pregnant with meaning when we consider all that this pagan spirit brought him later , in Dead-Sea fruit .

		At twenty-two , however , we have only a boy 's vague craving for passion , and the love of love as he imagined it as every poet had imagined it , one might say , since
J. J. Rousseau	PERSON	and Chateaubriand .

		The young Musset is all eager - ness to live , to strip the tree of knowledge with both hands .

		He would have liked to be
Don Juan	PERSON	, as he says in his '' Namouna '' ; and indeed lie was himself his very hero
Don Juan	PERSON	haunted through all his loves by an unattainable ideal .

		Such is the Musset '' before
George Sand	PERSON	. ''

		The Musset that came after is a more tragic figure , and the love he sings , in the splendid '' Nuila '' that voice his passion and his despair , is now a terrible reality .

		No wilful fancy of a sensuous imagination is this , but love in the presence , burning with all the passionate regret of a wrecked hope and a shat - tered ideal .

		In '' Souvenir '' we have a calmer mood , love in its regret for a past idealized by time and in the matchless stanzas to la Malibran , love thrilled with the tragedy of death and ihe longing for an immortal life .

		In an earlhlier sense Musset might have said with Dante : '' Io mi ton un che , quando Amor mi apira , ooto , I a quel modo Che ddtta dentro , vo significando . ''

		His is no divine
Beatrice	PERSON	, certainly ; yet none the less , in many lines of his best poems he did at least catch a glimpse of '' L'Amor ohe maove il sole e 1 ` altre atelle . ''

		We have here the significance of
Alfred de Mussel	ORGANIZATION	in the poetry of
France	LOCATION	.

		No other poet so exalts love into a religion .

		No other poet believes in it so absolutely , or celebrates the necessity of belief in such an endless hymn .

		Let us quote his credo , as we find it in '' La Nuit d'AoOt '' : '' Puiaqae , jusqu'aux roc hers tout se change en pouasiere ; Puisque tout raeurt ce soir pour revivre demain ; Puisque c ` eat un engrais que le meurtre et la guerre Pniaque sur une torn be on voit sortir de terre Le brin d'herbe sacree qni nous donne le pain ; '' O mnae !

		qne m ` imporfe on la mort on la vie ?

		J'aime , et je veux pfilir ; j' aime et je veux souffrir ; J'ainie , et pour un baiser je donne mon genie ; J'aime , et je veux sentir sur ma joue amaigrie Ruisaeler une source impossible a tarir . ''

		J'aime , et je veux chanter la joie et la pareaae , Ma folle experience et mes soucis d'un jour , Et je veux raconter et re ` pe ` ter sans oomo Qu'aprea avoir jure '' de vivre sans maltreats J'ai fait sentient de vivre et de mourir d'amour . ''

		De ` ponille devant tous 1 ` orgueil qni te de ` vore , Cu?ur gonfle '' d'amertume et qui t ` ea cru ferine '' ; Aime et tu renaitraa ; faia-toi fleur pour 4clore , Aprea avoir aouffert , il faut souffrir encore , II faut aimer sans oeaae , aprea avoir aim * ' . ''

		For the Anglo-Saxon , with his virile conception of life , there is a moral weakness implied in this idolatry of emotion ; it is especially evident in the second stanza .

		But we are not dealing here with Musset as a moral creature , but as a poet ; and the most severe of critics can not deny that in this un - divided worship lay material for splendid flight * of impassioned lyricism .

		His religion of love made MdSM-t as ; i port , it made him a * a playwright ami a novelist ; and his life-long devotion to this ideal gave us a volume which in the range and depth of
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 365 its passion might almost be called the breviary of love .

		The very perfume of departed youth breathes from the pages of these plays and poems , and the odor of spring-time clings to them like the scent of
April	DATE	violets .

		Some would object that they are hot - house violets , but surely that does not alter their color or spoil their delicate perfume .

		Well !

		we can see now why Musset was the idol of his contemporaries ; we can understand why his admirers once outnumbered
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's .

		We realize why his comedies and dramatic proverbs , in which he catches a breath of the true Shakespearian fancy , still hold their own upon the boards of the Come `` die Franeaise .

		`` It is not enough to be ad - mired , '' he says in one of his poems , '' one must be loved too . ''

		Alfred de Musset was both admired and loved . ''

		The favorite poet of
France	LOCATION	, '' as
Taine	PERSON	called him years ago , his popularity , tempor - arily obscured by the symbolists and the
Banville	PERSON	school , lies safe in the hearts of the older genera - tion .

		No permanent eclipse can fall upon this singer of youth .

		No change of literary fashion can overthrow a poet who , dandy of letters as he was , never wrote a line save in absolute sincerity to his mood .

		We wonder so often , when reading
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, whether his finest flights are not merely feats of rhetorical maestria .

		Not so with Musset .

		His vision of the poet is the pelican tearing out its heart to feed its young ; this is his secret of truth in art : '' Ah !

		f rappe-toi le cceur , c'est la qu'est le ge ` nie , C'est Ih qu'est la pitie '' , la souffrance et 1 ` amour . ''

		This advice to a fellow-poet was written in
1832	DATE	, several months before Musset met George Sand .

		How much Musset owed to Sand , how much his art gained from the woman who made him suffer , has long been dinned into our ears ; Mme. Sand 's admirers have even said that she taught his pen sincerity and truth .

		To us , perhaps , the fact might seem probable ; the mad irony and licence of his earlier poems ring false to Anglo-Saxon ears .

		We prefer the sweet seriousness of the English muses ; and
Byron	PERSON	, that great nonconformist , has always been more popular on the Continent than in
America	LOCATION	or at home .

		But Frenchmen are not Anglo-Saxons , and few Frenchmen would admit that the use of irony evinces insincerity , or indicates aught but the expression of an ironical mood .

		No !

		wanton as she is , Musset 's early muse is the poet 's very self ; all that suffering did for him later was to absorb him into a great experience , absorb him so fully that the sprites of wit and irony were for the time forgotten .

		For the born ironist , sorrow is the ulti - mate reality ; and sorrow alone , by taking from him the power of self-detachment , can give his art unity of emotional effect .

		So much , at least ,
George Sand	PERSON	did for
Alfred de Musset	ORGANIZATION	.

		She made him suffer , and the world is the gainer by a few splendid lyrics .

		But the price he paid for their perfection !

		That high lyrical note , of course , could not last ; it perished with the `` Nuits , '' with the verses to
Lamartine	PERSON	and to la Malibran , and with '' Souvenir . ''

		And the poet , unable to readjust himself td reality , fell back into irony in his later verses , an irony deepened by disappointed hopes , the residuum of disillusion and departed dreams .

		It is a very human story after all , and the note of bitter experience that runs through Musset 's plays and verse touches us , almost in spite of our - selves , with a sense of pity and regret for a talent thrown away .

		We have all dreamed of a fairer life than this is ; we have all given voice to Musset 's cry : '' Ah !

		si la reverie e `` tait toujours possible !

		Et si le sonnambule , en e * tendant la main , Ne trouvait pas toujours la nature inflexible Qui lui heurte le front centre un pilier d'airain . ''

		We have all bruised our foreheads against the pil - lars of bronze ; and most of us have learned to ac - cept the facts of life into our philosophy .

		Alfred de Musset never did .

		Till the end of his days he kept clutching at the soap-bubbles of illusion , never daunted by the drops of water he received in his eager eyes .

		He was predestined to suffer , to suffer and to succumb .

		Moreover , his impressionability made him the plaything of life .

		His acces de nerfs in his boyhood , of which we read in
Barine	LOCATION	, would be enough to explain his nature , did we need evid - ence to convince us of his physical unfitness for a life of self-control .

		For Musset 's final shipwreck , like
Poe	PERSON	's , is implied in his character .

		It lies revealed in the mad objectless passion of his early verses , through which the lust of life in all its ful - ness already burns ; the wood that feeds it still green , but sending up even then such a feverish flame !

		He was , in fine , a Romantic epicurean ; and an epicurean to whom even pain was preferable to the tedium of stilled emotions .

		And if anything more were needed to exhibit this hedonism , solely concerned with getting every emotion out of youth while it lasted donee virenti canities abest we may surely find it in the verses `` A une Morte , '' whose melody leads so wonderfully up to the almost intolerable pathos of the final chord : ''
Elle	PERSON	est morte et n ' a point ve ` cu .

		Elle faisait semblant de vivre .

		De son main est tombe '' le livre Dans lequel elle n ' a rien lu . ''

		The obverse of the picture has the added pathos of reality .

		When Musset wrote these lines , he had lived , and his genius was all but dead .

		His book '' le livre du cceur , '' as he called it , was all too soon read through , read and re-read until all meaning had faded from the words .

		He had realized , by this time , that one can not re-live an impression ; that the emotions wear away in successive experiences , as a gold coin loses the freshness of its imprint and its first soft bloom . ''

		Everything passes away like smoke , '' he cries , '' everything except ennui . ''

		His heart is now `` a solitude , '' `` a tomb '' ; his brain '' an empty fire-place filled with ashes . ''

		He envies Nodier , thirty years older than himself , the eternal youth which bubbles up in his '' Stances '' verses 366 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, written to
Masset	LOCATION	in the year
Nodier	ORGANIZATION	died .

		And , scarcely oat of his twenties , he falls back upon the thought that '' happy memories are , perhaps , more real than happiness itself . ''

		When death overtook him , in

		THE CLASSICS IN THE SLUMS might be thought unlikely to find readers , but they find what is even more astonishing buyers ; and as the books are bought chiefly in unornamental editions , it must be for purposes of reading rather than display .

		... LIBRARY SCIENCE AND BIBLIOGRAPHY IN
ITALY	LOCATION	appear to be in a sad state of neglect .

		In view of the coming exposition at
Turin	LOCATION	and the proposed exhibition of books in connection with it , the Italian government appointed a commission to visit the various national libraries of the country and make selections for what is likely to be an exceptionally fine display of rare and beautiful volumes .

		This quest has revealed an astonishing state of neglect and incompetence in the management of some of these libraries .

		It is reported of the
Vittorio Emanuele Library	ORGANIZATION	in
Rome	LOCATION	that its staff is largely composed of lackadaisical directors , harmless luna - tics , chronic invalids , incapacitated octogenarians , and women of hopelessly idiosyncratic peculiarities .

		Disregard of library hours and library duties is the rule and not the exception .

		One assistant librarian has been absent from his post for eight months , another seems to have settled permanently in
Cairo	LOCATION	, and a third is resting from his labors behind iron bars , being in prison on a sentence for burglary .

		Wholesale mutilation of valuable works , singly and in sets , is reported .

		In short , Italian libraries might fairly be conceived of as on the rapid road to ruin ; but it may be that the instances of mismanagement and neglect pointed out by the commission are ex - ceptional , not the rule .

		Let us hope so .

		Complaint is also made of the incapacity of the editorial staff appointed by the government to prepare a number of costly reproductions of historical works at the expense of
the Ministry of Public Instruction	ORGANIZATION	.

		To these editors Duns Scotus is so entirely unknown that his works , as found in the library at
Subiaco	LOCATION	, are described in two separate sections of a book on the monasteries of
Subiaco	LOCATION	, as the writings of a
Signor Scotus	PERSON	and again as those of a

		And yet it was
Italy	LOCATION	that gave to the world , or more especially to the British Museum , an

		FREAKS OF LITERARY CENSORSHIP are often amusing to the dispassionate observer , while not infrequently maddening to those more closely con - cerned with the censored wares .

		In a certain town not a million miles from

		An ancient name will cover a multitude of sins .

		In how many Puritan families has the Bible been peri - odically and conscientiously read through from cover to cover , while anything branded with the name of a novel , even a Waverley novel , and any work written for the stage , even a play of

Edmond Rostand	PERSON	, after being moved to metrical utterance by the not yet commonplace spectacle of an aeroplane cleaving its way through the clouds , conceived the sublime idea of a sonnet , or perhaps of a longer poem , writ - ten in a flying-machine in full career .

		But
Madame Rostand	PERSON	said emphatically , No , never or , at least , not until flying is as safe as walking .

		But when that stage of aeronautics is reached will it have power to thrill the aerial passenger and prompt him to sing ?

		If flying had always been safe and easy to wingless bipeds , we should most certainly never have had any '' Darius Green '' -LRB- which by the way , after making a decided hit almost half a century ago , is now making another hit in a special edition with mirth-provoking illustrations by Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	Gold - smith -RRB- .

		There is , however , more than a possibility , in view of recent occurrences at
Belmont	LOCATION	, that the French poet , after dipping his pen in the azure of the heavens and hymning the ecstatic praises of aviation , might never have composed another line .

		It might , in short , have been his swan-song , and he might have learned with
Darius	PERSON	that while flying is all well enough , '' the ' ain ' t sich a thunderin ' sight o ' fun in ' t when ye come to ` light . ''

		COUNT TOLSTOY 'S LATEST LITERARY WORK , a pamphlet entitled `` Three Days in a Village , '' re - counting simply and realistically the incidents of three days spent in a village near the writer 's home , has evidently been found by the Russian government to contain too much truth to be edifying reading ; and accordingly the seizure of all copies has been ordered .

		The sub-titles prefixed to the three suc - cessive parts of the little narrative -LRB- `` Wayfaring Men , '' '' Living and Dying , '' and '' Taxes '' -RRB- lead one to surmise that something of the heart-breaking misery and hopelessness of Russian peasant life has been presented to the reader ; and it is also said that the author has not refrained from a closing arraignment of the ruling powers that are responsible for all this wretchedness and injustice .

		It is safe to conclude that the doughty author , against whom even the despot 's hand is stayed , has delivered him - self of a weighty and a telling word , which , in spite of censors , will be heard around the world .

		... FATTY DEGENERATION IN OUR ENGLISH PROSE STYLE has set in , and is rapidly developing at least in the great mass of popular reading matter , such as is furnished by current fiction and by the newspapers and the illustrated magazines that so marvellously abound .

		M.
Emile Faguet	PERSON	, the emi - THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, nent French litterateur , complains , in the Revue des Deux Monde * , of a deplorable deterioration in French prose writing .

		Good writing , he well main - tains , is largely a question of intellectual fibre ; and there is much in modern educational methods , with their multiplicity of electives , including an increas - ing number of '' soft '' ones , to produce flabbiness of intellectual fibre .

		Courses in the study and writing of English have multiplied , it is true ; but the first requisite to good writing is sound and vigorous thinking .

		The student who has thoroughly mastered Thucydides in the original , for example , and has steeped bis mind in the English of the
King James	LOCATION	version of the
Bible	LOCATION	, is far more likely to write tersely and idiomatically than is the one who has taken courses in modern European fiction and written innumerable themes .

		But after all is said , in order to write well one must first have something to say ; and the old saying still holds , that the style is the man .

		A person with no orig - inal ideas and no toughness of fibre is sure to be characterless and weak in his writing .

		A CHILLY COMMENT ON COMMANDER
PEARY	PERSON	'S BOOK comes from Professor
Andreas Galle	PERSON	, chief of the
Geodetic Institute	ORGANIZATION	at
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		In the hardy explorer 's account of his Arctic achievement , the German scientist professes to find no convincing evidence that the Pole was really reached by him ; in short , he declares that Commander
Peary	PERSON	's claim rests upon no valid scientific proof whatever .

		Probably the
Herr Professor	ORGANIZATION	, if strictly catechized on the subject , would be forced to own that he had never received any valid scientific proof of the existence of such a city as
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The only validly scientific way to discover the
North Pole	LOCATION	would be for two or more geographic or geodetic societies to proceed thither in company , each keep - ing - tab '' on the others , and all uniting in signing a sworn statement that the protuberant end of the earth 's axis had actually been seen and handled by them severally and collectively .

		And then if a splin - ter were brought back in addition , perhaps even the
Berlin	LOCATION	professor of geodetics would be convinced .

		THE DISPOSAL OF THE LIBRARY AT STORMFIELD , whereof rumor has busied itself more or less of late , now seems likely to be of a more prosaically busi - nesslike character than we had hoped .

		The trans - fer in mass of
Mark Twain	PERSON	's literary treasures to the public library of
Redding	LOCATION	, as was rumored at one time to be their probable disposition , would have enabled future visitors to the humorist 's former home to inspect his gradually accumulated library and perhaps to handle some of his favorite volumes ; but this desired consummation will not be effected if the announced plan of his only surviving daughter , Mrs. -LRB- K-i | , < ; ; i l , rilo \ vit.sch .

		THE `` RETURN TO MACAULAY . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The discussion of a '' return to Macaulay '' moves ine to add a word upon the subject .

		In my opinion the time is not yet ripe for the type of history for which Profes - sor
Hutson	PERSON	pines .

		The older histories of this class were either based upon highly colored partisan contemporary accounts or upon some theory as to what the facts were .

		It is impossible for any writer covering a large field or a long period to investigate fully the basis for the thousands of statements that his book must contain .

		Speaking for American history alone , there is scarcely a topic respecting which there are not important questions which have not yet been answered .

		How important these questions are can not be known until the facts are ascertained .

		The most conspicuous example is the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		In hardly more than a single colony has the movement been traced in detail .

		Not until this has been done for all the colonies will any adequate presentation of the movement as a whole be practicable .

		The type of mind required for this detailed investigation is altogether different from that needed for painting the larger picture .

		When the detailed work is fairly complete , the man will come , who , with clear insight , a broad grasp , and a brilliant literary style , will combine the monographic results of his prede - cessors into a well balanced whole , which , to the inter - est of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, will add the advantage of being ap - proximately true .

		Therefore I would counsel continued work along present lines , and patience .


F. H. HODDER Juawrence	PERSON	,
Kansas	LOCATION	, Nov. o , '
1910	DATE	, TILL EULENSPIEGEL ON AVIATION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		We have been reading of wonderful flying experiences in
St. Louis	LOCATION	,
Darmstadt	LOCATION	, and elsewhere , and our own old city of
Magdeburg	LOCATION	has just been the scene of a three days ' national aeroplane contest .

		It is curious that two miles of street-car track bind together the great race-course where the German aviators strove with very modest success , it is true , not to mention the terrible death of Lieutenant Menthe to match the records of their hereditary enemies across the Rhine , and the old Town-House where the classic joker Till Eulenspiegel is said to have advertised one of the first flights on record .

		The story is Number XIIII .

		in `` The Book of Till Eulenspiegel '' ; but I translate from the somewhat more intelligible modernized ad - aptation contained in `` Tales of the City of
Magdeburg	LOCATION	, '' by Fr .

		Hiilsse -LRB-
Albert Rathke	PERSON	,
Magdeburg	LOCATION	-RRB- : '' Till Eulenspiegel came once also to the town of
Magde	LOCATION	- burg , to play here many a fool-caper .

		One day he gave notice that he would fly from the gable of the Town-House and down to the Market .

		-LSB- This gable was so arranged that officials mounted to a platform and read notices of public importance from that commanding position .

		TB . -RSB-

		When the news spread in the city , a great number of people , young and old , streamed together to the market-place .

		All were eager to see the far-famed fool fly .

		Eulenspiegel stood upright on the wall , and moved his arms and hands , just as if he would begin to fly .

		The folk opened eye and mouth wide in sheer astonishment , and thought to see him in the air the next moment .

		But Eulenspiegel laughed and said , ' I thought there were no fools or simpletons in the world but I .

		Now I see well that here almost the whole town is full of fools .

		For if all of you had said that you could fly I should not have believed it .

		You believe me , although I am a fool .

		1 am , as you know , neither a goose nor any other sort of bird ; moreover , I have neither wings nor feathers , without which no one can fly .

		So you can see clearly that I told you a lie . '

		Therewith he ran from the gable and left the folk standing , of whom some fled , but some laughed and said , ' Great rascal as he is , he has nevertheless spoken the truth . ' ''

		Far be it from the translator to institute comparisons or make a prophet of the cheerful philosopher .

		He merely finds it curious that the two events occurred so near together .

		A FOOT-NOTE TO '' VANITY FAIR . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Every lover of
Thackeray	PERSON	that is to say , every one with a soul worth saving will recall the chapter in '' Vanity Fair '' of which the climax is reached in the quarrel between
George Osborne	PERSON	and his father .

		Prior to this scene ,
Miss Swartz	PERSON	and the Misses
Osborne	PERSON	had a little music in the drawing-room , and the sisters began the entertainment with '' The Battle of
Prague	LOCATION	. '' '' '

		Stop that d thing , '
George	PERSON	howled out in a fury from the sofa . '

		It makes me mad .

		You play something ,
Miss Swartz	PERSON	, do .

		Sing something , anything but the Battle of

		Shall I sing Blue-Eyed
Mary	PERSON	or the air from the Ca - binet ? '

		Miss

		We 've had that , ' replied the misanthrope on the sofa . '' '

		I can sing
Fluvy du Tajy	ORGANIZATION	, '
Swartz	PERSON	said in a meek voice , ' if I had the words . '

		It was the last of the worthy young woman 's collection . '

		`` 0 , Fleuve du Tage , ' Miss Maria cried ; ' we have the song , ' and went to find the book in which it was . ''

		Now it happened that this song , then in the height of fashion , had been given '' And then the name of
Amelia Sedley	PERSON	on the title-page of the album ushered in the fatal dispute .

		It has been many a long year since I first read those lines , and began to wonder why '' The Battle of
Prague	LOCATION	'' so incensed the easily-incensed cap tain , and what manner of song was the '' Fleuve du Tage '' with which .

		i dark heiress calmed his wrath .

		Nobody to whom 1 put the question knew , and I came at last to believe that , since nobody was left alive who remembered the fashionable music of the -
year ' 15	DATE	, I must needs live my life out in ignorance thereof .

		Finally a very old lady recalled the '' Battle '' as a '' very noisy piece ; not at all pretty '' ; and from an old handbook of '' Things to Know '' I learned that it was written by
Franz Kotz	PERSON	- wara , who was born in the city which he thus celebrated , in
1791	DATE	.

		It is possible , therefore , but not probable , that
Thackeray	PERSON	was correct in fancying that
Miss Maria	LOCATION	and Miss
Jane	PERSON	favoured their dinner guests with his com - position , in the
spring	DATE	before
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		And now the death of another old lady , and the subse - quent sale of her books , has put me in possession of some bound volumes of ''
Godey	ORGANIZATION	's Lady 's Book , '' and in the number for
March , 1858	DATE	, behold !

		the song which Amelia loved '' Fleuve du Tage , '' '' written and com - posed for the piano forte for
Godey	ORGANIZATION	's Lady 's Book , '' by
J. Starr Hollway	PERSON	.

		The pretty plaintive air , and the delicate accompaniment , suggestive of softly-flowing water , are quite suited to the verses .

		No one can doubt that dear Amelia would have adored the song .

		But , oh !

		by what juggling with the calendar can we be sure that she ever heard it !

		MODJESKA IN
POLAND	LOCATION	AND
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		* Even those of us who are only fortunate enough to have seen
Madame Modjeska	ORGANIZATION	in later life can readily understand the enthusiasm evoked by her beauty , her charm , and her genius when , hardly more than a girl , she made her first appearance as Juliet in her native
Cracow	LOCATION	and received a veritable storm of applause , being ten times called before the curtain at the end .

		She had never witnessed a performance of the play , and had not even read it before taking up the study of her part .

		Her first appearance on the American stage , at
San Francisco	LOCATION	in
1877	DATE	, which was also her first trial of the English language before an audience , was equally suc - cessful .

		Her ''
Adrienne Lecouvreur	PERSON	'' was ap - plauded furiously .

		In a substantial volume of nearly six hundred pages , entitled '' Memories and Impressions of
Helena Modjeska	PERSON	, '' the great actress , who died last year at her
California	LOCATION	home before quite reaching the scriptural three-score-and-ten , tells her life-story with a most engaging frankness and completeness , and in English surprisingly pure and flexible , with such a command of its idioms as to betray hardly a trace of the for - eigner , although she was nearer forty than thirty when she began the serious study of our tongue .

		From her birth in
1840	DATE	to her retirement from the stage in
1907	DATE	the varied and eventful course of her life forms a narrative none too long .

		The many reminiscences of European and American celebrities , members of her own profession or otherwise noteworthy , diversify the story , while its abundance of portraits and views still further enliven it .

		Cracow was the birthplace of
Helena Opid	PERSON	, and as she was one of ten children and was left fatherless at seven years of age , her early seek - ing of employment on the stage can be readily accounted for .

		Her passion for the drama , as well as her elocutionary and musical gifts , must have been derived from that ill-fated father , who delighted in telling stories and reciting poetry to his children , and who played several musical instruments , music being his passion , as we are told .

		The following scene , depicted by the daughter in her opening chapter , is pro- phetic of her own subsequent development : I remember him during long winter evenings , sit - MKMORIKM AND IMPRKMIONH OF HELENA MODJMKA .

		ting by the fireside , holding me and my sister on his knees ; near him my mother knitting , and the boys , together with neighbors ' children , scattered on the floor , watching him with glistening , curious eyes , and listening attentively to his stories .

		They were wonderful stories that touched us with pity or thrilled us with joy .

		Some of them were taken from national legends or from the mountaineer folk-lore , some were his own invention , or subjects taken from his cherished books .

		His favorite story was Homer 's ' Iliad , ' extracts of which be told us in his simple language .

		I do not know how much I understood then of the famous epic poem , but when I read it some
fifteen years later	DATE	, many famous scenes came back vividly to my mind , and the picture of my father rose from the remote past , filling my eyes with tears . ''

		In the same vein is her recollection of the later evening readings in the family circle , when every one had to take turns , and while my mother and
Aunt Teresa	PERSON	were knitting , and we children were dressing or stitching clothes for our dolls , one of my brothers , or anyone who would volunteer to do so , would read aloud .

		These were very delightful , never-to-be-forgotten evenings . ''

		Dramatic talent was not confined to
Helena	LOCATION	; two elder brothers left home for the stage , and the younger children took naturally to private theatricals .

		About the year
1860	DATE	, as far as can be determined from her narrative , which is pleasantly free from an excess of dates and unfettered by too strict adherence to chron - ological order ,
Helena	PERSON	Opid married her German teacher ,
Gustave Modrzejewski	PERSON	-LRB- or
Modjeski	PERSON	, as she very kindly abbreviates and simplifies it for us -RRB- , and thus became the
Madame Modjeska	PERSON	of histrionic renown , although only
eight years later	DATE	she was wedded to her second husband , Count
Karol Chlapowski	PERSON	.

		Thus , the hyper - accurate librarian will take notice , her book should be catalogued , not under '' Modjeska '' or even '' Modrzejewska , '' but under ''
Chla	LOCATION	- powska . ''

		But in just what one of the several ways familiar to the dramatic profession Mr.
Modjeski	PERSON	passed from the scene of action and lapsed into oblivion , is not revealed .

		He ceases to figure in the book ere one is a quarter of the way through .

		Among
Madame Modjeska	ORGANIZATION	's early friends were the brilliantly gifted De Reszke family ;
Joseph Chelmonski	PERSON	, the painter ; Count Przezd - ziecki , the historian and archaeologist ;
Felician Falenski	PERSON	, the poet ;
Stanislaw Witkiewicz	PERSON	, the painter and author ; and
Henryk Sienkiewicz	PERSON	, the novelist .

		Of the latter as he appeared in his younger days we read : ' It was on a visit to their country home -LSB- i.e. the country home of some common friends J that we met

		The whole room , with its contents , men , women , and objects , was uncon - sciously yielding food for his acute observation .

		He some - times outstayed the company , and when only a few of our intimate friends remained he took an active part in the conversation , to our great delight , for his many-sided intellect and slightly sarcastic humor acted like a stimu - lant upon others , calling forth most clever and interest - ing replies .

		I was usually a mute listener to the inter - course , which sometimes became so fascinating that our guests did not notice when the candles were burnt out and replaced by fresh ones , while the dim white light peeped across the window-blinds . ''

		It was this young man of genius who was the most enthusiastic supporter of Count Chlapow - ski 's project of forming a community in
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia on the model of the one that had so flatly failed at
Brook Farm	ORGANIZATION	.

		The migration was actually accomplished ,
Anaheim	LOCATION	was settled , and the colony struggled on long enough to disembarrass its promoter of fifteen thousand dollars or more , when
Madame Modjeska	ORGANIZATION	seems to have put a stop to the folly by going off to
San Francisco	LOCATION	to study English and resume her old profession .

		Her husband accompanied her , and at one time acted as her manager .

		To touch here more particularly on her life in
America	LOCATION	, as the most important or at least , to us , the most interesting part , we may note a few of her more intimate friendships in this country and some of her triumphs as an actress , together with an occasional opinion of hers on American actors and on the art of acting in general .

		Her first meeting with
Longfellow	PERSON	is thus described : '' One of the most important events of my stay in
Boston	LOCATION	was my meeting with
Henry W. Longfellow	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
Gilder	PERSON	wrote that the great man would call on me at my hotel .

		Although I was forewarned of his visit , yet 1 was quite overcome with emotion when one after - noon his card was brought to my room .

		One look of his kind , deep-set eyes and a warm hand-shake soon restored my mental equilibrium and put me at my ease .

		The presence of this true , great poet , this man endowed with the finest qualities a man can possess , was a spirit - ual feast for me ... Then my son
Ralph	PERSON	came in , and we were both invited to lunch at the poet 's house in
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Longfellow 's great charm was just that perfect simplicity , so rare in celebrated men .

		There was not a shade of the patronizing air so frequently assumed by people of superior standing , not a particle of the pomposity I had observed more than once among much less-known writers .

		A celebrity without conceit is rare , but there was none in the author of '' Evangeline '' and '
Hiawatha	LOCATION	. '

		He did not seem to care much for com - pliments .

		... I made another attempt , and said I would gladly study some passages from his poems and recite them to him , and I mentioned '' Hiawatha , '' but he stopped me with the words : ` You do not want to waste your time in memorizing those things , and do n't you speak of `` Hiawatha , '' or I will call you Mudjikiewis , which , by the way , sounds somewhat like your name . ' ''


Edwin Booth	PERSON	, with whom
Modjeska	ORGANIZATION	played for a season , won her hearty liking as well as her admiration .

		She says of him : '' My season with
Edwin Booth	PERSON	was delightful .

		I found him one of the kindest and pleasaiitest men of the profession .

		He also possessed what I considered a great quality simplicity of manner ... '' ... I remember that at supper we spoke of Shake - speare , and then I had the opportunity of learning how deeply and thoroughly Booth studied his parts .

		He says he has no ear for music , but any mistake in blank verse jars upon him as a false note .

		Of course he puts a great stress upon pronunciation , emphasis , and inflections of the voice , and he kindly pointed out some of my mistakes in pronunciation , which I gratefully accepted , and tried to correct myself at the next per - formance ... He also said that my delivery of the ' Mercy ' speech -LSB- in < The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	' -RSB- was ' admirable . '

		I felt highly flattered and happy , of course .

		It seems that the reason why he has not studied any new parts for a long time is that , whenever he put a new play on the bills , the audience kept away from it and were asking for ` Hamlet , ' ` Richelieu , ' etc. , plays which he has played for years .

		It is very strange that people should be so conservative in their taste , but it is certainly the case with Americans , and the older the play the better ' the draw . ' ''

		A few pages after this surprising charge against us of excessive fondness for the good old plays , the writer has something to say about contemporary American actors , calling atten - tion to certain defects in the present system of training . ''

		The evil , '' she adds , '' lies in the unfortunate ' star ' system .

		There is little op - portunity for beginners to learn much .

		They usually are shifted from one company to another , and often forced to play one single part all through the season .

		In most cases they are not allowed to present their own conception of the character , but are compelled to follow blindly the stage-manager 's instructions . ''

		Touching later on the interpretation of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays , and the common contention that in order to render them properly the actors should be of English stock , she argues convincingly that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is too largely human , too universal in his appeal , to require players of only his own nationality to impersonate his characters .

		Of course she admits that in no foreign tongue can his plays be adequately presented ; and her fine mastery of the language of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is a proof of the earnestness of her feeling in this respect .

		Near the end of her book she says a few well-considered words on dramatic art in general .

		The faithful interpretation of a part she considers something more than an art . ''

		Something else is needed , something which ought to lie in the very depth of the actor 's soul , the sugges - 372 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, tion of which has much more value than even the moat laborious study .

		I do not know well how to define this something , but it seems to me to be an irresponsible desire of expression , together with the riches of feeling , which one can open to the world .

		Those who are en - dowed with this sense of expression , and moreover can enhance it with the color of their imagination and the intensity of emotional temperament , achieve what a mechanical though excellent performer can never do .

		They thrill the audience , which will carry home some of the actor 's inmost treasures and live on them for a while .

		The richer his nature , the better the influence . '

		The more I give , the more I have , ' says
Juliet	PERSON	.

		To give and to give is our task . ''

		Some of this is rather trite and obvious , it may be , but the whole passage of which it is a part is well worth reading .


Madame Modjeska	ORGANIZATION	's autobiography , coming as it does so soon after Miss
Ellen Terry	PERSON	's and
Madame Sarah Bernhardt	PERSON	's and
Clara Morris	PERSON	's published reminiscences , invites comparison with them , and will surely not suffer thereby .

		Some - thing of the pathos , the passion , the intensity , of her Polish blood shows itself in her writing , and imparts to her pages a vividness and a depth and richness of human feeling that enthrall the reader and carry him a willing captive to the end .

		No better book in its kind could be desired .

		The considerable additions to the narrative and to the illustrations , over and above what has already appeared serially , make the work really a new book .

		A NEW THING IN HISTORICAL WRITING .

		* There is a poem of
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	's whose legend runs thus : For many years the dwellers at the foot of the
Himalayas	LOCATION	had been subjected to incursions from the hill-people above .

		These latter descended through a mighty pass whose en - trance overhung the lowlands .

		At last , however , actual invasions ceased ; but up out of the heart of that gorge in the hills there came ever down to the affrighted ears of those below the sound of the mustering and trampling and tumult of a mighty armament .

		Trumpets blew and drums sounded ; arms clashed and cheers echoed ; and in the hearts of the lowland hearers was a sub - jected awe , a panic always poised to fly .

		This went on for some time , but finally the noises grew fainter , the clarion calls died away , and the footsteps of a great army seemed to retreat .

		A few of the bolder of the folk below summoned up courage to climb into the pass and this in what met their eyes : Great tree-trunks had

		been hollowed out and placed so that the winds of the gorge should blow through them .

		It was this which had simulated the noises of a tumultuous army .

		But Nature had defeated the scheme of man .

		Birds , birds in multitude , had crept into these hollowed pipes and built their nests ; and as they gradually stopped those narrow chambers up , the martial music had gradually decreased .

		This poem comes back to the mind as one reads General
Morris Schaff	PERSON	's book on `` The Battle of the Wilderness . ''

		For more than a generation the histories of the Civil War have been filled with the thunder of great guns , the tramping of infantry , the clang of horsemen ; filled , too , with the hatreds of both sides , and with the quarrels over the plunder of glory belonging to the various leaders .

		Now a poet makes his appearance , a poet with vision in his brain and charity and sympathy in his heart .

		Flowers bloom , birds sing , the woods are gay in
May	DATE	apparel ; we see the swinging march of men , we hear the ring of youthful voices .

		Stern war is turned to favor and romance .

		And hatreds and quarrels disappear .

		There is appreciation for the heroes of both camps , intimate pictures of their mien and bearing .

		This is indeed a new departure in historical writing , at least for American history .

		General
Schaff	PERSON	has adopted something of epic methods .

		He has a '' machinery '' of his own a mythol - ogy of spirits and phantoms that come at will , predict events , and brood over battles .

		Under the definitely traced lines of his actual record there gleam faded traceries of fate and mystic meaning .

		It would have required but little more to have brought the Vates or Druids upon the scene .

		What fine imaginative gifts many of the soldiers of the Civil War have shown !

		Pro- fessor
Shaler	PERSON	rose to really great heights in his epic drama '' Elizabeth of
England	LOCATION	, '' and now
General Schaff	ORGANIZATION	displays a vividness of phantasy , with a concurrent grace and magic of style , that outpoint most of our professed poets .

		It may be said without hesitation that the use of all these literary gifts has immensely brightened his book and given it a chance for permanent fame .

		The average mind , unless personally interested , can not follow the broken movements of a modern battle .

		Details of positions , roads , marches , battle-lines , attacks and repulses , are usually dry reading .

		THE DIAL 373 incidents General
Schaff	PERSON	has shown a wise artistic instinct .

		And though he has the poet 's preference for beauty , and though he puts most stress as every writer on war who wishes to be read must do on the high spirits and magnifi - cent courage of his actors , he has not hesitated to dash the shadows into his picture .

		There are scenes enough of grim and grizly horror .

		Yet of course the book is history , is a record of fact , and presumably an accurate one .

		The author tells an amusing story about the diffi - culty of being correct in such matters . ''


Batchelder	PERSON	, whose map of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	is authority , ... came to the army to verify the positions of the vari - ous commands .

		One night , after dinner , he entered , quite tired .

		` Well , ' he announced , taking his place at the table , ' I have been in the
Second Corps	ORGANIZATION	to-day , and I believe I have discovered how
Joshua	PERSON	made the sun stand still .

		I went first to regiment and had the officers mark on the map the hour of their brigade 's position at a cer - tain point .

		Then I went to regiment in the same brigade ; they declared positively it was one or two hours earlier or later than that given by the others .

		So it went on , no two regiments or brigades agreeing , and if I hinted that some of them must certainly be mistaken , they would set me down by saying , with severe dignity , ' We were there ,
Batchelder	PERSON	, and we ought to know , I guess ' ; and I made up my mind that it would take a day of at least twenty hours instead of thirteen at
Gettys	LOCATION	- burg to satisfy their accounts .

		So , when
Joshua	PERSON	's cap - tains got around him after the fight and they began to talk it over , the only way under the heavens that he could ever harmonize their statements was to make the sun stand still and give them all a chance . ''

		General
Schaff	PERSON	confesses that the strategy , grand tactics , and military movements of the war , stirring as these are , were not the features which engaged his deepest interest , but rather the spirit which animated the North and South .

		Perhaps he sees this through the haze of years ; but this only serves to bring his book into tone and harmony .

		We have spoken of the touch of magic which is often apparent in his style .

		Let us give a specimen . ''

		And now , on those soft mountain and valley winds of memory , which always set in when anything pensive warms the heart , are borne the notes of bugles sounding taps in the camps around us on those long-vanished
August	DATE	nights .

		Camp after camp takes up the call , some near , some far .

		The last of the clear , lamenting tones die away sweetly and plaintively in the distance , and back comes the hush of night as of old .

		Again the sentinels are marching their beats slowly , most of them thinking of home , now and then one , with moistened eyes , of a baby in a cradle .

		Peace to the ashes of
Warren	LOCATION	, peace to those of the sentinels of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the Potomac who walked their posts in those gone-by starry nights ! ''

		Some of
General Schaff	ORGANIZATION	's judgments we think are open to debate .

		He pleads with wistful eagerness for
Meade	PERSON	, yet in the end ranks him below
Sheridan	PERSON	and
Sherman	PERSON	.

		We do not believe that time will endorse this verdict .

		His attitude toward Grant is that of simple rever - ence .

		For ourselves there seems to be a curious parallel to
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's career in the Hannibalic War .

		Fabius and
Marcellus	PERSON	and Nero were all greater soldiers , greater inventors in warfare , than
Scipio	LOCATION	; but after they had worn down
Hannibal	LOCATION	's magnificent army until it was a mere shadow of a shade , Scipio came upon the scene , gave the final blow , and gained the ultimate and loftiest laurels .

		The flaw in this comparison is that
Grant	ORGANIZATION	himself assisted in the wearing-down process , though in conflict with generals far inferior to Lee and his great lieutenants ; but against this may be set the large and im - portant share of credit belonging to
Meade	PERSON	for the last year 's operations .

		Again , Grant only carried out
McClellan	PERSON	's policy of over - whelming the Confederacy by numbers .

		That he was allowed to do this , while
McClellan	PERSON	was not allowed , probably arose not so much from any special strength of character in himself , as from the conviction at last forced upon the au - thorities at
Washington	LOCATION	that it was the only way .

		There are two orders of men of action , those who , with ample means and abundant resources , accomplish great things ; and those who with scanty means , or none at all , or against prodigious odds , achieve impossibilities .

		There can be no doubt as to the class in which Grant belonged .

		Judged by this test , not Grant the victor , but Lee the vanquished , is the central figure of the Civil War .

		And
Meade	PERSON	, the only Northern leader who met Lee on terms of prac - tical equality and turned him back in disaster , deserves a place by his side .

		But Grant 's un - assuming modesty , his generosity to his foe and generally to his fellow-commanders , mark him as a noble character .

		Victory but left him as it met him .

		He was a more determined power from defeat .

		Death could not shake his tran - quility .

		Honor to them all ; they were great men .

		Was it all worth while ?

		As one reads Gen - eral
Schaff	PERSON	's book and realizes the visions of those meadows of the Rapidan and
Rappahan	PERSON	- nock , and those dark tangled woods of the
Wilderness	ORGANIZATION	, thick inlaid with patterns of fallen forms in blue and gray , it all seems a frightful waste .

		But we must wait .

		The blood sown in those mighty battles will yet bear noble harvests .

		Romance will rise and rear her altars through all that old Southern domain , and will set her saving mark upon those Northern thresholds whence our fathers issued forth .

		And General
Schaff	PERSON	's book , with its fairness to friend and 374 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, foe , its spirit of chivalry , its poetic imagination , its manly ardor and almost womanly gush of feeling , will do much toward this consummation .

		He has made history as true as poetry .

LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		AN ENGLISH TREATMENT OF GERM \ \ ROMANTICISM .

		* The root idea of the word '' Romantic '' has been used , somehow , in some form , almost ab tirbe condita . ''

		All the great poets , '' says Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	, `` have been Romanticists , except those of the eighteenth century . ''

		Romanticism has ever been , and will ever continue to be , so long as great poets poetize life .

		Yet there was once a prevalent opinion that Romanticism started in
Germany	LOCATION	about
1792	DATE	, and died out about
1830	DATE	.

		Romanticism was simply the pre - dominant feature of German literature during this period ; and from
Germany	LOCATION	it early spread , as a formal movement , over
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Poland	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and
Scandinavia	LOCATION	.

		It has been treated at various times from the genetic , philosophic , analytic , biographic , and popular standpoint .

		Elaborate discussions began in
Germany	LOCATION	with those heavy works of
Koberstein	LOCATION	,
Gervinus	PERSON	, and
Julian Schmidt	PERSON	, works soon to be superseded by
Haym	PERSON	's monumental Die roman - tische ,
Schule	PERSON	.

		Then there are the larger works of Heine -LRB- 1833 -RRB- ,
Hettner	PERSON	-LRB- 1850 -RRB- ,
Gautier	PERSON	-RRB- 1868 -RRB- ,
Brandes	PERSON	-LRB- 1873 -RRB- ,
Phelps	PERSON	-LRB- 1893 -RRB- ,
Huch	PERSON	-LRB- 1899 -RRB- , Omond -LRB-

1901	DATE	-RRB- , and
Symons	PERSON	-LRB-
1909	DATE	-RRB- .

		The small monographs on individual phases of Romanticism are literally legion .

		Mr.
Wernaer	PERSON	's '' Romanticism and the Romantic School in
Germany	LOCATION	, '' however , not only super - sedes any work that has thus far appeared in English , but will stand the test of comparison with studies of similar aim in any language .

		There was a time when , if asked to define Romanticism , one would have dismissed the question with some such non-committal gener - ality as that it was a reactionary movement which in its attempt to resuscitate the Middle Ages unconsciously introduced mysticism .

		But that was the dark age of Romantic study .

		We now know better .

		We know that Romanticism was reconciliatory rather than reactionary , that there were a number of things about the Middle Ages actually hostile to the very spirit of Roman - ticism , that the Romanticists did almost nothing ROMANTICISM AKD THE ROMANTIC SCHOOL IN GKB - MAXT .

		unconsciously , and that mysticism can also play a role in rationalism and realism .

		As Mr.
Wernaer	PERSON	's title indicates , his book treats only the older group of German Romanti - cists , the '' Romantic School '' ; and of this , only the great leaders the Schlegels ,
Wackenroder	PERSON	,
Tieck	PERSON	, Novalis ,
Fichte	ORGANIZATION	.

		Schelling .

		and
Schleier	PERSON	- macher .

		The author acknowledges manifest indebtedness to his predecessors .

		The work owes most to
Ricarda Huch	PERSON	's Bliitezeit der Romantik .

		In some ways it is superior to
Huch	PERSON	's work , in others it is simply different .

		This can be most clearly seen in the way each has treated that possibly most elusive feature of Romanticism , '' irony . ''

		The work does not deal , except in the most meagre way , with Romantic form or style .

		The publisher 's part in the book leaves something to be desired .

		The type-impression on some pages is so heavy that it shows through ; other pages are very pale .

		A few instances occur of badly muddled type .

		There are several typographical errors ; one of these , referring to
Hiigli	ORGANIZATION	's Romanische Strophen ^ etc. ,9 & `` Romantische Strophen etc '' is one that is generally found , even in card cata - logues .

		But since they are both about the same , this matters little .

		The author has italicized some untranslatable words and left unitalicized others .

		The italicized forms look better .

		These defects should be eradicated , root and branch , in the future editions that the work will likely enjoy .

		The Bibliography is modern , citing nearly a hundred monographs that postdate 1880 .

		The author 's style is one to provoke comment , but not criticism ; it has peculiarities , but not defects .

		One only wonders at his fond - ness for the word '' twist '' Yet
Arthur Symons	PERSON	gives
J. J. Callanan	PERSON	a place among English poets because he once used this word , '' The birds go to sleep by the sweet twist of her song . ''

		Mr.
Wernaer	PERSON	has not only written about German Romanticism , he has also drawn a moral from its lofty aims and unreached goals .

		He makes a plea for Humanism as the golden middle way betweenClassicism of the Head and Romanti - cism of the Heart ; between the legal temper and the sympathetic temper ; between obedience and freedom , duty and love .

		Literature , he says , represents life ; and Romanticism is soul - culture , it is love .

		This was the Romanti - cists ' mission ; but they could not humanize it .

		They loved beauty , inner beauty , with a lover 's love , blind to the hard realities that always con - front those who are not poets and whom poets must make free .

		They introduced a new sym -
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 375 holism , a broader symbolism than that typified by the
Versunkene Glocke	PERSON	or '' The Ancient Mariner . ''

		This new symbolism received its birth through the metaphysical conception that when spirit is brought in contact with matter , the one is transformed into the other ; they do not merge , the spirit ever lingers on .

		Their works were the ambassadors of their own thoughts , feelings , moods , and dreams ; the visible representatives of something invisible .

		Symbolism defines Romantic style in its attempt to put soul into sense , to inebriate the forms of art with poetic nectar .

		Coming to the Romantic leaders ,
Wacken	ORGANIZATION	- roder is portrayed as one who devoted his whole life to purity of thought and the religious beauty of form and spirit , without being great as poet , critic , or writer , but with an immeasurable influence on
Tieck	PERSON	, the poet of moods , mimicry , adaptation , of dreams and lack of seriousness .

		Then there was Fr .

		Schlegel , ingenuous , free - born , militant and intellectual ;
A. W. Schlegel	PERSON	, with his great equanimity of critical temper , the man who first discovered
Tieck	PERSON	and
Wacken	ORGANIZATION	- roder to the reading public .

		There was Novalis , the mystic prophet and clairvoyant of the school , the Romanticist who lived in the spirit world while yet on earth , the man who was always `` going home , '' the writer of fairy tales and epi - grams .

		There was
Schleiermacher	PERSON	the preacher , who maintained that he was most religious who could get along without the
Bible	LOCATION	, who could , if necessary , write one himself .

		There was the somewhat retiring
Dorothea Mendelssohn	PERSON	- Veit-Schlegel ; her real name was
Brendel	PERSON	, but Fr .


Schlegel	PERSON	-LRB- 1798 -RRB- called her
Dorothea	PERSON	, and
Dorothea	PERSON	she remained .

		And , finally , there was the forceful
Caroline Michaelis-Bbhmer	PERSON	- Schlegel-Schelling .

		This account of the Romantic leaders covers 94 pages , and is well worth while , since the book was written for an American public , un - acquainted with even the landmarks of Ger - man Romanticism .

		There follow 210 pages of delightful reading on the traditional themes that must concern this sort of work Impres - sionistic and Interpretative Appreciation of Art ; the
Romantic Mood ; Nature Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	; Religion ; Beauty and Love ; Irony ; Novalis ' `` Hymns to the Night '' ; `` Lucinde '' ; the Fairy Tale ; the
Blue Flower	ORGANIZATION	.

		On reading these pages , one gets the impression , it is hard to tell how , that the author read the works on which they are based over and over , time and time again , and then consigned to the page , not simply facts , but real revelations .

		To the tried student of Romanticism , they clear up some things .

		To the incipient student , they will open up a new world .

		The last two chapters contain the moral .

		The German Romanticists were cosmopolitans , and at the same time patriots , but only in the aesthetic sense , not in the political or social .

		They revived the art of
Germany	LOCATION	, but they thought there was only one art , only one poetry ; and this was the art , the poetry , of the world .

		They tried to be true to this cosmo - politan theory ; they pledged themselves to it .

		But in so doing , they neglected the call of those around them who were not poets , and whom they , as poets , were to make free .

		They had no time , no patience , for the social service of their day .

		They abounded in love , but lacked duty .

		They tried to reconcile the finite and the infinite , and in so doing they leaned too heavily on the infinite .

		They had enthusiasm with - out restraint .

		German Romanticism of the late eighteenth century has precious little meaning for us to-day .

		This is an age of democratic individualism , an age of service that needs restraint , obedience , law , and duty .

		Present - day literature must abandon photography and sensation , and concern itself only with that which is beautiful , yet wholesomely in accord with duty 's laws .

		And the poet must not , like
Heinrich	PERSON	in the
Versunkene Glocke	PERSON	, attempt to flee from the realities of the finite world when the bells of every-day life are constantly calling him to service .

		Such in brief is the outline of this book .

		TALKS ON CHARACTER AND TEMPERAMENT .

		* Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	's forthcoming work on '' Character and Temperament '' is to be a con - tribution to the as yet unconstituted science which Mill postulated under the name of ethol - ogy .

		The little volume entitled '' The Qualities of Men '' is a popular presentation of the more general didactic and moral conclusions to which his severer studies have led him .

		With Pro- fessor
Jastrow	PERSON	's ideas and aims we are in entire sympathy .

		His main plea is for a more discern - ing recognition of the qualities of men and things than is accorded by our democratic wor - ship of quantity , energy , bigness , and hustle .

		He pleads , to adopt his own terminology , for the conservation and encouragement of the poietic , * THE QUALITIES OF MEN .

Nov. 16	DATE	, as well as of the kinetic , type of man .

		Especially timely is his protest against the domination of the kinetic type even in the university , where if anywhere the sense of the finer values ought to be fostered and preserved .

		The chief scientific and psychological interest of the book , a little disguised by the necessity of entertaining mixed audiences , is the attempt to trace the nicer shades and the higher qualities of mind and character to the common root of a keener and more delicate sensibility .

		From this point of view , the whole work may be taken as an expansion and psychological justification of
Ruskin	PERSON	's declaration that '' the essence of all vulgarity lies in want of sensation ... blunt - ness of body and mind . ''

		Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	's lucid intelligence invites and his candor makes it easy to practice frank - ness .

		We are free to say , then , that despite our complete agreement with its tendencies and teachings we like the book less than either of its predecessors , '' Fact and Fable in Psychol - ogy '' and `` The Sub-Conscious , '' and less than we expect to like its successor .

		We do not think that the author has quite succeeded in harmon - izing the scientific and the hortatory or didactic points of view .

		In the interests of vivid and emphatic presentation , the popularizer employs summary classifications which must give the psychologist pause .

		One example will suffice .

		Under his '' great divide , '' or '' two-class divi - sion of humanity , '' he subsumes for literary illu - tration the antitheses of Athenian and Boeotian , of sulphite and bromide , of the gentleman and the vulgarian , and of the poietic and kinetic types .

		He is of course quite as well aware as tli ' - reviewer can be of the cross-classifications to which this arbitrary procedure leads .

		The -LRB- technical -RRB- gentleman , as described in the oft - quoted paragraph of Professor
James	PERSON	, which Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	quotes again , may be the most soporific of bromides .

		The sulphite in conversa - tion and at the dinner table is not necessarily or perhaps even probably the originator , inventor , and leader in literature , science , or affairs .

		The specialization of faculty , native or acquired , as
George Eliot	PERSON	is fond of reminding us , defeats all such summary and wholesale classifications .

		Our second cavil concerns what for the lack of an equally apt English work may be called the `` preciosity '' of the style .

		There are many ad - mirable and eloquent pages .

		But too often plain thoughts are not plainly and directly expressed , but are obscured by allusion , abstract circum - locution , and conceits .

		There are too many meta - phors , and too many of them are either mixed or relentlessly followed up . ''

		The effort to develop a tonal facility becomes an unwarranted intru - sion upon an unwilling audience . '' ''

		Discern that he is decoratively pur - blind . '' ''

		Manner may beskin-deep , or even cosmetically achieved . '' ''

		A whimpering , if not a crying need . '' ''

		If I had to face the opulent necessity of a surgical operation . '' ''

		The time-tested dictum of the Roman dramatist that in the country of the humanities no true man is foreigner . ''

		The public that heard these chapters as lec - tures doubtless applauded these and similar vivacities , and our censure may be thought captious .

		But we believe that Professor Jas - trow 's second thoughts will concede that in a serious book such sallies are regrettable conces - sions to the very temper which he deprecates the taste which demands loud colors and crude effects at any cost .

		It is a style into which a clever writer , gifted with a large vocabulary and a quick fancy , is easily seduced by the notoriety which it has brought to some contemporary practitioners .

		But Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	always has something definite to say , and his sound and sober thought does not need to hide inanity and confusion by meretricious ornament .

		We hope that he will return tb a style in which the truth can be told , a style whose main endeavor is to reproduce the very form and pressure of the truth as it is given to the writer to apprehend it .

		It is better to be sane than to be what the newspapers call '' epigrammatic '' ; and in these days it is more of a distinction .

		Not the least of Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	's distinctions as a psychol - ogist and as a popularizer , in the good sense of the word , is that he is eminently sane .

		THE DIAL 377 judgment of the eleventh President of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Intensity of partisan conviction permeated the works of Northern historians from
1850	DATE	to
1860	DATE	, and in the decade following other men and newer issues were paramount .

		Even in the South no vigorous voice was raised in defense of one who at best was never re - garded as of the '' inner circle '' either politi - cally or socially .

		Yet Folk 's administration was one of the most important in American expan - sion , and to-day interest is re-directed to his career and policies .

		Nor is the material for a careful study lacking .

		Over ten thousand of Folk 's letters are in the possession of the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	; while in the sixth month of his Presidency -LRB-
August 1845	DATE	-RRB- ,
Polk	LOCATION	began to keep a diary of each day 's incidents , and continued it throughout the greater part of his four years ' term .

		It is this diary , purchased some time since by the
Chicago Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, that is now presented in book form , and from it one may form some judgment of the justice or in - justice of contemporary opinion , as well as gain new light on vital historical incident .

		A copy of the diary , now in the
Lenox Library	LOCATION	at
New York	LOCATION	, was indeed made for the historian
George Bancroft	PERSON	, a member of Polk 's cabinet , probably with the intention of using it in an estimate and defense of his chief .

		But such use was never made of it , and the only writers who have as yet drawn upon the diary are Mr.
J. S. Reeves	PERSON	, whose lec - tures on '' American Diplomacy under
Tyler	PERSON	and Polk '' appeared in
1907	DATE	, and Mr.
G. P. Garrison	PERSON	, in his volume on '' Westward Expansion . ''

		Both writers , however , were prohibited by the formal necessities of their publications from any ex - panded treatment of the man or his times .

		Thus , the importance of the present publication is great , both for student and historian .

		As Mr.
Reeves	PERSON	well says , the sneer of '' Who / ' is Polk ? ''

		had been sufficiently answered at the end of his administration .

		The Diary shows him early determined upon four main points of his policy : settlement of the
Oregon	LOCATION	question , tariff reform , establishment of a sub-treasury , and acquisition of
California	LOCATION	; and in each of these the object sought was attained .

		These were Polk 's own policies , each approved by some group of his supporters , but all approved by none .

		That he thus carried through a pro- gramme is evidence of power , tenacity , possibly of good fortune .

		Certainly he was no mere figure - head .

		Quite evidently he was by nature secretive , listening attentively to the advice of his cabinet , commenting little , but ultimately formulating his own plan of action and adhering to it .

		Presum - ably this habit of silence is in part responsible for the charge of mendacity : for the silence that gives consent must often have been an irritation to officials who counted upon favors or acquies - cence from his receptive attitude , only to find themselves ignored in the outcome .

		As the intimate account of a personal ex - perience , the frank illumination of a personality , the Diary is disappointing .

		There is no key to Polk 's tastes , or amusements , or ideals ; no ana - lysis of opinions ; no light on his mental pro- cesses .

		Neither are there reflections or com - ments upon successes or failures .

		There is no entertaining gossip .

		There is , apparently , not the least imagination or humor , and there is curious failure to discriminate , equal attention and space being bestowed upon foreign emis - saries and remote rural office-seekers .

		The man is sunk in the President , and there is only the record of the President 's daily routine , stilted , concise , and , in the manner of it , wholly un - inspiring .

		Mr.
Polk	PERSON	was strangely unemotional , given to the expression of neither elation nor despondency , and writing of himself with ab - surd formality .

		The first entry is
August 26 , 1845	DATE	, in which he writes , '' The President stated , '' etc. .


October 1	DATE	, `` The President at - tended the
Commencement of Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	today ... He was accompanied from the Presi - dent 's Mansion by the Secretary of War , the Attorney-General , '' etc. .


October 7	DATE	. ''

		Mr.
Dallas	PERSON	, the Vice-President of the
United States	LOCATION	, called ... He dined with the President at 4 o'clock
P. M. Maj	PERSON	' r
A. J. Donelson	PERSON	returned from the North to-day , and took lodgings at the President 's mansion .

		He dined with the Pres - ident , also . ''

		As time went on , however , Mr.
Polk	PERSON	's oppressive consciousness of his
august	DATE	position became less novel and exacting , or the constant repetition of ceremonial forms became irksome ; for later in
October	DATE	, and for the greater part of the four volumes , he speaks of himself in the more natural first person .

		The only subject upon which he dwells at length is political intrigue , and this is treated at such length and with such seriousness as to create an impression of littleness of mind .

		And yet , in spite of the negative impression and lack of literary form or spirit , there runs throughout the daily journal a sense of country , and a bull - dog courage , that go far to redeem Polk from the stigma of mediocrity .

		Polk 's first great problem was the settlement of the
Oregon	LOCATION	question with
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		He had been elected on a platform asserting '' the whole claim , '' `` Fifty-four forty or fight . ''

		378 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, Yet almost immediately he offered to accept the forty-ninth parallel , only to be rebuffed by
Pakenham	PERSON	, the British Minister , in discourteous and insulting language .

		Polk then withdrew his proposal , and urged upon
Congress	ORGANIZATION	measures looking toward American occupation of the entire territory in dispute .

		Apparently he was ready to go to war .

		After
Pakenham	PERSON	's refusal he writes -LRB-
January 4 , 1846	DATE	-RRB- : '' I remarked ... that the only way to treat
John Bull	PERSON	was to look him straight in the eye ; that I con - sidered a bold & firm course on our part the pacific one ; that if
Congress	ORGANIZATION	faultered or hesitated in their course ,
John Bull	ORGANIZATION	would immediately become arrogant and more grasping in his demands ; & that such had been the history of the
Brittish Nation	ORGANIZATION	in all their con - tests with other Powers for the last two hundred years . ''

		Ultimately he accepted from the British govern - ment , more reasonable than its representative , practically what he had himself proposed .

		For his conduct of this entire negotiation , Whig writers attacked him , either picturing him as a hypocrite in advocating the extreme American claim , with no intention of securing it , or as a blusterer whose threats nearly precipitated a war with
England	LOCATION	.

		Even Mr.
Reeves	PERSON	doubts Polk 's sincerity , and believes that he so artfully played the political game as to force upon others the odium of yielding a portion of the
Oregon	LOCATION	territory .

		To the present reviewer Polk seems sincere , but embarrassed by the approach of the Mexican War .

		If his Diary is to be taken at its face value , and not regarded wholly as a conscious defense for posterity , then he was absolutely convinced of the rightfulness of our claim .

		His first offer was made with reluctance , inspired by a sense of obligation to his prede - cessors , and he was , indeed , greatly relieved when
Pakenham	PERSON	refused to consider it .

		Pend - ing a resumption of the question by
Pakenham	PERSON	, Polk maintained an obstinate passivity , allow - ing no overture , and merely permitting a rumor to transpire that the President might consider a new offer if presented by
Great Britain	LOCATION	.


Buchanan	PERSON	, the
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	, was much alarmed at this determination , fear - ing that war was inevitable if such a line were persisted in , and argued in Cabinet meetings that this was not '' wise statesmanship . ''

		Polk responded that it `` was right in itself , '' and that the only way to force a conclusion to this long-delayed
Oregon	LOCATION	question lay in impressing upon the British government the imminence of a crisis .

		However remarkable the steps of this negotiation , and the President 's attitude throughout , its satisfactory termination could reflect only credit on
Polk	LOCATION	's sagacity .

		The relations between the President and his
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	were far from harmonious .

		Buchanan , fearing the results of a stiff foreign policy , chafed under the subordination imposed upon him , and yet from political ambition de - sired to escape responsibility .

		Polk was not blind to the anxiety for applause , the tendency to propitiate the public , in his Secretary , and in his Diary he reiterates his suspicions of
Buchanan	PERSON	's intriguing for the Presidency .

		When the negotiations with
Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	took a more peaceful turn , and it became clear that war was not to follow ,
Buchanan	PERSON	, appreciating that the popular voice was against the com - promise , made a complete face-about , seeking to evade responsibility .

		From the man who , dreading a foreign war , had counselled a still more generous treatment of the British agents , this reversal of position came with bad grace .

		Naturally Polk was very angry .

		The proposals of
Great Britain	LOCATION	were under discussion in the Cabinet : `` He -LSB-
Buchanan	PERSON	-RSB- said the 54 40 ' men were the true friends of the administration , and he wished no backing out on the subject .

		I felt excited at the remark but suppressed my feelings and was perfectly calm . ''

		In preparing the message to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	asking '' previous advice '' on the British proposal ,
Buchanan	PERSON	declined to aid the President . ''

		He then said ; Well !

		when you have done your message I will then prepare such an one as I think ought to be sent in .

		1 felt excited at this remark , as he had on
Saturday	DATE	and on
this morning	TIME	refused to aid me in pre - paring my message , and I said to him , for what purpose will you prepare a message ?

		You have twice refused , though it is a subject relating to your
Department	ORGANIZATION	, to give me any aid in preparing my message ; do you wish , after I have done , to draw up a paper of your own in order to make an issue with me ?

		He became excited and said that remark struck him to the heart , and asked me if I thought him capable of doing such a thing ?

		I replied , you have twice refused to give me : m \ aid in preparing my message though requested to do so , and notwithstanding you see that I am overwhelmed with other important public duties and have been subject to constant interruptions , and now you say that after I have done you will prepare a message such as you think ought to be sent in ; and I asked him for what purpose will you do this , and he replied to submit it to you .

		I said , you have not before said that this was your pur - pose ; to which he replied that it was to -LSB- be -RSB- implied that such was his purpose .

		I then told him that I thought I had cause to complain that he had not aided me when requested , but that if I had misunderstood him , I retracted the remark .

		The conversation became a very painful and unpleasant one , but led to mutual explanations that seemed to be satisfactory .

		I told him I had never had any unkind feelings towards him per - sonally or politically .

		He expressed his friendship for me and for Mrs.
Polk	PERSON	.

		After a most unpleasant inter - view he retired . ''

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 379
Buchanan	PERSON	was but one , however , of the many aspirants to the Presidency whose principles , according to Polk , were determined by political expediency .

		Few men with whom he was asso - ciated in public life escaped his condemnatory judgment in this respect .

		During the
Oregon	LOCATION	controversy , but one man ,
Benton	LOCATION	, seems to have had the President 's full confidence , and to him he turned constantly for advice and counsel .

		Later , during the Mexican War , and particu - larly when
Fremont	LOCATION	's actions in
California	LOCATION	caused discord ,
Benton	PERSON	became less acceptable at the
White House	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yet
Benton	PERSON	's suavity and courtesy always appealed to
Polk	LOCATION	, for he was keenly sensitive , especially when new to office , to any word or attitude that seemed to reflect upon the dignity of his position .

		As time went on Polk 's personality be - came better known and men learned at least to respect his determination and his gift in party manosuvring .

		The game to win occupies much more space than the larger objects for which the game is played .

		Polk understood better than any public man of his time , save
Benton	PERSON	, the importance of the acquisition of
California	LOCATION	; and yet
Sloat	PERSON	's seisure of
Monterey	ORGANIZATION	receives but a scant ten lines of notice .

		Was the
California	LOCATION	occupation so largely a foregone conclusion that no comment was called for , or was Sloat 's action appreciated only in the retrospect ?

		Yet Polk generally believes that he held the statesman 's point of view .

		On the
last night	TIME	of his term as President -LRB-
March 3 , 1849	DATE	-RRB- , he makes the following entry , of peculiar inter - est in these days of intense discussion of federal conservation : '' I find that I have omitted to notice the passage by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, after
night of this day	TIME	's proceedings , of a Bill to establish the
Department of the Interior	ORGANIZATION	, or home
Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was presented to me for my approval late at night and -LSB- I -RSB- was much occupied with other duties .

		It was a long Bill containing many sections , and I had but little time to examine it .

		I had serious objections to it , but they were not of a constitutional character and I signed it with reluctance .

		I fear its consolidating tendency .

		I apprehend its practical opera - tion will be to draw power from the states , where the Constitution has reserved it , & to extend the jurisdiction and power of the
U. S.	PERSON	by construction to an unwar - rantable extent .

		Had I been a member of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	I would have voted against it . ''

		Judged by mere space , political management occupied most of Polk 's attention ; and yet upon the subject of office-seekers and their persis - tence , words fail him , though his steadily in - creasing irritation and disgust frequently occupy his pen .


October 19 , 1848	DATE	, he writes : '' The office of President is generally esteemed a very high & dignified position , but really I think the public would not so regard it if they could look in occasionally and observe the kind of people by whom I am often annoyed .

		I can not seclude myself but must be acces - sible to my fellow-citizens , and this gives an oppor - tunity to all classes and descriptions of people to obtrude themselves upon me about matters in which the public has not the slightest interest .

		There is no class of our population by whom I am annoyed so much , or for whom I entertain a more sovereign contempt , than for the professed office-seekers who have beseiged me ever since I have been in the Presidential office . ''


November 13 , 1848	DATE	: '' The herd of office-seekers are the most un - principled persons in the country .

		As a mass they are governed by no principle .

		As an illustration of this I received to-day a slanderous & abusive letter from a man named
Henry Simpson	PERSON	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		This man annoyed me by his letters for an office for more than two years of my time .

		He was disappointed , and now that I am about retiring he vents his bitter feelings .

		Such persons as he contributed largely to swell the vote of
Taylor	PERSON	, the Whig candidate for the Presidency at the late election .

		This man
Simpson	PERSON	professed to be an ardent Democrat whilst he was seeking office from me .

		He will now , I have little doubt , profess to be a Whig and be among the crowd of office seekers to Gen ' l
Taylor	PERSON	.

		There are thousands of unprincipled men like him who vote in elections according to their calculation of chances to get an office .

		The party in power will always be weakened by the votes of this , class of persons . ''


January 10 , 1849	DATE	: `` One Lady -LRB- Mrs. B. -RRB- a widow , called and importuned me to ap - point a gentleman whom she named who is now a clerk in one of the
Departments	ORGANIZATION	.

		She appealed to me to appoint him upon the ground that she desired to marry him provided he could get an office that would support a family .

		She was a gay person of good character , , accustomed to good society , and was rather a pretty woman .

		She said she could not marry her lover while he was a Clerk , but that if I would appoint him a Pay - master in the army she would do so and would be very happy .

		The dispensation of the patronage of the Gov - ernment will weaken if not break down any administra - tion . ''


January 11 , 1849	DATE	: `` Men and women annoyed me for office for themselves , their relatives , and friends ^ The people of the
U. S.	PERSON	have no adequate conception of the number of persons who seek to live upon the Gov - erment , instead of applying themselves to some honest , calling to make a living .

		Several of those who called !

		to-day have importuned me half a dozen times for office .

		They have no claims upon the country and no individual merit .

		I can not exclude them from my office , though I hold them in very low repute , and indeed I almost loath them when I see them entering my door . ''

		With such demands upon his time and for - bearance , surely even the Presidential office had its drawbacks .

		The period of
Polk	ORGANIZATION	's administration was a fateful one in American history , and whether in relation to the play of parties , to
Oregon	LOCATION	, to the Mexican War , or to the great question of the use of the new territories , the four volumes of the
Diary	ORGANIZATION	offer a rich opportunity and a great incentive to historical research .

		A GUIDE-BOOK TO FICTION .

		* Mr.
Arthur Ransome	PERSON	, after editing collect - ions of stories for the British public , has written a guide-book for his readers .

		He has L ^ im , not very happily , in the obscure regions of primitive story-telling ; he has followed more brilliantly with chapters on the narrative of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance , has classi - fied the English novel of the eighteenth century into masculine and feminine , and concluded with very interesting discussions of such French , English , and American innovators as
Scott	LOCATION	, Hugo ,
Poe	PERSON	, and
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	.

		His book is one that forces a reviewer to quote again that much over - worked description of a certain kind of modern criticism , '' the adventures of a soul amidst masterpieces . ''

		The author , as in most criticism of this nature , is sometimes inclined to put too much emphasis upon the adventures of his soul , and too little upon the absolute worth of the masterpieces .

		He sits with a pipe in his mouth , a cup of tea at his elbow -LRB- the description is his -RRB- , and runs over the centuries and their stories with an audacity that must shock the modern student of periods .

		And yet he writes pleasantly , is informing , sometimes illuminating ; and above all he tries , in a jocular fashion , to do some - thing new .

		He is one of the first to attempt to popularize the study of narrative technique .

		It is a much easier and perhaps a more im - portant task to write of personalities than of technique in literature .

		No wonder , then , that most critics of literature have chosen the former for their subject .

		And yet , for a history of the changing varieties of literary types , form , with the technical methods which lead to it , is all important .

		It is the register of that which belongs to art and not to psychology in those changes , and alone can give an effective unity to the whole .

		A writer upon such a subject must keep form chiefly in view .

		But unfortu - nately it is only the artist and the critic who have a natural interest in technical methods .

		The casual reader is after the kernel , and seldom cares for the shell .

		Being unaware that content and form are interdependent , he shies from a discussion of the latter as from a needless analy - sis which makes an artistic complexity of what he thought to be a simple story .

		The feeling is natural ; and if it be well that readers of fiction should sometimes consider the art as well as the substance of their favorites , the way to critical appreciation should be made as attract - ive as possible .

		Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	has felt the ' A HISTORY or STOBT-TBLLOTO .

		desirability of an amiaUe introduction into the criticism of types of fiction , and his hook is a not unsuccessful attempt to provide one .

		Although there are many interesting theories and brilliant characterizations to be credited to the author , much of its historical and critical material is not new ; but it would be difficult to find a summary of the development of the art of fiction more likely to be read through and enjoyed .

		Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	has not found his task an easy one .

		The paths of literary personality are seductive to the writer for non-professional audiences , and one can see the author turning away again and again from subjects more pleas - ant than types and purposes in story-telling .

		His restraint is praiseworthy .

		It has enabled him to bend in a truly critical manner the lives , the tastes , the ideas , and the world of his authors towards an explanation of their art , and this is a service in which more scholarly critics have often failed because of their very single-mindedness .

		At the expense of thorough - ness , and occasionally of accuracy , he has given a desirable breadth to his survey of fiction which more laborious students have often missed .

		The cost must not be overlooked .

		To classify all primitive narrative into the Warn - ing Example and the Embroidered Exploit is amusing , but ignores the animistic origin of much of our story-telling .

		Letters were by no means new in narrative when
Richardson	PERSON	began , and it was less the letter form than the adoption of the plot of the novella for such material as
Addison	PERSON	and
Steele	PERSON	had been busy with which `` helped him to be new himself . ''

		If it is most interesting to connect
Poe	PERSON	with
Godwin	PERSON	, who also constructed his stories with a '' powerful interest '' always in view , it is none the less important that his close connection with the English and German romanticism of his own day should be shown .

		And one wonders whether it is safe , even in a book which counts by centuries , to stop with
Flaubert	PERSON	, as the '' ultimate development of the Romantic move - ment without a change of name . ''

		And yet these and other questions which arise as one reads are not serious except in so far as they make up a criticism which must necessarily be passed upon a book of this kind .

		No series of generalizations , however brilliant , and however sane , can be entirely satisfactory unless their substructure be broad and sound .

		In Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	's work there is little room for sub - structure ; one must too often take it upon trust .

		The powerful and complex inHuenuea of the

		But there was no room , and the casual reader will not endure an exhumation of the grave - yards of the past !

		Exactly , and here is the root of the whole matter .

		If Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	had put more paper on his desk , more scholar - ship in his ink bottle , and more reading of dull and forgotten fiction in his head ; if he had made a new contract with his publishers , and served notice upon the light-minded among his readers , he might have grasped that admirable opportunity to write a thorough survey of fiction which his methods and his good judgment seem to have given him .

		But he or any one might readily fail in so arduous a task , whereas he has certainly presented us with a moderately comprehensive , occasionally brilliant , and thor - oughly readable popularization of the technique of fiction .

		of '' The Old Wives ' Tale '' know so well .

		When we say that the new novel is quite the equal of the earlier one , possibly surpassing it in relentless real - ism and grim power , we say enough to indicate that it is a work of extraordinary importance .

		In the larger sense , it gives us an account of the social evolution of an English provincial community during the closing three decades of the nineteenth century ; in the narrower and more intensely vitalized sense , it is concerned with the fortunes of one
Darius Clayhanger	PERSON	, printer and stationer , and of his son
Edwin	PERSON	.

		There are other figures , sisters , an aunt , employees , friends , and acquaintances , but these two are dominant , and with these two alone , vividly and minutely realized , typically significant , we are chiefly occupied .

		The tragedy of the narrative is found in the crushing influence of the older genera - tion upon the younger ;
Edwin	PERSON	has impulses and aspirations which might have borne fruit in a more favorable environment , but he is just lacking in the strength of will needed to free him from the iron tyranny of prescription .

		The struggle is soon over it is a struggle that hardly gets outside the arena of his own thoughts and he settles down to plod in his father 's footsteps , take on the abhorred business , and forget that he has ever been tempted to revolt .

		This novel is , as we said of the earlier one , a tale of mean lives in mean surroundings , but the truth of its portrayal is so insistent that we are ready to acquiesce in the absence of most of the elements that go to make up ordinary romance .

		The author is so afraid of drifting into any sem - blance of sentimentality that he seems at times positively inhuman .

		His own hatred for
Darius	PERSON	matches that of the son , and even the spectacle of the old man in his last stage of hopeless paresis can hardly wring from him a suggestion of tender sym - pathy .

		It is impossible to describe this book in honest terms that shall make it appear attractive , yet such is its power that we would not spare a single page ; the very trivialities with which it mainly deals are touched with such genius that we find them interesting against our will , and we must admit that they are needed for the total effect of the composition .

		The book is open to one serious criticism .


Hilda	PERSON	, the young woman whom
Edwin	PERSON	loves , and who accepts him in one moment only to turn from him in the next , is not a real person in the present narrative .

		As some one says of her , '' She 's nothing at all for about six months at a stretch , and then she has one minute of the grand style . ''

		We learn why she is thus left a mystery when we read the appended note which promises a whole novel about her next year , and we have no doubt that we shall know her inmost nature when that novel shall be in our hands ; but it is certainly a defect of artistry thus deliberately to evade the full responsibilities of one work in order to keep sufficient material for another yet to be written .

		Her conduct , as we here get glimpses of it , has neither rhyme nor reason , while her appearance and her character are so inadequately portrayed THE DIAJL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, that
Edwin	PERSON	's infatuation is nowise accounted for .

		To the present reader of
Edwin	PERSON	's age , which means in the early fifties , the book has a special , interest in which younger readers can not share .

		Pursuant to his larger purpose , the author has filled his nar - rative with echoes from the past , which evoke in us all sorts of dim memories .

		The things that were doing in the outside world , and of which even the Five Towns got some sort of inkling political happenings , currents of fresh thought , and the progress of civilization are brought into personal relations with the Clay hanger prejudices , and thus we read from time to time of such matters as
Colenso	PERSON	and the higher criticism , home rule , Glad - stone and
Parnell	PERSON	, the Queen 's Jubilee , the obstinacy of
Northampton	LOCATION	in sending Bradlaugh to
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment , the prayer gauge '' -LRB- here by a curious slip attributed to
Thompson	PERSON	instead of Tyndall -RRB- , `` The Light of
Asia	LOCATION	, '' and the early epidemics of influenza .

		All these historical matters are deftly made to serve their purpose in the author 's work of characteriza - tion , and at the same time to help to bring back a half - forgotten age .

		There are to be two more novels in the series the story of
Hilda	PERSON	, already spoken of , and a final volume dealing with the life of
Edwin	PERSON	and
Hilda	PERSON	after their long-delayed marriage .

		If we had not previously received proofs of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's versatility , we should wonder that the same pen should have produced '' Clayhanger '' and ``
Helen	PERSON	with the High Hand . '' ''

		In the Five Towns , '' he says , human nature is reported to be so hard that you can break stones upon it . ''

		This readers of `` Clayhanger '' will readily admit , but when he adds that '' sometimes it softens , and then we have one of our rare idylls of which we are very proud , '' the assertion needs the confirmation supplied by the light-hearted comedy of ''
Helen	PERSON	with the High Hand . ''

		The young woman thus designated is the great-stepniece of
James Ollerenshaw	PERSON	, a bachelor of sixty , and the miserly accumulator of miserable weekly shillings from the several hundred cottages which he owns .

		Owing to an ancient feud , he has not recognized
Helen	PERSON	's existence for the twenty-five years of her life , but one day that de - signing young woman insinuates herself into his life to the extent of becoming his housekeeper without asking his permission .

		The shock is twofold , for she gives him surprisingly good things to eat , and worries the wits out of him by her reckless expendi - ture .

		She soon lias him as wax in her hands , per - suades him , by alternate cajolery and the threat of going away , to purchase a mansion and live in it , and in the end he is prepared weakly to submit to her most irrational demands .

		His enlarged acquaint - ance with feminine nature inspires him to the auda - city of loving and winning a portly widow of the town -LRB- not without encouragement , it must be ad - mitted -RRB- , and his evolution is complete .

		Meanwhile ,
Helen	PERSON	has a little love affair of her own , which her resourceful talent enables her to bring to the desired issue .

		It is capital fooling , humorously charming from start to finish , and we are glad to have it as a pendant to Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's gloomy large-scale depic - tions of the Five Towns .

		A modified version of the tale of Tristan and Isolde is given us in '' Masters of the Wheat - Lands , '' by Mr.
Harold Bindloss	PERSON	.

		An English wheat-farm , r in the
Canadian Northwest	ORGANIZATION	has for years been betrothed to a girl in
England	LOCATION	- She has been self - supporting as a singer , but the loss of her voice throws her upon the world , and the man realizes that the time has come for the fulfilment of his pledge .

		But he can not very well leave his farm , and so he deputes a neighbor -LRB- who is going to Eng - land anyway -RRB- to bring the promised bride out to her new home .

		His choice of a messenger is ill - advised , for the man who undertakes the mission is a hero of the type frequently depicted by Mr.
Bind	PERSON	- loss , and the man who sends him is a shiftless sort of person , weak of will , and coarsened by his life on the prairie .

		The young woman draws the inevitable comparison , and when she reaches her new home , finds that she and her former lover have grown hope - lessly away from one another .

		It is a long while before the claims of conscience and the call of duty are adjusted to the new state of affairs , but in the end Tristan -LRB- without
Tristan	ORGANIZATION	's treachery -RRB- prevails over the rather despicable
King Marke	PERSON	, who , for his part , finds facile consolation in another quarter .

		The story thus offers something of a variant upon the author 's stereotyped plan of construction , al - though in the matters of description and characteri - zation it follows familiar lines .

		What finally wins the heroine is a Quixotic enterprise undertaken by the hero for the rescue of an old-time companion stranded in the wilds of
Kamschatka	LOCATION	.

		This adven - ture , brought to a successful issue , is given us with great detail , and , although interesting enough in it - self , makes too great a gap in the continuity of the narrative .

		When the hero returns , affairs are brought to a swift conclusion .

		Captain
Gilson	PERSON	's story of '' The Refugee '' is a spirited romance of the Napoleonic period .

		The chief figure is a fascinating and villainous French - man who joins the ranks of the emigres , finds shelter in an English country home , and makes love to the daughter of the house .

		But he is not fascinating enough to blind the object of his affections to his real character , and when he fails to win her by fair means , resorts to foul .

		Having become a turncoat and a spy in the pay of
Napoleon	LOCATION	, he plots to f urther the impending invasion , and incidentally to kidnap the girl .

		The story of his evil machinations and how they are foiled makes agreeable reading , and provides us with picturesque companions , notable among whom is the celebrated highwayman who gets mixed up in the plot , and whose audacious ex - ploits make us almost sorry for him when he is at last laid by the heels .

		Readers who found in Mr.
Booth	PERSON	's `` The Post Girl '' one of the most charming of
last year	DATE	's novels will take similar pleasure in reading its successor , * ' The Doctor 's Lass . ''

		The doctor is a country prac - titioner in
Yorkshire	LOCATION	, and his life has been blighted
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 383 many years before by the flight of his betrothed with another man .

		He has brooded over it ever since , fallen into slovenly ways , and taken to drink .

		Now comes a letter from the deathbed of the woman who had wronged him , describing the miserable consequences of her action , and begging the doctor to look after her child , a girl of twelve or there - abouts .

		The responsibility is reluctantly assumed , and the child is sent for .

		But she looks like her mother , and the doctor can not bear the sight .

		The bulk of the book tells how she insinuates herself into his affections , makes him mend his ways , and in the course of the proper number of years , aston - ishes him with the discovery that he is in love with her .

		There must , of course , be a set-back , and this is provided by her fancied attachment to a curate , which makes the doctor very miserable .

		Then her father turns up , a drunken criminal , and resorts to blackmail .

		This is too much for the curate , who loses no time in showing his colors , whereupon the girl discovers that it is her guardian whom she really loves after all .

		The story is rather excessively drawn out at times , and the agony a little more pro- tracted than it need be , but there are interest and vitality and wholesome charm in every chapter , and a style that is far out of the common .

		In its central situation , '' The Greatest Wish in the World , '' by Mr.
E. Temple Thurston	PERSON	, is not unlike Mr.
Booth	PERSON	's appealing story .

		It is , of course , a very old situation , being that created when a girl , reared from early childhood by a man of middle age , so entwines herself in his affections as to create an almost tragic complication when the mating impulse possesses her , and he is threatened with the going out of the very light of his life .

		The artistic solution of this problem is probably to face the facts and let nature have her way , but if the novelist is sentimentally inclined he will follow the path of least resistance , as Mr.
Booth	PERSON	does , and leave the girl in the protecting care of the man who is old enough to be her father .

		No such evasion is possible to Mr.
Thurston	PERSON	, however , for the guardian of his heroine is a Catholic priest and there is nothing for it but that he should nerve himself for the inevitable bereavement .

		His
Peggy	PERSON	is a very lovable creature , but her sailor-suitor seems to be quite worthy of her , and the misunderstanding which almost causes her to end her days in a convent is happily cleared up , with the connivance of Father
O'Leary	PERSON	, just in time to save two young lives for earthly happiness . ''

		The Greatest Wish in the World '' is of course , that of having a child to cherish , and this is equally shared by Father
O'Leary	PERSON	and his rather terrifying house - keeper , both of whom must suffer when
Peggy	PERSON	takes her flight .

		The poignancy of the situation is softened for us as much as possible , and a sort of sunset glow the radiance of bright memories is made to play about their lives that are left desolate .

		The story is very genuine and very human , but we do not quite like the affectation of familiarity with the reader in which the author so frequently in - dulges .

		There is much impertinent matter of this kind that must be described as padding , and had far better have been excised .

		The sort of story that Mr.
E. Phillips Oppenheim	PERSON	writes -LRB- at the rate of about two a year -RRB- may make no claim to serious critical consideration , but it can not be denied that the author has acquired an admirable technique of the sort demanded by the novel of intrigue and mystery .

		He never lets the interest drag , he contrives dramatic situations in rapid suc - cession , and he keeps his secret well in hand until the time comes to let it out . ''

		The Lost Ambas - sador '' offers a typical example of Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	's craftsmanship , and its easy man-of-the-world manner makes it entertaining reading .

		The hero discovers the heroine in the first chapter , constitutes himself her knight-errant , believes in her when appearances are most against her , and earns his final reward by the intelligence and devotion with which he ferrets out the mystery in which she has become entangled .

		It is all very neatly managed and to fairly exciting effect .

		Most detective stories plunge us into bewilder - ment and keep us there until the closing chapter , when we are vouchsafed a hurried and forced ex - planation that does not half explain .

		If it were worth while -LRB- which it usually is n't -RRB- , we should have to go through the whole story again to untie all of its knots with the help thus tardily furnished .

		Now Mr.
A. E. W. Mason	PERSON	, who writes `` At the Villa Rose , '' claims our gratitude for the particularity with which he clears things up at the end , and his example de - serves imitation .

		Otherwise , the story is of fairly conventional pattern .

		The scene is at Aix-les -
Bains	LOCATION	, and the interest is in the murder of a rather vulgar middle-aged woman .

		Her companion -LRB- the heroine -RRB- is suspected , and the man whom we at first take for the hero turns out to be the criminal .

		Then the story takes an unexpected turn , for the celebrated French detective who has unravelled the mystery finds that he has also won the love of the -RCB- r oung woman whose name he has cleared .

		Although Dutch types of character have provided the leading figures in the later novels of ``
Maarten Maartens	PERSON	, '' they have been given something like a cosmopolitan setting , and been shaped by the in .

		fluences of the larger world .

		In ''
Harmen	PERSON	Pols , '' however , the author recurs to his earlier task , and draws his inspiration wholly from his native air .

		He has indeed , in local visualization and narrow con - centration of purpose , given us a more intimate pic - ture of Dutch life the racy and circumscribed life of the Dutch peasant than is to be found in any of the book 's predecessors .

		It is a very small plot that he cultivates , but the cultivation is in the highest degree intensive .

		He has set himself to describe the spiritual tragedy of three lives the peasant - proprietor , weighted with a morbid sense of im - agined guilt , his wife , faithful in act but faithless in thought because self-convicted of the sin of cher - ishing an earlier love , and their son , for whom a spiritual crisis is prepared just as he is reaching manhood .

		A claim , long ignored but strictly legal , 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, is made upon the family farm , and the household is threatened with ruin .

		The boy tries to set matters to rights , and uncovers a complication of old in - iquities that threatens the very citadel of his soul .

		This test is the making of his character , and the redeeming ministries of pity and love achieve his rescue .

		The reality of the book fairly grips the reader , and the harsh outlines of the grim narrative are softened by tender and imaginative touches .

		The power of the story is no less marked than its fidelity to fact , and it is , as far as the chief figures are concerned , a triumph of artistic characterization . ''

		The Lady of the Spur , '' by Mr.
David Potter	PERSON	, is a story of love and excitement , with the adven - turous sort of hero and the pert sort of heroine that can always be counted on to provide entertainment .

		It offers a slight departure from the conventional type in the setting provided for it , which plunges us neither into the thick of modern life nor into the romantic atmosphere of the far distant past .

		The period is something less than a hundred years ago , when the name of
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	was one to conjure with , and the scene is in the pine barrens of
New Jersey	LOCATION	.

		One
Tom Bell	PERSON	, an escaped high - wayman under sentence of death , returns to this place after seine years of absence , trusting that he is so changed as to be safe from recognition .

		He comes to bring news of the death of one
Henry	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mnrv ; in .

		who has been his chum on the
Missouri	LOCATION	.

		But when he arrives , he is impelled to pass himself off as
Morvan	LOCATION	, whereby he takes possession of valu - able estates , and takes up the life of a country gentleman .

		His new life is beset by many perils , because his unexpected appearance frustrates the hopes of the rightful heirs , and a gang of masked nightrriders seeks to scare him away .

		He keeps up the imposture for the sake of a fair cousin with whom he falls in love , and balks the schemes of various villains at much personal danger .

		Finally , he makes a full confession , but the haughty heroine has capitulated , and then it turns out that he had never really been a highwayman , but a scapegoat , and that President
Jackson	PERSON	has long since signed a full pardon for him .

		Thus is he ingeniously ex - tricated from what seems an impossible situation , and we may henceforth approve of him without the stirrings of conscience that have troubled us heretofore .

		The story is an exceptionally good one of its rather trifling but undoubtedly entertaining kind .

		His real name is
Elam Harnish	PERSON	, but they call him '' Burning Daylight , '' a fact ostensibly ac - counted for by a rather pointless anecdote , but better explained by the natural revolt of sensible men against such a legal appellation as belongs to him .

		His habitat is
Alaska	LOCATION	, where he is a superman , ex - celling all his fellows in feats of strength and daring , in recklessness at the gaming-table , and in general deviltry .

		Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	, who has fashioned him for our delectation , evidently likes him , and glories in his varied brutalities , which is not surprising when we think of certain of the author 's earlier essays in portraiture . ''

		Daylight '' has a '' hunch '' that makes him one of the first discoverers of the Klondike , and carries him through speculative operations whereby he cleans up '' some ten millions in a couple of years .

		Then he betakes himself to
New York	LOCATION	, where a group of high financiers successfully '' play him for a sucker , '' and transfer the ten millions to their own pockets .

		Being a superman , he then forces them to disgorge at the pistol 's point , and carries his ten millions back to the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast .

		Settling in
San Francisco	LOCATION	, he plunges into the financial game himself -LRB- having profited by experience -RRB- , and his ten millions soon grow to thirty in consequence of a series of unscrupulous enterprises , which reveal him as the most desperate cut-throat of the gang .

		But one day he discovers that his muscles are growing flabby , and that he has been drinking too much for his health .

		At the same time he discovers unex - pected charms in his private stenographer , and pur - sues her with his customary violence .

		But to his surprise she will have none of his millions , persuad - ing him that the game is not worth the cost , and that what he really needs is to cultivate the simple life .

		Whereupon he '' chucks '' the whole game , throws his fortune into the scrap-heap , and retires to a modest ranch to earn a living by the sweat of his brow .

		The young woman , seeing what havoc her influence has wrought , can do no less than go with him , yielding to the man what she had obstinately refused to the millionaire .

		His regeneration is worked out with less of the usual bathos than might have been expected , and is a thoroughgoing perform - ance .

		The whole story is deliciously and glaringly absurd , and done in the crudest of colors , but it has the merits of swift action and forcible expression , and is , on the whole , rather better work than the author has been giving us of late .

		He preaches a gospel that is wholesome -LRB- barring its socialistic vagaries -RRB- and much needed in our frenzied com - mercial age .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		A tone view of mdium $ to U8e * me emphasis in speaking of the '' Studies in Spirit - i sm by Dr. A my
E. Tanner	PERSON	, who has had the active cooperation of Dr.
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	in preparing her papers for publication .

		As a scientific survey of an elusive group of phenomena popularly misconceived , and by the prestige of `` psychic researchers '' distorted to support an alien construction , the present book -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- becomes a serious plea for the rights of both logic and psy - chology .

		Toward any very special subject , the public can assume but a casual attitude , and must -RSB- > erforce judge by general appearances and draw distinctions loosely .

		To such , psychology and `` psychic re - search '' seem much alike ; and the former has at times been looked upon as a dull evasion of the latter .

		Their very different manner of conducting
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 385 their affairs is too commonly overlooked .

		Hence the need of emphasis to make an impression .

		Further - more , a sensational eagerness for the marvellous and the obscure inclines to all that makes for the reality of telepathy , and for the evidential value of Mrs.
Piper	PERSON	's sittings , and for the superphysical origin of
Paladino	ORGANIZATION	's table levitations .

		The public listens only when a dramatic collapse makes a clatter that finds a response in shouting headlines .

		Mrs.
Piper	PERSON	can not be dramatically exposed ; she must be rendered trans - parent to a reflective insight .

		Yet that difference does not obscure the important point in common : that the interpretation of such phenomena as revela - tions of unknown forces is just superstition , pure and simple , only not very pure and not very simple .

		For a stirring arraignment of this modern revival of outworn attitudes , Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's masterly introduction should be read .

		How far it will serve as an antidote seems uncertain ; but it prepares the way for
Miss Tanner	PERSON	's findings of the facts in the case , as they ap - peared in six well-arranged sittings .

		The record is inevitably detailed , and to some the reading will be tedious .

		But it is all necessary to the analysis , as well as to show the hollowness of Mrs.
Piper	PERSON	's -LRB- or her protagonists ' -RRB- pretences , and the amateurish irrelevance of the telepathic and similar '' eviden - tial '' hypotheses .

		Suffice it to say that Mrs.
Piper	PERSON	and her spirit controls fell into obvious traps , and made just such good guesses and such bad ones as were natural for her natural assumptions , assisted by a skilful '' fishing '' for clues and a practised handling of the landing-net .

		The psychological side of the story is the more interesting : on the part of the sitters , much favorable prejudice , more prepos - session and exaggeration , and a system of apologetics that creates prodigious coincidences of incidental trifles ; on the medium 's side , a trance-state that finds explanation as a variant of secondary personality , suggestive in the mode of its absorbing its mental stimulus and its suppressed reactions to the situa - tions .

		The trance-personality .

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	regards as sufficiently near of kin to the responsible Mrs.
Piper	PERSON	to enable her to prepare a very illuminating account of the doings of her silent partner .

		Yet on the whole there is no great excitement in these four hundred pages ; though the presentation of the evidence does not lag , and the summing up and charge to the public jury are most ably delivered .

		It is a book worth a large and serious attention .

		Its point of view should be absorbed , and the significance of the case appreciated .

		Those with predilections for flying to forces that we know not of , owe it a careful hearing .

		Such a volume is indeed needed , and the investiga - tions that make it strong and sound , while not in themselves over-fruitful , will in the end makepossible an attitude of wholesome interest in the true signi - ficance of even the vagaries of the mental life .

		For this service ,
Miss Tanner	PERSON	and Dr.
Hall	PERSON	deserve and will receive much credit .

		They must also be pre - pared to learn something about their motives and conduct and intelligence that their conscious selves have not as yet revealed to them .

		A new sheaf of those sprightly essays wherewith Dr.
Samuel McChord Crothers	PERSON	periodically entertains and not seldom instructs ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' readers , is just at hand . ''

		Among Friends '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- takes its name from the opening paper , which treats , among other things , of that good understanding and good humor which make possible the exhilarating give and take of good conversation . ''

		The
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
American School of Polite Unlearning	ORGANIZATION	'' is a whimsi - cal account of a supposed institution for the cure of international prejudice .

		`` The Hundred Worst Books '' and '' The Convention of Books '' will tickle the erudite and those whose days are passed in libraries . ''

		In Praise of Politicians '' has a good word to say even for the opportunist in statecraft , and it offers for our acceptance the useful word '' politicaster '' -LRB- after the analogy of '' poetaster '' -RRB- to denote the less admirable follower of the noble calling of politics , as distinguished from the politi - cian who will be known after his death as a states - man . ''

		Missionary Life in
Persia	LOCATION	, with Some Remarks on Liking One 's Job '' can not be character - ized in two lines ; but it finely advocates the sports - manlike and cheery attitude toward the task in hand . ''

		The Colonel in the Theological Seminary , '' `` The Romance of Ethics , '' and `` The Merry Devil of Education '' indicate merely by their titles that happy conceits and amusing freaks of fancy , together with a sufficiency of more serious matter , are to be found in the chapters which they head .

		While the book abounds in its author 's customary felicities of style and happy turns of thought , it seems to betray here and there a suggestion of the influence of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	.

		It is difficult to escape the Chestertonic infection even if one has never read him .

		He is in the air .

		But we are assured that Dr.
Crothers	PERSON	both reads and admires his British contemporary essayist .

		The following fragment from '' Among Friends '' inevitably reminds one of the staccato style so familiar to us from across the water : '' Find out what Natural Law is about to make everybody do , and do it before they know what it is .

		That is success .

		Success consists , not in doing what you want to do and doing it well ; it is doing what you have to do and being quick about it . ''

		With the style , something of its originator 's superabundance of thoughts and subter-abundance of thought may possibly be discovered ; yet we would not positively affirm this .

		It is a tendency , how - ever , to be guarded against .

		The charm Mr > ^ ert
Gehring	PERSON	, in his interesting and mystery and valuable book on `` The Basis of Music .

		of Musical Pleasure '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , treats his subject mainly from the inductive and external side .

		He states that there is as yet no such thing as a genuine explanation of the pleasure inherently belonging to music , although we have many indications of the varied sources from which that pleasure springs .

		He discusses the power of tone , the significance of musical form , the halo of THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, associative fascinations by which music is encircled , the effectiveness of music in its power to symbolize in many ways the light or serious experiences of men , and the remarkable parallelisms which exist between the intellectual and emotional life of the race on the one side and the structure and develop - ment of music on the other .

		To this last section of his subject he gives - his best and most decided attention ; and it is certainly worthy of the promi - nence in which he puts it .

		In fact , it contains within itself the possibility of an organic summation of all the other sources , and the placing of them in such relation as will make plain their comparative value and importance .

		Mr.
Gehring	PERSON	is everywhere a suggestive and interesting writer , but he makes no pretense to be complete or systematic , and in the end is altogether too modest about the results attained .

		Thus he says : '' Here we must conclude our research .

		It is better to make a frank confession of ignorance , than to indulge in empty guesses and untenable hypotheses .

		Let us hope that the problem is not essentially incapable of explanation , and that a day may arrive which shall witness a solution of the puzzling mysteries . ''

		It may perhaps be said that this day has already arrived .

		The mystery of music is neither more nor less than the mystery of any art .

		The secret of architecture is just as far to seek as that of music , and , indeed , the two have much in common .

		The
Ninth Symphony of Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	may very well be likened to a Gothic cathedral , and the import of one is similar to the import of the other .

		Music , being the last of the arts to mature , is also the last to find its theory and explanation .

		Mr.
Gehring	PERSON	's book is a hopeful sign .

		We think he will come to have a better opinion of opera than he seems at present to hold , and will entirely recognize that the world of emotion , complex and intricate , finds a consummate expression in the world of sound , cognately complex and intricate , and that the resultant music takes an equal place with the other arts in its revelation of the best and highest in the experiences of mankind .

		The book deserves the attention of all lovers and students of music .

		Countr ie8 , Mr.
John Foster Eraser	PERSON	now adds
Australia	LOCATION	to the list ''
Australia	LOCATION	: The Making of a Nation '' -LRB-
Cassell	PERSON	-RRB- gives a picture of the country as the author saw it in his visit of a year ago .

		A vast territory with but four million inhabitants , and those largely congregated in a few chief cities ; rather over-supplied with labor laws , and constrained to heed the mandates of the labor unions ; provided with government-owned railroads , and needing for the development of her vast re - sources many more miles of railroad than she is likely to get for a long time to come , this young and hope - ful commonwealth is revealed in the pages of Mr.
Fraser	PERSON	's book as a paradise not without its jungles a land unquestionably delightful to the curious and observant visitor , but suffering from a variety of ills known and unknown elsewhere .

		If the climate were different , if legislation could be modified , if it were not for the rabbit pest , and so on with a gen - erous provision of ifs ,
Australia	LOCATION	would be the ideal of what a country ought to be .

		Pending the reali - zation of these conditions , most of us are content to visit this over-grown and under-populated island in the pages of such generously communicative travel - lers and writers as Mr.
Eraser	PERSON	.

		On an early page he assigns to
Australia	LOCATION	, in his largeness of heart and with a familiar disregard of syntax , an area '' as big , or bigger , than all
Europe	LOCATION	, '' thus crediting the island with an excess of some eight hundred thou - sand square miles .

George A. Torrey	PERSON	, who began the practice of his profession almost half a century ago in
Fitchburg	LOCATION	,
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts , and continued it later in
Boston	LOCATION	, becoming general counsel of the
Fitchburg Railroad	ORGANIZATION	and trying cases in all but three of the counties in the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		His anecdotes of the bench and bar , from his own long and varied experience with courts and lawyers , are entertaining , and they bring into occasional near view such men of note as Judge
Hoar	PERSON	, Senator
Hoar	PERSON	, Mr.
Richard Olney	PERSON	, and others .

		Even more interesting , for the average reader , are Mr.
Torrey	PERSON	's reminiscences of his school and college days .

		He entered
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1855	DATE	, under the benignant ad - ministration of President
Walker	PERSON	and in the palmy days of Professors
Felton	PERSON	,
Peirce	PERSON	, Child ,
Cook	PERSON	,
Lovering	PERSON	, and
Bowen	PERSON	, all of whom he recalls by nickname .

		In his expressed conviction that the stu - dents of his time received a training such as is now no longer to be had , he but adopts the inevitable belief of all college men , that alma mater was in the full flush of her ripened charms during the four years they were in college , and that she has been falling off ever since .

		On an early page of his book the author assigns to his own church in
Fitchburg	LOCATION	the time-honored story of the very short preacher and the very high pulpit above which he managed , by standing on tip-toe , to show the top of his head as he piped forth his text , `` It is I , be not afraid . ''

		How many other old-time churches claim to be the scene of this incident , we shall probably never know .

		The feminine * d , Mr -
Edgcumbe Staley	PERSON	has recently of Vrnrtian life added another volume to his series under the Dope * .

		of gtu dies in Italian history , the sub - ject this time being '' The Dogaressas of
Venice	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		That the consorts of the doges must have exerted a real influence on Venetian policies and development is evident , though in rare case * only does this appear on the surface of the political current The doyaressas had many responsibilities and prescribed duties , though these were chiefly of

		THE DIAL 387 a social character : '' the patronage and direction of charities of all kinds whether eleemosynary or educational , the maintenance of the Ducal hospitali - ties , the reception of ambassadors , the claims of the family , and the encouragement of arts and crafts . ''

		But these are activities that the annalist too often fails to record , and hence the story of the dogaressas is neither intensely interesting nor very instructive ; too often the account is limited to a name , a date or two , and a pedigree .

		Nevertheless , there is much in Mr.
Staley	PERSON	's book that his readers will enjoy : pictures of Venetian life , both public and private ; descriptions of odd customs and quaint ceremonial , of pageants , processions , athletic tournaments , and gorgeous funerals ; of household arts , particularly those of the boudoir .

		All this may be regarded as padding , but it is padding of a very pleasant sort .

		The work is , indeed , more a study of feminine life in
Venice	LOCATION	than a history of the ducal consorts ; it is as social history that it will prove most valuable .

		It is written in the author 's easy , almost exuberant style , and is provided with a number of valuable illustrations .

Lawrence	PERSON	has produced a of psychology useful compilation of old and mod - and medicine .

		He calls it '' Primitive Psycho-Therapy and Quack - ery '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		What in primitive situations was the natural belief in the efficiency of procedures based on accredited systems of ideas , becomes in more illuminated periods the survival of quackery preying upon credulity .

		The large share of such quackery persisting to or revived in our own time and clime gives the necessary experience to make the older practices of one nature and kinship .

		Dr.
Lawrence	PERSON	brings together a most varied collection , many of them from unusual sources , of the diverse methods of appeal to the faith in the desired cure , from amulets to blue-glass and magic formulae .

		It makes a curiously assorted string of beads , yet really united by the common thread of a mental influence acting upon a favorably disposed imagination ; and it leads to reflection upon the enduring traits of human nature , one of which was briefly commented upon by Puck , another by
P. T. Barnum	PERSON	, and yet another by Lincoln .

		The degree of human folly , the human appetite for folly , and the futility of folly as a permanent prescription for all men on all occasions , all find pertinence in the long historical range of citations brought to - gether by this student of the by-ways of medicine and psychology .

		Dr.
George M. Gould	PERSON	, whose thought - ful and thought-generating studies are by no means confined to the subject of eye-strain , has brought together a number of his essays on religious subjects in a volume en - titled `` The Infinite Presence '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The title is taken from the first chapter , which is A new '' Religio Medici . ''

		reprinted from '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly '' of six years ago ; the other essays were also , with one exception , prepared originally for other purposes than book pub - lication .

		Taken together , they present , in an at - tractive and sufficiently systematic form , the deeper beliefs and higher ideals of a scholarly and reflective mind .

		Far from professing the skepticism or the agnosticism of the typical physician , Dr.
Gould	PERSON	acknowledges a very positive belief , which , as we understand it , has a certain pantheistic tinge .

		The Infinite Presence is defined as '' the living synthesis of all these characteristics of which we as partial incarnations present only facets . ''

		The limitations and `` the failures , His mistakes or ours , '' of Dr.
Gould	PERSON	's non-omnipotent deity are frankly acknowl - edged , although elsewhere in the book the terms '' omnipotence '' and '' infinite of power '' occur , but rather vaguely .

		The author makes the stellar uni - verse to be of limitless extent , whatever modern astronomy may have to say to the contrary .

		In spite of an occasional apparent or real self-contradiction , some repetition , and perhaps a little insufficiency of clearness and conciseness , the book is both worthy of a careful reading and is written in a style to insure it .

		It is based upon much material heretofore unused , and constitutes a solid contribution to American scholarship in the historical field .

		Mrs.

		Professor
Paul Shorey	PERSON	's college text of the Odes and
Epodes of Horace	ORGANIZATION	, first published twelve years ago , has come into a new edition , the preparation of which has been shared by Professor
Gordon J. Laing	PERSON	.

		The changes consist chiefly of added references to the recent litera - ture of the subject , and a slight curtailment of the 388 THE DIAL -LSB-

		`` A Guide to Reading in Social Ethics and Allied Subjects '' is the title of a unique bibliography which has just been prepared through the cooperation of more than twenty teachers in
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each instructor has contributed a list of the more noteworthy books in his special field , and in almost every case has added a brief criticism or analysis .

		Although the vol - ume is designed primarily for those engaged in social service , the general reader should find in it a useful guide to the best contemporary studies of social condi - tions and problems .

		` The Lure of the Antique '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the attractive title of the latest book about old furniture .

		Some form of the antique allures almost everybody nowadays , and it is fnr these omnipresent amateur col - lectors that Mr.
Walter A. Dyer	PERSON	has planned his treatise , which covers Colonial furniture , china , mirrors , candle-sticks , silver , pewter and glass ware , copper utensils , and clocks .

		Mr.
Dyer	PERSON	urges the advantages of the Colonial period for American collectors , and of specialization in one field rather than dabbling in many and consequently accumulating a hodge-podge which is likely to include plenty of '' fakes . ''

		How to dis - tinguish the false from the real is a matter to which he gives much attention .

		Another puzzling question for the inexperienced buyer is the financial one : how much to pay for the article you covet ; what is a real bargain and what a fair price .

		Mr.
Dyer	PERSON	finds a rather novel way of helping to solve this problem .

		His book is richly illustrated from photographs of typical antiques , and each one is given its approximate money-value .

		In the treatment of each subdivision of the subject the arrangement is chronological , with emphasis on the work of noted makers .

		Some time ago , Mrs.
Bertha Feiring Tapper	PERSON	edited for the Musician 's Library '' of the Messrs.

		The editor is herself a Norwegian , and consequently brings to her work of selection both understanding and sympathy .

		Eighteen opus numbers are represented , most of them by several pieces .

		The Chancellor , in proposing the toast of ' ' The King , '' announced that his Majesty had consents t < > accept the dedication of the new edition of the Ency - clopedia Britannica -LSB- cheers -RSB- , and that the President of the
United States	LOCATION	had also accepted a similar iedi - cation .

		The President of the British Academy -LRB- Mr. -.11 Butcher ,
M.P.	LOCATION	-RRB- proposed the toast of the `` Eney.-lo paedia Britannica . ''

		He said , in part , that the `` En - cyclopaedia Britannica ' ' was a very remarkable book in its traditions .

		The first edition went back 140 years , but the eleventh edition had now passed into the hands of
the University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was to come out in ti9 volumes ; it had i !

		7,000 pages , 40,000 articles , and more than 1.500 contributors .

		These contributors were men of great distinction , not only in this coun - try , but all over the world ; and with its
India	LOCATION	paper and some other of its physical characteristics , the weight of the 29 volumes was 30 Ibs. , all the volumes being compressed into a space of about two feet .

		-LSB- Laughter and cheers . -RSB-

		How did this book come into existence ?

		Who made it what it wast Who had created this new e < litionf It was more than a new edition ; they might wiy that it had been '' \ \ ritten as compared with the ninth or tenth edition : i ml the work was due to the editor , Mr.
Chisholm	PERSON	, perhaps , also with the help of his assistant , Mr.
Phil	PERSON	- ips .

		He had been silently at work on this edition for eight years , and had been able to produce an edition which wan a quite original thing in the history of en - cyclopedias .

		He had obtained the help of expert advisers , and through the aid of The Times had been able to establish relations with all the world .

		It seemed to him that there were two interesting and original features of this new edition .

		The first was that the book would be a complete and uniform whole .

		Through all these eight years the editor had kept all the parts of the book in relation one with the other .

		He had kept in touch with the contributors , and had made them know what the other collaborators were doing .

		He so set to work that the book received a structural unity of its own .

		This was the first novel feature of the `` Encyclopaedia , '' because hitherto each volume had been a distinct and separate unit .

		Xow for the first time the book , though of immense variety , was a unit . '

		Hitherto there had been curi - ous inconsistencies and discordant articles intro into different volumes .

		They had this peculiar result from such an intellectual creation which had come into existence during an interval of fourteen or fifteen years .

		There was now an end of that irregularity , and this was a very great achievement .

		For the first time they had a real book , a book with structural unity , not a set of discordant monographs .

		The second characteristic of the new ' '
Encyclo	PERSON	- pa-dia '' was that it kept pace with the forward move - ment and march of progress , and of the spirit of ex - pansion in every domain of knowledge .

		They were : i \ \ are that in the last thirty or forty years every form of knowledge had gone ahead at an extraor - dinary and accelerated rate , not only in the pi nc.es , but in humanistic science history , literature , an < l archaeology .

		In order , therefore , to bring this 1 .

		ncyclopapdia ' ' up to date , it was necessary to revise the old one and even to rewrite it from the luxinning .

		The new book , therefore , was no longer a mere record of the past , bat it was to some extent in anticipation of future discoveries .

		It gave not only an insight into the past , luit it gave a foresight of the future , a spirit of progressiveness , and a display of the enlargement of all the boundaries of knowl
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAI , 415 Abridged Report from the
London	LOCATION	Times ,
Saturday , October 22 , 1910	DATE	The Encyclopaedia Britannica THE NEW EDITION edge .

		Surely , that was a splendid result to achieve , a splendid hope to have opened up ?

		He observed in the list of contributors the names of writers belong - ing to the organized societies representing knowledge , some of the best men we had .

		There was , moreover , no limit of nationality in the selection of writers .

		Some of the 1,500 writers belonged to the Colonies ,
India	LOCATION	, the
United States	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, Hol - land , and even
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Those who had planned the book , therefore , and carried it through to completion , had done so inspired with the progressive spirit of science , having devoted to every branch of knowledge the kind of spirit which many would naturally feel might only belong to the more rapidly advancing forms of physical science .

		He believed that
Cambridge	LOCATION	was a fitting home for the new `` Encyclopaedia . ''

		The
University	ORGANIZATION	was a living organism ; its roots were in the past ; it was a thing of gradual growth ; it looked on to-day and to-morrow ; and its hopes stretched out into the future .

		He expressed the hope that by possessing and controlling such a book as this
Cambridge	LOCATION	might become more than it ever had in the past an inspiring center of world-wide intellec - tual life , and able to carry out not only its national but also its international function .

		-LSB- Cheers . -RSB-

		Mr.
Hugh Chisholm	PERSON	, who was cordially greeted , while warmly thanking Mr.
Butcher	PERSON	for the kind things he had said about him individually , insisted that it was in his representative rather than his per - sonal capacity that this very remarkable compliment was paid him .

		During the last seven or eight years he had been at the head of what had been really , though unrecognized by the world , a sort of college research , because he knew that the sort of book they wanted to bring out could not be made without it .

		An encyclopaedia was , of necessity , in a way , a coop - erative work , but the mere collecting of the work of a number of different distinguished authors did not make a work really cooperative .

		What they had done in the case of this particular edition was to make it really cooperative through the instrumentality of his editorial staff .

		It was universally recognized that the
Ninth Edition	ORGANIZATION	, in spite of the faults that were due to the method of its compilation , was , on its merits , a very fine edition indeed , and he had certainly en - deavoured not to lower the ideals of
Kobertson Smith	ORGANIZATION	and the editors of those days .

		The '' Encyclopaedia Britannica '' was never a mere reference book .

		The various editions of it had been among the actual sources through which progress had been attained , in the exposition of many important branches of knowl - edge , and they had attempted to maintain that tradi - tion in the present edition .

		But while keeping it an authoritative book and a collection of contributions from men who were making progress in all the sub - jects of knowledge , they had made it a very much better reference book than it was , and had given , he thought , a broader interpretation to the general prin - ciple .

		The ' '
Encyclopaedia Britannica	ORGANIZATION	' ' long ago ceased to be purely Scottish , but it still remained in the
Ninth Edition	ORGANIZATION	a predominantly and rather nar - rowly British book .

		It took an entirely British point of view in a great number of subjects .

		The phrase in some of its articles `` in this country , '' meaning
England	LOCATION	, rather represented a certain mental attitude on the part of the contributors .

		The idea which ran through the whole of the new edition was that British interests were best served by giving the reader all the relevant information about any subject , whether it affected foreign countries or the homeland .

		Every single subject in the new edition was treated in what was really the only proper method , the comparative method .

		The book was not written purely for English - men , although his own feeling was that British inter - ests covered the whole world .

		The important thing was to give the English-speaking peoples an insight of what was going on in other countries .

		That was done in a capricious way in the
Ninth Edition	ORGANIZATION	in the legal articles , but they carried out that principle in every sort of article in the new edition .

		He believed that
Cambridge	LOCATION	, by disseminating through all its educa - tional channels the contents of this book , would really be doing a great work to advance popular culture and to give a real impetus to the desire for accurate knowledge .

		The American Ambassador , in reply to the toast of `` The Guests , '' with which his name was associated , said he thought there was a general consensus of opinion among the scholars of the world that the one Encyclopaedia to which they all looked for the most comprehensive , the most eomplete statement of facts relating to any particular subject , was the great `` Encyclopaedia '' with which they had to do that night .

		He thought , also , that there was very general satisfaction among the scholars of the world that this great work of reference was passing now from private control and from private editorship into the hands and under the responsibility of one of the two great Universities which for so many centuries had been the home of national , and perhaps he might venture to say , international scholarship .

		There was a certain satisfaction , too , in feeling that it had passed under the control of
the University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	that one of the two great Universities which was popularly regarded at least as being specially given to scientific accuracy of investigation and to mathematical pre - cision of statement .

		Those were the very qualities for which they looked most of all in a book of rr-fer - -LSB- OA -LSB- 416 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, Abridged Report from the
London	LOCATION	Times ,
Saturday , October 22 , 1910	DATE	The Encyclopaedia Britannica THE NEW EDITION ence .

		A great scholar of
Cambridge	LOCATION	some centuries ago said that he proposed to take all knowledge as his province .

		The boundaries of human knowledge since that time had been enormously expanded , and no great son of
Cambridge	LOCATION	would now venture to say that he took all knowledge as his province .

		He might , perhaps , aspire to know everything about some one thing ; he certainly could only hope after that to come op to what was an American definition of education to know something about everything .

		But the one great work to which they all did go if they wanted to know something about everything was the `` Encyclo - pedia Britannica . ''

		Far be it from him to say that there was not a very large class of subjects on which American encyclopaedias were not better .

		He meant to say subjects in which Americans were specially interested .

		Perhaps to that extent their encyclopaedias were one-sided .

		He did believe , however , that it was the general judgment of the ttcholars and investiga - tors of the world that the one book to which they could go for the most complete , comprehensive , thor - ough and absolutely precise statements of fact upon every subject of human interest was the one for which
the University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	was henceforth to be responsible to the world of letters .

		It was difficult to enhance the authority of the great work the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity had taken in charge .

		But if there was one thing which could be done to enhance its reputation they had done it .

		They had secured the authority to send it out to the world not only under their own imprima - tur , but bearing the great names of the two chief executives who divided between them the government of the he had almost said the undivided and indivisi - ble English-speaking race a race which was united in its history , united in its language , united in its pride , in the past , and united in its hopes and aspira - tions for the future .

		-LSB- Cheers . -RSB-

		The President of the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Sir
Archibald Qeikie	PERSON	-RRB- submitted the toast of `` The
University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	. ' '

		The Chancellor -LRB- Lord Rayleigh -RRB- , in reply , said that what , perhaps , came home to him most in connection with the new edition of the ' ' Encyclopaedia ' ' was the great advantage it would enjoy from the nearly simul - taneous publication of the various volumes .

		Many of them might remember the absurd results which might arise from piecemeal publication as given by , he believed , the Autocrat of the
Breakfast Table	ORGANIZATION	.

		He described the case of a person who , having come across only one of the early volumes , knew everything about the Alps and the
Andes	LOCATION	, but hud never heard of the Himalayas or the
Bocky Mountains	LOCATION	.

		Continuing , the Chancellor said that his connection with the ' ' Ency - clopaedia Britannica '' went back some little time .

		He knew the former editor , Dr.
Robertson Smith	PERSON	, who said that if he wanted an article of a serious char - acter , inspired by wide and accurate knowledge , he generally looked for a
Cambridge	LOCATION	man as the author .

		It was implied , if not directly stated , that if he wanted a more general or ornamental treatment he might turn to the sister
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		This was one of the matters in which , he thought , they might learn something from the sister
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		At
Cambridge	LOCATION	they needed and were proud of their specialists , but even a specialist was none the worse for having com - mand of language and grace of style .

		Some Comments 4 4 T ^ HIS rich , composite history of English literature is a real service to English scholarship .

		It presents us wtth the first adequate treatment of many neglected parts of our literary history , and it throws new light on many old themes ... The editors deserve all thanks , and the critic who feels inclined to quarrel with this point or that in their methods or conclusions will be humilated and silenced when he remembers that this is the first attempt by a body of scholars to tell the story of our literature on a scale worthy of its greatness . ''

		The
Saturday	DATE	Review . ''

		A clear and convincing estimate , and one in which everything that is of outstanding significance is skillfully disentangled from the vast mass of subsidiary clues to interpretation .

		It seems to us that this is the supreme merit of the volume , the discrimination and judgment with which it brings to a focus the gradual evolution of a language and the wonderful outburst of creative achievement in letters under the Tudors . ''

		The great Russian moralist who died ten days ago reached the venerable age of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and was as distinctly as Goethe the most command - ing figure in the whole world of contemporary letters .

		With
Tolstoy the last of the nineteenth century	DATE	giants has departed , although the twen - tieth century has run but a single decade of its course .

		Swift 's epitaph might serve for him , for he has found rest ubi sceva indignatio ulte - rius cor lacerare nequit ; his torn and indig - nant spirit could no longer bear to live among a people fast lapsing into barbarism , a people that has wellnigh forfeited all claim to be reckoned among the civilized communities .

		Pathos un - utterable and spiritual tragedy are mingled in the story of those closing days in which he went forth into the solitudes to draw his final breath .

		Like
Lear	PERSON	, he was driven out into the storm , and wandered distracted over the heath .

		He would not have relished the comparison , because he was blind to the splendor of that fictive counterpart of his own perplexed soul , but those 446 THE DIAL -LSB- Deo .

		1 , who were gathered about him at the end might well have murmured , u Vex not his ghost ! ''

		as he passed into the valley of the shadow .

		In the happenings of recent years in
Russia	LOCATION	, its stifling of every aspiration toward freedom , its bloody orgies of administrative revenge , its foul perfidy revealed in the rape of
Finland	LOCATION	, there may be found ample cause for the gloom that enfolded
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's soul in the evil days upon which he had fallen ; yet could he have realized to the full his world-wide influence for good , some light might have found its way into his darkness .

		For he was , despite the seeming moral inertia of his environment , the most effective preacher of his time ; his voice stirred the deeps of many waters that appeared stag - nant , and its vibrations thrilled responsive hearts the world over .

		It was not by argument that he prevailed , but by direct appeal to the saving instinctive elements of the human con - sciousness .

		His reasoning was often childish , but his moral passion was overwhelming in its force .

		Thus , one need not accept the Tol - stoyan conclusions to be a Tolstoy an in spirit , and those who upon purely intellectual grounds must maintain the attitude of antagonism may without shame pay the tribute of reverence to his whole-souled sincerity .

		His essential service was to persuade men to go straight to the heart .

		of the fundamental problems of life , to strip them of their wrappings of custom and preju - dice and tradition , and to solve them in the terms of an all-embracing human sympathy .

		The key to all these problems ,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	held , was to be found in the gospels .

		He believed that Christianity the literal teaching of its Founder was workable .

		He saw clearly enough that it had not worked hitherto , and that the poet 's despairing cry was only too well justified by the historical record . ''

		The nineteenth wave of the ages rolls Now deathward since thy death and birth .

		Hast tliou fed full men 's starved - out souls ?

		Hast thou brought freedom upon earth ?

		Or are there less oppressions done In this wild world under the sun ? ''

		One may make a comparison between literal Christian teaching and the literal text of the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	; just as the latter has been made into a working instrument by a long line of decisions of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, so the former has been given practical expression as a guide of conduct by the glosses of ecclesiastical tribunals , has been fashioned into an effective system by the opportunism of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	which stands as its visible and offi - cial embodiment .

		Now just as there are those who claim that < > ur political salvation lies in a recurrence to the fundamental principles of civil liberty as set forth in tlu - Constitution and the Declaration , so there are those who believe that in the New Testament , strictly interpreted , may be found a panacea for all the ills of modern society .

		Tolstoy was of those who shared this belief , and it never found a more appealing and eloquent champion .

		Was his light a marsh-fire or a beacon ?

		We may do no more than put the question .

		The subject is immensely complex and infinitely debatable .

		He , at least , had no doubts , and his faith has powerfully influenced many wavering souls .

		The voice is stilled , but the record remains .

		It is a record assailable by logic at many points .

		It is weakened by inconsistency and paradox , by touches of mysticism and fanaticism , by a repudiation of many of the real conquests of civilization , and by an almost incredible lack of the historical sense .

		Its method is that of didacticism rather than of art , forgetful of the eternal truth : '' Tout passe .

		L'art robuste Seul a F 4terniU $ . ''

		But it is all aflame with the passion of the prophet , and its accents have a resonance that the echoes will prolong .

		Yet we can not help feeling that his power would have been more lasting , and his influence exerted in ways subtler but ultimately more effective , had he not , mid - way in his career , allowed the exhorter in him to get the better of the artist , yielding to the emotional stress .

		of his overwrought soul .

		Des - pite the temptation to speak only words of praise in this hour when the world mourns the loss of one of its greatest and best , we are yet con - strained to repeat our words of twelve years ago , written upon the occasion of his seventieth birthday . ''

		When his living personality shall have passed from the view of men , when his tracts and his parables and his religious polemics shall have taken their place in the intellectual lumber-room which contains the vagaries of great souls gone astray , when his autobiographical writings shall be valued only as curious revelations of a mind out of joint , he will be remembered and admired and extolled as the author of ' War and Peace , ' that epic of the Russian people in the most tragic hour of its con - sciousness ; of '
Anna Kare'uiua	PERSON	, ' that sincere and poig - nant portrayal of a group of intensely limn m souls ; by the slighter and earlier sketches of the Crimean War and the Cossacks and the
Caucasus	LOCATION	that exhibit in some respects a finer an than the two colossal productions by which he is best known ... Men will smile at the color-blindness of his esthetic writings , and at the pathe - tic lack of the historic sense so characteristic of his social and religious philosophy , l > iit they will luivcmily respect and wonder for his achievements during the years before he set about the hopeless task of reforming the world .

		THE DIAL 447 THE LANDSCAPE PAINTER IN LIFE AND LITERATURE .

		If pure happiness can fall to man it must surely be the lot of the
Landscape Painter	ORGANIZATION	.

		He realizes
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's ideal , and enjoys delight with liberty .

		He is the real Aladdin , with the Lamp in his color - box .

		This makes him master of the world .

		From it he can evoke forests and streams , palaces with rich domains , cottages where tranquility abides .

		Only perhaps his genie does not always rise to his bidding with huge silver salvers laden with dishes or smok - ing with rich viands .

		But perish such low , material gratifications !

		Even if house rent is lacking he is so free of nature that he ought to be able to lodge in a tree , like the French poet , '' third branch to the right . ''

		The greatest of men have been tramps ,
Homer	LOCATION	,
Socrates	LOCATION	,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Cervantes	PERSON	, the founders of religious orders , not to speak of more sacred names still .

		Some of these their fellow-beings have imprisoned or hanged in order , I suppose , to give them gome visible means of support .

		The Landscape Painter 's business is to tramp , to explore nature , to be blown about by breezes on the heights , to burrow into the valleys , to eat his noonday bite by curling brooks , to bivouac if need be on bedded leaves , to be of kin to beasts and birds and butterflies , to say to the ass , like St.
Francis	PERSON	, '' My Brother '' ; and when he has won the wise and healthy secrets of these things to bring them back to man in his crowded city dens as restoratives and inspirations .

		What a life is his !

		Perhaps , like the lower order of tramps ,
Winter	DATE	may drive him into city quarters ; but when
Spring	ORGANIZATION	breathes its first enchantment over the land he is out again where real existence is possible .

		He goes be - fore the Gypsies and takes the winds of
March	DATE	with his beauty , if he has any .

		He hunts out the likeliest and loveliest localities , and is the real advance guard of the great army of
summer	DATE	boarders which follows where he leads .

		He is always Dr. Syntax in search of the picturesque .

		Perhaps nearly every attractive Summer resort in this country has been first discovered and ex - ploited by artists .

		The quaint and natural in human life appeal to him as much as landscape splendors , and he is the real leader of revolt against the artificial and sybaritic existence of the rich .

		It is the artist who discovers those delicious villages where life is lived as in a world remote or a forgotten century ; or those individual inns which stand out in the memory like red letters in a missal .

		He is usually so simple in his tastes that he melts into this life as water does in water .

		The man of letters counter - feits all these tastes and traits , and because words are more portable and fly about the world easier than pictures he gets the credit for these returns to nature , but the artist is the man .

		However , business is business .

		The Land - scape Painter is not out primarily for his health , or to gratify his instincts for the quaint , the charming , or the unexpected .

		He is bent on the conquest of the outer world .

		It is for him to over-run nature as
Alexander	PERSON	or
Napoleon	PERSON	did the empires of man , and to put the stamp of his mind on the scenes he recreates .

		Some - times he makes a march to
Moscow	LOCATION	, but oftener he conquers and gives almost as much as he receives .

		For while he can not compete with nature in details , while he can not begin with his pigments to rival the infinite delicacies or splendors of form and color in the actual world , he can group and arrange these things better , or at least more significantly , than Na - ture .

		Nature , like
Cromwell	PERSON	, is careless of the warts ; but the artist can eliminate , thrust back , bring forward , soften or make vivid any part of the scenes he paints , and can transform the most commonplace of these into something which resembles the portals of Fairyland .

		Sermons , in stones , books in the running brooks , are also in his line , and he can throw over Nature what - ever he possesses himself of gaiety or melan - choly , he can add to it a tragic grandeur , and cast upon it the reflection of human fate .

		To struggle with the problems of light and shade , of projection and distance ; to deal with the sky as a great drop-curtain which rises and falls on the scenes of the world ; to realize the clouds which build up their architecture of domes and towers , throwing shadows upon each other or upon the earth beneath as they sweep over it ; to handle some frond of foliage where * half the leaves are like little mirrors reflecting the light of the sun and the other half are intricately confused in their own forms by the shadow of their neighbors ; to paint the forest depths where rays of light are like visitation of angels and gild what they touch with floating gold ; to reproduce that visionary light which at sunrise or sunset bridges the sky in an instant , and falling at one 's feet turns the most ordinary objects to appurtenances of the Age of Gold ; to re-create the mystery of twilight when dusk gathers in the trees and night creeps close to earth 's bosom , while above , as day departs , the moon 's bowl fills , the moon 's bowl glows , and with it all the starry chalices ; to reveal 448 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, the - lani'ir < > f tin - tinnm 's ton-lies as they MIOVC below , en tangled in boughs and bushes or march - ing in broad procession along avenues embanked in shade ; to give permanency to
Spring	ORGANIZATION	's half nude graces , or
Summer	DATE	's rich pomp , or Au - tumn 's wistful but glorious fading , or
Winter	DATE	's sculpturesque outlines , these are the labors and the delights of the
Landscape Painter	ORGANIZATION	.

		And when he returns to his city studio , room so unlike all others , a chamber by night , a working place by day , strewn with implements of his craft , and with cooking conveniences in a corner , when he returns here what sheaves he brings with him , what rich spoils of con - quest !

		That his pictures are unsalable is of little import .

		A man can not have everything .

		He can not get heaven and have rosewood fur - niture and velvet carpets at the same time .

		He may not even have accumulated a wife and children , but he has espoused the day and begotten the stars .

		Literature has been strangely neglectful of the
Landscape Painter	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has an affection for huffing heroes and people of action , captains and men-at-arms .

		When it turns to the arts at all for characters it takes up with its own kind .

		And it must be admitted that literary men are better fun than their gentler brothers of the brush , that their wits are brighter , their lives more interesting , that they deal more in love affairs , have more wives , and so become generally dear and delightful .

		Even literature incarnate in
George Sand	PERSON	, who devastated all the other arts and sciences by her conquests , disdained having an affair with a landscape painter .

		I can recall no great literary creation of this profession .

		Poets , novelists , actors , figure and flourish in fiction .

		Thackeray even gives us that great artist of sauces ,
M. Alcide de Mirobolant	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the painter is forgotten .

		The dramatists of course have no use for him .

		I think the only occasion on which he appears in person in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is the brief satirical glimpse of the portrait painter in `` Timon of
Athens	LOCATION	. ''

		Molidre , who painted and satirized all other kinds of men , left the artist out though he must have known the Court painters of Louis XIV .

		Goethe , too , although he struggled hard to become an artist himself , did not devote any creative effort to bodying forth one of the craft .

		He drew poets , actors , even landscape gardeners , but the man of the brush he ignored .

		The epic and narrative poets also ignore him .

		Antiquity simply does not know that he exists .

		Dante devotes two lines to
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	and Cimalme .

		Milton ,
Dryden	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	.

		Keats ,
Hugo	PERSON	, what have any of them done for the painter ?


Tennyson	PERSON	has his Lord of Bur - leigh , with the slighting '' He was but a Land - scape Painter . '

		Browning alone gives us some adequate sketches of artists , of which the one depicting the tortured soul of
Andrea del Sarto	PERSON	is the greatest .

		The novelists are a little better .


Rousseau	PERSON	's
St. Prieux	LOCATION	was an artist .

		That tame specimen of the genus homo ,
Waverley	LOCATION	, sketched ; as did Colonel
Mannering	PERSON	.

		The hero of `` St.
Ronan	PERSON	's Well '' has a false glamor thrown over him by the imputation that he is an illustrious artist .


Charles Reade	PERSON	's Triplet , being capable of all , might probably have painted landscapes , hut there is no record that he did .

		There is no artist , I think , in
Jane Austen	PERSON	s books .


Charlotte Bronte	ORGANIZATION	makes
Jane Eyre	PERSON	a landscapist , and a wonderful one if the description of tin - sketches she shows
Rochester	LOCATION	is exact .

		Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	starts one of her heroes as a landscape painter , but she soon involves him in that web of fine folk and important affaii-s which she delights to weave and which has no possible human interest .

		Thackeray , half artist him - self , did little to bring the painter into the realm of literature , though
Clive Newcome	PERSON	dot s make a valiant attempt at art ; and
Dickens	PERSON	did less , though
Alfred Jingle	ORGANIZATION	could paint .

		Truly , printer 's ink has not been wasted on the artist .

		The best creation of the kind I can think of in literature is the Scotch hutdscapist in
William Black	LOCATION	's ''
Shandon Bells	PERSON	. ''

		He is worth more than any figure in ''
Trilby	PERSON	, ' though the latter is doubtless the most important piece of liter - ature which is all about artists .

		Its instant acceptance showed that the world was hungry for knowledge of the habits and manners of these little-known animals .

		History and biography of course come to the rescue of the artists , though even here they get much less than their just proportion of attention .


Vasari	PERSON	's u Lives '' are comparatively full and fairly attractive , but we get little about the jolly , rollicking Dutch artists , and only dry scraps in regard to the French and Spanish men .

		There are no art biographies , I believe , that can com - pare in affectionate labor and rich detail with a score of literary memoirs .

		Something has been made up to the artists by the great critics .

		Fronton tin .

		Rusk in ,
Meier	PERSON	-
Graefe	LOCATION	, and others have given to the works of the great painters a profound analysis and splendid praise .


Kuskin	PERSON	is rather under a cloud with the artists at present , though they ought to sacrifice a hecatomb to him every year .

		He
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 449 opened the eyes of the great mass of English readers , taught them that the Earth was some - thing more than a place to plant potatoes in , and that the chamber of the air served other uses than that of respiration .

		And he made the art which reported these other purposes of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	respectable and popular .

		His criticism erred in a hundred particulars .

		He was half wrong in his central principle that great art is the praise of God , it is just as often the praise of the Devil , or at least an uncriticizing exhibition of him .

		He was totally wrong in his insistence on actual truth in painting , in demanding that things be painted as they are rather than as they seem .

		He was largely wrong in both his apotheosis of
Turner	PERSON	and his depre - ciation of
Whistler	LOCATION	.

		But when all is said and done , there is a great balance of right thinking and teaching to his credit .

		Literature and painting are the most closely allied of the arts .

		The domain of literature is immeasurably the wider , that of painting the more definitely realized .

		The trouble with paint - ing is this : it is not and can not be known ex - cept to a few .

		Black and white or colored repro - ductions do something to spread a knowledge of it , but these do not give the real vision of the artist ; whereas a book repeats exactly to the reader what the writer created .

		It is perhaps this comparative secrecy and seclusion of the artist 's work that accounts for his little promi - nence either in the real world or the literary report of it .

		~
CHARLES LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		TOLSTOY 'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE WOMAN PROBLEM .

		`` That remarkable piece of stupidity which is called the rights of women , '' is the great Russian iconoclast 's summary of the modern woman 's insist - ent demand for the right of self-expression in all fields of endeavor .

		That remarkable revolt against tradition and established ethical and moral laws , the book that epitomizes his revolutionary tenets , '' What to Do , '' deals uncompromisingly with the woman problem .

		From the point of view of the most Russian of all the Russians a man who has not been out of his own country in fifty years
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	shows a keen appreciation of woman 's status in the world .

		He is guided chiefly by the eternal verities .

		He exalts motherhood , and maintains that woman can be dominant only through her power to effect the salvation of man .

		He says : `` As stated in the
Bible	LOCATION	, a law was given to the man and the woman .

		to the man , the law of labor ; to the woman , the law of bearing children .

		Although we , with our science , avons chang & tout
$ a	MONEY	, the law for the man , as for the woman , remains unalterable . ''

		Why should this credo , the outcome of his demand that we base all our actions on the most primitive interpretation of the law of brotherly love , seem reactionary ?

		In trying to lift what he considers the burden of twenty centuries of so-called civili - zation and progress from the shoulders of suffering humanity ,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	sees only one path to right living : a return to primitive social conditions .

		But he re - conciles us to his stern demands by pointing out the wide , almost unlimited , scope of woman 's work and influence : `` Women form public opinion , and women are especially powerful in our day . ''

		These two expressions would seem to give the antipodal points in his attitude toward woman 's emancipation .

		From both points of view , he places woman on an exalted plane .

		And yet we are constrained to voice some doubts .

		Will a return to the patriarchal condi - tions which he lauds as conducive to greater human happiness produce a loftier ideal of the marital union ?

		Does a realization of his ideal regarding woman 's sphere and influence mean a denial of the ultra-modern woman ` sdemands in their highest sense ?

		Countess Tolstoy 's reference to her own position is singularly suggestive . '

		When I married Count Tolstoy , I had modest ideas : that is , I was willing to be second ; he made me advance to first place .

		Since then he has desired to make me third .

		Eh bien non !

		I shall hold to second . ''

		In his own life ,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	has been true to his championship of the old-time ideal of woman 's position in the conjugal relation .

		He and his wife have always enjoyed the higher sense of companioni-hip that is the result of perfect harmony and broad intellectual sym - pathy and understanding .

		The
Countess Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	is a woman of high intellectual attainments .

		She has never favored the aggressive measnres of her modern sisters , probably because she finds that she has all the rights she can do justice to .

		Until her daughters were old enough to assume that duty , she was her husband 's amanuensis ; ai.d she has always been the guardian angel who has protected him from the evil that might result in some cases from the extreme application of his theories . ''

		In her conduct and bearing toward her husband and his literary productions , '' says her brother , Mr.
Behrs	PERSON	, '' she always reminds me of a religious worshipper and zealous guardian of some sacred fount . ''

		Tolstoy has always been deeply convinced of the mission of women as teachers .

		It is to be deplored that his own schools , in which his wife and daughters supervised the splendid work done , could not stand against Russian immutability .

		His aim to reform men , not methods , had some chance of realization in his own and his family 's attempts to train young minds in the way they should go .

		His ideal of human fellowship and service could hardly be more practically applied than in his repeated admonitions to mothers as the pillars of the world 's moral found - ation .

		He censures the modern tendency toward over - indulgence , with its consequent weakening effect ; and he fears for the future of the race when he 460 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, warns us against '' bolstering up this delusive life of ours with the aid of our science and art . ''

		Wuinan , the altruistic half of humanity , should know no higher mission than to lead toward the realization of man 's highest endeavors .

		It is liard to reconcile this conception of woman 's rights with her demands , in this dynamic age .

		We must not forget that Tola toy repudiates all force , all oaths of allegiance , and every social institution .

		Woman 's aggressive measures for the attainment of what she deems her rights would come under his ban as being coercive .

		Militant suffrage he thinks abominable .

		How would a man of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's con - victions meet the argument of the eminent French - woman of revolutionary fame , who demanded equal suffrage on the plea that a woman should have the right to mount the platform as long as she is con - ceded the right to mount the guillotine ?

		According to
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, no human being is free so long as anyone has the right to sanction or forbid that person 's actions by threatening violence .

		Those of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's heroines who strike the right balance between head and heart in dealing with the problems of life are often a negative embodiment of his ideal woman .

		He places the blame for many wrecked lives on the prevailing false standards of social purity and conjugal honor .

		The ''
Kreutzer	PERSON	Sonata '' has evoked the anathemas of many who could not sanction its moral perversities , and its author has been accused of having brought about a most dangerous unsettling of our moral and ethical codes .

		So far as the book 's influence on immature minds is concerned , its jarring exaggerations and repulsive details reveal little more to them than abnormalities of the untamed Slav temperament .

		There are brutal biological facts and ugly truths that
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	tells unflinchingly , and they see only these from their myopic viewpoint But the motive of the book is not a reversion of the moral code ; it is a much-needed arraignment of the causes that are responsible for much of the world 's conjugal misery .

		Translated into action , the ''
Kreutzer	PERSON	Sonata '' would bring about social chaos .

		As a preachment from one of those fanatics of to-day who become the pro- phets of to-morrow , it must be regarded as holding the germ of a theory that leads in the right direction .


George Meredith	PERSON	, that master interpreter of `` the eternal feminine , '' called
Anna Karenina	PERSON	the grandest woman in the whole range of fiction .

		Let us see how the heroine in this tragedy of a sinful love reflects what her creator demands as a woman 's inalienable right , `` not the support of social con - ventions but the laws of her own being , '' in the words of the most modern champion of her sex ,
Ellen Key	PERSON	.

		Anna 's character reflects what the author has gained in sympathy and understanding , as does each of the women in his later works .

		Shortly after the publication of ''
Anna Karenina	PERSON	, '' Tolstoy astonished the world by his remarkable change of attitude toward the masterpieces that had raised him to the pinnacle of success .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A FORGOTTEN AMERICAN POET is pleasantly re - called in one of the chapters of the just-published
Stedman	PERSON	`` autobiographic biography . ''

		When Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	, the publifher , made a visit to this country about ten years ago , be was filled with enthusiasm for a new poet , Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	, to wit , whose early works he had then recently produced .

		Calling one day upon
Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	, he enlarged upon the subject , and wished particularly to note the originality of the themes chosen by Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	.

		There was the tale of Paolo and
Francesca	PERSON	, he said , that no other modern had thought of making into a tragedy , whereupon Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	turned to his shelves and took down the familiar -LRB- to American readers -RRB- work of
George H. Boker	PERSON	.

		This was a setback , but Mr.
Lane	PERSON	rallied , and said that at least no other poet had hit upon such a subject as '' Christ in Hades . ''

		Where - upon Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	again turned to his shelves , and took down a volume of poetry with that identical title .

		It was not easy to catch Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	napping upon a matter of the history of American poetry .

		The poem in question was the work of
William Wilber	PERSON	- force Lord , who was born in
1819	DATE	, and who died not long ago when wellnigh a nonogenarian .

		This generation has completely forgotten him , but in his time he attracted marked attention , earning the praise of
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and incurring the censure of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	.

		He published three volumes between
1845	DATE	and
1856	DATE	.

		In the new
Stedman	PERSON	biography occurs the follow - ing passage , dated
1850	DATE	, when the writer was a boy of sixteen . ''

		Mr.
Lord	PERSON	went over to
N. York	ORGANIZATION	with me the morning you sailed .

		I admire him , from the bottom of my heart .

		I have , with great diffi - culty -LRB- they are so little known -RRB- procured a copy of his poems , and am lost in ecstasy and wonder at the sublimity of his '
Niagara	PERSON	' the calm and holy and grand philosophy of his ' Worship , ' and the majesty and elegance of his ' Ode to
England	LOCATION	' ... What an intellect he has !

		Will this be my fate to be forgotten and unknown ? ''

		It is safe to say that Lord has not become better known during the sixty years that have elapsed since he received this tribute of boyish admiration .

		But Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	was loyal to the last , holding Lord to have been the most Miltonic of American poets , and only a year before his death expressed this opinion in a conversation with the present writer , adding that one of the things he most hoped to find time and strength to do was to prepare a critical essay upon Lord 's work .

		The essay , we fear , had to be left unwritten , but its subject remains , and possibly some one else may become minded to undertake the task which was thus left unperformed .

		A MASTER OF SUBTLE EFFECTS , both as painter and as writer ,
John La Farge	PERSON	, who died recently at the ripe age of seventy-five , will long be remem - bered for his passionate devotion to the mistress -LRB- Art -RRB- whom he so nobly served , for his insatiate thirst after ever new knowledge , his reverence for all that is venerable and sacred in the past , and his quick detection and dexterous exposure of much that is neither venerable nor sacred in the present .

		In literature he is known for his '' Artist 's Letters from
Japan	LOCATION	, '' his ' Artist and Writer : Lectures on Art , '' and those papers on the old masters and the Barbizon School of painters that have lately been collected in two volumes .

		A posthumous issue of tho * e autobiographical or retrospective notes that he is thought to have left behind him in some drawer or pigeon-hole of his de > k , is to be hoped for .

		French by descent and American by birth , he presented in his person a rare combination of notable qualities .

		His old friend and co-eval , Mr.
Elihu Vedder	PERSON	, writes admiringly of him in ' The Digressions of V. '' '' La Farge was inspiring , '' he declares ; '' I have never met anyone more so . ''

		And further : '' This quality of subtlety is shown in those never-to-be - forgotten flowers , particularly in that damp mass of violets in a shallow dish on a window-sill , where the outside air faintly stirring the lace curtains seems to waft the odour towards you .

		This quality , pecu - liarly his own , affects me in his writings , so that as a writer I was at one time inclined to find fault with him for a certain elaborate obscurity in his style , which I now see arises from his striving to express shades of thought so delicate that they seem to render words almost useless . ''

		THE DEDICATION OF THE HAY MEMORIAL Ll - BRARY , that stately white marble building that now contributes so effectively to the beauty and the dig - nity of the hill on which
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	stands , and that forms so fitting a monument to the mem - ory of one who was by temperament and choice more warmly devoted to letters than to affairs of state , took place on the llth of
November	DATE	, as had been planned .

		Tribute to the departed statesman was paid in eloquent terms by Senator Root , his fellow cabinet-member , while an equally eulogistic word concerning the man of letters , the poet of so fair early promise , the biographer of so noteworthy later achievement , was spoken by President Emeritus
Angell	PERSON	of
Michigan University	ORGANIZATION	, his old time teacher at
Brown	PERSON	and afterward his personal friend and 452 THE DIAL -LSB- Deo .

		1 , kindly adviser .

		`` Those of an who knew him best , '' said Dr.
Angell	PERSON	, `` looked for a distinctly literary career for him .

		We experienced a serious disap - pointment when we saw that events were turning him in a diffe rent direction . ''

		And from Mr.
Root	PERSON	's speech this passage is noteworthy : '' It would be difficult to conceive of a sharper contrast than between the character of Mr.
Hay	PERSON	and the confident , thick-skinned , self-assertive , pushing , hustling char - acter ordinarily associated with success in the practical affairs of this hurly-burly world . ''

		The memorial building is a fine example of library architecture , dignified without and admirably adapt - ed to its uses within .

		It stands easily first among college and university library buildings in
New England	LOCATION	.

		... THIS YEAR 'S WI.VNKK OK THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR LITKK.VTUKK .


Herr Paul Heyse	PERSON	, is one of those well - loved authors of our early reading -LRB- if we be not too old , or too young -RRB- whom we are a little surprised , on hearing him mentioned now , to find still alive and active .

		It was as long ago as
1873	DATE	that his Kinder der Welt '' appeared ; and even then his fame as poet , playwright , and novelet-writer , was secure .

		He was born in
Berlin	LOCATION	on the
15th of March , 1830	DATE	, and the plaudits over his achievement of his eightieth birthday had hardly subsided when there came the report of this crowning honor of his long literary lifc .

		Thirty and more volumes are required to contain his collected works , and bis fellow - countrymen 's estimate of their quality is evident from the tone of admiration and veneration in which he and his writings are mentioned throughout Ger - many .

		Whatever his unquestioned merits in other and more important fields of literature , his facility and artistry in the short novel , or long short-story , have won him a wide reading and an enviable fame .

		... AN ANNUAL REMINDER OF THE SWIFT LAPSE OF TIME comes to us this month in the Almanac for the new year HO close at hand .

		Still foremost among our favorites in the literature of this description stands `` The Old Farmer 's Almanac '' founded by
Robert B. Thomas	PERSON	, of honored memory , in
1793	DATE	.

		The issue for
1911	DATE	is , consequently , the one hun - dred and nineteenth consecutive number of this venerable publication .

		Cautious and conservative in its weather forecasts , especially for the last few months of the year , it al-to prints a number of safe and useful maxims and sage reflections side by side with the monthly calendar . ''

		Uncle
Zekiel	PERSON	says that notwithstanding all the modern time-saving contrivances , there do n't seem to be so much time left as there used to be . '' ''

		A good many farmers , and a good many other men , too , for that matter , would know a lot if they had not forgotten so many things . ''

		An excellent opening suggestion on the
January	DATE	page is this : '' Keep a notebook and a scraphook , or a combination of both . ''

		Those who like the homely , the practical , and the aphoristic , should order their days by `` The Old Farmer 's Almanac . ''

		SUPERIORITY OF AN '' UNCUT '' COPY of a book to a copy that hat * been shaved and -LCB- tared to the < jni < - k l > y a m-n-il-s Kinder was never better illustrated -LRB- in a negative way -RRB- than by a curious instance that has just come to our notice .

		At a recent Merwin-Clayton sale of books , in
New York	LOCATION	, a copy of the
1820	DATE	edition of
Henry Brooke	PERSON	's '' Fool of Quality , '' '' judiciously revised and edited by the Rev. .


John Wesley	PERSON	, '' was among the items sold .

		But it was not a tall , uncut copy , as proved both by its appearance and by an indignant note written in it by a former owner .

		`` The marginal notes in this book , '' writes the aggrieved anonymous possessor of the volume , `` were inserted by
Samuel Taylor Coleridge	PERSON	, to whom I lent it when I was residing at
Highgate	LOCATION	.

		The binder threw them away two fly - leaves filled with his -LRB-
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- comments , and shaved off the edges of the volume so close that it is often impossible to ascertain the purport of the original note .

		It may be a warning to others of the craft that the misguided delinquent died of cholera shortly after being paid his bill for spoiling this hook .

		I find his was the solitary instance of death by that disease in
Highgate	LOCATION	. ''

		This will ntrike a responsive chord in the breast of those who have had cause for similar complaint .

		THE CLASSIFICATION OF LIBRARY WORKERS develops as a natural and indeed almost inevitable process in a profession that concerns itself so unceasingly and -LRB- with the constant enlargement of the domain of literature -RRB- so increasingly with classification in all its major and minor divisions , and with the attaching of appropriate and suffi - ciently conspicuous labels to the objects classified .

		The
ST. Louis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	has just elaborated and applied a scheme of classification by which the entire staff is first divided into three classes , `` those in regular grades , those in special grades , and those in ungraded occupations . ''

		The head librarian seems to form a class by himself , and under him are ranged the three above-named classes , subdivided into sections A , B , C , D. K , for the regu - lar grades , and into sections -LRB- 1 -RRB- , -LRB- 2 -RRB- , -LRB- 3 -RRB- , for the special , while the ungraded persons , having neither letters nor numbers -LRB- but not therefore necessarily illiterate or innumerable -RRB- bring up the rear with broom and coal-scuttle and such-like insignia of office .

		The qualifications requisite for each of these classes and sub-classes , and the formalities to be complied with in order to pass from a lower to a higher grade , are briefly explained in a type-written bulletin issued by the Library .

		A NEWSPAPER OF NEWSPAPERS , like a '' Review of Reviews '' or a '' Literary Digest , '' would seem to have its place in the scheme of things journalistic .

		The busy man 's daily newspaper , after the model of the busy man 's monthly or weekly review , is a desideratum long felt by many impatient patrons of the increasingly voluminous sheets that chronicle the diurnal happenings of the world along with a
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 453 quantity of things that have not happened .

		Begin - ning about the first of this month , Mr.
Ernest F. Birmingham	PERSON	, editor and publisher of `` The Fourth Estate , '' proposes to issue a reasonably small after - noon journal , sifting and condensing the news of the world , skimming the cream of current editorial opinion , and '' expanding the news of art , literature , music , the drama in its higher phases , education , religion , civic and economic questions , and the like , to an extent greater than is possible in any existing daily publication . ''

		Excellent paper and presswork and superior illustrations are promised .

		If all this wealth of laudable intention is realized , and also the exalted purpose is attained '' so to conduct the paper that everything that appears in its columns will be considered as authoritative and practically the last word on the subject , '' then '' The News - Letter , '' as the hopeful venture is to be named , will indeed supply a real want and make for the raising of the standard of journalism .

		AN INSTANCE OF LITERARY MASQUERADING that is reported to have deceived even the experienced cataloguers at the British Museum is rather note - worthy .

		Many readers were doubtless somewhat puzzled a few years ago by the oriental manner and appearance of Mr.
F. W. Bain	PERSON	's book of haunting fairy-tales entitled '' A Digit of the Moon . ''

		The author 's mystifying hint of a Sanskrit origin to these stories and his perfect command of the oriental style of narrative he being a scholar thoroughly versed in East Indian lore and legend combined to deceive even the wary ; and so his book was classed with oriental literature by the Museum authorities , who also shelved in the same department its successors , '' A Heifer of the Dawn , '' `` A Draught of the Blue , '' '' In the Great God 's Hair , '' '' An Essence of the Dusk , '' and others .

		The offering of translated work as original is a common enough practice , but the disclaiming of originality for one 's own inspired ideas is not so common though a few conspicuous instances readily come to mind .

		At any rate , Mr.
Bain	PERSON	's modesty seems now to have been unveiled , and the
British Museum	ORGANIZATION	has made haste to re - classify the product of his gifted pen .

		* PUNGENT UTTERANCES FROM BALZAC have been quoted in abundance from his commonplace books , but the choicest collection of these sayings -LRB- or writings , rather -RRB- is found in the unpublished but soon-to-be-published notebook which the novelist used to call `` the great park of my ideas . ''

		M.
Jacques Cre	ORGANIZATION	` pet is the editor and annotator of the volume , which will bear the title , '' Fences , Sujets , Fragmens , '' and from which a few choice passages have recently found their way into print .

		For ex - ample : '' There are authors who are not viviparous '' which no one will dispute .

		`` Space , darkness , terror three great sources of poetry . ''

		`` To doubt everything and to doubt nothing in both cases one betrays the same defect . '' ''

		The finest revenge is the scorn of revenge . ''

		`` Genius has big ears on the inside . ''

		`` Virtue 's sentinel is work '' the complement to
Isaac Watts	PERSON	's well-known lines about Satan and mischief and idle hands .

		`` Everyone who thinks strongly raises a scandal . '' ''

		Excessive civilization is close to barbarism , as steel is close to rusting .

		A moment 's forgetfulness , and the thing happens . ''

		On the whole , there seems to have been rather more of bitterness than of sweetness , of doubt than of faith , of pensive melancholy than of radiant joy .

		in
Balzac	LOCATION	's musings .

		HOMER 'S UNDYING CHARM for the appreciative is attested by the appearance , every few years , of a new translation of his '' Iliad '' or '' Odyssey , '' or of both .

		The number of extant renderings in all modern tongues must be innumerable .

		Merely in the catalogue of the libraries of the late
William Everett	PERSON	, and of his father ,
Edward Everett	PERSON	, which are to be sold this month , one meets with nearly a score of different versions of Homer .

		And Mr.
Prentice Cummings	PERSON	of
Brookline	LOCATION	, busy lawyer and street railway president though he is , has found or made time to add another to the endless list , his being an achievement in hexameters that seems deserving of a cordial reception .

		As long as history shall be re-written for each new generation and the passion of the human heart re-sung , so long will the charm of
Helen	PERSON	, the valor of Achilles , and the wanderings of
Ulysses	LOCATION	, be over and over again re-told from the epics of Homer .

		...
JOHN MORLEY	PERSON	THE WRITER AND
JOHN MORLEY	PERSON	THE STATESMAN are almost two different persons .

		His recent reported resignation of public office has elicited press comment on his administration of Indian affairs , and it is even claimed that his chief title to fame rests on what he has accomplished in
British India	LOCATION	.

		But we who have always associated his name with those admirable woiks on Diderot and
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	and
Rousseau	PERSON	, on
Burke	PERSON	and
Walpole	LOCATION	and
Cobden	PERSON	, with the early and highly successful editorship of '' The Fortnightly Review , '' as also with the editorship of the first two-score numbers of the `` English Men of Letters '' f-eries , and later with the monumental life of
Gladstone	LOCATION	, we know better .

		Not as
Lord Morley	PERSON	, Secretary of State for
India	LOCATION	, but as
John Morley	PERSON	, scholar and author in the fields of history and literature , will he be longest and most favorably remembered .

		... THE SEASON 'S ABUNDANCE OF BIOGRAPHIES OF PUBLIC MEN , especially of men in political life , is something unprecedented .

		We have , for example , the first volume of Mr.
Monypenny	PERSON	's four-volume work on
Disraeli	ORGANIZATION	, based largely on those f-eventy volumes of the statesman 's papers that Lord
Rowton	PERSON	preserved so long and so faithfully .

		Then there are lives of
John Bright	ORGANIZATION	and
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	and
John Redmond	PERSON	, and autobiographical reminiscences by Mr.
William O'Brien	PERSON	, while in this country the publishers are offering us the late Senator
Platt	PERSON	's detailed `` Autobiography '' and , in quite different 454 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, vein ,
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	's record of the friend - ship between himself and
Cleveland	LOCATION	.

		Among these and other accounts of men who have done things , praiseworthy and not so praiseworthy , he must be hard to please who can not find a good deal of excel - lent reading .

		MACAULAT ,
MR. HUTSON	PERSON	, AND THE WRITING OK Hl.sTnkY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THR DIAL . -RRB-

		I have been interested in the letter of Mr. Hut son on The Writing of History , '' aud in the replies called out by it Mr.
Hutson	PERSON	tells us that history never has been a science , and that it is in a fair way of ceasing to be literature , and he advises us to get back to the spirit and methods of
Macau	LOCATION	lay as soon as we conveniently can .

		Those who reply to Mr.
Hutson	PERSON	say that while history may not be a science , it is scientific in its methods .

		They deny that any historian tries to write badly , and they contend that many historians since
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's time , such as
Kenan	PERSON	and Luchaire , have written well , and that if we do not all write like
Macaulay	PERSON	it is not because we do not wish to do so .

		They maintain that
Macaulay	PERSON	was a genius , that
England	LOCATION	has produced but one
Macaulay	PERSON	, aud that it is too much to expect us so - called historians to be geniuses like
Macaulay	PERSON	, and to have a style like his ; they think that , even if we attempted to imitate him , our books , doctor 's theses and the like , would probably not displace the latest novel on the young ladies ' dressing-tables .

		Probably they would not .

		But what interested me most was that your correspondents , differing at so many points , were quite agreed that there never was a style like
Macaulay 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		I have been waiting to hear someone say that he could not endure
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's style .

		I remem - ber well the first time I read of
Macaulay	DATE	's History hav - ing been found , by the young ladies , when it first came out , more interesting than the latest novel .

		I was in college then , and I ran to the library to get
Macaulay 's History	ORGANIZATION	, hoping against hope that no one had drawn it out before me .

		No one had .

		I was elated at the thought that the history of
England	LOCATION	might be taken on so easily , and with the same pleasure I had experienced in learning about Athos and Porthos .

		I went home prepared to make the acquaintance of an English Dumas .

		Well , I was disappointed .

		I did not keep the book on my dressing-table , but returned it to the library .

		Since then , I have tried again and again to read
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's History ; and , by dint of much perseverance , I have succeeded in reading most of it .

		Imagine the whole history of
England	LOCATION	written by
Macaulay !	ORGANIZATION

		I can not imagine it ; but I have often tried to imagine what the Pil - grim 's Chorus , adapted to fife and drum , would be like .

		One of your correspondents , ''
J. W. T.	PERSON	, '' in his reply to Mr.
Hutson	PERSON	, brought forward Renan , and set him up , with some timidity , I thought , by the side of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, to show that there had been some good writing since
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's time .

		He seems to say that Renan writes very well indeed , and cites one passage which even Macaulay might have envied ; and he mentions others , such at Lavisse and Luchair , who write well , though of course not as well as
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	.

		England , as he says , has produced but one Macaulay .

		Well , I should think that one was enough .

		Of course it would be a distinct loss not to have had one
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, to observe the aver - age middle-class Englishman raised to the nth power is certainly worth while ; but one such will do very well .

		Now , if it conies to style , or to matter either , or to man - ner , or to philosophy , I much prefer Renan .

		It is trm - that be has not the wealth of allusion to all the litera - tures of the world that Maraulay lias .

		Hut I think I must care less for literary allusions and quotations than some readers .

		I despise a Greek quotation because I can not read it , and I am suspicious of a Latin quotation because I can not always read it easily .

		O tempore I O marts !

		if this is apropos here .

		Mr.
Hutson	PERSON	complains that the new school turm-d it * back on Macaulay . ''

		They drowned their thought with : in - ndlfs > tan - , ' !

		.

		- < > -LRB- nnnlilirat I , '' a > !

		.

		< > < p aptly s.-ivs . ''

		Those who still stood by rhetoric looked on
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's style as crude and sometimes as cacophonous , and aimed at effects which we call , after the French , precious . '

		Of these were
Walter Pater	PERSON	and
Robert Louis Steven	PERSON	- son .

		Well , what of the result ?

		Perhaps we have greater exactness as to facts , in many cases new points of view , a more cautious summing up of the evidence ; but nowhere is the clear and -LRB- lowing current of narra - tive , the allurement of style , the wonderful touch of art in the presentation of truth . ''

		Incidentally , I am not convinced that
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	is `` precious , '' at least not in the sense Mr.
Hutson	PERSON	means .

		I do not wish to enlarge on that ; but since Mr.
Hutson	PERSON	has mentioned
Walter Pater	PERSON	, I would like to quote , apropos of '' allurement of style , the wonderful touch of art in the presentation of truth , '' the following passage from that writer .

		It is taken from the essay on
Leonardo da Vinci	PERSON	, and is an inter - pretation of the famous picture La Gioconda '' : '' The presence that thus rose so strangely beside the waters , is expressive of what in the ways of a thousand yean men had come to desire .


Hera	LOCATION	is the head upon which all '' the ends of the world are come , '' and the eyelids are a little weary .

		It is a beauty wrought out from within upon the flesh , the deposit , little cell by cell , of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite passions .

		Set it for a moment beside one of those white Greek goddesses or beantifnl women of antiquity , and how would they be troubled by this beauty , into which the soul with all it * maladies has passed !

		All the thoughts and experience of the world have etched and moulded there , in that which they have of power to re - fine and make expressive the outward form , the animalism of
Greece	LOCATION	, the lust of
Rome	LOCATION	, the revery of the middle age with its spiritual ambition and imaginative loves , the return of the Pagan world , the sins of the Borgias .

		She is older than the rocks among which she sits ; like tin - vampire , she has been dead many times , and learned the secret * of the grave ; and has been a diver in deep seas , and keeps their fallen day about her ; and trafficked for strange webs with
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	merchants : and , as
Leda	PERSON	, was the mother of
Helen of Troy	ORGANIZATION	, and , as Saint
Anne	PERSON	, the mother of
Mary	PERSON	; and all this has been to her but aa the sound of lyres and flutes , and lives only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments , and tinged the eyelids and the hands .

		The fancy of a perpetual life , sweeping together ten thousand experi - ences , is an old one ; and modern thought has conceived the idea of humanity as wrought upon by , and Humming up in itself , all modes of thought and life .

		Certainly Lady
Lisa	PERSON	illicit stand aathe embodiment of the old fancy , the symbol of the modern idea . ''

		Meanwhile , I sympathize with Mr.
Hutson	PERSON	in the matter of doctor 's theses .

		I have written one aud read several .

		Professor
Sioussat	PERSON	, in his defence of doctor 's theses , gives good reasons for their existence , some of which are , at the same time , the best reasons in the world for not printing them .

		THE DIAL 455 < W t lefo A POET OF THE WORLD .

		* Somewhere in the correspondence of
Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	occurs the following pas - sage : `` Five hundred years of
Earth	LOCATION	are none too many could we retain vigor and health .

		Would n't you like to be fifty years a traveller , fifty an inventor , fifty a statesman to practice painting , sculpture , oratory and all the time a fisher , sailor , poet , author , and man of the world ?

		I should , and then might be willing to try another sphere . ''

		This confession of eager vitality , of an interest in life to which nothing human could possibly be alien , illus - trates the most characteristic trait of the man whose death , not quite two years ago , bereft us of our foremost poet and our most beloved man of letters .

		The seventy-five years of his life were far from sufficient to satisfy his measure - less desire for life , but they were nevertheless singularly rich in many varieties of experience that which chastens as well as that which exalts and their outcome was a ripeness of temper and wisdom such as is vouchsafed to few among mortal men .

		The record of his life is now spread before us , chiefly in his own words , in the elaborate '' autobiographic biography '' which has been prepared by Miss
Laura Stedman	PERSON	, the poet 's grand-daughter and sole surviving des - cendant , with the collaboration of his old and close friend , Dr.
George M. Gould	PERSON	, whom he expressly wished to have a share in the work .

		In calling Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	`` a poet of the world , '' we have had chiefly in mind his many points of contact with life and the wide range of his interests .

		The designation is not to be taken in the sense of `` world-poet , '' for his best friends would claim no more for him than that he was distinctively a product of American cul - ture , occupying a seat in the American Par - nassus a little less exalted than the stations of the half-dozen poets who were from one to four decades his seniors .

		Still less is it to be taken as meaning that he was a worldly-minded poet , with eyes imperfectly opened to the spiritual aspects of life , for this would indeed be to mis - interpret his aspirations and ideals .

		But in the sense already suggested by our introductory quotation he was very noticeably '' a poet of the world , '' a man who lived among his fellows and delighted in them as inheritors of a com - * LIFE AND LETTERS OF

		mon humanity , a man who could be many things to many men while still guarding the citadel of his own soul .

		The contrast between him and such poets as
Poe	PERSON	and
Emerson	PERSON	and
Whittier	LOCATION	was in this respect very marked ; it was similar to the contrast between
Byron	PERSON	and
Keats	PERSON	, be - tween
Browning	PERSON	and
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		In
Stedman	PERSON	's case , the contrast was emphasized by the fact that throughout most of his career he was struggling for a living in the common mart .

		He once wrote to his mother : '' I am not swal - lowed up of poetry .

		I earn
eight dollars	MONEY	per day , but my business friends do n't know that I ever heard the word . ''

		The honorable way in which he thus recognized that the primary obligation of a man even of a poet is to earn a living and support a family occasionally brought upon him the undeserved reproach of sacrificing to
Mammon	LOCATION	, and earned for him the meaningless newspaper - title of '' banker-poet , '' or '' broker-poet . ''

		This he keenly resented , and in one case , moved from a dignified silence by a peculiarly reckless attack , wrote a pointed letter to the editor of the offending publication .

		The article , he said , '' Conveys the impression that I am devoted to mak - ing money ; that I surrender the time which should be given to art to accumulating wealth as a stock-operator , and only give my leisure hours to poetry ; that I am , in short , a mere money-chaser , and thus by choice an amateur or dilettante .

		This hypothesis may have formed itself in your mind from the vulgar newspaper-phrase ' broker-poet ' which paragraphers have attached to my name , and which is as unwelcome to me as the term clergyman-editor doubtlessly would be to you and as utterly senseless . '' ''

		Your hypothesis has just this basis of truth .

		I wish to live , and have dear ones for whose comfort and hap - piness I have taken sacred vows .

		Were I content to see them enduring the ills -LRB- to which you commend me -RRB- of absolute ' poverty , ' I could not keep them even from cold and hunger by poetry alone .

		I am a member of the
Stock Exchange	ORGANIZATION	, one of the mass of hard-working brokers who there toil humbly and honestly for their daily bread .

		This is for me a cause neither of pride nor of complaint .

		Most authors who have not inherited property , and whose writings are of an aesthetic or phil - osophical kind , have to sustain themselves by some labor other than that nearest their hearts . '' ''

		I married young and , owing to a chain of circum - stances , found myself , upon a time , penniless ; and with a family to support , and had the choice of several modes of life , all of which you have seen exemplified in the careers of authors great and small : 1 .

		I could leave my family to shift for themselves , fling my harp over my shoulders , and go on my tuneful way in quest of pleasure and fame .

		2 .

		I could support my house - hold , and continue to write verses , by a process of credit and imposition ; could borrow of friends , refuse to pay the baker and washerwoman , filk the butcher , and maintain the traditional right of bardlets to exemption from the claims of decency and honor ; or , 3 .

		I might work at some occupation which would enable me to 456 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, earn an honest living , and write poetry when I found time , strength , and the heart to do so . ''

		l/et me at once acknowledge that the stem neces - sity of earning so much a week before I can write a line , interferes with and retards my literary work ... When baring a little money ahead , I have several times left the ' Street ' altogether , and have been devoted to study and authorship , until my reserve was exhausted and I had to go back again .

		Thus it happens that I have not yet been able to own my own home , to keep a horse , or even to visit
Europe	LOCATION	, where I have so many friends and literary comrades , and whither I have longed for years to go .

		But I have had a modest subsistence , having educated my children one of whom I have ventured , even , to send to college ; and have been able to write and print a few books whose merits are short , very far short , of my wishes and ideal . ''

		This apologia pro vita sua is one of the most strongly-felt and self-revealing documents in the whole biography ; the fact that it defends the writer from a charge which no one would now dream of making does not lessen its signifi - cance as an expression of the poet 's character .

		The story of
Stedinan	ORGANIZATION	's boyhood is interest - ing , and in a way pathetic .

		He was an infant when his father died , and he was separated from his mother for a considerable part of his early life , at school and in the care of relatives .

		Soon after he entered
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, at the age of fifteen , his mother re-married and went to
Italy	LOCATION	with her husband , who represented the
United States	ORGANIZATION	government at the Court of
Piedmont	LOCATION	.

		Mother and son were thus parted for a long term of years , and the seriousness of this separation is revealed in his tenderly affectionate letters to the distant parent .

		He was a precocious youth , a great reader with an early passion for poetry , but not without a healthy interest in boyish sports .

		His means were narrow , and he was not altogether successful in supporting himself while in college upon an annual income of three hundred dollars .

		He was inclined to be a little priggish at first , and formulated a set of rules for his conduct that would have made him a very model of student virtue had he not soon learned to depart from them .

		The reaction came in his sophomore year , and his escapades resulted in an intimation from the authorities that he had better seek another field for his talents .

		In his old age he thus wrote about the affair : '' I was an imaginative and excitable boy , and became rather reckless ; fell off in all my studies ; cut prayers , etc. , and excelled only in English composition , and in reading ... My nights were spent with beer , whiskey - skin , skittles , and howling around town .

		How I lived through it , I don t know .

		At the end of sophomore year , 1 wab arrested one night with some older men and taken before the local
Dogberry	ORGANIZATION	.

		The others gave false names , paid their fines , and got away , but I was recogni - zed by my long hair , and other eccrutricitifs , and re - ported to the faculty ; was m.ti .

		; iU-d tu
Northampton	LOCATION	, where I panned a
summer	DATE	under the charge of 1 ` rofi-ssor
Dudley	PERSON	, a famous Greek scholar , who had a private seminary there .

		The institution was full of a still wilder crowd than I - had met at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, and I joined with them in painting the town red , getting in love with the
Northampton	LOCATION	girls , and into trouble generally . ''

		After this
summer	DATE	, he went to visit a college chum on a
Virginia	LOCATION	plantation , and of this visit the following anecdote is told : A custom more honored in the breach than in the observance - prevailed in the hospitable mansion , where he was a guest ; the custom of opening the shutters , and welcoming the various guests by sending to their rooms a quart pitcher of mint julep , intended as a loving-cup for the household .

		This time it was left first at the door of young
Stedman	PERSON	by an old white - haired darkey , who returned later to take the pitcher on its further rounds .

		When the black-and-white mes - senger came for this purpose , the old man looked at the pitcher , then at the dark-eyed youth ; then his eyes began to twinkle , and , as he went downstairs with the empty pitcher , his head shoo and his shoulders rattled . ''


Stedman	PERSON	was predestined for the service of the muse . ''

		As soon as he could speak , '' his mother says , '' he lisped in rhyme , and as soon as he could write , he gave shape and measure to his dreams . ''

		He himself says : '' From my earliest remembrance I made poetry .

		All of the
Cleveland	LOCATION	blood do bad cess to them !

		I was a natural writer , an insatiate reader especially of fiction , adventure , poetry . ''

		His first poet was Scott '' what better fodder for a boy ? ''

		then he discovered
Keats	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Coleridge	PERSON	, had the necessary attack of
Byron	PERSON	- ism , and gradually attained to the conception of poetry as art , a conception fully ripened when he learned to know and love
Tennyson	PERSON	in his early twenties .

		His aesthetic creed must li ; i \ v become fairly fixed when he could write , as in
1857	DATE	: '' Now , to end with
Tennyson	PERSON	, I want to say that through all his writings of every style , there runs , overtly or covertly , the tnu-st , noblest , broadest philosophy of the age .

		He has made me wiser and better , and if his grand thoughts are expressed in the most finished and perfect manner , it is a fault that the thousand shiftless writers of prosaic verse would do well to imitate .

		* By way of poetic p ` rfnrmaiitv ,
Stedman	PERSON	had already won college distinct ions , and shown himself to be at least a facile \ n > i fier endowed with much poetic sensibility .

		Mis 41 Hours of Idleness '' or '' Victor and Cazire '' period produced nothing that is particularly worth preserving , but it drtmiiined his bent , and supplies its element to the interest of his life-story .

		Passing over hU youthful experiences : i
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 457 printer , publisher , and editor , and the story of the boy-and-girl marriage which seemed so fool - ish but which laid the foundation of a half - century of happy domestic life , we find
Stedman	PERSON	in
New York	LOCATION	at the age of twenty-one , in search of a living .

		He experimented in selling clocks , in real estate brokerage , in the law , and in the railroad business all the time with one eye upon journalism as a practical gateway to liter - ature .

		One of the most interesting chapters in the biography is his account of the
Unitary Home	ORGANIZATION	in which the family lived from
1858	DATE	to
1860	DATE	.

		This was an experiment in modified Fourierism , a kind of cooperative boarding - house , which solved the problem of comfortable existence upon a moderate outlay .

		He calls it '' A Brownstone Utopia , '' describing both its management and its denizens in a very charm - ing way .

		This description was prepared as a chapter of the '' Eeminiscences '' upon which he was engaged near the end of his life , a work of which he brought only a few fragments to a finished state .

		The story of his successful skit , '' The Diamond Wedding , '' and of how he almost had to fight a duel on account of it , is too long to relate here , but it must be mentioned as one of the things that brought him into closer rela - tions with journalism .

		It was soon followed by '' How Old Brown Took
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry '' and '' The Ballad of
Lager Bier	PERSON	, '' the three ballads together earning for him a reputation that his more serious and artistic poetry had failed to secure .

		He received no pay from the '' Tribune '' for these poems , but they brought him his first assignment from that paper to report the fun - eral of Irving at
Sunnyside	LOCATION	, and he received ten dollars for the four columns of his report .

		At this time also , he entered into his lifelong friend - ships with
Taylor	PERSON	,
Stoddard	PERSON	,
Leland	LOCATION	,
Boker	PERSON	,
Aldrich	PERSON	,
Willis	PERSON	,
Winter	DATE	, and many others .

		Of that joyous company , Mr.
Winter	PERSON	is now the sole survivor .

		Immediately after the fall of
Fort Sumter	LOCATION	,
Stedman	PERSON	set out for
Washington	LOCATION	as correspond - ent of the
New York	LOCATION	`` World , '' and for the remainder of the year
1862	DATE	he was hard at work either at the capital or in the field .

		He saw the first battle of Bull Run , and described it in what was called '' the best single letter written during the whole war . ''

		But he did more than observe , as will be seen from these words of another correspondent : '' The enemy appeared in sight , firing their guns , the balls raining upon us thick .

		Emerging from the valley we saw the reporter of the ' World , ' with the standard of the
Massachusetts Fifth	ORGANIZATION	, waving it over him and pleading for the men to rally around him , but it was in vain ; they heeded him not .

		An officer asked the priv - ilege of riding behind him .

		It was granted , and before they had gone a hundred yards a shot from the thicket struck the officer in the head and he reeled off .

		Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	wrapped up the standard and galloped about a mile ahead , and afterwards succeeded in rallying a larger force . ''

		Thus did the poet receive his baptism of fire , and become qualified for something better than an arm-chair singer of the battle-field .

		His stirring war-poems followed in rapid succession , and were among the most inspiring that our four years ' struggle produced .

		At the beginning of
1862	DATE	,
Stedman	PERSON	became an assistant to Attorney - General
Bates	PERSON	, occupying the post until late in the following year .

		Then he returned to
New York	LOCATION	, got more and more definitely into the banking business , and made fairly steady prog - ress .

		He wrote to his mother in
1865	DATE	: '' I enclose a slip , to show you the honorable and large position of my house .

		Although obliged to leave , poor , 1 have the satisfaction of having , unaided , built up the most popular and successful young banking - house in
New York	LOCATION	, and having shown that poetry , if good , may not unfit a man for other work , if he chooses to do it .

		If I had health for five years , I would write two or three books , and open banking-houses in
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	, in connection with the
New York	LOCATION	house . ''

		Among the happenings of the ten years fol - lowing , we may mention
Stedman	PERSON	's joining of the
Stock Exchange Board	ORGANIZATION	in
1869	DATE	, his restora - tion to membership in the Yale class of
' 53	DATE	, with the degrees of A.B. and
M.A.	LOCATION	, in
1871	DATE	, and his publication of `` Victorian Poets '' in
1875	DATE	.

		To this period belong the extremely interesting letters from
Swinburne	LOCATION	upon which we commented last year -LRB-
July 1 , 1909	DATE	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	calls them '' by far the most interesting letters that
Algernon	PERSON	ever wrote . ''

		The decade brought varying fortunes , and alter - nating moods of gayety and depression .

		Here is a confession dated 1870 : '' Have passed the fatal to poets thirty-seventh year , and begin to think I am no poet ; only a poor , gray-haired , unsuccessful dreamer , trying to get fat by feeding on the wind .

		Am as poor as on my twentieth birthday , except in the love of friends .

		Mother and
Mary	ORGANIZATION	send me gifts ; my wife and boys love me , and we are all in a hired home by ourselves , but O , how poor , and how precarious the future !

		And how my genius , whatever it may be , is cramped , warped , and gradually atrophying away . ''

		When the '' Victorian Poets '' had at last gone through the press early in
1875	DATE	, the author took the first real outing of his life , setting sail for '' The Carib Sea '' for a few weeks of dreamy ease .

		This was such a joy as he had never before known , and the enchantment of the ex - THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, perience colored his thoughts for all the rest of his days .

		A second trip was made in
1892	DATE	, and from the two journeys flowed a
spring	DATE	of lyrical inspiration which offers unfailing refresh - ment to the readers of his collected poems .

		For the
next quarter-century	DATE	, S ted man re - mained an active member of the Stock Ex - change ; finally disposing of his seat in
1900	DATE	.

		Oa that date he wrote in his diary : `` Sold my ` seat ' in the
New York Stock Exchange	ORGANIZATION	for 839,500 , less a commission , etc. .

		This ends a mem - bership of thirty and one-half years -LRB- since the
summer of 1809	DATE	-RRB- , and it is like tearing a tree up by the roots .

		All this time I have walked that floor , until its tragedies and comedies its drama its friendships in battle and in action in success and despair have become a part of my life .

		It is the tirst chance , in seventeen years , for retiring with honor , though half the money goes to liquidate my debts to my dear comrade
Baker	PERSON	, who has carried me through evil times .

		And I am at best leaving the raft which has given me support since my ship was scuttled in
1883	DATE	.

		Here at sixty-six , I do n't know whether I have strength to live by writing , and I have no other means of support . ''

		The reference to the '' scuttled ship '' has to do with the tragedy of his business life .

		In the
Spring of 1882	DATE	, fortune was smiling upon him as never before , and he went to
Europe	LOCATION	, plan - ning an Italian vacation of several months .

		But he was barely settled in
Venice	LOCATION	, when a cable - gram informed him that his business had sud - denly become a wreck .

		Returning at once to
New York	LOCATION	, he set about saving what was possi - ble , and after a very black year of struggle , culminating in one terrible day of the following
Summer	DATE	, was able to write : '' As it is , my bank - ing capital is gone I am in a sea of doubt and trouble but have averted dishonor , saved my confidential and my Wall Street engagements , saved many humble friends from ruin . ''

		His tangled affairs were settled by the end of the year , and ho resumed , regretfully , his active membership of the
Stock Exchange	ORGANIZATION	.

		How he felt about it all may be learned from this extract from a letter : Tin - scholar 's delightful indolence crept over me once more , during the few months when I stayed up town , and smoked , and wrote at my will .

		Goda !

		how I hated to go back to meaner things .

		Nothing but the great value of my ` seat ' to my family , in case of my death , and the will to have absolute vindication , led me to accept it again .

		For I found that we could live on the rent of
Laura	LOCATION	's house added to my literary income provided I should write altogether .

		Yea , and a quiet , happy life writing poetry .

		Think of what duty has compelled me to give up . ''

		The story of
Stedman	PERSON	's life is mainly recorded in the first of the two large volumes now before us .

		It was in
1897	DATE	that he established himself in a suburban home almost a country home , although within easy reach of
New York	LOCATION	at
Lawrence Park	LOCATION	,
Bronx	LOCATION	\ ilk ' .

		This was the
Casa Laura	ORGANIZATION	in which he spent a term of relatively peaceful years , saddened toward the close by the death of Mrs. St - < lmaii in
1905	DATE	, and of th-ir oldest son a few months later .

		Then , in
1906	DATE	, the house was sold , and he returned to the city , occupying the apartment in Broadway where he was to die
less than two years later	DATE	.

		Miss
Stedman	PERSON	gives us the following affecting arrount of his last hours : At the family dinner the old-time hour at which to talk over intimate and outside affairs , the evening before his death , he was , lays Mrs.
Ellen Douglas	PERSON	Sted - man , ' more like himself than for days .

		He long had been , ' she adds , ' putting on a brave face to the outside world , ' but he was now ` unusually bright and alert . '

		Did he , perhaps , forefeet the coming end , and was he smiling , even laughing , at Death , as he crowded the days and hours with social activities and duties ?

		He followed his guests to the door , and keeping them a lit tit - longer , told ' one more story ' before Good-night was called , as if pleading to be thus remembered .

		He was accustomed to leave the papers , books , etc. , on his work-table so that he could easily resume his study or writing where he had left off :
this last night	TIME	his books were balanced to the hour , and everything was ar - ranged and ordered as if he were , indeed , going away upon a journey .

		On the morning of
Saturday	DATE	,
January 18 , 1908	DATE	, Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	rose a little later than usual , and passed the mom ing at work upon his last essay .

		His mail was large , and he said : ' Twenty-seven letters !

		What is the use ! '

		After a late luncheon , he passed to another room and fell . ''


Three days later	DATE	, the funeral services were held , and a year later his friends gathered in the
Carnegie Lyceum	LOCATION	to pay their tribute to his memory .

		The second of the two volumes of this biog - raphy supplements rather than continues the first , by devoting separate chapters to Sted man 's chief literary works , as illustrated by the corre - spondence and criticism that they evoked .

		Other chapters are concerned with his public activities and private friendships , and to the whole an extensive bibliography is appended .

		The chief achievement of this second volume is the setting forth of the many ways in which he was in touch with life , each contact being a vital experi < Micr for himself as well as a matter of interest for others .

		So rich is the material here offered that no review can pretend to do it justice , and
\ %	PERCENT	v can only record the plain fact that the work is interesting beyond almost any other of its kind in the field of American literature .

		Two scraps from the feast spread before us may be offered in further illustration of the quality of this auto - biographic revelation . ''

		THE DIAL 459 you , 't is only an aggravation , now for me to see youth and beauty f I see that my beard is white and they see it and yet I do n't feel it .

		I hav n't a ' realizing sense ' of it , and why should I voluntarily incite the woes of Tantalus ?

		The most appalling and absurd scrape I ever got into was when Rose
Cleveland	LOCATION	beguiled me to tea at Mrs.
Reed	PERSON	s finishing-school .

		Then she took me into the big hall with its waxed floor .

		There were fifty full-grown girls , doubtless all thinking me an old prig .

		However , I sat down between the prettiest two one in pink , one in blue and we soon were flirting at a great rate .

		Mark you !

		that horrid Mrs.
Reed	PERSON	switched me up on the platform , and then presented all those fifty girls to me till I felt like an octogen - arian muff and a figure-head .

		They hated me , I knew , and I wanted to hug them and talk nonsense to them .

		I am not a bit of a show , and Mrs.
Stedman	PERSON	justly says that I have no dignity .

		Girls are good to kiss not to teach .

		I would rather have been Anacreon than Solon . ''

		With this Ruskinian outburst we will join the following note for the unwritten '' Reminis - cences '' : '' At least I have obeyed at eve the voice obeyed at prime ; the more so , as in this matter desire went hand in hand with duty .

		Strength wanes , passion long since flew , but the compulsive gift of youth stays by to the last .

		If I have been false to it through long stages of life , it was because there is a still higher law that of protection for others , and honor among one 's kind .

		I confess that I am not of the Scriptural -LRB- patriarchal -RRB- breed , that would slay or sacrifice those under my law or protection , even at the command of an Angel in the bush , the thicket , or the cloud . ''

		How intimate , in both charm and appeal , are these contrasted confessions !

		They illustrate the lighter fancy and the more serious mood of reflection that sojourned side by side in Sted - man 's complex personality .

		He was truly one who * ' warmed both hands before the fire of life , '' and so survives in the memory of those who loved him that they are fain still to think of him , not as dying in any real sense , but as flinging '' off somewhere into the ether , '' as he said of Landor , '' still facing the daybreak and worshipped by many rising stars .

		stone of stumbling and a rock of offence unto the falling and redemption of many in both houses of
Israel	LOCATION	. ''

		But no picture drawn by a hostile critic could be more frank in its revela - tion of groping experiments and failures than
Miss Addams	PERSON	's own account in her record of the first twenty years of that remarkable institution which has done so much to soften the sharpness of class hostility and bring the inhabitants of a great city a little nearer to the realization of the fact that they are indeed all one family , one member of which can not suffer without injury to the whole body .

		Hull-House is not merely a `` settlement '' ; it is a garden of civic health and sweetness ; it is a piece of sound flesh grafted into the midst of a plague-spot in the body of the sprawling giant
Chicago	LOCATION	; it is a life and a heart of love anastomosing into the arteries of a community impoverished by wealth and the struggle for wealth .

		Therefore Miss
Addams	PERSON	has done well to begin her account of Hull -
House	ORGANIZATION	with a sketch of the influences surrounding her youth , which prompted her to devote her life to this work .

		In connection with her first visit to the poorer quarter of her home town , she tells us : '' I remember launching at my father the pertinent inquiry , why people lived in such horrid little houses so close together , and that , after receiving his explan - ation , I declared with much firmness , when I grew up I should of course have a large house , but it would not be built among the other large houses , but right in the midst of horrid little houses like these . ''

		Next to this instinctive desire for equal privileges was the sense of absolute sincerity cherished in the young
Jane	PERSON	by the life and precept of her father , leaving upon her mind the final impression , that `` it did not matter much whether one understood foreordination or not , but that it was very important not to pre - tend to understand what you did n't understand , and that you must always be honest with your - self inside , whatever happened . ''

		In these two influences of childhood it is possible to discern the dominating factors of the power of Hull -
House	ORGANIZATION	: the will to help , and the open mind .

		And in the latter of these two factors lies the differential of
Hull-House	ORGANIZATION	.

		No other settlement undertaking has been carried on with quite the same absence of pre-conception and prejudice , with the same willingness to learn and be adapted to the conditions , with the same absence of the air of patronage .

		Most settle - ments , for instance , have been outposts of denom - inational conquest : behind the kindly act was the more or less open suggestion , '' Do not for - get the church that has done this for you / ' Not 4 ; o THE DIAL -LSB- Dev .

		1 .

		only the recipients of neighborly kindness , but even the fellow-workers in other settlements , were unable to understand a good will that repre - sented no propaganda , and were long disposed to suspect some dark heresy or atheism behind the movement that refused to walk under the standard of a denominational creed .

		`` During the first decade of Hull-House it was felt by propagandists of various social theories that the new settlement would be a flue coign of vantage from which to propagate social faiths , and that a mere preliminary step would be the conversion of the founders ; hence I have been reasoned with hours at a time , and I recall at least three occasions when this was followed by actual prayer . ''

		At one time , indeed , in the early history of Hull -
House	ORGANIZATION	there was an attempt to unify the religious life of the '' residents '' so the regular workers call themselves , but it resulted only in the conclusion , that it might be possible that among such diversified people it was better that the Settlement corps should also represent varying religious beliefs . ''

		Miss
Addams	PERSON	's book is a faithful reflection of the spirit and activities of the
Hull	LOCATION	-
House	ORGANIZATION	Settlement : modest , unassuming , self-effacing .

		It has much to say of problems and experiments , but speaks shyly of lessons and achievements .

		With such a simple platform as good-will and open-mindedness , one hunts almost vainly for more definite threads of leading .

		A prime difficulty , too often ignored by charity workers and journalistic investigators of social conditions , was the fact that the resi - dents were not actually on the same footing as those with whom they proposed to '' neighbor . ''

		`` There was always present the harrowing conscious - ness of the difference in economic conditions between ourselves and our neighbors .

		Even if we had gone to live in the most wretched tenement , there would always have been an essential difference between them and ourselves , for we should have had a sense of security in regard to illness and old age , and the lack of these two securities are the specters which most persistently haunt the poor . ''

		`` We were early impressed with the curious isolation of many of the emigrants ; an Italian woman once ex - pressed her pleasure in the red roses that she saw at one of our receptions , in surprise that they ` had been brought so fresh all the way from
Italy	LOCATION	. '

		She would not believe that they had been grown in
America	LOCATION	... During all her six years in
Chicago	LOCATION	she had lived within ten blocks of a florist 's window ; she had not been more than a five-cent car-ride away from the public parks , but she had never dreamed of faring forth for herself , and no one had taken her . ''

		`` That a group of Greeks should be permitted to slaughter sheep in a basement , that Italian women should be allowed to sort over rags collected from the city dumps , not only within the city limits , but in a court swarming with little children , that immigrant bakers should continue unmolested to bake bread for their neighbors in unspeakably filthy spaces under the | iin-lit , appeared incredible to visitors accustomed to careful city regulations . ''

		lint -LRB- if all the aspects of social misery nothing u so heartbreaking a unemployment , and it was inevit - able that we should sec much of it in a neighborhood where low rents attracted the poorly paid worker . '' ''

		We early found ourselves spending many hours in efforts to secure work for deserted women , iiiMiraiu for bewildered widows , damages for injured operators , furniture from the clutches of the installment store .

		The Settlement is valuable as an information and inter - pretation bureau .

		The hospitals , the county agencies , and
State	ORGANIZATION	asylums are often Init vague rumors to tin people who need them most .

		Another function of the Settlement to its neighborhood resembles that of th .

		big brother whose mere presence on the playground protects the little one from bullies . ''

		With all these and many more concrete problems the Settlement at
Hull - House	ORGANIZATION	has endeavored to implant in its residents and it - neighbors a sound and democratic ideal of culture ; to civilize their amusements , to hum - anize their employments , to ennoble their daily routine , '' to promote a culture which will not set its possessor aside in a class with others like himself , but which will , on the contrary , con - nect him with all sorts of people by his abilit \ to understand them as well as by his power to supplement their present surroundings with the historic background . ''

		In the pursuit of these ends Miss Addams and her co-workers have undertaken endl activities ; they have been garbage inspectors .

		Juvenile Court officers , strike arbitrators , members of numerous commissions and of the
Chicago Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the attempt to act as '' big brother '' to the ignorant and wrong-headed , in such cases as the Pullman strike , the
Averbuch	PERSON	extradition case , the Anarchist trials , the teamsters ' strike ,
Hull	PERSON	-
House	ORGANIZATION	naturally incurred the charge of sus - taining all the wrongs done in connection with these events .

		When Labor ' is in disgrace we are always re - garded as belonging to it and share in the opprobrium .

		In the public excitement following the Pullman strike Hull-House lost many friends ; later the teamsters ' strike caused another such defection , although my office in both cases had been solely that of a duly appointed arbitrator . ''

		Perhaps the most difficult thing for one in piililic or semi-public life is to stand out for truth and justice against popular clamor , be - cause the loss of popularity threatens at least immediate usefulness .

		And the most discour - aging feature in this situation is the fact that practically no great newspajwr can IH depended upon to stand with the misunderstood , but in

		THE DIAL 461 almost always found echoing the hue and cry of the mob .

		While the individual representa - tives of the great
Chicago	LOCATION	dailies have often been friendly to Hull-House , and have in many ways supported Miss Addams 's efforts , in great emergencies they have been ready , to their shame , to decry and misrepresent one whose purposes they knew to be absolutely generous and noble .

		As has been said , this book is not a book of boastings .

		But with a fine net it is possible to gather out at least a partial list of definite achievements in which Hull -
House	ORGANIZATION	has been the pioneer , though far from claiming the whole credit for them : the appointment of women as assistants in outdoor relief work ; the intro - duction of civil service methods in
State	LOCATION	and county appointments ; the Public School Art Society ; public bathhouses ; branch public libra - ries ; probation treatment in Juvenile Courts ; college or university extension ; local textile fabric exhibitions ; a purely amateur public stage , '' through which humble experiments , as well as through the more ambitious reforms which are attempted in various parts of the country , the theatre may at last be restored to its rightful place in the community . ''

		Miss Addams 's chapters on The Children of Immigrants ,
The Problem of Poverty	ORGANIZATION	,
Economic Discussion	ORGANIZATION	,
Labor Legislation	ORGANIZATION	in
Illinois	LOCATION	, So - cialized Education , Tolstoism , The Arts at Hull -
House	ORGANIZATION	, Echoes of the Russian Revolution , but one might as well name them all , are replete with calm and sane observations and the report of most interesting experiences .

		It is a great satisfaction to read a book on sociology not written by a doctrinaire , containing abso - lutely no dogmatism and very few generaliza - tions .

		Yet this does not mean that most valuable lessons as well as tense entertainment may not be had from the reading of it .

		Every chapter has its share of concrete cases and anecdotes , though always such as bear on the problems involved .

		The drawbacks to the parole system in the
Juvenile Court	ORGANIZATION	are illustrated by the case of the Bohemian boy '' out on parole from the old detention home of the
Juvenile Court	ORGANIZATION	itself , who brought back five stolen chickens to the matron for
Sunday	DATE	dinner , saying that he knew the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	were having ' a hard time to fill up so many kids and perhaps these fowl would help out . ' '

		A beautiful illustration of the service of the
Labor Museum	ORGANIZATION	maintained in
Hull-House	ORGANIZATION	is given in the following : `` A certain Italian girl ... came every
Saturday	DATE
evening	TIME	to a cooking class in the same building in which her mother spun in the Labor Museum Exhibit ; and yet Angelina always left her mother at the front door , while she herself went around to a side door because she did not wish to be too closely identified in the eyes of the rest of the cooking class , with an Italian woman who wore a kerchief over her head , uncouth boots , and short petticoats .

		One evening , however , Angelina saw her mother surrounded by a group of visitors from the
School of Education	ORGANIZATION	, who much admired the spinning , and she concluded from their conversation that her mother was the ' best stick-spindle spinner in
America	LOCATION	. '

		... At least two things resulted : she allowed her mother to pull out of the big box under the bed the beautiful homespun garments , which had previously been hidden away as uncouth ; and she openly came into the
Labor Museum	ORGANIZATION	by the same door as did her mother , proud at least of the mastery of the craft which had been so much admired . ''

		And full of dramatic situations is this experi - ence of the charity worker : '' I recall the dying hour of one old Scotchwoman whose long struggle to keep ' respectable ' had so em - bittered her that her last words were gibes and taunts for those who were trying to minister to her . '

		So you came in yourself
this morning	TIME	, ' did you ?

		You only sent things yesterday .

		I guess you knew when the doctor was coming .

		Do n't try to warm my feet with anything but that old jacket that I 've got there ; it belonged to my boy who was drowned at sea nigh
thirty years ago	DATE	, but it 's warmer yet with human feelings than any of your damned charity hot water bottles . '

		Sud - denly the harsh gasping voice was stilled in death , and I awaited the doctor 's coming , shaken and horrified . ''

		It seems impossible by excerpts to give a true impression of the tone of sweet reasonable - ness that pervades these pages .

		It is safe to say , however , that few modern books dealing directly with social problems give so much light and so much uplift to those who feel , as did Miss Addams in her youth , the responsibility for the wrongs of the social order and are prompted to make some effort for their allevia - tion .

		If such would-be workers do not find here a plain guide-post to the best course of action they will at least receive many valuable hints as to the right spirit in which to work , as well as concerning many errors to be avoided .

		Says
Miss Addams	PERSON	near the close of her book : `` There is no doubt that residents in a Settlement too often move toward their ends ' with hurried and ignoble gait , ' putting forth thorns in their eagerness to bear grapes .

		It is always easy for those in pursuit of ends which they consider of overwhelming importance to become themselves thin and impoverished in spirit and temper , to gradually develop a dark , mistaken eager - ness alternating with fatigue , which supersedes the ' great and gracious ways ' so much more congruous with worthy aims . ''

		The '' practical '' man may well question the usefulness of much ill-considered so-called Set - tlement work , which is often nothing else than 462 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, slumming in disguise ; but in such influences as those of Hull-House it is hard to see anything but the noblest sort of solution of Mr.
Stead	PERSON	's hypothetical problem If Christ Came to Chi - cago . ''

		Miss
Addams	PERSON	's account of this work deserves , as it will undoubtedly receive , wide reading and taking to heart .

		THE BEAUTY OF THE WORLD .

		* The translation of the late
Emile Michel	PERSON	's book on '' Great Masters of Landscape Paint - ing '' is one which anyone interested in the subject will want to have .

		It covers a wide range , is well printed , and profusely illustrated with photogravure and other reproductions , not only of pictures but of drawings from many private as well as public collections , and is by a well-known authority .

		Owing to his general plan
M. Michel	PERSON	was forced to omit one development in landscape painting that id now rather important .

		He in - cluded in his work no living artists , and there - fore of the so-called '' impressionists '' or `` plein - air '' landscapists he was able to mention only
Sisley	LOCATION	.

		Those students who feel that a work on landscape must omit a good deal when it omits
Monet	ORGANIZATION	,
Pissarro	PERSON	, and Ce ` zanne , not to speak of many others , may remedy the defect by the translation of
Duret	PERSON	's book on the French Impressionists , which , though it deals with much beside landscape painting , considers the impres - sionist landscapists in quite as much detail as
M. Michel	PERSON	could have done according to the plan of his work .

		The many who have read with instruction and sympathy Mr.
Birge Harrison	PERSON	's '' Land - scape Painting '' will be interested in knowing that whereas Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	says , '' Not until the
early years of the nineteenth century	DATE	... did the first true school of landscape make its appearance , ''
M. Michel	PERSON	devotes almost two - thirds of his book to the painters before Con - stable .

		On the other hand , the landscape - painter who appears to be most interesting to
M. Michel Theodore Rousseau	PERSON	is merely alluded to once by Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	, and then only in connection with two or three others .

		Another quotation from Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	is worth GKKAT MASTKK * or LANDSCAI-K PAIWTIKO .

		noting : `` In landscape , of course , drawing is of secondary importance ; color , refraction and vibration ranking first '' Now while color is a matter of some interest to
M. Michel	PERSON	, he hardly ever mentions refraction or vibration or anything of the sort .

		Such comparisons make pretty clear the general position of
M. Michel	PERSON	's book in the present interest in landscape - painting .

		It is not a presentation of landscape on the basis of the ideas now generally current .

		It is a historical study of landscape as it has appeared in European art in the last four or five centuries .

		And as the idea of landscape now predominantly current is a matter chiefly of the last hundred years or less , it becomes clear that
M. Michel	PERSON	does not omit
Monet	ORGANIZATION	and a hundred others merely because they were living at the time he wrote .

		He writes the book he does because he was not interested in the con - ception of landscape art which regards vibration and refraction as the two chief things .

		He had other standards , among them drawing .

		His book , therefore , has much in it for one whose taste has been largely formed in the schools of the present , because though one will not find one 's favorite artists presented and inter - preted -LRB- one may go to
M. Duret	PERSON	for that -RRB- one will almost without a doubt be interested and surprised to find how much there is in the land - scapes of earlier days , those landscapes of the centuries before '' the first true school of land - scape '' made its appearance .

		It will be seen that there were great men before
Alexander	PERSON	.

		One thing that appears to me a great defect in the book is the general plan , which is chiefly individual or often biographical .

		That was , of course ,
M. Michel	PERSON	's idea and desire : he calls his book the '' Great Masters . ''

		Now much may be done by a study of the great land - scapists of all time , and doubtless
M. Michel	PERSON	knew just what he wished to accomplish .

		But much more interesting , to my mind , than a study of the lives , even of the works and the genius , of different artists , is a presentation which includes some study of developments and tendencies , a history of art , in fact .

		Perhaps we have heard so much of developments and tendencies of taste that people are tired of them and will be glad to read something that is frankly individual and biographical .

		But the matter is not merely a matter of taste : it has a more practical element .

		For instance ,
M. Michel	PERSON	has half a page on
Salvator Rosa	PERSON	and a page on
Wilson	PERSON	: there is little more than a mention of each .

		This is natural enough from his standpoint , for Salvator is certainly not one
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 463 of the masters of landscape with whom , for the beauty of his own work , we should want to have much to do ; and although there are many things by
Wilson	PERSON	that are charming , yet one can see how a Frenchman whose mind was full of
Claude	PERSON	would not consider him very im - portant .

		But both men were undeniable in - fluences .

		To us in
America	LOCATION	they are more interesting than elsewhere , for there can be little doubt that the pictures of
Wilson	PERSON	, and to a less degree of Salvator , were a real inspiration to
Thomas Cole	PERSON	and the first American land - scapists , not to mention American writers and men of general culture .

		Doubtless
M. Michel	PERSON	was not at all interested in
Cole	PERSON	and his inspir - ations , or in American landscape , but it was not by any means in
America	LOCATION	alone that
Salvator	PERSON	was an influence , or
Wilson	PERSON	either .

		So I feel a lack in this book which comes , doubtless , from looking in it for what
M. Michel	PERSON	did not care to put there .

		If the reader will look at the book for what is there he will find much that he will like .

		Here is an appreciative and thorough account of the Barbizon painters ; here , as one would expect , is a thoroughly sympathetic treatment of
Nicolas Poussin	PERSON	and of
Claude	LOCATION	; here is a full dealing with
Ruysdael	PERSON	,
Hobbema	LOCATION	, and the Flemish and Dutch .

		* These things one would expect , but there are other matters not so obvious .

		One is a matter of method .

		It surely is excellent in
M. Michel	LOCATION	to study land - scape not only with his eye on the picture but on thescene .

		Here we have the so-called ' `` Tempest '' of Giorgione compared with a photograph of Castlefranco ; we have a consideration of Titian on the basis of the photographs and sketches of the country about Cadore ; we have the already known comparison of some of the land - scapes of Ruysdael with the localities them - selves .

		I am sorry that
M. Michel	PERSON	did not go further in this way , for it seems to me to be full of possibilities , not for identification only , but to help us form an idea of what the painter had in his mind to give us in his picture .

		It is something like a comparison of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays with their sources , a study that may easily become dry and lifeless , but which is also sus - ceptible of real gain in dramatic appreciation .

		In studying American landscapists , in partic - ular , such a method has its advantages , one of which is that it is not difficult to do a good deal * Cf. Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	, p. 28 : '' Thanks to them -LSB- the luini - narists -RSB- it is not possible for the worst of our modern land - scapists to use such distressing color as is to be found in the best of the Hobbemas and Cuyps and Ruysdaels of the sixteenth century . ''

		in identifying localities and seeing what a man has made of them .

		It must be allowed , however , that such a means runs easily into the descriptive or the historical , and this is
M. Michel	PERSON	's especial field ; indeed , his criticism is too often apt to lack artistic quality .

		He often speaks of the senti - ment or the idea of a painter , and often , too , of his technical means .

		But these things somehow fail to give one the painter 's quality .

		Velasquez , he says , '' is unique as a painter . ''

		Doubtless : but I at least feel the truth of this remark more on looking at the two pictures of the Villa Medici in the
Prado	LOCATION	, or rather at their reproductions , than `` by reading
M. Michel	PERSON	's criticism .

		But
M. Michel	PERSON	's position has been long known , and there is no reason why I should try to define it .

		His book certainly gathers together an immense amount that will delight any lover of landscape .

		In turning to the Impressionistic landscapists in
M. Duret	PERSON	's book , , one thing will be immedi - ately obvious of which the cause is significant .

		The pictures give by no means so pleasing an impression as those of the other book .

		In fact , some of the impressionist pictures look very childish , for instance , the '' Pay sage '' of
Cezanne	ORGANIZATION	, or one or two by
Monet	ORGANIZATION	.

		None of the pictures in
M. Michel	PERSON	's book look childish except the very early ones : even the pictures of some lesser-known Dutch painter , say
Van Goyen	PERSON	, do not look childish at all .

		The reason for this is as plain as the fact , and it is a characteristic matter .

		In the newer landscapists drawing is of less importance than some other things , for example , vibration ; and while drawing is something that can be well reproduced by a photograph , vibration can not .

		The means taken by the impressionists to gain by painting the especial effects that they desire are such as can not be reproduced in some totally different medium .

		You can not give a good idea of
Richard Strauss	PERSON	's orchestration on a pianola .

		In other words the impressionists are aiming at very different effects from the landscapists of earlier years .

		Even Constable ,
Crome	ORGANIZATION	,
Cotman	PERSON	, or
Rousseau	PERSON	,
Corot	LOCATION	,
Millet	LOCATION	, though acknow - ledged by the moderns to be great painters of landscape , did not have the same aims as the present .

		People now look in landscape for things very different from those which charmed preceding generations .

		They want form , com - position , values , as people always have ; but they also want , and want more , light , vibration , actuality .

		And these new elements in landscape are so potent that their presence or absence 464 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, outweighs all other things put together when it comes to quality .

		Hence the impressionist is indifferent to subject in so far as associations are concerned , or picturesqueness .

		He finds an ordinary hillside with a house on it as good a subject as a craggy precipice with a romantic old castle .

		In fact it is better as a subject ; for there will be no story or association to dis - tract attention from the light and the feeling of reality and the atmosphere which he wishes to give .

		There are many things in Nature , and when one is accustomed to her freshness and brilliancy , or her softness and delicacy , one is not satisfied by a number of other things which sometimes are not in Nature at all .

		Whether this is for the best or not , we need not discuss here .

		An understanding of the fact shows the difference between the impressionist landscape and every other landscape that has preceded it .

		The others may be beautiful , they often are , and a landscape that was beautiful in the time of
Giorgione	ORGANIZATION	will generally have preserved its beauty to-day , but the landscape beauty of to-day is something that the older masters did not think of .


M. Duret	PERSON	's book is on ''
Manet	PERSON	and the French Impressionists , '' and half the book is on Manet , who was not a painter of landscape .

		He was , however , often enough a painter of out-of - doors , and of his pictures here reproduced , Le Dejeuner sur 1 ` Herbe '' is quite as much of a landscape as the picture of Giorgione which inspired it .

		And whether landscapist or not ,
Manet	PERSON	was full of the feeling and ideal which afterward appeared in the pictures of
Monet	ORGANIZATION	and
Pissarro	PERSON	.

		So the whole book will be inter - esting to the student of landscape .

		As we have said , the impressionist landscapes do not always lend themselves to reproduction , but with this necessary drawback the book is handsomely illustrated with etchings , wood-engravings , and half-tones .

		It is an inspiring thing to read these books and get an idea of the beauty of nature as it has moved the genius of so many artists .

		If one read them this
Winter	DATE	, one will see more that is delightful next
Summer	DATE	, if not before .

		If
Thackeray	PERSON	and Du
Maurier	PERSON	had not l > een draughtsmen before they were writers , how much less might have been their success in the literary world !

		Although Mr.
Elihu Vedder	PERSON	repeatedly and unaffectedly disclaims all literary skill , his autobiography , the rich and varied record of his seventy-four years of going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it , painting the while as well as doing thousands of other things , is incomparably the most diverting book of the season so far as the season 's books have come to the present writer 's notice .

		`` The Digressions of V. , '' as the author humorously names his autobiographical recol - lections , may indeed occasionally remind some older readers of
Artemus Ward	PERSON	's familiar way of deserting the topic of his lecture to expatiate on sundry irrelevant matters casually called to mind , until the evening was found to have sped and the announced lecture had to be postponed .

		But it is with Mr.
Vedder	PERSON	as with Artemus : whatever the drift of his discourse , one could not possibly wish him to be talking about any - thing else in the world than just what is actually claiming his attention , and his listener 's .

		A bit of original verse on the half-title-page indicates the book 's purpose : `` Somewhat o'ershadowed by great names , A feeble plant he tries to rear ; It is not nourished by great aims Nor yet retarded by much fear ; His aims if any are but these , To be remembered and to please . ''

		The title-page itself sets forth the nature of what is to come , thus : '' Containing the quaint legends of his infancy , an account of his stay in
Florence	LOCATION	, the garden of lost opportunities , return home on the track of

New York	LOCATION	in war-time coinciding \ s itli that of the nation , his prolonged stay in

		THE DIAL 465 flash unseen , and waste its brilliance on the family air ; and therefore , faute de mieux , he decides to be his own
Boswell	PERSON	, and also to tell his story in plain and simple language .

		``
Apro	PERSON	- pos of hard words , '' he explains , '' I frequently tell of the Frenchman who disliked tomatoes .

		He said he was glad of it , for if he liked them , he would eat them whereas he detested them .

		It is the same with me in regard to hard words .

		I do n't like them ; luckily I know but few ; if I knew many more I would use them , whereas I detest them , or at least regard them with apprehension . '

		The author 's name is in itself enough to indi - cate his Dutch descent .

		Schenectady was the American cradle of his race , and its members intermarried to an extent that would now alarm the apostle of eugenics , but that then seems to have had no worse effects than the generating of strong , not to say idiosyncratic , characters in considerable numbers .

		One of these was a grandfather , or great-grandfather , of the artist , who never allowed his religion to give him a moment 's concern , because he knew his damna - tion or election was already irrevocably deter - mined , and there was no use in worrying .

		On the day of his death he took care to have the clock wound as usual , wound his watch , and announced that he was going to die at three o'clock .

		Had death failed to keep the appoint - ment he would have been much put out , says his grandson .

		It was in
New York	LOCATION	, however , not in
Schenectady	LOCATION	, that
Elihu	PERSON	, son of
Elihu	PERSON	and
Elizabeth	PERSON	-LRB-
Vedder	PERSON	-RRB-
Vedder	PERSON	, was born on the 26th of
February , 1836	DATE	.

		Of the various homes he knew in boyhood , on
Long Island	LOCATION	and in
Cuba	LOCATION	, as well as in
New York	LOCATION	and
Schenect	PERSON	- ady , and of the successive schools to which he was sent and where he was exposed to the more or less imminent danger of catching an educa - tion , and of all the pranks he engaged in and the narrow escapes he had from sundry sorts of violent death , there is no space here to tell .

		These things , with hundreds more , must be read in the writer 's own words and with the artist 's own drawings .

		A brief passage from an early page will show what bent was early given to his mind in religious matters .

		`` I am writing of long ago .

		At that time , as a matter of course , all good Christians quarreled among themselves , at least in
Schenectady	LOCATION	, but united most harmoniously in persecuting the poor Universalists .

		In
Schenectady	LOCATION	it was like the early days of the Church .

		We met almost furtively , and the windows of the humble little chapel were constantly broken by stones , thrown , sometimes , during the meetings .

		And all this because they , the Universalists , held that a good God would never create any one for endless torture . ''

		A few pages later he relates an ingenious but unanswerable question which he had put to an orthodox Sunday-school teacher , and which the latter could not answer without stultifying him - self or incriminating the Deity . ''

		My child , '' replied the teacher , '' you are too young to understand such things ; when you get older , all that will be explained . '' ''

		I am still wait - ing for the explanation , still too young , per - haps , '' adds the author .

		The turn that his artistic impulse later took toward the not infrequent representation of the weird , the gruesome , the shuddersome , may perhaps be partly accounted for by the follow - ing boyhood experience : '' In this quiet street there had been a very old grave - yard ; but progress , even in that quiet spot , had made its appearance , and it was decreed that the graveyard must be removed .

		And so it happened that I had a glimpse of an uncle that I had never known .

		Why I went , or who too * me , I have forgotten , but shall never forget what I saw .

		We had to go some distance out of town ; it was a cold day , under a gloomy sky , that we climbed the bleak hillside until we could see beneath us the ice-blocked river and the flooded , snow-covered flats fading away into the distance .

		From afar off , borne on the wind , came the tooting of a distant engine , a most desolate sound .

		At our feet , on the frozen ground , was a broken and decayed coffin with tne lid gone , and in it a tall skeleton to which clung bits of shroud that fluttered in the chilly wind , and this was , or had been , my Uncle
Uri	PERSON	.

		A strange meeting , indeed !

		And then back to the cheerful town and the warm fire - side leaving him out there alone . ''

		Strange and mysterious things were con - stantly occurring in the
Vedder	PERSON	family .

		For example , the mother , after having the time of her death predicted years before by a fortune - teller , and after the foolish augury had been aJl but forgotten by those interested in it , was actually taken ill at the appointed time and , through the carelessness of an aged doctor who forgot to prescribe a strengthening diet when the crisis was past , fell a victim to medical neglect and died of innutrition .

		The announce - ment of her death caused her son
Elihu	PERSON	to faint away , for the only time in his life , so deep and strong was his attachment to her .

		His art education , it is significant to note , was largely self - education .

		At the
Atelier Picot	PERSON	, in
Paris	LOCATION	, whither the young man betook himself in
1856	DATE	, '' the instruction consisted , '' as we read , '' in a little old man with a decoration coming twice a week and saying to each one of us , ' Pas mail Pas mail ' and going away again .

		But we got instruction from the older students , got it hot and heavy and administered in the most sarcastic way . ''

		Further , the author goes on : '' Who can tell of the workings of Fate or foretell anything ?

		Had I fallen in with some of the
American THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, students of Couture , I might have gone there and gotten over a faithful but fiddling little way of drawing which hangs around me yet , unbeknownst , ' or I might have said in later yean with a most talented friend of mine , ' I wish to God I could get rid of that cut-and - dried Beaux-Arts style . '

		All that is past remedy .

		I was only in
Paris	LOCATION	eight months , drawing from plaster easts , and left because
Rhodes	PERSON	left , and I wanted to see
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		And in
Italy	LOCATION	, the author tells us , so much Art burst into his unprepared mind that the result - ing confusion has lasted for the rest of his life . ''

		I studied by myself , '' he continues , `` and some - times wish I had n't , for my pictures always have to me a home-made air which I do n't like .

		I mean , they lack the air of a period or school , and this I say it seriously seems to me a great defect . ''

		Probably it is this very '' defect '' of unoonventionality , or originality , that his ad - mirers most like in him .

		While on this topic of theory in art , he adds : '' One thing I settled on that style should spring entirely from the subject , be appropriate to it and the time at your disposal , whether you were taking it by assault or by siege ; and my idea of the aim of Art was first to have an idea , and then from your expe - riences and the nature about you get the material to clothe it .

		In fact , take a soul and give it body ; this in my case has not been a cold-blooded plan of action , but merely the expression of my nature .

		I am not the discoverer of this idea , however . ''

		Contrasting his style as artist with his style as writer of his own life , the author remarks on the peculiar fondness he has for painting land - scapes with no figures , whereas in wandering through the hazy past he finds himself always writing about the figures and not about the landscape . ''

		Is it , '' he asks , '' because I have been so awfully bored by long descriptions of beautiful scenes and health-giving air which only the writer can afford to either see or breathe ?

		Or that
Nature	ORGANIZATION	is always in dead earnest , ex - cept in kittens and puppies ? ''

		Dead earnest is , happily , often absent from Mr.
Vedder	PERSON	's mirthful pages .

		Referring to one of his best-known works , he writes : I have been told by those in the trade that , as an illustrated book , the
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	has had a longer lease of life than any other book of its kind .

		I happen to know that it yet sells , and have reason for being glad of it .

		But I wonder why the book should sell .

		I am not alluding to the poem that will always sell ; but is there something wrong about the pictures something Tupperish that they should have been so popular ?

		A fearful thought .

		It can not be the drawing in them , for plenty of men I do not say can , but at least do , draw better ; therefore that can not be the attraction .

		They take the mind , perhaps ?

		or do they touch the heart ?

		Who knows ?

		The subject is too deep for me ; I give it up , yet I wonder if that getting at the heart or mind is not my proper trade after all , and if I had not better stick to it . ''

		Yes , it is getting at the heart , of the reader no less than of the picture-viewer , that is Mr.
Vedder	PERSON	's '' proper trade . ''

		In his book he ap - peals to the unspoiled human nature that i. - in us , and reveals himself as unmistakably human and large-hearted and lovable , generously en - dowed with desirable qualities from those sturdy and enterprising Dutch pioneers of the Mohawk valley , and richly possessed of all that comes to him who lives a long and full life worthily and well .

		Such scanty quotations and conden - sations as have been given above can convey no adequate notion of the charm of the author 's digressive narrative , and hardly a word has been said of the abundant and always character - istic and appropriate illustrations , which are sometimes reproductions of the artist 's more celebrated paintings , sometimes sketches made expressly for the book .

		There are many pecu - liarities in the cover-design , the title page , and elsewhere , that are eminently Veddt-n-sqiu ' .

		Scarcely ever , in fact , has a man put more of himself into his book than has this artist-author crammed into the generous bulk of '' The Digressions of V. ''

		THE NEWEST BOOK OF
PARIS	LOCATION	.

		* Disdaining to enter into competition with
Baedeker	PERSON	, the most recent author of a '' Book of
Paris	LOCATION	'' has undertaken the pleasant task in some such spirit as
Thackeray	PERSON	used in his `` Sketch Books . ''

		It is true that Mr.
Claude C. Washburn	PERSON	takes himself far more seriously than
Thackeray	PERSON	ever took himself ; and takes less pains to make sure his little asides are truly interesting .

		That is a mere detail .

		Both thr Victorian and the American write `` personal ' volumes .

		And the later-comer tells us , with perfect veracity , that ''
Paris	LOCATION	is not the subject of the book :
Paris	LOCATION	is only the medium . ''

		The subject is life : '' and whatever , good or bad , has any bearing upon life is found somewhere in its pages . ''

		It may sound unduly patron i/iu ; to hint that it is unfortunate that Mr.
Wash	PERSON	- burn has already given us his '' Book of
Paris	LOCATION	, '' instead of keeping it by him to rewrite , and delete , and enrich .

		Yet it is certain that in taste and in true knowledge of life he will in the years to come greatly increase , or at least PAGES FROM THR BOOK or
PARIS	LOCATION	.

Claude C. Wftshburn	PERSON	.

		With etchings and drawings by
Lector O. Hornby	PERSON	.

		THE DIAL 467 that is to be devoutly wished and hoped for .

		A travel-book of the conventional sort Mr.
Wash	PERSON	- burn is amply qualified to produce .

		It is only this fuller and more ambitious kind of writing that he is hardly '' up to . ''

		In feeling that Mr.
Washburn	PERSON	could have greatly improved his book and made it altogether good reading which it is not as it stands I judge , in part , by the intolerant common-sense of his `` exposure '' of so-called bohemianism ; by the delightful passage on the
Faubourg St. Germain	ORGANIZATION	; by the exquisitely humorous account of a motor-bus journey from
Montmartre	LOCATION	to the
Left Bank	ORGANIZATION	such a journey as my Uncle Toby himself might well have taken , in company with his diverting nephew , had he lived long enough to be shaken about in a motor-bus .

		If the `` Book of
Paris	LOCATION	'' were not , even as it stands , the most striking book recently published on the subject of so many books , I should not have been tempted to write about it at such length , and with so many qualifying phrases .

		As a matter of fact , it is when he almost succeeds in getting the better of his very troublesome self-consciousness that Mr.
Washburn	PERSON	interests his reader . ''

		Oh , for the poet great enough to convince us of the nobility and the glory of eating when we are really hungry ! ''

		he exclaims on a page that we could well do without .

		This is , in his own phrase , de la litterature : and not good litera - ture .

		Neither is what follows : `` We reserve the splendor of our verse for love ; but there is not half the high satisfaction in being in love that there is in dining well after a hard gallop over country roads .

		I know , for I have tried both . ''

		Too many such pages of the '' Book of
Paris	LOCATION	'' obscure for us , through their labored crudity and incorrigible dilettanteism , the real excel - lences of the book .

		Anatole
France	LOCATION	is , appar - ently , the writer 's hero among men of letters ; but , in spite of the '' Imaginary Interview , '' the deeper culture and the native wit of
M. France	ORGANIZATION	are not Mr.
Washburn	PERSON	's .

		This returned traveller generously spares us '' word-paintings '' of familiar monuments .

		He leaves the matter of illustration to his col - laborator , Mr.
Lester G. Hornby	PERSON	.

		This skilful young American suggests Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	fre - quently in his choice of subjects , rather less frequently , but rather more unmistakably , in his treatment of subjects .

		Some of the etchings and drawings which he includes in his part of the '' Book of
Paris	LOCATION	'' are no more than the promis - ing `` studies '' of an art-student en voyage .

		They want sureness of touch , and they suggest an absence of definite intention .

		But neither craftsmanship nor selectiveness are in every case absent .

		There are several effective street - scenes ; and in handling such unambitious com - positions as are strongest , after all , in '' human interest , '' or , at any rate , homely interest cabs at the cab stand , for example success in all things but originality is attained .

		And what is originality compared with sincerity ?

		In spite of his failure to spare us such messiness as blots his '' Old Passage , Palais Royal , '' Mr.
Hornby	PERSON	has already , when at his best , a certain delicacy both in impressibility and manner ; and a decided charm .

		The Book of
Paris	LOCATION	has often been written , and '' by eminent hands . ''

		It has been written and unwritten and rewritten and it has so far come no nearer completion than the catalogue of the
Bibliotheque Nationale	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yet when a writer of great opportunity , so far as '' elegant leisure '' goes , '' settles '' in
Paris	LOCATION	, how can he utterly fail to convey something of the city 's enduring charm ?

		NOTES OF A VETERAN PRINTSEL , L , EK .

		* The announcement of a book about the great engravers , from the pen of one who has acquired intimate knowledge of their works during forty years ' experience as a printseller , naturally arouses keen expectations .

		It is somewhat dis - appointing , therefore , to find Mr.
Keppel	PERSON	's at - tractively printed and profusely illustrated vol - ume not what its title would imply ; but instead that it is made up , for the most part , of articles originally contributed to popular magazines , lectures delivered before the
Grolier Club	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	, at
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	and elsewhere , and of what appear to be biographical sketches to accompany dealers ' exhibition catalogues .

		The article entitled `` The Golden Age of Engraving , '' from which the book takes its name , was first published in ''
Harper	PERSON	's
Maga	PERSON	- zine '' in
1878	DATE	, and has since been reprinted at least four times .

		All that Mr.
Keppel	PERSON	has to say about the line engravers and their works is contained in this and two shorter articles , the three covering only thirty-five pages , while nearly two hundred are devoted to etching and etchers , and seventy to other topics .

		If the book had been called `` A Veteran Printseller 's Notes about Famous Etchers and Engravers '' it would have been more aptly * THE GOLDEN AGE OF ENGRAVING .

		4t > 8 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, named .

		The author 's style is light and chatty , and his pages abound in anecdotes and entertain - ing reminiscences .

		Some of these stories , hav - ing been used to enliven more than one of the articles , reappear several times in the book be - fore us .

		Judicious editing might have elimin - ated some of the repetitions , and certainly would not have permitted the printing of the following comment upon Mr.
PennelTs	PERSON	work , on page 241 : '' Tli is impromptu spontaneity of Mr.
Peunell	PERSON	' a method carries with it one little drawback if it be a draw - back at all .

		It is , that in his architectural scenes what the French call the orientation is reversed : west is east , and east is west .

		In this he follows the precedent of both Kenibraudt and
Whistler	LOCATION	.

		The sole preoccupa - patiou of these masters was to produce a picture , and they cared not at all to provide a topographical plan of some stated locality . ''

		In the same article , the reader had already been told , on page 234 , that : This impromptu spontaneity of his method involves one little drawback if it be a drawback at all : it is that in his architectural drawing what the French call orientation is reversed ; west takes the place of east and south of north .

		But in this he follows the precedent of
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	,
Whistler	LOCATION	, and
Seymour Haden	PERSON	.

		The sole preoccupation of these masters was to make an artistic picture , and they cared nothing at all for observing the points of the compass . ''

		One of the most interesting of Mr.
Keppel	PERSON	's reminiscences takes him back to his first trip to
Europe	LOCATION	to buy prints . ''

		It did not take long for me to expend my little store of money , so I packed up my stock and engaged my passage to
New York	LOCATION	on a steamer which was to sail in a few days .

		The day following I learned that the greatest priutseller in all
Europe	LOCATION	could be found at number 109 , The Strand .

		I went there and read on the signboard the name of
Noseda	LOCATION	.

		I entered , inquired for Mr.
Noseda	PERSON	and learned that the head of the house was Mrs.
Noseda	PERSON	, an elderly widow .

		I was introduced to her and found that in spite of her Italian name she was a good cockney who had been born to the prosy name of
Jane Smith	PERSON	, and I perceived that when she spoke , the letter h was very uncertain in her vocabulary .

		I stated my business and said that I had spent all my money before I knew of her and her magnificent stock of rare prints .

		` It might be arranged , ' said Mrs.
Noseda	PERSON	, ` if you ` ave good
London	LOCATION	references . '

		Well , I had , and next day I took to her three letters of which I was quite proud . '

		What are these ? '

		said she .

		I answered that they were three letters from prominent
London	LOCATION	mer - chants , and that these letters spoke of me as being an honest and industrious young man .

		Mrs.
Noseda	PERSON	tore up the three letters unopened , dropped them into the fire , and said to me : * Now you may take anything and everything you like of my stock , and when you return from
New York	LOCATION	next year you shall pay me for them . ' ''

		To thin remarkable woman 's confidence in him Mr.
Keppel	PERSON	attributes his `` first real start .

		She was a pronounced '' character , '' and he relates several amusing anecdotes in which she figures .

		These are too long to be quoted here , but his description of her apparel is necessary to complete the picture of the first interview : '' Anyone ` seeing her in lu-r street attire -LRB- which was the same at all seasons and for long year * -RRB- was not likely to forget her .

		She generally wore a yellow gown : her hat was of the most outlandish and flamboyant British style , but it was her outer garment that made her unforgettable .

		It was a satin shawl of scarlet and yellow , in broad alternate stripes , and it could be seen in the street as far as human eyesight could reach . ''

		Mr.
Keppel	PERSON	's comments upon the artists about whom he writes , are , on the whole , sound and well-considered .

		He does not venture into the field of criticism , but confines himself almost wholly to biographical sketches , personal gossip , and generous words of appreciation of the artists ' finest works .

		Only now and then does he at - tempt comparisons , as in the case of Millet 's '' The Wood
Sawyers	PERSON	, '' which he rightly places far above the better-known '' Angelus '' in artistic merit .

		Occasionally his enthusiasm leads him to extravagant statement , as when he insists that etching can suggest all that -LCB- minting can .

		In the hands of a master , lines and light and dark masses can be made to suggest a great deal , but surely far less than all that it is possible for painting to present to the mind .

		This , however , is of little importance .

		The charm of a fine etching is not so much in what it suggests as in the harmonic arrangement of the lines and masses .

		Even the magic quality of touch is sec - ondary to the composition .

		Strange to say .

		art i > ts do not always keep this in mind .

		There arc etch - ings by
Whistler	LOCATION	that consist of petty details only , and are lacking in the general effect .

		For
Whistler	LOCATION	as an artist Mr.
K.-pp	PERSON	.

		1 has only unstinted praise ; and he devotes to him an essay on '' Whistler as an Etcher , '' and an article entitled `` One Day with
Whistler	LOCATION	. ''

		Both of these are very readable .

		The author , how - ever , makes one rather invidious and unmerited though perhaps unintentional distinction in mentioning Mr.
Howard Mansfield	PERSON	's descriptive catalogue of
Whistler	LOCATION	's etchings , published by the
Caxton Club of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, and the catalogue compiled by Mr.
E. G. Kennedy	PERSON	to accompany the portfolios of reproductions of the etc hi issued by the
Grolier Club	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		In saying that * Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	's book , in particular , is a monument of patient and intelligent lal > or '' it is probable that Mr.
Keppel	PERSON	meant only to praise the work of a rival pi - intscller .

		Imt the language used is most unfair to Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	, whose book is also the result of long and pains - taking research , and is the more complete of the two .

		The illustrations of this volume are of especial

		THE

		They consist of two hundred and sixty-two well-printed half-tone plates , chiefly reproductions of notable etchings and en - gravings , including most of the acknowledged masterpieces .

FREDERICK W. GOOKIN	PERSON	.

		HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS .

		i. BOOKS OF TRAVEL AND DESCRIPTION .

		The undying appeal of Palestine has been heard and heeded by Mr.
Robert Hichens	PERSON	, who , in a sumpt - uous volume entitled '' The Holy Land , '' illustrated from paintings by Mr.
Jules Guerin	PERSON	and from photo - graphs , conveys to the reader something of his delight in the scenes and characters there to be encountered .

		The mere sensuous charm of the region seems almost to intoxicate Mr.
Hichens	PERSON	. ''

		It is an Arcady of the
East	LOCATION	. ''

		he exclaims , '' and of a charm to me irresistible .

		Cares drop away , are lost among the innocent wild flowers ; fears , anxieties disperse on the gentle , cares - sing breezes .

		Far off , at evening , the little white tent will welcome you ; and as you see it in the distance , and your horse , lifting his head and distending his sensitive nostrils , neighs joyously , you will bless from your heart the nomadic life . ''

		After a chap - ter devoted to Baalbec and one to
Damascus	LOCATION	, the author takes us from
Damascus	LOCATION	to
Nazareth	LOCATION	, from
Nazareth	LOCATION	to
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, and from
Jericho	LOCATION	to
Bethle	LOCATION	- hem .

		An important chapter on
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, and another descriptive of the Easter ceremonies at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre , as viewed under rather trying conditions by the writer , close the book .

		Similar in character to Mr.
Hichens	PERSON	's work on ``
Egypt	LOCATION	and its Monuments , '' the book is of course a noteworthy product of the printer 's and the illus - trator 's art , as well as a glowing piece of writing .

		Vivid effects are present in abundance , both in the text and in the brilliantly colored pictures by Mr.
GueVin	PERSON	, who accompanied the author on his journey through Palestine .

		-LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Unfading is the charm of
Brittany	LOCATION	, and every fresh visit reveals some new phase or detail of that charm .

		Last year Miss
Frances M. Gostling	PERSON	told us much that was delightful about `` The Bretons at Home . ''

		and this year Mr.
George Wharton Edwards	PERSON	has produced an elaborate volume on ''
Brittany	PERSON	and the Bretons '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- illustrated both in color and in black-and-white by himself ; while Miss
Mary J. Atkinson	PERSON	, in a book entitled '' A Chateau in Brittany '' -LRB-
James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , gives her impressions of the country and its people .

		Mr.
Edwards	PERSON	, rambling extensively with Mrs.
Edwards	PERSON	in the byways of that unmodernized corner of
France	LOCATION	, has chronicled their wanderings in a style and with a variety of illustrative anecdote that can not fail to interest .

		Occasional passing mention of the ancient superstitions of the people as , for instance , their steadfast abstention from blackberries because they believe the crown of thorns was made of blackberry vines helps one to realize how far removed they are from the twentieth-century world about them .

		The author 's pictures are numerous , and their manner of execution is well adapted to the homely quaintness of their themes .

		So interesting are they that one could wish the accompanying reading mat - ter were more given to expatiating on or explaining their details .

		Miss
Atkinson	PERSON	's `` Chateau in Brit - tany '' is also the record of personal experience , and it takes its title from the comfortable villa , or farm-house , at
Dinard	ORGANIZATION	which she and her companions made their headquarters .

		The ways of the people , and the antiquities and legends of the country , with a sufficiency of historic reference , help to give variety to the author 's account of places visited and sights seen .

		Seventeen pictures from photographs are scattered through the book .

		If now the English - speaking tourist does not find himself already fairly familiar with the Bretons and their country before visiting them , it will not be for lack of agreeable and informing literature on the subject .

		To stand in the streets of
Pompeii	LOCATION	is to feel that '' nothing in its life became it like the leaving it . ''

		Never more than a second or third rate provincial town in its own day and generation , with no claim on the notice of its contemporaries in respect of art , letters , or men ,
Pompeii	LOCATION	through its death , burial , and resurrection has won for itself a charm unique and unrivalled in the world .

		Not until the nineteenth century was well on its way did we learn much of
Pompeii	LOCATION	as we see it to-day .

		Since then , not only picks and spades but pens have been busy , and
Pompeii	LOCATION	dead enjoys a fame never known by
Pompeii	LOCATION	living .

		The traveller finds no lack of guide-books , the scholar no lack of archaeological data ; but the average stay-at-home reader will de - light rather in the new and satisfying volume on ''
Pompeii	LOCATION	'' by Mr.
W. M. Mackenzie	PERSON	, published by Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	.

		The author 's aim is to reconstruct , often necessarily by suggestion or analysis only , the life of the old town , with suffi - cient explanation and account of the material to furnish a basis of actuality , or at least a general view , from different sides , of what
Pompeii	LOCATION	means .

		From what is now disclosed , much insight is gained into such features of Roman civilization as muni - cipal and domestic life , streets , trades , houses , deco - ration and art , public buildings and public amuse - ments , religion , temples , tombs , and monuments .

		It is somewhat unusual to find the name of the illustrator precede that of the author on the title - page of a book .

		That it does so in the present instance is only just to the artist ,
Alberto Pisa	PERSON	, who painted the twenty charming landscapes and archi - tectural groups that illustrate Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	's text .

		These are in full-page and fairly aglow with color .

		But , brilliant and striking as they are , only a person 470 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, who has never seen
Pompeii	LOCATION	in the Spring-time will consider them exaggerated .

		Mr.
Ernest Peixotto	PERSON	's qualifications for describ - ing and illustrating the attractions of his native State are a sufficient guarantee of the excellence of his '' Romantic
California	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Seventy illustrations from his hand are ably reinforced with descriptive matter giving the artist 's experiences and impressions in various parts of his vast and even yet not very well known
State	ORGANIZATION	, and in the
Farallones	LOCATION	.

		What may be called the old-world charm of
California	LOCATION	especially appeals to him , as do also the natural beauties of its less frequented spots .

		A chapter devoted to the `` Midsummer Jinks '' of the
San Francisco Bohemian Club	ORGANIZATION	in the redwood forest eighty miles north of the city , with some account of the recent
Grove Plays	ORGANIZATION	, is of un - usual interest ; as are also the chapters '' Through
Bret Harte	PERSON	's Country '' and '' The Farallones . ''

		The Spanish blood in Mr.
Peixotto	PERSON	's veins may at least partly account for the fondness in which he holds the history and the picturesque antiquities of this romantic land , and in expressing which his pen and pencil have vied with each other .

		The book has a pleasing cover-design in color and gilt ; elsewhere the artist confines himself to black-and-white .

		When , in wandering about
London	LOCATION	, you come upon a particularly quaint street , a square whose old houses have an unmistakable air of being historic , and whose little park speaks , somehow , of interest ing associations with by-gone days , then you long for a guide who is versed in all the rich tradition of the place , and who can tell you in detail its whole story .

		It is exactly this sort of thing that Mr.
James S. Ogilvy	PERSON	does for the reader in his volume entitled '' Relics and Memorials of
London	LOCATION	Town '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Ogilvy	PERSON	is a painter , with a taste for quaint pic - turesqueness and the lore of the past .

		In a former volume he painted and described bits of
London	LOCATION	'' City '' ; now he wanders over a wider area , search - ing not so much for beauty or architectural import - ance as for storied interest .

		But he finds beauty too , of a kind the
London	LOCATION	kind , as the fifty colored plates in this book testify .

		Lincoln 's Inn Fields and
Portsmouth	LOCATION	Street , Gray 's Inn , the neighbor - hoods of St.
Clement Danes	PERSON	and St Mary-le-Strand ,
Drury Lane	PERSON	,
Covent Garden	ORGANIZATION	,
Charing Cross	ORGANIZATION	,
Soho Square	LOCATION	,
Bethnal Green	ORGANIZATION	, these are a few of the many localities whose history Mr.
Ogilvy	PERSON	relates and whose traditions he has carefully sifted , finding his greatest difficulty to be the curious confusion of characters from novels or ballads with real people .

		The book is naturally too large to be used as a guide on the spots described ; but as preface or appendix to a
London	LOCATION	visit it would be difficult to find a more delightful volume .

		To Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	's '' American Highways and Byways '' series is now added a volume on `` The Rocky Mountains '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The au - thor 's camera has here , as usual with him , aided and abetted his pen with excellent effect More than sixty scenes from animate and inanimate nature , including human nature in divers types , are faithfully reproduced .

		Tin - fifteen chatty chapters of the book take the reader on a pleasant ramble through North and
South Dakota	LOCATION	,
New Mexico	LOCATION	,
Oklahoma	LOCATION	,
Colorado	LOCATION	,
Nebraska	LOCATION	,
Montana	LOCATION	,
Wyom	PERSON	- ing ,
Kansas	LOCATION	,
Texas	LOCATION	,
Utah	LOCATION	, and the
Yellowstone National Park	ORGANIZATION	.

		The cyclone cellar on the plains where the wind will blow the buttons off a man 's coat , besides doing more serious mischief , the I pioneer farmer holding the plough while his faithful helpmate leads the horse , and the fast-disappearing Indian tepee , with types of redskin humanity , are objects of interest to the author and to his readers .

		With tact and skill Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	secures from the natives much racy and informing talk on local mat - ters and on the history of the region , so that a large part of his narrative is printed in quotation marks and has the agreeably broken-up appearance of conversation .

		Professor
Oscar Kuhns	PERSON	, a lover of
Swit /	ORGANIZATION	.

		erland by virtue of his descent from Swiss ancestors and of
summer	DATE	vacations and several longer sojourns amid the Swiss mountains , is the author of an his - torical and descriptive volume entitled
Switzer	PERSON	- land : Its Scenery , History , and Literary Associa - tions '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Its strongest appeal is to the mountain-climber and the mountain-lover , abound - ing as it does in the adventures of famous Alpine explorers , in stories of landslides and other stirring incidents among the mountains , and in pictorial and verbal presentation of the glories and the sublimities encountered on every hand in this '' playground of
Europe	LOCATION	. ''


Edward Whymper	PERSON	's conquest of the Matterhorn in
1865	DATE	, with the fearful acci - dent attending that achievement , is well , though briefly , related .

		As the author has several times made
Geneva	LOCATION	his home , attending courses at the
University	ORGANIZATION	and making-excursions into the surround - ing country , he has had ample opportunity to possess himself of the spirit and traditions of the country .

		Illustrations , print , and binding are in keeping with the excellence of the reading matter .

		In these days when so many tourists consider a camera a necessary part of their equipment , there will be plenty of interested readers for such a book as Mr.
W. I. Lincoln Adams	PERSON	's '' Photographing in
Old England	LOCATION	, with Some Snap Shots in
Scotland	LOCATION	and
Wales	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	is editor of `` The Photographic Times , '' and manifestly is skilled in the taking of sun-pictures , as well as experienced in the art of sight-seeing .

		The des - criptive matter that divides his large pages with the beautiful views to which it relates , originally appeared in the paper which he edits , as did also the illustrations .

		Sixteen full-page plates are inter - spersed among the more numerous smaller pictures ; all are fine specimens of photography and of half - tone reproduction , though a few are credited to other cameras than the author 's .

		The scenes photographed lie chiefly along the Thames from
Windsor	LOCATION	to
Oxford	LOCATION	; in
Warwickshire	LOCATION	; in Devonshire : in the Lake Country : in
London	LOCATION	: in
Wales	LOCATION	ami
Scotland	LOCATION	;

		THE DIAL 471 and in various cathedral towns .

		A chapter of per - tinent advice to itinerant amateur photographers concludes the book . ''

		The Father of Waters , '' and the vast valley it drains , has proved a fruitful theme to Mr.
Julius Chambers	PERSON	in his large and profusely illustrated octavo , '' The
Mississippi	LOCATION	and its Wonderful Valley '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Since his first passage over the twenty - seven hundred and seventy-five miles of the mighty stream , from its source to the sea , the river has become to Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	a veritable enthusiasm , as he informs his readers ; '' dwellers along its banks have become his friends and associates ; mere towns when first known to him have grown into prosper - ous cities . ''

		Beginning with '' the era of fable , '' he sets forth in not too great detail about all that is known or knowable concerning the
Mississippi	LOCATION	in early times .

		In addition to the historic and the pic - turesque aspects of the river , its industrial or com - mercial importance is duly considered , one of the most interesting chapters treating of the proposed deep waterway for large steamers from
Chicago	LOCATION	to the
Gulf	LOCATION	.

		Views and portraits and maps in good number are scattered through the book , which in workmanship is worthy of its theme . ''

		Oxford and
Cambridge	LOCATION	, delineated by Hanslip Fletcher '' -LRB-
Wessels & Bissell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- presents in sixty-one large plates , and in an historical introduc - tion and other descriptive and historical articles by various competent writers , the beauties and the antiquities of the two venerable seats of learning in
England	LOCATION	.

		An agreeable change from the prevalent half-tone photographic picture is the hand-executed illustration of Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	.

		Some of his work is in pen and ink , while other examples appear to be wash-drawings of some sort ; but all are executed with wonderful minuteness of detail and also with excellent general effect .

		The various colleges are adequately represented , and the descriptive matter is in each instance contributed by a fellow or other member of the college in question ; while the Registrary of
Cambridge	LOCATION	writes the general intro - duction , in which most readers will find much that is new to them and interesting .

		The book is dur - ably , flexibly , and neatly bound .

		The leisurely and book-loving traveller in War - wickshire and
London	LOCATION	could find few better com - panions for his wanderings than Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	in his long since famous work , ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's
England	LOCATION	. ''

		The gradual outgrowth of a number of visits to the old country , the book took its present name and something of its present form in
1888	DATE	, and under that name '' it has passed through more than twenty-five printings , '' as the author , with pardonable pride , announces in his preface to a new and still further enlarged edition , handsomely published by Messrs.
Moffat	PERSON	,
Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Incidentally , this new issue has a personal or biographical interest from the author 's endeavor , '' while eliminating repeti - tions , to express , wherever essential , the different moods and emotions awakened , in the same ob - server 's mind , by different visits to the same place . ''

		Thirty-one views from photographs supplement the text and please the eye .

		A striking memento of the
San Francisco	LOCATION	earth - quake and fire comes from the publishing house of
Messrs. Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is in the form of a volume , quarto size , of heavy brown paper , the right - hand pages serving as card-board mounts to beauti - fully tinted photographs of the ruined and of the resurgent city , and the left-hand pages bearing verses inspired by the accompanying views . ''

		The brown tint of the illustrations matches the brown paper upon which the book is printed , and the objects photographed are chosen with an artist 's eye .

		The metrical accompaniment , pitched in a minor key of tender regret , is pleasing and appropriate .

		The volume is stoutly bound in buckram and boards .

		A series of handsome volumes dealing with '' Beautiful England '' has been undertaken by
Messrs. Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Ernest W. Hasle	PERSON	- hust furnishes the colored illustrations , and Messrs.
Edward Thomas	PERSON	,
Walter Jerrold	PERSON	,
A. G. Bradley	PERSON	,
Canon Danks	ORGANIZATION	, and others write short and chatty descriptions of the places and buildings represented .

		The six volumes now ready are entitled '' Oxford , '' `` The English Lakes , '' `` Canterbury , '' ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	- Land , '' `` The Thames , '' and `` Windsor Castle . ''

		Not as formal guide-books , but rather as dainty souvenirs of scenes visited or read about , will these agreeable volumes prove their worth .

		The freshness of first impressions and the inti - macy of family letters are combined in Mrs.
Agness Greene Foster	PERSON	's `` By the Way '' -LRB-
Paul Elder	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which is made up of '' travel letters written during several journeys abroad , describing sojourns in En - gland ,
Scotland	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	-
Hungary	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	, and European and
Asiatic Turkey	LOCATION	, '' with many illustrations from photographs .

		The book is really a new edition , with added letters on
Germany	LOCATION	,
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	, and
Turkey	LOCATION	, of a little volume published seven years ago .

		An '' Index of Places , with name of hotel or pension '' and an `` Index of Authors and Books Mentioned '' have also been added .

		Six deservedly popular books of travel , which have appeared within the
last two or three years	DATE	, are now offered by the publishers ,
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	, in new editions of attractive appearance and moderate price .

		Two are by Mrs.
Anna Bowman Dodd	PERSON	: `` Falaise , the Town of the Conqueror / ' and '' Three Normandy Inns . ''

		Mr.
Henry C. Shelley	PERSON	is also the author of two volumes : '' Untrodden English Ways , '' and `` Literary By-Paths in
Old England	LOCATION	'' ; and the remaining two are Mr.
Samuel Adams Drake	PERSON	's ''
New England Legends and Folklore	ORGANIZATION	in Prose and Poetry , '' and Miss
Lilian Whiting	PERSON	's ''
Italy	LOCATION	, the Magic Land . ''

		All the volumes are attractively illustrated , and boxed ; and all deserve , in their new and popular-priced form , a large ac - cession of readers .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, HOI.II - w KDITIOXS OP STANDARD LITERATUBE .

		Highly elaborate and wholly in harmony with the spirit of the poem is the artistic accompaniment prepared by Mr.
Willy Pogrfny	PERSON	for `` The Rime of the Ancient Mariner '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The text itself , in a rather profusely ornamented black-letter , with initial letters of more or less intricate design , and with a generous use of colored scroll-work , presents the appearance of an illuminated manuscript It is , we infer , from the same hand that executed the many illustrations , mostly in color , that fill about half the volume .

		Weird , fantastic , and gruesome are some of the artist 's conceptions , while others have a lightness and grace difficult to describe .

		Like delicate water-color paintings , with here and there a suggestion of
Turner	ORGANIZATION	in the treatment of shimmering ocean or haze-enveloped ship , these more airy productions are of the very stuff that dreams are made of , even as the others are trans - lated nightmares .

		Each page has both marginal decorations of elaborate pattern , and also , running over the page , a faintly-tinted design wherein crawling things and snake-like vines have much to do .

		The albatross is skilfully worked in as an occasional ornamental feature .

		The front cover , the half-title , and the title-page are splendid with gilt and scroll-work and rich colors .

		A page of Latin from
Thomas Burnet	PERSON	's '' Archaeologise Phil - osophicie '' effectively precedes the poem , and a part of the Lord 's Prayer , likewise in
Latin	LOCATION	, follows it .

		Without question , this is the most elaborate and the most beautiful edition of the '' Ancient Mariner '' ever published .

		In sumptuous form , beautifully printed on heavy paper , and lavishly illustrated in color , with other decorative features ,
M. Joseph Bedier	PERSON	's version of the Tristram and Isenlt legend makes its appear - ance in an English translation from the pen of
Miss Florence Simmonds	ORGANIZATION	.

		< -LRB- The Romance of Tristram and Iseult '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- in its present version forms a very readable love story , told in modern phrase but with much of the naive manner of the original frag - ment from the hand of Beroul .

		To the translation of this fragment -LRB- about 3000 lines -RRB-
M. Bexlier	PERSON	added from various sources , or supplied outright , what was necessary to make a complete and connected narrative .

		In a brief introduction to the work
M. Gaston Paris	PERSON	says : `` The element which attracted the French romancers in the story and tempted them to clothe it in the consecrated form of octosyllabic verses , in spite of all its difficulties and obscurities , was the element which secured the success of their undertaking and gave an unprecedented popularity to the legend as soon as it became familiar to the Romano-Germanic world : the idea of the fatality of love , which raises it above all laws .

		This idea , incarnated in these two exceptional beings , is the more sympathetic to the hearts of men and women here , because it is purified by suffering and sancti - fied by death . ''

		The colored pictures by
M. Maurice Lalau	PERSON	are in harmony with the romance , and the English translation is admiral.lv smooth and just enough tinctured \ \ ith archaism .

		It is one hundred and forty years .

		since -LRB- iolil - smith 's `` Deserted Village '' first appeared , in a quarto of thirty-two pages , with a steel engraving on the title-page .

		Subsequent editions , three of which appeared within little over a month of tin - first issue , are of course too numerous to mention : but the quarto reprint , copiously illustrated both in color and in black-and-white by Mr.
W. Lee Hankey	PERSON	, published in this country by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead iv Co.	ORGANIZATION	, has merits , artistic and typographical , belonging to few if any of its predecessors .

		In forty colored plates and about as many uncolored drawings the artist has well caught the spirit of the poem and reproduced its homely rural scenes and characters .

		With few exceptions the coloring of the plates is subdued enough to be natural and pleasing , and the drawing is excellent A short introduction by '' T. S. '' gives the circumstances attending the writing and publishing of the poem , with a few contemporary estimates of its merits .

		To lovers of
Goldsmith	LOCATION	, no more acceptable gift of its kind could be presented .

		Mr.
Edmund Dulac	PERSON	has once more been fortunate in securing exactly the right material on which to exercise the magic of his art The Sleeping Beauty and Other Fairy Tales '' have been freely translated from the Cabinet des Fees by that sym - pathetic raconteur of old stories , Sir
Arthur	PERSON	-LRB- ^ uiiler - Couch , who also contributes a charming preface about the Cabinet des Fees and
Perrault	PERSON	and
Madame de Villeneuve	ORGANIZATION	, authors of the four tales here chosen from its mine of riches .

		Mr.
DulacVnew	PERSON	pictures have a touch of drollery like those he made for the '' Arabian Nights , '' more than a touch of the romance and mysticism of his '' Rubaiyat '' illustrations , and a fairy-like daintiness and delicacy of design and coloring that is all their own .

		They are , of com - .

		beautifully reproduced .

		The text is handsomely printed on wide-margined pages of fine proportion , and the binding is tasteful and of appropriate design .

		Miss
Mitford	ORGANIZATION	's and
Anna Maria Hall	PERSON	's rural sketches are drawn upon for two holiday books '' Sketches of English Life and Character '' and `` Tales of Irish Life and Character , '' both with the McClurg imprint The first is ascribed to Mai \ I - ; .

		Mit - ford , author of ` Our Village . '' '

		Of course
Mary Russell Mitford	PERSON	's `` Our Village '' is a well-known work , and the natural inference that these revamped `` Sketches '' are taken therefrom is found to be correct : but there has been such jumping about among the five original series of the work , with not too scrupulous retention of the original titles , as to make identification rather difficult Why the book could not have been published as a selection from '' Our Village , '' rather than as by the -LRB- misnamed -RRB- author of `` Our Village , '' will puzzle the plain reader , who will also be perplexed by the lack of connection between the reading matter and the '' six - teen reproductions from the paintings of
Stanhope A. Forbes	ORGANIZATION	,
A. R. A.	PERSON	'' The pictures are pleasing .

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 473 however , and rural in theme .

		They are all hrightly colored .

		The '' Tales of Irish Life and Character , by Mrs.
S. C. Hall	PERSON	, '' are chiefly selected from Mrs.
Hall	PERSON	's '' Sketches of Irish Character , '' a work now about eighty years old and probably not unworthy of a revival .

		In this instance again , the colored `` re - productions from the paintings of
Erskine Nicol	PERSON	, R.S.A. , '' have no close reference to the text which they adorn .

		But the two volumes make pretty picture-books , and the reprinted sketches have not spoiled with age .

		It was a happy thought that sent Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	with his camera to
Walden Pond	LOCATION	to pro- cure illustrations for a new edition of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's best-known book .

		`` Walden '' appears in the same handsome form as '' Cape Cod '' and '' The
Maine Woods	PERSON	, '' from the hands of the same illustrator and the same publishers -LRB-
Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Thirty-three full page views , not only of
Walden	LOCATION	in different aspects and the site of
Thoreau	PERSON	's hut , but also of memorable spots in the village of
Concord	LOCATION	, are scattered through the volume .

		A short introduction by Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	gives , among other information , the ultimate fate of the hermitage , of which no good picture seems to have been available for the present edition of `` Walden . ''

		Both for those that have and for those that lack '' a pretty good supply of inter - nal sunshine , '' this record of a two-years ' cheerful solitude , spent in simple labors of the body and healthful exercises of the mind , will always be in - vigorating reading . ''

		To read well , '' says
Thoreau	PERSON	in the book under discussion , '' that is , to read true books in a true spirit , is a noble exercise , and one that will task the reader more than any exercise which the customs of the day esteem . ''

		If the humor of the '' Pickwick Papers '' needs any bait to tempt present-day readers , it is provided in Messrs.
Hodder & Stoughton	ORGANIZATION	's reprint , wherein are to be found some of the
Club	ORGANIZATION	's adventures , under the title '' Mr.
Pickwick	PERSON	: Pages from the
Pickwick Papers	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The book is rather bulky to read from , but this disadvantage is offset by the large clear type .

		And whoever takes it up merely to look at the pictures will shortly find himself too much amused by them not to dip into the story .

		Mr.
Frank Reynolds	PERSON	is the artist .

		His humor is more genial than that of the early illustrators , and a large page and the use of color give him an excel - lent opportunity to depict his conception of the Pickwickians , their friends , and their experiences in a fashion at once telling and decorative .

		Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	's `` Collected Verse '' the author 's own selection of the work by which he wishes to be finally represented is the basis of a handsomely-made holiday volume with illustrations by the English colorist , Mr.
W. Heath Robinson	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's imagination is peculiarly difficult to match pictorially .

		It demands boldness both in coloring and conception ; and the
fall	DATE	from the interestingly grotesque to the mere absurd is easy .

		Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	attempts everything the singing souls of the `` jolly , jolly mariners , '' the Explorer insane in the desert ,
Tomlinson	PERSON	gripped by a spirit hand , the '' Ford o '
Kabul River	LOCATION	'' with its floating dead .

		All the pictures are interesting , but many give most strongly the impression of being attempts at the impossible .

		`` Tom
Sawyer	PERSON	'' needs no commendatory word from the reviewer 's pen .

		Nevertheless the new edition issued by the Harpers , with sixteen excellent illustrations by Mr.
Worth Brehm	PERSON	, is so attractive that it can not be passed over in silence .

		Tom him - self is admirably conceived by the artist , who shows him to us in some very convincing attitudes , whitewashing his Aunt Polly 's fence , showing off before the blue-eyed , yellow-haired girl in
Jeff Thatcher	PERSON	's garden , relating his adventures to a spellbound circle of admirers , and so on .

		But there is one detail in the first-named picture that is wrong : the fresh whitewash from Tom 's brush is represented as beautifully and brilliantly white , whereas every whitewash artist knows that the white shows only after the wash is dry .

		But Mr.
Brehm	PERSON	may plead artistic license ; and his good work in other respects has earned him our indulgence .

		Browning 's ''
Pippa	PERSON	Passes '' and the group of lyrics called '' Men and Women '' are brought to - gether in a small clearly-printed volume in flexible leather binding , with ten colored illustrations by
Miss E. Fortescue Brickdale	ORGANIZATION	.

		The poems included under the title '' Men and Women '' are not limited to the final grouping of the author , but include the much larger selection issued under that title in
1855	DATE	. ''

		In a Balcony , '' however , has been omitted , because it was republished in a separate form by the author .

		The pictures , if we mistake not , appeared originally in an octavo edition of these poems , a few years ago .

		The volume contains a wealth of poetry , and is issued in an artistic and durable form , suited to the book-shelf or the pocket .

		-LRB-
Hough ton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The continued popularity of
Eugene Sue	PERSON	's '' Mysteries of
Paris	LOCATION	'' is attested by the handsome two-volume edition issued this Fall by
Messrs. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a reprint from the original English version published by
Chapman	PERSON	and
Hall	PERSON	, and seems to have the original illustrations nine spirited drawings in each volume .

		Together with '' The Wandering Jew '' and
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's '' Les Mise ` rables , '' this story will long be read by lovers of old-fashioned French romance in its elaborate and somewhat sensational form .

		That the author was strongly convinced of the high moral purpose actu - ating his literary labors , appears in an interesting foot-note to the eighteenth chapter .


Bret Harte	PERSON	's characteristic story of `` Salomy Jane '' is issued in a tastefully illustrated and decor - ated edition by the regular publishers of
Bret Harte	PERSON	's works ,
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Harrison Fisher	PERSON	and Mr.
Arthur I. Keller	PERSON	have illustrated the tale most attractively , especially captivating being the former 's conception of the heroine .

		Among the season 's moderate-priced gift-books this has both in matter and embellishment rather unusual distinction .

		474 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS .

		That enthusiastic Bostonian , Miss
Mary Caroline Crawford	PERSON	, follows up her `` Old Boston Days and Ways '' with another glowing tribute to the undying .

		hai m of the
American Athens	ORGANIZATION	.

		In her '' Roman * tie Days in Old
Boston	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- it is the nineteenth century that she chiefly confines her - self to in recalling the interests and activities of a
Boston	LOCATION	that , though irrevocably past , will endur - ingly survive in literature and tradition and in the permanent influence for good that she exerted on the country at large .

		Merely to name some of the topics selected for treatment by this well-informed writer such topics as the Brook Farm experi - ment , the real
Zenobia	PERSON	, the slave as a hero , the words and deeds of
Wendell Phillips	PERSON	and
Theodore Parker	PERSON	, the old
Boston	LOCATION	theatres and their stars , old - time hostelries , the great fire , some famous visitors and how they were entertained , and
Boston	LOCATION	as a literary centre will give a notion of the book 's strong appeal to readers - of the right sort . ''

		Though of the present generation ,
Miss Crawford	PERSON	has friendships and memories -LRB- her own or trans - mitted to her -RRB- that enable her to write with more than a scholar 's command of her theme .

		The un - usually numerous and interesting illustrations in the book constitute one of its chief attractions .

		It is indexed , and runs to four hundred pages of most inviting reading matter .

		Steering a middle course between the seriousness of history and the frivolity of fiction , Mrs.
Jean Lang	PERSON	's substantial volume entitled `` A Land of Romance : The Border , its History and Legend '' -LRB-
Dodge Pub ' g Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- brings together a large amount of matter interesting to readers of Sir
Walter	PERSON	, as also to students of
Scotland	LOCATION	's antiquities and the vicissitudes of her eventful history .

		Beginning with the building of the Roman Wall , the author passes on to the coming of
Arthur	PERSON	, then to the spread of Christianity northward to that wild borderland , and after that treats of the border wizards .

		Monks and monsteries , the struggle for independence in the days of
Wallace	PERSON	and
Bruce	PERSON	, raiders and robbers , the ill-fated
Mary Queen of Scots	ORGANIZATION	, border feuds , the Covenanters , bonnie Prince
Charlie	PERSON	, and finally a chapter on `` Sir
Walter	PERSON	's Day , '' referring to the good old time when the
Laird	PERSON	of
Abbotsford	LOCATION	was alive , such are , in brief , the remaining contents of the book , which is adorned with six photogravure illus - trations from paintings by Mr.
Tom Scott	PERSON	An ap - propriate poem in six stanzas , by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, precedes the first chapter and prompts the inference that '
Jean Lang	PERSON	'' is none other than Mrs.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	.

		Not to be dismissed without commendation is the handsome typography of the book .

		A new series -LRB- the third -RRB- of '' Where Ghosts Walk , '' by Mrs.
Terhune	PERSON	-LRB- `` Marion Harland '' -RRB- con - tinues those pleasant sketches of bygone folk of bygone days , as recalled by visits to their familiar haunts .

		The '' Ghosts '' of the new volume are English , with a sprinkling of French dames and gallants for variety .

		The visits paid to storied spot * are casual tourist 's wanderings ,
Imt	ORGANIZATION	inspired by a definite purpose and backed by thorough prepara - tion .

		One of the most entertaining -LRB- sketches is that about the Ladies of
Llangollen	LOCATION	, the eccentric pair of eighteenth-century friends who forsook the gay world to live together in the wilds of
North Wales	LOCATION	.

		The mansion that they made out of a cottage is now stored with interesting relics of their tenantry , in - cluding journals , correspondence , and expense-books , whose items , quoted at length in the narrative , are both entertaining and enlightening .

		Two portraits , a photograph of their faithful maid , views of their house and of their tombs in the parish church-yard serve as illustrations to this chapter .

		The little Duke of
Gloucester	LOCATION	at
Twickenham	LOCATION	, Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	at
Penshurst	LOCATION	,
George Herbert	PERSON	at
Bemerton	LOCATION	,
Joan	PERSON	of Arc at
Chinon	ORGANIZATION	, and
Marie Stuart	PERSON	at Am - boise are among the other subjects , in the treatment of which historical anecdote is pleasantly mingled with lively personal recollections of the scenes in which the dramas of great lives were set -LRB-
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons . -RRB-

		It would be difficult to write a dull book about
Rosa Bonheur	PERSON	.

		Virile , energetic , original to the verge of eccentricity , generous to a fault , absorbed in her art and holding a unique position among artists , withal a delightful and copious letter - writter , she provides an almost ideal subject for biographical study .

		Mr.
Theodore Stanton	PERSON	's `` Reminiscences of Rosa Bonheur '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is , as far as possible , a first-hand record of the artist * personality as shown in her letters , and of her friends ' and contemporaries ' impressions , in many cases offered expressly for Mr.
Stanton	PERSON	's use .

		Mr.
Stanton	PERSON	furnishes the missing links in the chain of continuous narrative , besides exercising much .

		skill in sifting and arranging his documentary material .

		Many portraits and a number of reproductions of
Rosa Bonheur	PERSON	's paintings enhance both the human and the artistic interest of the volume , which runs .

		always entertainingly , to the proportions of a stout octavo .

		Mr.
Stanton	PERSON	's picture is that of a very genial , very independent woman , with a keen zest for life , an intense interest in only one thing , and a serene carelessness of public opinion except where it touched her paintings .

		The Friendly Library '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is enriched this season by two inviting little books , beautifully printed and bound , and neatly boxed .

		One of them .

		`` The Book of Friendship , '' is tastefully illustrated by Mr.

Samuel McChord Crothers	PERSON	.

		The selections , in both prose and verse , are wide-ranging , culled from novels , plays , poems , the
Bible	LOCATION	, juvenile fiction , and published correspond - ence , all conveniently divided into sections headed `` Childhood Fi i. Midships . '' ''

		Inarticulate Friend - ships .

		- In School and College Days , '' `` Neigh - bors , '' and so on .

		THE DIAI , 475 hand that of Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	.

		Bits of informal letter-writing are selected from the immortal letter - writers , and a number from less famous sources are added .

		A few unpublished fragments , mostly anony - mous , are also included .

		The whole , besides being good reading , forms an excellent guide and model to the would-be graceful and witty and friendly letter-writer .

		An agreeable book for all lovers of
George Eliot	ORGANIZATION	has been written by Mr.
Charles S. Olcott	PERSON	. ''

		George Eliot : Scenes and People in her Novels '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- treats of the circumstances attending the writing of her successive stories and novels , with appro - priate illustrations from photographs .

		The original scenes and characters utilized by her are once more brought to our notice , and occasional critical remarks are introduced , both original and quoted .

		The chapter on '' Romola , '' that scholarly effort of painstaking historical and antiquarian research , runs to a length and to a warmth of commendation rather out of proportion to its merits as a work of fiction .

		In a chapter devoted to the quasi-matrimonial rela - tions between
Marian Evans	PERSON	and Mr.
Lewes	PERSON	, the writer says that the two '' decided to live together as husband and wife , and to make the mere announce - ment of their determination suffice in lieu of the usual ceremony . ''

		What about that nuptial cere - mony on the continent , which , as we have been glad to learn on apparently good authority , was resorted to as the best available substitute for a regular English marriage ?

		The book closes with a readable chapter on `` The Womanliness of George Eliot '' Miss
Helen Keller	PERSON	's unrhymed poem in irreg - ular metre , which first appeared in '' The Century Magazine '' under the title `` The Song of the Stone Wall , '' is now issued in book form with eight pictures from photographs representing the author amid rural surroundings , the wall also appearing in most of the views .

		The rough irregularity and enduring strength of the old wall , rudely built of field stones , are to some extent typified by the un - conventional pattern of the poem , while the fresh - ness and vocal sweetness of the woods and meadows through which the wall runs breathe again in the thought and feeling of the verses .

		The dedication is to
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	; '' for he loved the old walls and the traditions that cling about them , '' and he was himself `` the living embodiment of whatever was heroic in the founders of New En - gland . ''

		Decorative borders add a finishing touch to this handsome volume .

Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr. and Mrs.
Robert Shackleton	PERSON	's '' Adventures in Home-Making '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- will delight and inspire all enterprising persons who either do n't own homes or find those they do own hopelessly ugly .

		There is no use in living in a house you do n't like , aver the Shackletons cheerfully , and then proceed to produce their evidence : photographs of the very ugly one they bought , and of the charming abode into which , with comparatively small expenditure of money but with plenty of time and thought , they transformed it .

		How to remove '' ginger bread '' decorations , alter partitions , let in windows , take out superfluous doors and stairs , snatch charming banisters , mantels , and cupboard doors from the wreck of half-demolished houses , and transform the doors into wall-paneling , how to be everlastingly on the watch for the right things , to picture in imagin - ation just what you want and then get it , even to a secret stairway , this is what the
Shackletons	PERSON	did ; and they describe the process in all its practical details , even to the sordid one of dollars and cents .

		The '' Adventures '' extended to porches , barn , gardens , useful and ornamental , and lawns ; so that a variety of interest is assured .

		There are pictures of all stages of the game of home-making , the fascinations of which , in spite of multitudinous detail , are never lost sight of .

		A vivacious , even a tempestuous great lady was ''
Bess of Hardwick	PERSON	, '' whose life is entertainingly chronicled by Mrs.
Maud Stepney Rawson	PERSON	.

		Thrice married to a great title , lady-in-waiting to Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	, friend of
Mary	PERSON	of
Scotland	LOCATION	, - to whom her last husband , the
Earl of Shrewsbury	ORGANIZATION	, long acted as jailor , vain , romantic , passionately fond of power and exercising a great deal of it ,
Elizabeth Countess of Shrewsbury	ORGANIZATION	is an extremely picturesque figure .

		Among '' her children , her friends , her buildings , her household gods , her intrigues , and her dazzling dreams , '' she moves , always dominating , often in - scrutable , generally thorny , but never uninteresting .

		Her copious correspondence is largely drawn upon to add personality and local color to the pages of Mrs.
Rawson	PERSON	's volume .

		Numerous family portraits at once illustrate and embellish the text .

		-LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Of such value to photographers and to artists in general did Mr.
Sadakichi Hartmann	PERSON	's chapters on '' Landscape and Figure Composition '' show them - selves to be on their appearance in '' The Photo - graphic Times '' that they are now collected and issued , with some revision and enlargement , in book form , together with the numerous illustrations origin - ally accompanying them .

		Occasional diagrams are used to make clearer the author 's remarks on com - position , and the tone of his instruction and exposi - tion is throughout so little technical or otherwise difficult that a mere beginner or even a general reader without artistic pretensions can follow him with ease and pleasure , as also with profit .

		Both celebrated paintings and views from nature are used in illustration , and though often the scale is too small for the best effect , the author 's purpose is fairly well served .

		One , two , and even three illus - trations appear on a page , usually with some read - ing matter ; but the page is of generous propor - tions .

Byam Shaw	PERSON	, and others , and is likely 476 THE DIAL to appeal strongly to the lovers of folk-lore and of stirring tales of heroes and adventurers .

		Younger readers of fairy-tales will be a little daunted by the book 's apparatus of introductory and explanatory matter , by the glossary and index , and by the metri - cal passages , sometimes not inconsiderable , from both earlier and later sources .

		Yet older readers will profit by these helps to the understanding of the myths and legends , and younger readers will grow to their appreciation .

		The book covers well a certain age of fable with which every English - speaking person should be familiar .

		Local color , a dash of dialect here and there , swinging metres , .

		and spirited illustrations , many of them in the hues of nature , or an approximation thereto all this and more is to be set to the credit of the volume containing Mr.
Joseph Mills Hanson	PERSON	's `` Frontier Ballads '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		The twenty-five poems in the book are about evenly divided into > oldier Songs , '' `` Prairie Songs , '' and `` River Songs , '' of which the last two sections please us more than do the tales of violence and bloodshed .

		In `` The Engineer of the ` Golden Hind ' '' we make the acquaintance of a second
Jim Bludsoe	PERSON	who heroically runs his blazing craft ashore , and then has done with engines for good and evermore ; and in ''
Jesus Garcia	PERSON	, '' a similar character in the person of a Mexican railway engineer thrills the spell - bound reader .

		Mr.
Maynard Dixon	PERSON	has furnished the drawings , which begin on the front cover of the book and run through the volume in a manner both realistic and decorative .

		The holiday season would scarcely be complete without Mr.
Ralph Henry Bar	PERSON	hour 's annual tale of young love and happiness . ''

		The Golden Heart '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is the title of his latest offering .

		The heroine 's eyes are of a sparkling blue , the hero 's of a soulful brown ; she keeps a tea-room and gift-shop , he rows a skiff and paints pictures ; and as the tea - gift establishment stands at the water 's edge , what more natural than a meeting and love at first sight ?

		After that nature is allowed to take her course .

		But , incidentally , the author , in personifying Nature , makes her masculine , against which one must pro- test .

		The colored illustrations by Mr.
Clarence F. Underwood	PERSON	are very pretty , and they catch the spirit of the little romance , while the marginal sketches and other decorations by Mr.
Edward Stratton Holloway	PERSON	lend an attractive touch to this attractive book .

		Fire and passion , tears and pathos , the hunger for affection and the sweetness of reciprocated love are mingled in due proportion in the fascinating Japanese tale entitled '' Tama '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- by
Onoto Watanna	PERSON	, author of '' The Wooing of Wistaria , '' `` The Heart of Hyacinth , '' and other successful stories .

Harrison	PERSON	KMu-r ' x studies in feminine beauty is issued by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a volume entitled '' A Garden of Girls . ''

		Its spacious pages are marginally deco - rated by Mr.
Theodore B. Hapgood	PERSON	, and tint her filled with appropriate verses of an amorous nature .

		mostly from early and later English poets .

		A crit - ical eye can not fail to note the mutilation and altera - tion of
Donne	ORGANIZATION	's little poem , '' The Message , '' which is blunderingly ascribed to -
John Bonne	PERSON	. ''

		Certain of the girls have their charms not exactly heightened by the hideous headgear of the day , but other '' IM the costumes are only less fetching than the bright eyes and rosy cheeks of their wearers .

		A good old-fashioned love-story in verse is pre - sented in '' A Hoosier Romance '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	, with colored and other illustrations from the skilful hand of Mr.
John Wolcott Adams	PERSON	, and with a tinted decorative design embellishing each page of print .

		The troubled but finally triumphant course of a true love , against which a harsh and miserly father makes unsuccess - ful opposition , is related in Mr.
Riley	PERSON	's well-known manner , the climax of the tale being an ingenious variation of the elopement episode and the speedy tying of the nuptial knot .

		The book is tastefully bound and boxed .

		Three hundred and thirty-seven thousand copies of Mrs.
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	's ' Rebecca of Sunny - j brook Farm '' -LRB- Houghton -RRB- have been sold since its I first publication
seven years ago	DATE	.

		This \ ve It-am from the '' Publisher 's Note '' to the new illustrated holiday edition of the charming story .

		A colon - 1 frontispiece by Mr.
F. C. Yohn	PERSON	shows
Rebecca	PERSON	seated by Mr.
Cobb	PERSON	's side on the old stage-coach , and there are eight other illustrations from photo - graphs of scenes in the play so successfully made out of the story .

		The stage
Rebecca	PERSON	contrasts strongly with the stage-coach
Rebecca	PERSON	, and in other respects the theatre pictures are not quite what might best have interpreted the simple tale ; but the book is sure to please as a handsome holiday issue of a deservedly popular work .

		Folk-lore as it is found among tin vanishing aborigines of the far
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	is presented in Miss
Katharine Berry Judson	PERSON	's '' Myths and Leg - ends of the
Pacific Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, especially of Wash - ington and
Oregon	LOCATION	'' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		Effort is made to relate the simple legends as the Indians tin ins .

		l \ t ^ told them , though of course not in their tongue ; and of course this means the reproduction of much that is childish and primitive in thought ami expression but all anthropologically significant even though devoid of literary charm .

		Of unusual beauty are the full-page views of natural scenery , and also interesting are the photographs of Indians and of their wares .

		The large form of the Look cond-i ` miteS to the effectiveness of these numerous illustrations .

		THE DIAL 477 A handsome volume of '' Stories of the Spanish Artists until Goya '' -LRB- that is , including Goya -RRB- , by Sir
William Stirling-Maxwell	PERSON	, `` selected and ar - ranged by
Luis Carreno	PERSON	, with introduction by
Edward Hutton	PERSON	, '' is published in this country by
Messrs. Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Fifteen great artists of
Spain	LOCATION	, beginning with
Morales	PERSON	in the sixteenth century and ending , not with
Goya	ORGANIZATION	, but with
Cean Bermudez	PERSON	, who survived
Goya	ORGANIZATION	by a year , are chosen for biographical and anecdotal and more or less critical treatment , from contemporary records , with a sufficient reproduction , sometimes in color , of examples of their work .

		The book is of handsome appearance and sure to please the art-lover and the student of art-history .

		It is published in the '' Art and Letters Library , '' forming a companion volume to those already devoted to Italian , Flemish , Dutch , English , and French artists , respectively .

		Selections in prose and verse -LRB- chiefly the latter -RRB- on the subject of friendship have been brought to - gether by
Miss Ina Russelle Warren	ORGANIZATION	to form `` A Book of Friendship '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , which is published in a style befitting the theme .

		A frontispiece and marginal decorations give an artistic finish to the book , whose broad pages are graced with the praises of that '' golden thread that ties the hearts of all the world '' from the pens of various writers , from
Marcus Tullius Cicero	PERSON	to Mr.
George Sylvester Viereck	PERSON	.

		An author-index and a title-index facili - tate the finding of any given selection .

		An especially appropriate souvenir of the holiday season has been prepared by Mr.
Walter Tittle	PERSON	.

		`` Colonial Holidays : being a Collection of Contem - porary Accounts of Holiday Celebrations in Colonial Times '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- is so elaborately illustrated and illuminated by the compiler that the reading matter , except such part of it as is ornamentally en - grossed on a gilded background , is quite cast in the shade .

		Divers passages from old chronicles and letters and diaries have been studiously hunted up and brought together so as to furnish , together with the pictures , some adequate conception of how our ancestors , whether Puritans or Cavaliers , celebrated the festive season .

		Nor is it Christmas and New Year 's alone that are treated by the compiler ; Thanksgiving Day ,
May Day	DATE	, royal birthdays , and other glad occasions receive due attention .

		Mr.
E. S. Rait	PERSON	has felt moved by the studies he undertook for the '' Victorian History of the Coun - ties of
England	LOCATION	'' to edit a much smaller work on `` English Episcopal Palaces -LRB- Province of
Canter	PERSON	- bury -RRB- , '' which is issued in this country by
Messrs. James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A staff of six contributing writers has prepared short historical and descriptive sketches of the archiepiscopal and episcopal palaces within the province of
Canterbury	LOCATION	, embellished with fourteen portraits , and with a frontispiece portrait of Sir Thomas More ; but not a single one of the palaces is pictorially represented , except in the cover-design .

		The book , however , will please those interested in English church history .

		THE SEASON 'S BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG .

		The following is a list of all children 's books published during the present season and received at the office of THE DIAL up to the time of going to press with this issue .

		The titles are classified in a general way , and brief descriptions of most of the books are given .

		It is believed that this list will commend itself to
Holiday	ORGANIZATION	purchasers as a convenient and trustworthy guide to the juvenile books for the season of
1910	DATE	.

		Two of the six are now printed for the first time ; the other four have previously seen the light in different quarters .

		One of the titles is `` Johnson wit limit
Boswell	PERSON	, '' a thing difficult to imagine , but justified by the essay itself .

		Volume X. of the '' Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society '' comes to us from
Messrs. Williams & Norgate	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are ten papers in all , dealing for the most part with general and highly abstract themes , although two philosophers
Kant	PERSON	and
M. Bergson	PERSON	come in for specific attention .

		A new anthology , '' The Englishman in
Greece	LOCATION	, '' is announced by the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has been compiled by Mr.
H. S. Mil ford	PERSON	, and among the poets whose work is given are several living authors .

		Sir
Rennell Rodd	PERSON	, one of these poets , contributes an intro - duction .

		The book is a companion volume to `` The Englishman in
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Arthur Spurgeon	PERSON	's now familiar utterance on '' The Premature Cheapening of Copyright Books '' - being one of the most important papers read at the
International Publishers ' Congress	ORGANIZATION	which met at Am - sterdam last
Summer	DATE	is reprinted in handy pamphlet form , together with the English '' Publisher 's Cin u - lar 's '' comment thereon , by
Messrs. Cassell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		English Tragicomedy : Its Origin and History , '' by Dr.
Frank Humphrey Ristine	PERSON	, is a publication of the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	, done in the regulation aca - demic fashion , with notes and bibliographies .

		A Har - vard production of the same well-defined type is Dr.
William Alfred Morris	PERSON	's monograph on '' The Frank - pledge System , '' published by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


Paul Johann Ludwig Heyse	PERSON	, the veteran poet and novelist who has just been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature , is probably best known to the American public through his play ''
Mary of Magdala	PERSON	, '' which Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	translated and Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	produced some years ago , and his novel '' Children of the World '' which in its English translation has gone through several editions .

		Six volumes have recently been added to Messrs.
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	* '' Memorial Edition '' of
George M-iv	PERSON	< lith 's works : `` The Tragic Comedians , '' `` Diana of the Cross - ways , '' '' One of our Conquerors , '' '' Lord
Ormont	PERSON	and his Aminta , '' '' The Amazing Marriage , '' and '' Celt and
Saxon	PERSON	. ''

		This instalment completes the tale of the novels , leaving only the short stones , essays , and poems to complete the edition , besides a volume of bibliogra - phical material .

		`` The Vineyard '' is the title of a little monthly magazine recently started in
London	LOCATION	which sets for itself the ambitious task of cultivating `` every thing that has proved essential in the real progress of man . ''

		Its more specific purpose is to fortify the ancient love of the earth , alike for its spiritual and economic value . ''

		In this wholly commendable aim we wish '' The Vine - yard '' all success .

		Its contents are pleasingly varied and interesting , and its physical make-up inviting .

		Mr.
A. C. Fifield	PERSON	is the publisher .

		An authorized biography of the late
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	is in preparation by her daughters , Mrs.
Laura E. Richards	PERSON	and Mrs.
Maud Howe Klliott	PERSON	.

		and will be published next year by the
Houghton Mifllin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In order that nothing may be lost from the record of Mi - .


Howe	PERSON	's activities of many years , the authors request the loan of letters and characteristic notes that may be use - ful for the purposes of the biography .

		Communications
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 483 may be addressed to Mrs.
Laura E. Richards	PERSON	,
Gardiner	PERSON	,
Maine	LOCATION	.

		All material sent will be promptly copied and returned to the owners .

		The authors will also be grate - ful for any personal anecdotes or reminiscences of Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	.

		Early this month the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		are planning to publish a collection of Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's later poems entitled '' At Sunset , '' upon which she was engaged at the time of her death .

		They were written mostly during the last eleven years , many of them for notable public occasions . ''

		The Cost of
Our National Government	ORGANIZATION	, '' very appro - priately sub-entitled '' A Study in Political Pathology , '' is a volume by Professor
Henry Jones Ford	PERSON	, now pub - lished by the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		It contains the
George Blumenthal	PERSON	lectures for
1909	DATE	, revised and amplified for presentation to the reading public .

		The recognition and diagnosis of a pathological condition must necessarily precede curative measures , and the case now under discussion is sorely desperate , but we have no great hopes that the heroic remedies needed will ever be applied .

		A volume of seven '' Essays and Studies by Members of the
English Association	ORGANIZATION	, '' collected by Mr.
A. C. Bradley	PERSON	, is published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Henry Bradley	PERSON	leads off with a study of '' English Place-Names , '' and Mr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	follows with a paper '' On the
Present State	ORGANIZATION	of English Pronunciation , '' which -LRB- the state -RRB- we violate no confidence in saying that the writer finds discouraging .

		The five remaining essays are upon subjects as varied as
Blond Harry	LOCATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Browning	PERSON	, and
Carlyle	PERSON	, with a pleasant essay by Mrs.
Edith Sichel	PERSON	entitled '' Some Suggestions about Bad Poetry . ''

		Altogether , the collection makes very good reading .

		Mr.
Cobden-Sanderson	PERSON	announces the early publica - tion of three new volumes from
The Doves Press	ORGANIZATION	, com - prising :
Browning	PERSON	's ''
Dramatis Persona	ORGANIZATION	?

		, '' printed from the first -LRB- 1864 -RRB- edition ; ''
Pervigilium Veneris	PERSON	, '' edited , rearranged , and supplemented by Professor
J. W. Mackail	PERSON	; and ''
Laudes Creaturarum	PERSON	, '' by St.
Francis	PERSON	of
Assisi	LOCATION	, in the Latin text with
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's trans - lation .

		During the coming year Mr.
Cobden-Sanderson	PERSON	hopes to issue the following : Goethe 's '' Die Leiden des
Jungen Werther	PERSON	, '' from the
Weimar	LOCATION	text ; `` In
Prin	PERSON	- cipio , '' the first chapter of Genesis in the Authorised Version ; '' A Decade of Years , '' poems by
Wordsworth	PERSON	, 1798-1808 ; and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's `` Anthonie and
Cleo	PERSON	- patra , '' in the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	text .

		A posthumous work of
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	's , being a translation of
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's `` The Temptation of St.
Anthony	PERSON	, '' is published by the
Alice Harriinau	PERSON	Com - pany of
New York	LOCATION	and
Seattle	LOCATION	.

		An illuminating preface by
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's biographer , Mrs.
Elizabeth Bisland Wetmore	PERSON	, gives interesting personal reminiscences of the making of the translation , which belongs to the early period of '' Cleopatra 's Night '' and newspaper work in
Cincinnati	LOCATION	and
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Wetmore	PERSON	dilates also upon the spiritual fitness of
Hearn	LOCATION	for interpreting what is considered by many to be
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's masterpiece ; and she adds something about
Flaubert	PERSON	and the tremendous , passionate effort that went into everything he wrote .

		Hearn preceded the translation by a brief '' Argument '' ; in both is to be found the subtle , sensitive , exquisite quality of style which marks all his work .

		The trans - lation is complete save for a few unessential paragraphs , which
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	intended to treat as addenda , and which the publishers have thought better to omit entirely .

London Daily Graphic	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` The work , like everything the author writes , is a contribution of value , and peculiarly interesting because of the characteristically personal note it strikes . ''

		Scotsman , EXTRACT FROM THE PREFACE .

		Ever since the close of the nineteenth century a difficulty has been felt about the utili - zation of the Old Testament for teaching children .

		Nor has conviction of the truth of the cardinal doctrines of the New Testament been quite unshaken .

		So much has had to be modified or discarded , in deference to scientific discoveries which are in process of popular assimilation , that a hesitating cautious attitude is not only reasonable but meritorious .

		In so far , however , as my own researches have led me to perceive a profound substratum of truth underlying ancient doctrines , and in so far as the purpose of them instead of underlying actually illustrates and illumines use of these , I con - ceive it to be my duty as well as my privilege to indicate to the best of my ability how matters stand .

THE AMERICAN ACADEMY	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was a year ago that the American Acad - emy of Arts and Letters made its formal appearance before the public .

		The place was
Washington	LOCATION	, and , besides the regular sessions of the organization , there was a reception by the President of the
United States	LOCATION	, which in a way symbolized the newly-assumed public char - acter of the organization .

		Application was made to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	for a national charter , and the bill for that purpose is still pending .

		It passed the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, but did not obtain from the
House	ORGANIZATION	the '' unanimous consent '' necessary for prompt action .

		Some members objected because their own pet measures could not gain this concession , and one or two others because they could not discover in the membership of the Academy any representatives of , say ,
Arkansas	LOCATION	or
Oklahoma	LOCATION	.

		We trust that this was only a temporary post - ponement of action upon a subject that can not possibly be affected by any political interest , and is of some concern to the higher life of the nation .

		Last week , the second public meeting of the Academy was held , this time in
New York	LOCATION	, and in connection with the larger
National Institute of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Letters , from whose membership academicians must be elected .

		The sessions were dignified and impressive , fully justifying , if that were necessary , the existence of the two organizations which jointly represent the best that
America	LOCATION	can offer in literature and scholar - ship , in music and the arts of design .

		Even the newspapers were somewhat less irreverent 506 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, than they usually are in dealing with anything that even remotely suggests
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's saving `` remnant , '' did not make as many jocose remarks about '' immortals '' as might have been expected , and in general treated the meeting quite seriously .

		Those who were pres - ent felt that they were witnessing the begin - nings of a movement having much potentiality for good , and likely in the future to play a considerable part in our national life .

		A year ago , we published a list of the members of the Academy as it then was constituted .

		There have been a few deaths and a few elections since that time , but the list remains substanti - ally the same .

		One of the sessions of last week was devoted to the reading of commemorative papers upon the members who have died during the last five years or so , and the roll is one of which any body and any country might well be proud .

		In literature , the names included were those of
Stedman	PERSON	,
Clemens	PERSON	, Hay ,
Norton	PERSON	,
Aldrich	PERSON	,
Jefferson	LOCATION	,
Gilder	PERSON	,
Schurz	LOCATION	,
Harris	PERSON	, and
Hale	PERSON	.

		In music and the fine arts there were the names of Mac Do well ,
Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	, McKim ,
Ward	PERSON	, and Homer .

		Since the plans for this session were made , three other academicians ,
Moody	ORGANIZATION	, La Farge , and Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	-LRB- the only woman member -RRB- have gone over to the majority .

		It must be a lasting inspiration to the organi - zation to know that these men once adorned its ranks , as well as a spur to those living to make themselves as worthy as possible to occupy the vacated places .

		The sessions pf last week were held in the New Theatre -LRB- generously given for the occasion -RRB- and were gracefully presided over by Mr.
William Dean Howells	PERSON	, as President of the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	, as Pres - ident of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	.

		The papers which were read were upon a high level of thought , and struck with proper discretion , but without undue forcing , the American note .

		The last-mentioned characteristic was noticeable in the afternoon session of
December 8	DATE	, when music , poetry , fiction , and sculpture were respectively repre - sented by Messrs.
Walter Damrosch	PERSON	,
Percy Mackaye	PERSON	,
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	, and
Lorado Taft	LOCATION	.

		The morning session had been occupied with more abstract and philosophical themes , '' Criticism , '' by Mr.
William Crary Brownell	PERSON	, `` The Revolt of the Unfit , '' by President
Nicholas Murray Butler	PERSON	, and `` The Living Past in the Living Present , '' by Mr.
Henry Mills Alden	PERSON	.

		All these papers will appear in due time in the Proceedings of the organiza - tions concerned .

		The first paper of all must have a word to itself .

		It was entitled `` A Retrospection , '' and was read by the venerable
John Bigelow	PERSON	.

		The paper itself was a page of racy reminiM .

		- n. .

		from the author 's life in
Paris	LOCATION	in the early sixties , but the interest it aroused on its own account was greatly exceeded by interest in tin personality of the reader .

		That wonderful old man , now in his ninety-fourth year , brought the whole audience to its feet when he stepped for - ward upon the platform , and the prolonged applause which his appearance evoked was heart-felt and sincere .

		His voice was low but distinct , and he spoke with a degree of anima - tion suggestive of anything but senility .

		In him , the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	boasts of a member who comes close to being an `` immortal '' in the literal sense , and he gave a new turn to an ancient jest when he began his remarks by saying : '' You 'd scarce expect one of my age to stand in public on a stage . ''

		Second in interest only to Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's contribution to the programme was the Shake - spearian reading given by Dr.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	, that veteran scholar who bears his years so lightly , and wears his honors with such unaffected simplicity .

		`` King Henry the Fifth '' was the play chosen for the reading , and those who knew the play best felt that they were viewing it in a new light through the medium of the reader 's skilfully modulated voice and occasional suggestive commentary .

		Not the least noteworthy incident of the meeting was the bestowal of the gold medal of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	upon Mr.
James Ford Rhodes	PERSON	, declared by a plurality of votes to be the most worthy among living American historians to be awarded this distinction .

		The closing act of the public exer - cises was provided by a formal reception given by the Mayor of
New York	LOCATION	in the Lenox Li - brary .

		When the end of the entire programme was reached , the members regretfully dispersed , most of them feeling , we think , that it was good to have been participants in the affair .

		It was all very skilfully managed , and its temper was happily voiced by the President of the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	when he said : `` The academies of
France	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	,
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	, and other European countries have un aiitiioritati \ i * position which we do n't pretend to .

		We do n't hope to shape American art and letters , hut our aggregation will make for a higher standard in American art and letters .

		Each of us feels the molecular stir of universal activity .

		The purpose of our organization is to relate itself to the testhetic life of tin * nation .

		\ \ < lia \ r a ri ^ lit to remain in this organization because we hope that we can help others to do something more important than we have done ourselves . ''

		THE DIAL 507 ANATOLE
FRANCE	LOCATION	.

		Did some prevision of worthiness stir within
Jacques Anatole Thibault	PERSON	when he chose for pseu - donym the name of his country and became
Anatole France	LOCATION	?

		If so , time has justified his temerity ; for now , at sixty-six years of age , the author of some twenty-seven works , and member of the Academy , he is certainly the most interesting and perhaps the most remarkable figure in the literary life of con - temporary
France	LOCATION	.

		Furthermore , his fame and his books have begun the crossing of boundary lines , translations are growing abundant , and one sees `` Anatole
France	LOCATION	'' in the lite ` rary journals almost as often as the names of the popular novelists .

		When a foreigner comes to
America	LOCATION	, we have an unfortunate habit of saddling him with a compari - son : he is the
Hearst	ORGANIZATION	of
Italy	LOCATION	, or the
Roosevelt	PERSON	of
Illyria	LOCATION	, or the boss of
Madrid	LOCATION	.

		A foreign author must be labelled forthwith ; hence many an un - offending Belgian or Russian has Shakespeare or
Mark Twain	PERSON	stamped upon him for the American market .

		No one denies the usefulness of the prac - tice , but in certain cases it may be unfortunate .

		We have greeted
Anatole France	PERSON	as the
Sterne	PERSON	of his native country .

		The comparison is particularly un - happy .


Sterne	PERSON	was a sentimentalist :
France	LOCATION	is as unsentimental as
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.

		Sterne played upon the foibles of human nature :
France	LOCATION	attacks human nature itself .

		There seems to be no possible resem - blance between the two writers unless in their like mastery of wit and of style , a resemblance which scarcely justifies an exchange of names .

		If
France	LOCATION	must be compared to an Englishman , let it be to Swift .

		Swift turned his generation into pigmies , and so made fun of them ; he made his ideas of better men into giants , and so cudgelled his contem - poraries with Brobdingnagian strokes ; he embodied his ideals in the form of a horse , and so cast scorn upon the unideal .

		Just so
Anatole France	LOCATION	trans - forms his Frenchmen into penguins that he may ex - pose their frailties , saints into fools that he may reflect upon saintly wisdom , and beloved stories into analyses of human folly .

		By all means call him the Swift of
France	LOCATION	, if you must compare ; but the truth is more interesting than any approximation .

		After the comparison-mongers , two other recep - tion committees have waited upon the reputation of
Anatole France	LOCATION	.

		They are the slightly contemptu - ous and the entirely objective schools of criticism .

		The first make no bones of the matter .

		France lashes the church , lashes the state , lashes morality , lashes human nature .

		Believing in nothing himself , he is as destructive as a steam-shovel .

		Therefore he is a satirist without a standard , an intellectual dilet - tante , and thus very dangerous .

		The objective school is more gentle .

		For them ,
France	LOCATION	is a wit , a stylist , and a consummate master of irony .

		His fundamental beliefs or disbeliefs can go hang .

		What do they care about his dilettanteism so long as he amuses them !

		Both schools , I believe , are wrong .

		The accusers on the grounds of dilettanteism were nourished , one may suppose , upon '' Le Crime de
Sylvestre Bonnard	PERSON	, '' and have cherished opinions , thus conceived , to apply them where they do not be - long . ''

		Sylvestre Bonnard '' is an old book .

		It was crowned by the French Academy in
1881	DATE	, and has been popular ever since , as witness my own copy , bought in
August , 1909	DATE	, in
France	LOCATION	and of the one hundredth and ninth edition .

		When you read it , a strange sense of familiarity comes over you , mingled with a stranger sense of novelty .

		The familiarity is easily explained .

		The book is an idyll , a prose idyll of the kind the French have always done so well .


Sylvestre Bonnard	PERSON	, the scholar , sits in his
City of Books	ORGANIZATION	far above the
Paris	LOCATION	quays and looks down upon the world below .

		After awhile he ven - tures out into that world .

		First , it is when a young wife has the temerity to become a mother in the neighborhood of his scholarly retreat ; again , it is in a wild pursuit of a manuscript , to
Sicily	LOCATION	and back ; most decisively , however , when he joins battle with custom and law in an attempt to save from misery the daughter of a woman he had once loved .

		With , as hero , the most charming and gracious scholar who ever lost the world for a book , this is sufficiently idyllic .

		But Sylvestre is somewhat different from the '' professor '' who usually represents the faculty in literature .

		True , he is unworldly , as that figure always is .

		True , he distrusts his imagination , and is aware of the cramping of his heart .

		But Bon - nard remains a hard-headed intellectual from cover to cover .

		He exhausts the thirteenth century , yet in the droop of his age one finds him , no truant to knowledge , at work upon the society of the flowers and the bees .

		In brief , this book is an idyll of the intellectual life , the most intractable of materials for idyllics ; and hence its curious novelty .

		It is made up of the reflections of the world upon the mirror of the intellect .

		If it has a moral , it teaches how to get pleasure from one 's mental life , and thus is indubitably a study in intellectual dilettanteism .

		But I believe no one called
France	LOCATION	a dilettante when he published ''
Bonnard	PERSON	. ''

		With so gentle a book , there was no need for name-calling .

		And yet satire was latent there .

		Hamilcar , who purred upon his cushions in the City of Books , could some - times show his claws ; and so could the author of ''
Sylvestre Bonnard	PERSON	. ''

		Old
Bonnard	PERSON	got his wished - for manuscript through the woman with the baby ; for she was a collector of rarities too of rare match-boxes with photographs of notabilities on the covers , and so of course could sympathize with his scholarly pursuit .

		There was a claw shown !

		Indeed , though
Bonnard	ORGANIZATION	passes with a Nunc Dim - ittis upon his lips , he does not utterly die .

		He is reincarnated in the spirit of the later Anatole , more vigorous , more knowing in the world and less fond of it , quite willing now to test
Paris	LOCATION	and the world with his intellect , sure that if they be found wanting his intellect will still remain to console him .

		It is this later
Bonnard	PERSON	, disillusioned and done with his r , o THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, idyll , who wrote '' L'lle des Pingouins , '' and lias been called an intellectual dilettante for doing so .

		`` The hie of Penguins '' was probably not the greatest book of its year -LRB-
1908	DATE	-RRB- , but it was perhaps the most interesting , and certainly the most remarkable .

		It begins with a faithful if somewhat satiric repre - sentation of an early saint of the kind which those who read the saints ' legends know .

		The blissful Mal had been accustomed , like all the early mis - sionaries , to navigate in a trough of stone ; but , tempted by the devil , he foregoes the miracle and takes to a boat .

		The evil boat , taking the wind in its teeth , flies far down into the Antarctic , and there lands the blissful .

		Mad .

		weary , half blind with spray , upon a little island , where sit a colony of penguins .

		The holy man mistakes them for savages , blesses them , and , believing that the chorus of quackings with which they respond to his voice indicates a desire to be saved , instructs them in the faith , and baptizes each one with a drop of pure water upon his head .

		Then the pontiffs , the doctors , and the saints in Heaven are thrown into a horrid confusion .

		What has been the effect of this unfortunate bap - tism ?

		Is it the form or the spirit of the sacrament which counts ?

		If it is the form , here is a pretty pickle !

		The debate goes to the formalists ; and God , to save an embarrassment for what if the Penguins , having no souls , should sin and be damned ?

		transforms the birds to men .

		Then the isle of the
Penguins	ORGANIZATION	is towed by miracle to the
Breton	LOCATION	shores ;
Penguiny	ORGANIZATION	becomes
France	LOCATION	, the rise of the Penguins the rise of our modern civilization .

		But the Penguins , though men in shape , at first are but animals in intelligence .

		It is an opportunity for their facile historian who , with searching irony and infinite wit , leads them through the courses of sophistication .

		One views in their bare nakedness the origin of sacred institutions . ''

		Do you not see , '' cries the ancient Mael , '' this furious
Penguin	PERSON	who bites the nose of his fallen adversary , and that other who pounds the head of a woman with a great stone ? '' ''

		I see them , '' answers
Bulloch	PERSON	, his fellow monk .

		They create law ; they found property ; they establish the principles of civilization , the basis of society , and the foundation of the
State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The age of myth appears , with its dragon , who is ex - posed as a most vicious fraud , but remembered by the Penguins as a most awful reality .

		And so one passes through the notable twists and turns of French history wherein man is shown to be always ridiculous , incapable , vain , and lewd ; where woman is sensual , and the cause of wickedness and wars ; where great events happen from little causes , and the Penguins as men are often more ignoble than as birds .

		Finally , the story looks to the future . ''

		Houses could never be built high enough ; they raised them ceaselessly , constructing thirty or forty stories upon which were placed offices , stores , and banks ; while , beneath , the earth was dug more and more deeply for cellars and tunnels .

		Fifteen mil - lions of men worked in the giant city . ''

		But life had become too monotonous , too hard for happi - ness .

		A young man , who felt that this society had passed its usefulness , harnessed radium , and in a series of mighty explosions wrecked the giant city .

		Anarchy followed , and gave rise to decadence .

		The city died , and was buried beneath pastures .

		A pastoral people wandered over the site .

		They founded villages .

		The villages became great towns .

		These united into a vast capital .

		It grew rich and vast , until '' houses could never be built high enough : they raised them ceaselessly , constructing thirty or forty stories upon which they placed offices , stores , and banks ; while , beneath , the earth was dug more and more deeply for cellars and tunnels .

		Fifteen millions of men worked in the giant city . ''

		And thus , with the recurrence of a melancholy cycle , the book ends .

		The school of the contemptuous and the school of the objectivists view this story in different fashions ; and to them is added a third school with still a third point of view .

		This last group is the most positive of all .

		The book is bad , they say , morally bad , and so wash their hands of further criticism .

		One must admit , in fact , that the English lady who found ''
Antony	PERSON	and Cleopatra '' '' so unlike the home-life of our dear queen '' would be shocked by '' The Isle of Penguins , '' seriously shocked .

		But it is doubtful whether she would not be more shocked still by
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's '' Candide . ''

		The two books be - long upon the same shelf .

		Who should read them and who should not , is a nice question , the answer to which I leave to divines .

		I wol not han to do with such matere . ''

		The contemptuous say that `` The Isle of Pen - guins '' is dangerous politically , because it advocates the destruction of a society which has failed in the pursuit of happiness and therefore advocates anarchy ; that it is dangerous for religion , since its attitude is completely negative as regards religion itself , but most positive in its abuse of the accom - paniments of the Christian religion ; that it is dangerous morally , since it adopts the anthropologi - cal explanation of our morals , and traces result ^ which , if sometimes ludicrous , are terrible to con - template ; and that , though pessimistic , it is com - pletely flippant in tone .

		They charge the author with attacking everything while believing in no - thing ; and maintain , finally , that the book as a whole is dangerous because it is irresponsible .

		The particular charges I admit ; the general .

		I deny .

		Anatole
France	LOCATION	does believe in something : he believes in intellectuality .

		The force of his attack upon humanity betrays some interest in th < > body attacked , even as Swift 's brutal onslaught proved that he felt his enemies to be worth chastis - ing .

		One does not analyze the weaknesses of tin - French character for four hundred pages , with con - tempt of the species as the only motive .

		The writer must at least assume an intellect sufficiently intflli - gent to appreciate attacks upon itoelf , and worthy to be written for !

		An ingenuous youth atadinm-r given to
France	LOCATION	in the Argentine Republic de - clared that the writer had bestowed upon the young
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 509 men of the republic a new conception of life .

		Surely the books this youth had read were positive as well as negative .

		And they are so , all of
France	LOCATION	's satiric books .

		They apply the test of intellectuality , or of the intellectual life , to the world , and then discourse of the reactions .

		The author has a standard of criticism and a basis for his satire .

		He is like his Colomban , who seems to stand for
Zola	ORGANIZATION	in the
Penguin	LOCATION	's version of the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	case .

		Colomban , a short-sighted , hairy little man , alone of all the Penguins can apply reason to the affair of the alleged traitor .

		When he sees the truth , he acts upon it ; and in spite of abuse , bruises , slander , threats , advances the banner of reason against the hosts of unreason and prejudice .

		When he is over - whelmed with the execrations of the multitude , he is content to remark , '' The affair is more difficult than I had supposed . ''

		Tumbled into the Seine , sheltering his dripping body beneath a bridge in com - pany with an old , lame horse , he merely persists , '' This affair is more difficult than I had supposed . ''


France	LOCATION	is far more tactful than Colomban , but he displays the same consistency in advocating reason and the intellect .

		In this book he is in no sense a dilettante , and though often wrong or at least one devoutly hopes so is in no sense irresponsible .

		But no more tenable is the position of those who are content merely to enjoy the exquisite wit , the charming style of `` The Isle of Penguins , '' while they let the sincerity of the author take care of itself .


Bernard Shaw	PERSON	and
Anatole France	LOCATION	are fellow - sufferers in this respect .

		Their wit , their style , can not be wholly appreciated when divorced from its guiding principle .


France	LOCATION	's principles , or his application of them , must often be erroneous ; other - wise it is a pretty world we live in .

		To ignore or deny them is to miss the full flavor of his work .

		Nevertheless , there is much that is racial in prin - ciples , and in the satire which flows from them .

		It may be that the purely literary and artistic virtues of the books of
Anatole France	LOCATION	are more instructive for English readers than his philosophy , be that never so cogent .

		His satire is sometimes like French tobacco , designed for home consumption ; whereas his literary art has earned its English rights since it has made singularly impressive a foreign mental attitude which is neither very novel nor particularly sympathetic .

		Some of the literary virtues of this Frenchman are perhaps the virtues of the French in general .

		His style is clarity and grace itself ; he has , what is so rare in English , a light pen for heavy matters ; he never fails to make precise the half-thought or the subtle perception .

		But there is one virtue , one power , which is all his own : the satirical illumina - tion of legend or history .

		He is not a good story - teller .

		He stops at too many pleasant cafe 's where one may rest awhile and discuss the situation ; his characterization is too arbitrary .

		Yet he chooses story-telling for the discharge of his ideas , and so falls unfortunately sometimes , successfully often into a kind of narrative essay .

		In his best vein , he holds with the modern historian that the chronicles preserve only the symbols of the past ; then deduces from an old story the true happening .

		Every ap - pearance of scholarship bolsters his work .

		Sylvestre Bonnard himself might be proud of the erudition , of the method ; and yet the results are pure satire .

		One feels the ultra-modern intellect at work upon the foundations of tradition , and this satire cuts home .

		u Les Sept Femmes de Barbe-Bleue , '' which everyone in
France	LOCATION	seemed to be reading in the
summer of 1909	DATE	, is a charming example of this un - comfortably effective process . ''

		The Seven Wives of Bluebeard , '' though it gives the book its title , is not the best story .

		There is , for example , the miracle of the great St.
Nicholas	PERSON	.

		Scientific scholarship proves that there were two saints of this name .

		Scientific scholarship , after the best models , identi - fies one of them as the holy man of the nursery - rhyme who miraculously synthesized the bodies of three children salted in a pork barrel .

		Back to the city of Trinqueballe the bishop for this St.
Nicholas	PERSON	was a bishop led the fruits of his ex - periment , and there brought them up according to a policy of perpetual kindness , hoping thus to counteract the harshness of their years in the pork - barrel .

		But note the results of the miracle : one became a murderer and ravisher , one a swindler , and one a heretic .

		Thanks to the efforts of the three ,
Nicholas	PERSON	was despoiled of his wealth , bereft of his beloved niece , his bishopric torn by wars and dissensions , its faith made prey to indecent heresies , and he himself driven out to seek some hermitage where he might spend the little remainder of his life in puzzling over the mystery of the will of God .

		Yet the purpose of the miracle was not left unex - plained .

		There was a hermit upon the lonely mountain-top where he sought for peace .

		It was the wicked inn-keeper who had salted the three unfortunates !

		The miracle had converted him ; he was the soul saved by the universal wreck .

		Then there is `` La Chemise , '' a perfect work of its kind , almost as perfect in form and this is rare with
France	LOCATION	as it is pungent in substance .

		A king , as in the old tale , must have a shirt from a perfectly happy man if he is to be cured of his ills ; but king and ills are modern .

		This ruler who bears a strange resemblance to
Leopold	LOCATION	, the late lamented of
Belgium	LOCATION	is a commercial success ; he has learned to despise his ministers , and yet run a constitutional government without friction ; he has learned to steer his course between popularity and unpopularity ; but in spite of all the conveniences of a modern kingship , he is bored bored until ennui becomes a disease .

		His physician belongs to the modern school which believes in natural reme - dies .

		Sea-air , mineral waters , for example , are excellent ; and for this case , no less a tonic than the exudations from the skin of a perfectly happy man .

		Saint-Sylvan and Quatref euilles go forth to find the happy man and his shirt .

		They approach a noble peer ; alas , he loves the public , and the public revile him for his solicitude .

		They seek a heroic duke ; 510 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, he is senile , the prey of his servants .

		They din - cover , with rejoicings , a country curt who lives an idyllic life among his peasants ; his existence is a torture , for he no longer believes .

		The lover , the rich man , the wise , and a dozen of those intermediate types which modern society provides , are but new figures for the comedy .

		Women they do not seek .

		It will not do to feminize the king 's ideas of happi - ness , and besides , says
Saint-Sylvan	PERSON	, `` I observe that , in our class , they do not bring up their chil - dren , do not direct their households , know nothing , do nothing , and kill themselves with fatigue ; they consume themselves in shining , their life is a kind of candle ; I ignore if it is enviable . ''

		And , last of all ,
Mousque	LOCATION	, a poor half-witted creature who plays about in the king 's park and makes toys for the children . ''

		As happy as Mousque , '' the people say .

		He is happy , he admits it when they explain to him the nature of happiness ; but when they offer him gold , a palace , a new pair of shoes , for his shirt , his face expresses only surprise .

		He had no shirt !

		And it is thus that this good
Anatole France	LOCATION	teases his penguins .

		Is he a notable figure in con - temporary literature ?

		Certainly he is an artist with novel means at his disposal ; certainly a power - ful satirist with a consistent standard of criticism .

		Yet , if notable , it is not because his point of view is new it was
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's before him but because of the - kill and the modernity of its application .

		One is tempted to call him the Swift of
France	LOCATION	; in spite of the dangers of comparison , one is still more tempted to call him the Voltaire of the twentieth century , though a very limited and specialized
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, who advances , as the only guide , a very up-to-date intellect : indeed , a
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	so individual that it would be well to exhaust the resemblance , and drop it , before we begin to compare some writer of our own to
Anatole France	LOCATION	.

SKIDEL CANBY	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE KEPROACH OF ACADEMICISM , which that vig - orous and independent thinker ,
Thomas Davidson	PERSON	, the `` wandering scholar '' - -LRB- as his biographer , Dr.
William Knight	PERSON	, aptly called him -RRB- , used to throw up against the college-trained man , is still one that waits to be entirely removed .

		Undoubtedly the modern varied curriculum , despite its faults , pro- duces fewer prigs and pedants than did the old-time college course that demanded of the student little beyond an ability to read and remember , and that placed a premium on drudgery rather than on intel - lect A correspondent of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post , '' Professor
Hiram Bingham	PERSON	of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, offers a suggestion which , if universally followed , might go far toward removing the reproach of academicism , and toward making the mere drudge much less suc - cessful in his pursuit of academic honors . ''

		The bane of our present college teaching , '' Mr.
Bingham	PERSON	believes , '' is the frequency of questions beginning with ` what ' and ` who / and the infrequency of those beginning with why ' and ' how . '

		Of course such questions are harder to make out , harder t < > answer , and harder to mark than those designed to see whether the student can give back what he has heard the instructor say , or has read in the text - book .

		But my own experience has been that the results are correspondingly far more satisfactory . ''

		This substitution of the '' why '' and '' how '' for the '' what '' and '' who '' would certainly discourage the cowardly though comforting habit of clinging to the text-book as to a life-preserver .

		* THE PUBLIC LIBRARY A PUBLIC PANACEA such , in brief , is the burden of the song , or hymn of praise , that greets the delighted ears of librarian and assistants at a certain great city library with many branches .

		Patrons of this institution have given uttterance to so many expressions of appre - ciation and gratitude for benefits received , that the library has issued an anthology of these eloquent tributes .

		This florilegium -LRB- to be sure , it is not in verse , or if it is the scansion is defective -RRB- is entitled , '' Results not Shown by Statistics in the Work of the Public Libraries of
Greater New York	LOCATION	. ''

		We give a few choice extracts .

		An Irishman is reported as saying : '' My children are getting so d n smart at school that I am obliged to use the library to keep ahead of them . '' ''

		My ! ''

		exclaimed another reader , in praise of the library 's collection of music scores , I could hear two or three operas on the money I saved by coining to the library for music scores . ''

		A French woman , a semi-weekly frequenter of the library , said : '' I do n't know what we should have done without the library this winter .

		My husband and I could in former years go to the theatres once in a while ; but this lias been such a hard
winter	DATE	that we could not afford any such luxuries .

		The library has furnished us with all our pleasures this
winter	DATE	. ''

		And another woman : '' I have had a great deal of trouble .

		Everything in life has failed me , and if it were not for my books I should go crazy . ''

		This from a man of enterprise : '' I was a barber , and have been able to become an electrician with the aid of the books in the library . ''

		And so on , through fourteen pages of fine print , in far greater variety and detail than can here be even hinted at .

		It is a little book to warm the librarian ' * heart ... , A SUGGESTION TO BUYERS OF GIFT-BOOKS for
Christmas	DATE	may not be out of order .

		Many places too small to support a good book-store do maintain an excellent public library , and at the library may be seen and examined , with the aid and consent of the librarian , a collection of recent and desirable holiday publication - , from which certain title .

		- , with publishers ' names and perhaps also with prices , may be noted for subsequent orders on the nearest book-dealer .

		The public library of
Jackson	LOCATION	,
Michi	PERSON	- gan , makes a practice of exhibiting at this season
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 511 books suitable for gifts to children .

		It might well make its exhibition more comprehensive , as the grown-ups , too , like to receive presents in the shape of books .

		The
Jackson	PERSON	method may be indicated by an extract from the current Report of the librarian . ''

		The Christmas exhibition of Children 's books suitable for gifts was again held , and attracted much attention .

		Upon request to the publishers seventy-two books were donated , and forty-two were lent us by the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	; the total number of books shown was 235 ... The present collection of gift books for children has been of great use to teachers and parents , and inquiries about it have come from all over the
State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		THE POEM THAT THE PEOPLE LIKE BEST , according to the editor of the '' Notes and Queries '' department of the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript , '' seems to be that favorite of our tender years , '' The Blackberry Girl , '' by Mrs.
Nancy Dennis Sproat	PERSON	.

		No other piece of verse is asked for and inquired about so often as this touch - ing tale of piety and poverty , beginning , as many will remember : '' Why ,
Phoebe	PERSON	, are yon come so soon ?

		Where are your berries , child ?

		You can not , sure , have sold them all : You had a basket piled . ''

		The whole story of blackberries spilled and the anguish of dark despair and the final emergence of the sun of happiness from behind the thunder-clouds of gloom takes twenty-one of these four-line stanzas in the telling .

		They were published as early as
1829	DATE	, in
Boston	LOCATION	, in a collection of Mrs.
Sproat	PERSON	's writings entitled '' Stories for Children in Familiar Verse . ''

		But it is probable that '' The Blackberry Girl '' had already been separately given to the world in some newspaper or other periodical .

		In
1833	DATE	it re-appeared in a reading-book called '' The Child 's Guide , '' published by the old and famous house of
George Merriam	PERSON	, at
Springfield	LOCATION	.

		Probably few , even of those who best remember the poem , are aware that it had a sequel , '' What the Blackberry Girl Learned at Church , or The Blackberry Girl Continued . ''

		THE LATE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
VERMONT	LOCATION	, who died
Nov. 29	DATE	, at
Burlington	LOCATION	, was one of our comparatively few scholars of the good old sort , well-versed in the Greek and Latin classics , and master of a literary style at once ornate and clear .

		It is now thirty-nine years since
Matthew H. Buckham	PERSON	succeeded Dr.
James B. Angell	PERSON	-LRB- upon the latter 's acceptance of the presidency of
Michigan University	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- as head of the
University of Vermont	ORGANIZATION	; and in that time he has added to the laurels of scholarship the well-earned fame of an able admin - istrator , and the institution under his direction has flourished notably .

		The mere titles of some of his printed discourses indicate the breadth and sanity of his mind , as , for example , '' The Love of Diffi - culty , '' `` The Culture of the Imagination , '' `` Dead Languages Forsooth , '' '' The Real Bible , '' '' Reserve in Matters of Religion , '' and '' The Economic Sit - uation . ''

		He was an occasional contributor to educational magazines , but his lifework is more substantially commemorated in the later buildings and professorships of the
Vermont University	ORGANIZATION	than in the domain of literature .

		TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE OF DEMAND FOR THE LATEST LIBRARY BOOKS the obvious thing to do is to buy additional copies if the requisite funds are available .

		The generous policy of the
Springfield	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- City Library is thus stated in the current Report of that well-managed institution : '' When - ever four names are on the waiting list for a book , unless the demand appears purely spasmodic , an additional copy is bought .

		This applies chiefly to new and popular works of non-fiction .

		Standard works for which the demand is fairly constant should usually be obtainable with less delay , and especial attention has been paid to procuring suffi - cient copies of such books .

		Libraries do not hesi - tate to buy many copies of the new , more-or-less ephemeral fiction , and it would seem to be no less a duty to multiply copies of the standard histories , biographies , and other works of literature .

		Readers unable to obtain books readily may have their wants attended to by filling out a slip entitled ` Books never in . ' ''

		This liberality of supply may , and indeed must , lead to congestion , sooner or later , in certain instances of books over-rated at the time of their appearance .

		But there are always springing up new public libraries to which the less desired duplicates are likely to .

		prove an acceptable offer - ing ; and so the greatest benefit to the greatest number will be effected .

		* THE DEATH OF LIBRARIAN BURR OF
WILLIAMS	PERSON	COLLEGE deprives that institution of one of its most useful and most highly esteemed faculty members .

		A graduate of the college -LRB- class of ' 68 -RRB- ,
Charles H. Burr	PERSON	was called in
1888	DATE	from the pastorate of the
Bethany Congregational Church	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	to take charge of the library of his alma mater , where he devoted twenty-two years of skilled service to the formidable task of transforming an old-fashioned , rudely classified , imperfectly catalogued , and laxly administered college library into a modern , scien - tifically classified , adequately catalogued , and wisely managed college library .

		Like many another de - voted to the somewhat dry technicalities of this learned profession , Mr.
Burr	PERSON	had a dry humor of his own that cropped out in speech and in writing ; and he will be missed not only for his scholarly and administrative ability , but also for his genialty and companionableness as a man .

		THE PERIODICAL POETRY OF THE YEAR has been sifted by Mr.
William Stanley Braithwaite	PERSON	, himself a poet of repute , in accordance with his custom of the last six years , and his results are published in the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript , '' as in previous years .

		He selects for his purpose six magazines that , as he affirms , '' publish the best , and not only the best , but oil !

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, the greatest number of poems . ''

		These six encour - agers of contemporary poets are `` The
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' 44 The Century , '' '' Scribner 's , '' ``
Harper	PERSON	's , '' * ` Mc - Clure 's , '' and *
Lippincott	PERSON	's , '' which in the year now closing have published , respectively , 34 poems -LRB- 12 of distinction -RRB- , 69 -LRB- 19 of distinction -RRB- , 42 -LRB- 13 of distinction -RRB- , 62 -LRB- 16 of distinction -RRB- , 36 -LRB- 9 of dis - tinction -RRB- , and 48 -LRB- 8 of distinction -RRB- .

		It ` is note - worthy , but not surprising , that the -
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' has the highest proportion of distinguished poems , ac - cording to Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's rating .

		He chooses six for reprinting at the end of his article , and of these three are from the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' two from the '' Century , '' and one from '' Scribner 's , '' the names of the six poets thus crowned being

Ellen Angus French	PERSON	,
Cale Young Rice	PERSON	, and
Timothy Cole	PERSON	... THE TERCENTENARY CELEBRATION OF AN ENG - LISH CLASSIC known by name at least to every one , and by far the '' best seller '' in the book-trade of to-day , is to be held next
April	DATE	.

		It ought to be superfluous to give the name of this book , one or more copies of which are to be found in nearly every English-speaking household in the land , and the phraseology of which has made a permanent place for itself in our spoken and written language ; and yet it may not instantly occur to every one that in the year
1611	DATE	, on a day now no longer accurately determinable , there was published in
England	LOCATION	that masterpiece of clear , forcible , idiomatic , and pic - turesque English , the King James version of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		It is proposed by the American Bible So - ciety to devote the first
Sunday	DATE	after Easter to a general commemoration of this publishing event .

		Among the topics suggested for addresses and lec - tures are these : `` The story of the growth of the English Bible from the first translations to the King James version , '' '' Later revisions and trans - lations , '' `` The influence of the Bible on English literature , '' `` The influence of the Bible on customs , laws , government , and social life , '' and `` The English Bible and civil liberty . ''

		GENIUS AND MADNESS have ever been regarded as closely akin .

		The gift of poetry is especially likely to be confused with unsoundness of mind by the severely practical .

		`` Ant iruanit homo , aut versus facit , ''
Horace	PERSON	makes his slave Davus say of him .

		Sophocles in his old age was charged with insanity by his unfilial son lophon , and was sum - moned by him before the Phratores , to whom he read , in proof of his mental soundness , a splendid passage from his lately-written but not yet produced `` CEdipus at Colonus , '' and so made his poetry clear him of that suspicion of imbecility which , had he been a stock-broker or a hardware-dealer instead of a poet , would probably never have rested upon him .

		And now , si parva licet componerc magnis , a poet of no mean ability is said to have been recently discovered in a
Minnesota	LOCATION	asylum for the insane .

		Was it her addiction to poetry that caused her con - finement ?

		Still another public institution -LRB- a peni - tentiary tlii - time -RRB- of the name
State	ORGANIZATION	shelters a writer of verse that has met with acceptance in high quarters in the magazine world ; and the alleged reason for his seclusion too may be defined as a sort of insanity , if one takes the view that all sin is but unsoundness , or insanita * , of the moral nature .

		But , after all is said , there remains a large proportion of the mentally or morally mad who possess neither poetic n < > r : in \ other kind of genius : and also there are many poets and poetasters who have never incurred the faintest suspicion of any sort of phrensy , either divine or diabolical .

		THE PROFITS OF PASTIME are not always con - fined to those returns of enjoyment and reinvigora - tion that make pastime so emphatically worth while .

		Sometimes a person 's play is more remunerative , pecuniarily , than his serious labor .


Lewis Carroll	PERSON	-LRB- or
Charles Lutwidge Dodgson	PERSON	, as he was known to his friends and acquaintances -RRB- varied the monotony of preaching sermons and writing textbooks on higher mathematics by giving the rein to his playful - ness of humor in those immortal adventures of Alice that so delighted the circle of little girls who formed his audience , and that have since been the joy of other children of all ages up to ninety or over .

		One is glad to learn , from the life of
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	now added to the season 's stock of good books , that these merry whimsicalities of his leisure hours yielded him such returns that he could devote himself to the sublimities of higher mathematics without feel - ing that he was frittering away time that should have been devoted to bread-winning pursuits .

		A MOUNTAIN OF BOOKS , or something approach - ing it , confronts the sight-seer in
Berlin	LOCATION	who visits the new
Royal Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		The rambling old palace that formerly held this precious collection of books has been superseded by the nearest approach to a sky-scraper known to the library world .

		The new building towers aloft to the height of thirteen stories , and its bookstack contains more than fifty miles of shelving , or capacity therefor , its 1,300,000 books filling already nearly thirty-two miles of this shelv - ing .

		In fifty years , or in less time if the world 's production of books continues at its present rate of annual increase , this many-storied stack will be filled .

		But there is always plenty of room at the top , and , within the limits imposed by building laws and laws not made by man , bookstacks can always grow in an upward direction .

		However , before another halt - century has passed perhaps our librarians will in - vent some satisfactory sifting process to relieve the pressure on their shelves , or possibly a second Omar will solve the problem by burning our enormous collections of books and giving us a chance to he - MI over again .

		THE FIRST AVIATOR was undoubtedly Dtedalus .

		What does concern all interested in curio - sities of literature is the finding of an early treatise on aerial navigation from the pen of no less a cele - brity than
Jean Jacques Rousseau	PERSON	. ''

		Men walk on the earth , '' says
Rousseau	PERSON	, '' they sail on the water , and swim in it .

		Is not the air an element , like the others .

		What business have the birds to shut us out of their domain while we are made welcome in that of the fishes ? ''

		To
Rousseau	PERSON	's restless and inquiring mind the problem of man-flight resolved itself into the two subsidiary problems of finding a body lighter than air and so capable of rising , and , secondly , of discovering some means to make it stop rising and -LRB- hardest of all -RRB- to compel it to descend . ''

		Le Nouveau D ^ dale '' for thus the little book was happily named is said to have first found its way into print in the
year 1801	DATE	; but it was ahead of its day , and so lapsed into speedy oblivion , to be revived a century later .

		A TWICE-TOLD TALE OF THE STEAMBOAT that IS curious enough to merit a passing note is to be read in the two like-named and simultaneously pub - lished books of the season , '' Steamships and their Story '' by Mr.
E. Keble Chatterton	PERSON	, and `` Steam - Ships and their Story '' by Mr.
R. A. Fletcher	PERSON	, both large octavos , illustrated with almost equal profusion and partly in color , and pursuing much the same plan of tracing the development of the latest turbine monster of the deep from the earliest beginnings of steamboat construction .

		It is a delib - erate and voluntary termination of its activities that is now in prospect .

1868	DATE	, the society 's original intention was to continue in existence for about twenty or thirty years , whereas it has now been beneficently active for forty-two years , doing excellent work in the elucidation and publication of Chaucer texts .

		PRESIDENT FOLK 'S DIARY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your issue of
November 16	DATE	appears a long review of '' President Folk 's Diary , '' lately published in your city from the original manuscript now owned by the
Chicago Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		The reviewer observes of the
Bancroft	PERSON	copy of that Diary , in the
Lenox Library	LOCATION	at
New York	LOCATION	, that the only writers who have yet drawn upon it are two recent ones specified by him , and he calls repeated attention to the rich opportunity for new historical research afforded by the present publication .

		I should like to point out that the Lenox Library copy of '' Folk 's Diary , '' clearly typewritten , and hand - somely bound , and purchased long ago with the
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		Collection left by
George Bancroft	PERSON	, has been known and appreciated for many years by historical investigators , of whom I may claim to be the earliest , as well as the first to call public attention to the work and make state - ment of its contents .

		In
1894	DATE	I made a diligent study of all the Polk papers in that collection , and published two articles in the `` Atlantic Monthly '' in
1895	DATE	'' President ` Polk 's Diary '' -LRB-
August	DATE	-RRB- , and '' President Folk 's Administration '' -LRB-
September	DATE	-RRB- .

		Both of these articles were reprinted in my volume of '' Historical Briefs , '' published in
1896	DATE	.

		That President
Polk	PERSON	's papers were well preserved by his widow in
Tennessee	LOCATION	and included his own `` Diary '' of his administration , I learned from Mr.
Bancroft	PERSON	himself in
1887	DATE	; and the circumstances under which he , that same year , procured the copies from Mrs.
Polk	PERSON	for his own use in
Washington	LOCATION	, are detailed in the former of these articles .

		While preparing the narrative of President
Polk	PERSON	's
Administration	ORGANIZATION	for my `` History of the United States '' -LRB- Vols .

		4 and 5 -RRB- I tried in vain to get access to to these copies ; and as soon as the Ban - croft manuscripts were purchased and made available the venerable author having died in
1891	DATE	I hastened to examine them , by way of revising my own volume , published shortly before .

		The two ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly '' articles were intended as a sequel commentary to my narrative ; and when in
1904	DATE	new plates were made for my History I revised the text so as to incorporate the new material .

		Mrs.
Polk	PERSON	survived
George Bancroft	PERSON	several years ; and as the ex-President 's papers did not come into the market until long after the
Bancroft Collection	ORGANIZATION	had been purchased by the
Lenox Library	LOCATION	, these copies of the Polk papers were readily accessible to scholars long before the originals .

		I presume that the Lenox Library copy of `` Polk 's Diary '' is full and accurate in all respects .

SCHOULER	ORGANIZATION	.


Boston	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	,
Dec. 3 , 1910	DATE	.

		-LSB- I am extremely sorry that in writing the review of '' Polk 's Diary , '' I was in ignorance of the fact that Mr.
Schouler	PERSON	had used it and printed material based upon it , previous to its publication .

		In at - tempting to check the statements in the preface and introduction , to the effect that the Diary had '' occasionally been used '' by historians , I naturally turned first of all to Mr.
Schouler	PERSON	's well-known work .

		Unfortunately , that happened to be the first edition of the `` History of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' in preparing which the Diary was not accessible to the author .

		I failed to examine either the later edition or the `` Historical Briefs . ''

		These omissions I greatly regret .

		That Mr.
Schouler	PERSON	has made use of the
Polk MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		is not surprising ; it is only sur - prising that the reviewer should not know of such use by a scholar of reputation .

		This , however , is the case .

		While the
Lenox Library	ORGANIZATION	copy of the Diary undoubtedly offered opportunities to those who could get to it , the appearance of the Diary in print is surely a genuine `` incentive to research . ''

		Neither Mr.
Reeves	PERSON	nor Mr.
Garrison	PERSON	, whom I men - tioned , used the Lenox Library copy exclusively ; the former had resource both to the
Chicago MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		and to the copy ; and the latter had the
Chicago MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		copied expressly for his own use .

		What I have meant to say is that the Diary in print is now widely available , and that no writer has exhausted its content or bearing .

		A PUBLICIST OF Two NATIONS .

		* The late
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	's book of '' Reminis - cences '' expresses the conclusions of one who was deeply occupied with the general welfare ; who came into large and varied contact with the leading persons and events of his time , and Drought to their consideration an independent , penetrative , and judicial mind .

		The author says of himself that he was not ambitious , and the events of his life seem to confirm this opin - ion .

		He was more than once solicited to run for office ; yet , with liberal means and delicate health , he never allowed himself to come under the exactions of hard labor .

		In boyhood he was a scholar at
Eton	LOCATION	, where he came in contact with boys who were to play a prominent part in life .

		Later he was a student at
Oxford	LOCATION	, where he became a tutor and then a professor the last and the most permanent position that he held in
England	LOCATION	.

		The period of the profes - sorship is given as 1858-1866 , and was later than his residence in
London	LOCATION	.

		He was a member of several public commissions fitted to add to his influence .

		He was interested in current events in
Ireland	LOCATION	, in our Civil War , and in the insurrection in
Jamaica	LOCATION	.

		In all these move - ments and events the spirit of philanthropy prevailed with him .

		Prior to his Oxford professorship , he began the study of law in
London	LOCATION	, but found its demands too severe for his health .

		He spent several years in
London	LOCATION	, and for three years was on the staff of '' The
Saturday	DATE	Review . ''

		In
1868	DATE	he made a second journey to
America	LOCATION	, and became for two years professor in
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	.

		He removed thence to
Toronto	LOCATION	, where he remained some forty years , until his recent death .

		These diverse experiences were interspersed with travels , visits to

		the opinions and methods In - encountered were ofton distasteful to him .

		He was conversant with men of literary eminence , and gives us an occasional criticism .

		What he says of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	is so concurrent with my own feeling that I give it in full : '' I can not honestly say that 1 ever got nim-h from his writings .

		I can find no system ; I find only aphorisms ; an avalanche , as it were , of unconnected pebbles of thought , some of them transparent ; some translucent , some to me opaque .

		Carlyle introduced
Emerson	PERSON	to the British public as one who brought new fire from the empyrean .

		But the two men in genius were leagues apart , and
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	at last found the new fire a bore . ''


Goldwin Smith	PERSON	was thoroughly democratic in his tendencies , and judged men and things chiefly in their bearing on the general wel - fare .

		It was political events more than other events that occupied his mind .

		He regarded as the deepest issue in our Civil War the cardinal difference between slavery and free - dom .

		He did not allow this issue to be pushed aside or covered up by any secondary issues which might have arisen in connection with it .

		While he seems to us to do full justice to
Lincoln	LOCATION	, he does not fall into the indiscrim - inate laudation that has become the fashion .

		As one who , in a living experience , was familiar not only with the war but with the events that preceded it and prepared the way for it , I have felt that
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's chief merit lay in his un - failing honesty .

		He entertained all forms of human welfare according to the measures of his own character , and never allowed himself to forget them or to be turned from them by im - mediate interests .

		He did not , however , enter into the depths of the ethical struggle involved in the war .

		He entertained the apologetic and partial reasons which occupied public attention and concealed in part the true force of events .

		The working classes in
England	LOCATION	had a more thoroughly correct view of the war than most Americans .

		The question was not whether we should allow another nation to spring up on the soil of the
United States	LOCATION	, but whether a slave - holding nation should establish itself at our side with exacting and hostile claims .

		A war was inevitable , should we meet it in its ear - liest and weakest form , or allow the forces of evil full opportunity of accumulation ?

		Lincoln felt the crisis , but rather as a national crisis than one in the history of the world .

		His methods had sufficient patience and insight to succeed , but hardly enough to turn victory into moral enthusiasm .

		The things most striking in his addresses , as that at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, was the
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 515 perfectly simple and straightforward way in which he contemplated the facts .

		We have stood as a nation for democratic principles , the universal recognition of human rights ; but it has been largely because our interests have been identified with these princi - ples rather than because we have accepted them as of universal application .

		When prosperity in - vited a departure from fundamental opinions , we have readily strayed into the forbidden paths of tyranny .

		We have been fortunate in our European admirers ; they have been truer than we have been to our best convictions .


Carl Schurz	PERSON	and
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	felt at once the derelictions into which we were falling .


Goldwin Smith	ORGANIZATION	could see but little in the pres - ent Republican Party of the promise contained in its early history .

		While he regarded our present pension system as a negation of merit and a complete subserviency of politicians to an unscrupulous vote , the only good he saw in it was an enormous expense frightening us from war .

		His repugnance to war rested on a sense of the immense evil it brings to society .

		Among those in English politics on whose character and services the writer dwells were Disraeli ,
Gladstone	LOCATION	, and
Cardwell	PERSON	.

		The latter was for a time Irish Secretary , and thus in - volved in that tangle of evils , impossible of correction , which has so long perplexed both peoples .

		To have brought any firm and suffi - cient policy to
Ireland	LOCATION	is the highest of records .

		Acknowledging the wonderful power and facil - ity of execution which belonged to
Gladstone	LOCATION	,
Goldwin Smith	ORGANIZATION	saw also clearly the restricted action of his mind in some directions , and the rapidity with which he was liable to fall into extreme measures .


Goldwin Smith	ORGANIZATION	's dislike of Disraeli was so strong as somewhat to overstrain his candor .

		The success of Disraeli in English politics is proof both of his own power and the perversion of thought still possible in
England	LOCATION	.

		The cur - rent of censure directed against Disraeli , though well deserved , has doubtless carried away at times the banks of the stream , and tumbled some shapely trees into the river .


Goldwin Smith	ORGANIZATION	belonged to the Manchester school , the school of free trade so long and so beneficently led by
Cobden	PERSON	and Bright .

		Per - haps no man in English politics preserved so uniformly a broad and generous view in his speeches as did Bright .

		Sound sentiment in trade seemed to temper all his thinking and im - part to him a universal philanthropy .


Goldwin Smith	ORGANIZATION	escaped the narrowness that sometimes grew out of a single interest of trade .

		It was possible to attack protection simply as an ob - stacle to one 's own occupation .


Goldwin Smith	PERSON	was an advocate of trade unions as a necessary defense of the workman against the drift of social causes and the encroachments of capital .

		No class more needs a careful consideration of its own welfare and the assertion of its rights as a leading constituent in society .


Goldwin Smith	ORGANIZATION	belonged to the class of con - stant , consistent , and reasonable critics , a class to which much of our progress will always be due .

		No temper requires more balance , more self-restraint , than the reformatory temper .

		It is one thing to figure a perfect social state , often in oversight of many new evils ready to be set in motion , and quite another thing to see and urge the correction that lies next in order .


Goldwin Smith	ORGANIZATION	preserved his hold on active influential men while striving to enlarge and redirect their efforts .

		VENICE ix HER , DECADENCE .

		* Perfection being inhuman , every book must perforce have some fault ; yet just what is the fault of
M. Philippe Monnier	PERSON	's ''
Venice	LOCATION	in the Eighteenth Century '' it is difficult to say unless it be an embarrassment of charm .

		Reading it now in the English translation after having read it in the original French a year or more ago , one 's belief that it is an enchanting , as well as accurate , word-picture of a delightful , albeit decadent , age is thoroughly confirmed .

		Yet the reader must know
Venice	LOCATION	to enjoy to the full the charm of this book , so permeated is it with the spirit of the city of the lagoons .

		If you know
Venice	LOCATION	,
M. Monnier	PERSON	will transport you there ; seat you in a frail gondola ; guide you through an enchanting maze of dark canaletti to the
Lunetta	LOCATION	; and there debark you so deftly that , when you follow him into the glorious piazza beyond , forgetful of the grime and soot of the material place in which you dwell , you will actually believe yourself to be in
Venice	LOCATION	at carnival a time when '' there is no more day nor night , no more appointed hour for sleep or dinner , no more restraint , stability , or rule '' ; a time when '' folly shakes her bells , fiddles are tuned , and all feet are agog to dance . ''

		Until the last page is turned , you will not realize that you have been reading a treatise as *
VENICE	LOCATION	IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY .

		From the French of
Philippe Monnier	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
The Gorham Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL -LSB- Dec - , 16 scholarly as it is delightful ; for , although
M. Monnier	PERSON	colors with the charm of a
Watteau	ORGANIZATION	, his outlines are as true as the most rigid naturalist could demand .

		Indeed , he is what might be termed an artistic scholar , if that be not a paradox or , to put it more clearly , an artist who feels and a scholar who knows .

		Although he is erudite as well as artistic ,
M. Monnier	PERSON	has no sociological theories to propound , no historical lessons to preach .

		He realizes that the age he is portraying is a petty age , yet he knows that even in her decadence
Venice	LOCATION	remained great ; for , as he wisely puts it , `` her greatness had been built upon the rock of her past , and this past was potent still . ''

		It is no mere word-artist who , studying that eighteenth century , so petty in
Italy	LOCATION	, so perti - nent in
France	LOCATION	, has the historical acumen to see that in that age
Venice	LOCATION	stands out conspicuously from the rest of
Italy	LOCATION	, not only because of her unique independence , but because she is the city where life was most vivid , most intense , '' and that '' never in the whole of her history had she been freer of the influence of
Rome	LOCATION	than at this moment of supreme civilization ; never had she seemed more worthy of her cleverness and of her beautiful dialect , never more signally , more triumphantly Venetian '' Furthermore , it takes a man of greater insight than the mere delightful chronicler of follies that
M. Monnier	PERSON	appears to be in many instances , to analyze the very folly he is chronicling and make it clear to the reader that : '' Never in the history of the world had there been a time when the element of tragedy was so conspicuously absent from the scheme of things .

		Never had human life been so void of all heroism .

		And never had there been such joyous , childish laughter in the world , as at this moment of termination to a period that reeked of passion and blood . ''

		Though history tempers
M. Monnier	PERSON	's pages , his book is no history , but rather a series of dissolving views in which a people and an age are pictured with an artist 's touch .

		Yet with all the bold dashes of color that illuminate these pages , the man who knows his
Venice	ORGANIZATION	will feel that the color is characteristically true ; while he who has studied the particular age whereof
M. Monnier	PERSON	writes will recognize that here that age is painted more charmingly , truthfully , and concisely than in any other book about it .

		Painted is the very word : no other will describe what the author has done ; even a bungling translator can not wholly destroy the charm of such a colorful picture of
Venice	LOCATION	on a
summer	DATE	's day as this : `` Out of a veil of tenderest blue , soft as mist , cradled in a translucent vapour , rises tin - city of the sea like a dream of rose and marble .

		Air and water seem to merge themselves with the vision of her past , and to weave for her a robe of fantasy , where opal and mother - of-pearl , coral , old ivory , and old silver are wedded in a riot of pink , palest violet , and lucent grey .

		Over everything there is a wonderful brightness .

		It bathes the domes , the cupolas , the towers of the city in an exquisite luminosity , displaying their spires and pinnac - les in a trellised daintiness more like lace than stone . ''

		The words `` exquisite luminosity '' have a euphuistic sound , but they are the translator 's own , not a suggestion of them appearing in
M. Monnier	PERSON	's original .

		Indeed it is to be hoped that the distinguished author of this book does not understand English , else a very bad quarter of an hour will be his when he reads his charm - ing work in our guttural tongue .

		Take , for instance , the very passage we have just quoted .

		In the original French it reads in this exquisite way : '' Sur une soie d'azur tendre , dans une gaze de vapeur molle , au sein d'une poussiere lumineuse , surgit la cite * : ui ; ul \ OIIHMU - comme une fantaisie de marbre rose .

		L'eau , le nuage et le passe * s ` accordent a lui tisser uu vgtemeut de nuance , oh la nacre et 1 ` opale , le corail et la perle , le vieil ivoireet le vieil argent s ` appellent , se re * pondent , se marient , se pament , s ' ^ panchent en roses
Verne	PERSON	's , en violets pales , en gris transparents et mobiles .

		Une clarte * charmante enveloppe et pdiietre les domes , les coupoles , les campaniles , qui y baignent leurs bulbes , qui y trempent leurs e * pis , qui y de ` ploieut les graces ajourees d'une pierre en dentelle . ''

		The inapt translator has apparently been utterly baffled by
M. Monnier	PERSON	's delightful imagery , not a vestige remaining in his garbled version of the thought that beautiful
Venice	LOCATION	rises out of the misty sea like Aphrodite Anadyomene at her birth .

		Yet
M. Monnier	PERSON	's ima ^ rry is not really so baffling as it seems , and needs but to be translated to convey the very impressions he intended to convey , the following being but a literal rendering of the passage in question : '' On a silk of tender blue , in a gauze of soft mist , on the breast of radiant spray , the Anadyomene city rises like a caprice of roseate marble .

		The water , the clouds , and the past conspire in weaving for her a various garment wherein nacre and opal , coral and pearl , old ivory and old silver call and respond one to another , wed , faint , and are disclosed in veined roses , pale violets , and transparent , changeable greys .

		AM enchanting light envelopes and penetrates the domes , the cupolas , and the church towers , which bathe their l > ull therein , steep their crests , and unfold the fretted charms of a stone in the form of lace . ''

		Here the original text has been followed far too conscientiously , it being apparent that '' tissue '' and '' veil '' are nicer words than `` silk '' and `` gauze , '' and that a translator should not be too faithful in his allegiance to
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 517 the Latin roots and construction of the original .

		Only in the word `` fretted '' has any great lib - erty been taken , the heraldic term '' ajoure '' although Englished , being too un-English to serve in even so literal a translation as is here attempted .

		The passage has been rendered thus faithfully in order to demonstrate the gross liberties the anonymous translator of this book has taken with
M. Monnier	PERSON	's deft imagery ; for , although '' translucent vapour , '' '' lucent grey , '' and '' exquisite luminosity '' stand forth in vul - gar crudity , it is chiefly when imagery appears to confound him that he or , more likely , she demonstrates that just so long as
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	publishers , to pare shillings or dollars , confide the translating of foreign masterpieces to literary hacks instead of to literary artists , will foreign masters be butchered mercilessly .

		To return to
M. Monnier	PERSON	's book and the petty age it pictures , it may be said that the men of
Venice	LOCATION	were quite as little as their age it being a truism that men make an age .

		Even Metastasio , great though his aspirations un - doubtedly were , is great only in comparison with the dwarfs who surround him .

		Though an artist of the grand style ,
Tiepolo	ORGANIZATION	, to quote
M. Moimier	PERSON	-LRB- who seems ever to be aptly quot - able -RRB- '' loved to delight his fancy with wonder - ful lights and strange architecture , beautiful draperies , beautiful forms , animals , and im - plements . ''

		Indeed , the only man of that period who refused to delight his fancy with lights and draperies and beautiful forms was Goldoni .

		Being a lover of his kind , with a keen obser - vance , this master of naturalistic comedy painted bits of life exactly as he saw them ; yet too short of sight to penetrate the broad atmosphere en - veloping the life he painted , he failed to see the relation of that life to the past or the future or even the times in which he lived ; therefore , though a great naturalist , he was not that higher thing , a great realist , such as Moliere proved himself to be in Le Misanthrope , Tar - tuffe , and Le
Festin de Pierre	ORGANIZATION	.

		As a true picture of a bit of humorous life , Le
Baruffe Chiozzotte	PERSON	is a masterpiece ; yet , though we may laugh at it till tears fill our eyes , while exclaim - ing how true it is , it will never make us ponder .

		Though the greatest man of his age in
Italy	LOCATION	, Goldoni must therefore be given a place on the second rung of the ladder , his limitations being due to the fact that , though he saw clearly and sanely everything about him , he never pondered upon the origin of the things he saw , upon their relation to each other , or upon their outcome .

		Understanding Goldoni as thoroughly as he understands his petty age ,
M. Monnier	PERSON	thus portrays both the charm and the limitations of this commanding figure of eighteenth century Venice : '' No one ever invented more situations , imagined more events , wove more intrigues , arranged more in - cidents , seized more opportunities for fun , marshalled more characters , produced more persons , imparted more gaiety , and scattered or poured .

		out a greater profusion of his riches with more recklessness of heart .

		The laughter , which arose from this jumble , was frank and fresh , pure and unrestrained , thoughtless and untinged by bitterness .

		It rose in the air like the gay outburst of a joyful heart . ''

		With the directness of a natural force and the elemental simplicity of a creature from a golden age , he calmed and simplified existence .

		Always eager and obliging , charitable and good-humoured , he was as un - defiled as water from a
spring	DATE	, as transparent as a crystal .

		Conscious of his limitations , he was content with the talents which he had , and employed them as he could .

		In spite of scorn and derision and mis - understanding , he triumphed over all obstacles with his smile , avenged all offences by forgiving them , and continued to vouchsafe to all , bad and sad and wicked alike , a salutary example of good-humor .

		Gran Goldoni ' the crowd shouted with enthusiasm on Car - nival evenings dead and gone .

		For all these reasons he was great . ''

		Here Goldoni is not patriotically exalted , as many Italians have exalted him , nor chauvinis - tically belittled , as many Frenchmen have be - littled him , but justly given his true place as a naturalist , who `` calmed and simplified exist - ence '' and whose humor was the '' gay outburst of a joyful heart . ''

		Nor is he deified as the '' Moliere of
Italy	LOCATION	, '' be it remarked , a mis - nomer beneath the crushing weight of which Goldoni has all but perished .

		On the contrary , he is
Italy	LOCATION	's Gran Goldoni the most `` salu - tary example of good humor '' in the entire realm of the drama .

		This judicial quality makes
M. Monnier	PERSON	's book valuable ; its charm has already been set forth , therefore little need be added except to say that it tells of gaiety and love in
Venice	LOCATION	as well as of that Sybaritic city 's literature , music , and drama in the century of her decay ; tells , too , of how her people lived and of how her freedom perished when the span of its pleasure - loving life had been run .

		It is a book for Platonists , however , not for matter-of-fact Aristotelians ; and , furthermore , it is a book for those who love
Italy	LOCATION	and particularly
Venice	LOCATION	.

		By these it should be read ; but in the original French if possible , much of its charm being lost in the translation .

CHINA	LOCATION	'S `` OLD BUDDHA . ''

		* `` Though only a woman , Her Majesty Tzu H - i has ; il 1 the courage of a man , and more than the ordinary man 's intelligence . ''

		Thus wrote His
Excellency Ching Shan	PERSON	, while the Boxers raged through the imperial capital of
China	LOCATION	; and with this statement will everyone agree who reads the intensely interesting pages of
China	LOCATION	under the Empress Dowager . ''

		Only two years dead , it is impossible to pans a final verdict upon her wonderful career ; but one thing seems certain beyond peradventure of doubt , the `` Old Buddha '' will stand out as one of the great women of all time , and as the greatest of Chinese queens .

		The story of her life seems like a page out of some mediaeval romance rather than one writ in the full light of the nineteenth century .

		And what a life it was !

		Born of good parentage , in
1835	DATE	, selected as an Imperial concubine when not yet seventeen , she soon became the favorite of her dissolute master , and later , as mother of his heir , her position was unassailable .

		These were stirring times within the Empire .

		In the southern provinces the Taipings were apparently in full control , with
Nanking	LOCATION	as their capital ; and to this great rebellion , unequalled in modern history , was added a war with
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	which only ended with the capture of Peking and the flight of the Imperial house - hold to Jehol , beyond the Great Wall .

		For the first time
Tzu Hsi	PERSON	knew the sorrows of hurried flight before the `` outer barbarians , '' who on this occasion destroyed the
Summer Palace	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was at Jehol that the Empress faced the first great conspiracy against her .

		The emperor , Hsien-Feng , had been failing rapidly .

		His death would necessitate a regency , and three of the Manchu nobles laid their plans to secure this power for themselves .

		Their success seemed assured , but they had reckoned without
Tzu Hsi	PERSON	; their authority was short-lived , for on the return to Peking she asserted her rights , and the conspirators were condemned to suicide or a felon 's death .

		Then began the first Regency -LRB- 1861-1873 -RRB- , in which she formally shared authority with Tzu An , the late Empress Consort ; but as a matter of fact the latter generally deferred to her more vigorous colleague , and rarely did

Dec. 16	DATE	,
Regent	ORGANIZATION	.

		This period saw the collapse of the
Taiping Rebellion	ORGANIZATION	, to which result tin - KmpreBB Dowager contributed through her whole-hearted support of the great Viceroy , Tseng Kuo-fan .

		With the coming to age of her son , the Emperor T'ung -
Chih	PERSON	, the joint Regency ex - pired , and the supreme authority was nominally vested in the weak and dissipated youth .

		But the Dowager had tasted the sweets of power , and she could brook no interference .

		It was to her interest that in the event of her son 's early death no heir remain to cause the widowed con - sort to become the
Empress Dowager	ORGANIZATION	.

		So it has been widely believed that Tzu Hsi encour - aged the youthful Emperor in his dissipations , and did nothing to protect him from their evil effects .

		At any rate , in
January , 1875	DATE	, the Emperor succumbed to small-pox , and '' as - cended the Dragon to become a guest on high . ''

		Then came the question of the succession .

		The young Empress was enceinte , and should a son be born he would become Emperor , which was not to the taste of
Tzu Hsi	ORGANIZATION	.

		Supported by faithful officials and troops , she called a council of the Clansmen and high officials , and in spite of all opposition secured the succession of her sister 's son , a grandson of the Emperor Tao -
Kuang	PERSON	.

		In this way
Tzu Hsi	ORGANIZATION	retained her authority , for the former co-Regents were continued , and the widowed Empress completely ignored .

		A few months later her death was recorded , by suicide it was reported officially , but there were many who read a more sinister meaning into the pathetic story .

		The enforced selection of Kuang-Hsu as Emperor caused a storm of protests from both Chinese and Manchus , for it meant a violation of the dynastic law and of the fundamental principle of ancestor worship .

		The heir should have been of a younger generation in order that he might perform the proper rites before his adopted parent 's shrine .

		In this case the late Emperor was left without an heir , while the new Emperor was proclaimed as the adopted son of his uncle , the Emperor Hsien-Feng , and it was promised that as soon as a son was born he would act as the adopted son of the late Emperor .

		But this explanation was not satis - factory to many of the loyal supporters of the throne .

		The second Regency was marked by increas - ing bitterness between the co-Regents , to such an extent that the sudden death of the
Empress T	ORGANIZATION	/ u An .

		in
1881	DATE	, occasioned many misgivings .

		Henceforth , without usurpation of authority ,
Tzu Hsi	PERSON	was free to direct the ship of
State	ORGANIZATION	alone , sole Regent of the Empire . ''

		In
February , 1889	DATE	, the '' Old Buddha , '' as she was now familiarly called , handed over her powers to the Emperor , and for almost ten years she enjoyed a respite from her arduous labors ; but even among the pleasures of the restored Summer Palace she did not lose track of the developments in Peking .

		In this period came the disastrous war with
Japan	LOCATION	, for which the Empress Dowager was not a little blamed , especially because of the diversion of funds designed for the navy to the rebuilding of the
Summer Palace	ORGANIZATION	, and for the protection afforded Li Hung Chang , who by the southern Chinese especially was looked upon as an arch-traitor .

		With the death of Prince
Kung	PERSON	, the respected head of the
Grand Council	ORGANIZATION	, the Emperor fell under the influence of the Cantonese reformer , K'ang Yu-wei .

		Then began the '' Hundred Days of Reform . ''

		Decrees were issued in rapid succession reforming the system of education and examination ; the army and navy were to be reorganized , and reforms in other depart - ments of government were announced .

		But all the time the Emperor and the reformers realized that their most dangerous obstacle was the '' Old Buddha . ''

		If she approved , all would go well ; if she opposed , the result would be disaster .

		This led to the cleverly-planned coup d'etat which should have resulted in the arrest and confinement of the
Empress Dow	ORGANIZATION	- ager and the execution of her loyal supporters .

		Yuan Shi-k ` ai was selected as the leading actor in this palace revolution .

		He was to seize
Jung Lu	PERSON	, Viceroy of Chihli and Commander - in-Chief of the foreign-drilled army , and also the most loyal servant of the
Empress Dowager	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then , after having him beheaded , he was to lead the disciplined troops to Peking and there arrest the Empress .

		The plan was excellent , but the agent was human . ''

		Yuan reached Tientsin before noon , and proceeded at once to Jung Lu 's Yamen .

		He asked Jung Lu whether he regarded him as a faithful blood brother .

		-LRB- The two men had taken the oath of brotherhood several years before . -RRB-

		< Of course I do , ' replied the Viceroy .

		You well may , for the Emperor has sent me to kill you , and instead , I now betray his scheme , because of my loyalty to the
Empress Dowager	ORGANIZATION	and of my affection for you . '

		Jung Lu , apparently unaffected by the message , merely expressed surprise that the Old Buddha could have been kept in ignorance of all these things , and added that he would go at once to the capital and see the Empress Dowager that same evening .

		Yuan handed him the Emperor 's decree , and Jung Lu , travel - ling by special train , reached Peking soon after 5 p. m. '' From that moment events moved with startling rapidity .

		The Empress Dowager grasped the situation '' with the courage and masculine intelligence that enabled her to overcome all obstacles , '' and a secret conference of the Con - servative leaders was arranged .

		In less than two hours the whole of the
Grand Council	ORGANIZATION	, several of the Manchu princes and nobles , and many of the high officials were gathered together , and `` on their knees , the assembled officials besought her to resume the reins of government and to save their ancient Empire from the evils of a barbarian civilization . ''

		Early the next morn - ing the Emperor was seized , and a decree issued in his name which stated that he had begged the Empress Dowager '' to condescend once more to administer the Government '' and that she had graciously consented .

		Then came the punishment of the reformers , although K'ang Yu-wei escaped in a British war-ship to
Hong Kong	LOCATION	, and later many of the reform decrees were reversed .

		The Emperor still lived , and there were many who believed that his '' sudden death '' was to be expected and , when the blow did not fall , believed that only fear of the south - ern Chinese and of foreign opinion caused the Empress to spare her traitorous nephew .

		Following closely upon the revolution of
1898	DATE	came the
Boxer Rising	ORGANIZATION	of
1900	DATE	.

		The material for this period is of supreme interest , for it is thg diary of His
Excellency Ching Shan	PERSON	, a Manchu kinsman of the
Empress Dowager	ORGANIZATION	's family who had held many high offices until his retirement in
1894	DATE	.

		With the entry of the allied forces , three of the women of his house - hold committed suicide , and he was murdered by his own son .

		The diary was found in his study , and saved from destruction at the hands of a party of Sikhs .

		It is a most remarkable human document .

		The Boxer madness is de - scribed from the inside .

		The hopes of the Empress that at last an instrument had been provided for the complete destruction of the hated barbarians , her rage at the fraudulent despatch from the Ministers demanding her abdication , the murder of von Ketteler , the Ger - man Minister , the '' unfathomable ignorance '' of many of the Manchu nobles , the endeavors of far-sighted officials to stem the flood of un - reasoning hate , all are vividly portrayed .

		see her wavering between hopes and fears , cry - ing out for the destruction of all foreigners and again sending fruit and melons to the beseiged legations ; and we read a new explanation for the failure of the beseigers in the dogged refusal of Jung Lu to turn his cannon over to the Boxers .

		Then came the march of the allies upon Peking , and once again the Empress Dowager knew the privations of a hurried flight before the masterful barbarians .

		This experience taught a needed lesson .

		Out of it emerged a changed woman , penitent for the evils brought upon the Empire and genuinely eager for the reforms which she now realized were sorely needed .

		From
1901	DATE	until her death in
1908	DATE	she moved in the front rank of the reformers , and her edicts even went beyond those that had caused the Emperor 's retirement in
1898	DATE	.

		The difference was this , that the Empress Dowager now urged reforms , and there was no one strong enough to oppose them .

		Such are the events portrayed in ''
China	LOCATION	under the Empress Dowager . ''

		Full of interest they certainly are , and the treatment is in full accord with the theme .

		Even the memorials and edicts so frequently quoted contain a liter - ary charm seldom found in western state papers , and the extracts from the various diaries add a rare personal note .

		The book lends itself to quotation , especially the excellent final chapter , in which an attempt is made to analyze the secret of
Tzu Hsi	ORGANIZATION	's power over men .

		their hearts the vision of that which they expect to see realized on the earth , and calling upon the rest of the world to see with their t \ And as for walking , there is no other way .

		They have all learned long since that those who touch even the hem of their divinity 's garment come not in automobiles or express trains , but in the humility and labor of their own footing .

		He who knows most among them tramps most , and the first sacrifice demanded of the neo - phyte is a generous out-wearing of buskin and cothurnus .

		This season four princes among these ideal trampere are on the road , offering their com - panionship to all who will go with them four princes of varied tastes and temperaments , dif - fering both in the objects of their search and in their manner of talking by the way .

		Among them we best know Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	, whose breezy swinging stride or saunter as the case may demand over fields and through woodlands has put much good blood into our own veins .

		We are only too glad to renew our youth with him now by being taken a second time over some of the walks among the
Catskills	LOCATION	where Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	was born and where he learned to tramp .

		Good strenuous outings most of these are ; and some of them , such as are described in '' The Snow - Walkers '' and '' A White Day and a Red Fox , '' furnish the seasonable inspira - tion which we need to keep us in the open in spite of cold and storms .

		The essay on the
Southern Catskills	ORGANIZATION	, which tells of Mr.
Bur	PERSON	- roughs 's first ascent of Slide Mountain , is par - ticularly exhilarating .

		Others will be remem bered as among the author 's best descriptions of bird life .

		Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	's photographs are genuinely illustrative , and furnish some good portraits of Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Packard	PERSON	's '' Wood Wanderings '' are quiet strolls in less famous and less dramatic surroundings ; but one does not expect to take fairy walks in bold regions and we already know that when we walk with Mr.
Packard	PERSON	we may expect to meet fairies .

		Starting out with the belief that '' woodland glades and sun - dappled depths '' may easily be peopled with fairies , sprites , and goblins , he sees that the fairies have stitched the poke-berries across the top to keep them from bursting , as is proved by the fact that '' the marks of the needle show , and the tiny puckering made by drawing the thread very tight . ''

		He suspects the fairy urchins of taking l > it 's from tin - partridge l > er - ries when their mothers are not looking , and is sure that the faint glow which you see in your
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 521 path when you walk the wood at night is cast by the candles in the jack-o ' - lanterns which these same urchins make from trillium fruit .

		The same delicate wit serves him in all his hobnobbing with the woodland , and glints back at people in the world outside , making the quaintest associations .

		He can but feel , he says , that the pure lives of the birches '' radiate an influence among the swamp maples , '' and explains : '' Most of the lady birches stand aloof on the upland slopes ; I notice not far enough away to forbid the handsome young maples from climbing out of their mire of dissipation to nibble the dry husks of gravel - bank breakfast food and drink dew among them if they have the courage .

		But not all thus withdraw in whispering groups .

		Down into the swamp others have stepped , and stand among the rubicund roisterers .

		Social workers these without doubt , missionaries of the birch
C. T. U.	PERSON	, who thus give their lives nobly to teach - ing by example . ''

		Under further special favor of the Brother - hood of Walkers , Mr.
Packard	PERSON	received last year a roving commission which sent him south for the winter but on a good ship and not on foot , and gave his genius unlimited opportunity to exercise itself on ''
Florida	LOCATION	Trails . ''

		The greater extent of this other spit of sand , which he says reminds him always of
Cape Cod	LOCATION	, has not blunted the fine point of his delightfully whim - sical but nevertheless accurate observation . ''

		The
Florida	LOCATION	heron , '' he says , '' wading leg deep in the
St. Johns River	LOCATION	, has the same self - conscious dignity , the same absurd rhythmic hesitancy of motion as a wedding procession going up the aisle .

		I have seen a great many grooms wade in and I never saw anything a bit different . ''

		Blue birds and butterflies , cherokee roses and crocodiles , jasmine and pelicans , pigs and palmettos , and all the other varied exuber - ances of
Florida	LOCATION	, become in turn the shrines of his reverent but fanciful devotion .

		A number of photographs bring sunny remembrances of
Palm Beach	LOCATION	, Indian River , the
Everglades	LOCATION	, and numerous Keys to those who perforce must take their
Florida	LOCATION	second-hand .

		A less well-known writer , Mr.
Samuel C. Schmucker	PERSON	, in his group of essays entitled '' Under the Open Sky , '' shows himself a com - petent instructor in this peripatetic school .

		It is quite wonderful to note how much informa - tion he imparts , with no malice prepense , and over how wide a range his wisdom extends .

		Has anyone told us before that in the
spring	DATE	the meadow-lark `` because his yellow breast , now growing more brilliant in readiness for his nearing courtship , would betray him among the bare branches , is quite in the habit of turning his back to any living thing in the neighbor - hood whose movements he mistrusts '' ?

		Of the cricket he says : '' His joy , so a scientist tells us , rises and falls so absolutely with the ther - mometer , that it is possible to calculate ' the temperature with a reasonable degree of pre - cision by the pitch of the ericket 's shrilling . ''

		In like manner we may learn from these carefully - written pages wherein consists the poison of the poison ivy , how the seventeen-year locust spends his cabalistic existence , what method the bee follows in fertilizing the violet , how tragic and loveless is the old age of the grasshopper , how Jack-in-the - Pulpit seasons his religion with pepper , and many other secrets .

		Numerous illustrations , both marginal and full-page , give a further lift to the imagination .

		We feel that all of these '' delegates of the ideal '' are poets at heart ; but it is nevertheless a pleasure to find among them a poet so prac - tised in verse-making that he finds it '' easier to tell the strict truth in poetry rather than in prose . '' ''


October	DATE	Vagabonds '' is the enviable title of Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	's book , which in the reviewer 's plain prose tells the story of a tramp from a
summer	DATE	paradise somewhere in western
New York	LOCATION	to some other place much nearer the city '' Enchanted journey !

		That begins Nowhere and nowhere ends . ''

		But there is little plain prose in the story ; for though not overweighted with verse , it is full of imagination and is there a better term than literary ?

		fancy .

		If the word seems inappropriate at first , it proves gratefully true on perusal of the book ; for Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	, lacking the trained observation of the naturalist , sees in trees and fields and hills the outward embodiment of the dreams of poets and prophets with which his mind is stored . ''

		Can anyone deny , '' he asks , '' that the meadows of the world are greener for the Twenty-third Psalm , or the starry sky the gainer in our imagination by the solemn caden - ces of the book of Job ? ''

		The orchards along the way grow more beautiful because they look like those in the country of
King Alcinous	LOCATION	, and the heavily-laden wains on the farms waken us to our identity with the past when they become '' the slow-moving wagons of our Lady of Eleusis . ''

		Learners in this school of out-of - door idealism will be glad to know what books so keen a critic of the appropriate carried in his knapsack and found not irrelevant .

		They were these :
J. W. Mackail	PERSON	's '' Georgics , ''
Hans Andersen	PERSON	's Fairy Tales ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Sonnets , THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	,
Locke	PERSON	's '' The Beloved Vagabond , '' '' Selections fromR.L.S. , ''
Pater	PERSON	's `` Marius the Epicurean , '' and
Alfred de Musset	PERSON	's '' Premieres Poesies . ''

		Colin , '' Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	's fellow vagabond , is an artist with pencil and brush , and his drawings match the occasional poems in delicacy and truth .

		And for the poems themselves , it is to be said that they are not '' literary '' but real , voicing the sentiment , the romance , and the fervor of all votaries of the ideal , whose prayer is : '' Bathe me in 1 astral dawns , and the morning star and the dew , Make , pure my heart as a bird and innocent as a flower , Make sweet my thoughts as the meadow-mint O make me all anew And in the strength of beech and oak gird up my will with power .

		VARIETY ix CURRENT DRAMA .

		* Not within the memory of living man have acting dramas which yet make the literfcry ap - peal been published so freely as at the present time .

		The group here considered only a part of the season 's promise , is proof of the state - ment , and significant of the fast-growing im - portance of the literary drama in all the lands where letters are cultivated .

		If the movement increases proportionately in the next few years , fiction , that modern tyrant among literary forms , will have to look to its laurels .


M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	has done remarkable things with the play form .

		He has shown the value of indirection through an imaginative appeal which has subtilized psychology , and he has far surpassed Ibsen in the use of the subjective method .

Monna Vanna	PERSON	, '' has he produced an acting drama in the traditional sense ; although '' Sister Beatrice , '' more ob - jective in motive , has considerable dramatic power , beautiful as it is pictorially and in con - MART M AODKLKNK .

Mary Magdelene	PERSON	, '' his new drama , seems som .

		` uliat disappointing , In-oans * - it larks objective dramatic power , while the historical demands seem to clip the author 's genius and forbid a success of '' The Intruder '' type .

		Tin - main situation , to be sure , with the Roman soldier promising
Mary	PERSON	to spare the Christ if she will give herself to the soldier , is of obvious dramatic value ; but there is a lack in the handling : it fails to thrill .

		There is a certain pictorial quality , too , in the scenes , notably that in the house of
Joseph of Arimath &	ORGANIZATION	a , and in the effect of the mob in the garden of Silanns , with the Saviour invisible yet dominating the scene .

		It may well be that these skilful group - ings and plastic manipulations would lend the play fascination when witnessed .

		But on the whole , the material appears to be handled rather tamely , and it is doubtful if this drama can ever stand with the author 's best ; although its good taste in the presence of a delicate theme , and its spiritual elevation , can be heartily recognized .

		After reading the three one-act pieces of
Herr Sudermann	PERSON	grouped under the sombre title '' Morituri , '' one instinctively asks what would be their fate if the author were not famous .

		They possess little or no dramatic quality , and whatever of literary charm is theirs is success - fully eliminated by the translator , whose En - glish is indifferent or worse than indifferent .

		To allow
Herr Sudermann	PERSON	to be Englished by one with so little feeling for idiom , to whom the distinction even between `` shall '' and `` will , '' for example , does not exist , is a pity .

		The first play , the historical sketch called `` Teja , '' is the best of the trilogy , but in no way remarkable ; `` Fritzchen '' is slight and ineffective ; and as for the final piece , '' The Eternal Masculine '' -LRB- a clever title that promises well -RRB- , after two readings I am inclined to give it up , either the translation has ruined it , or it is far below the author 's standard and dangerously near nonsense .


Herr Sudermann	PERSON	's earlier play - group , *
Rosen	PERSON	, '' while no more than minor work , and seamier in themes than the present set , was very much superior as drama . ''


Manila	LOCATION	'' and '' The Joy of Living '' truly seem far away in reading these later specimens of the same author 's play-making .

		\ V hatever the faults of Mr.
Edward Sheldon	PERSON	's '' The Nigger , '' nobody can read or sec it with - out recognizing that it is genuine drama , in contradistinction from the drama that is `` liter - ary . ''

		And one relishes the vigor of this young -
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 528 est of aspirants , after the languid efforts of mature experts .

		When I saw the play at the
New Theatre	LOCATION
last winter	DATE	, it was for me a vigorous and skilful piece , certainly with melo - dramatic touches , but handling a perilous theme in a way to make it inoffensive , while evoking from it a very strong central situation : the love of a Southern man supposedly white for a Southern girl , and the question of what she will do on discovering that he has negro blood in his veins .

		And now , reading the play , I feel that it has good workmanship , the artist 's able control of his material ; it is a piece of liter - ature , which perhaps gets a bit didactic in the last act , but in general the story is allowed to speak for itself , and the situations are there and made much of .

		Moreover , it has the great merit of being about something , and that some - thing worth while ; the drama has a big idea .

		In view of the author 's youth , this play and his preceding '' Salvation Nell '' are immensely promising for Mr.
Sheldon	PERSON	's future , and he will hereafter be looked to as one of the torch - bearers .

		He is very much sur le mouvement .

		The advanced realism of the day the realism that has produced a Wedekind in Ger - many is well exemplified in Mr.
John Mase	PERSON	- field 's The Tragedy of Nan , and Other Plays . ''

		There is something terrible in finding the British rustic types , here studied , so revolting in their characteristics .

		This remark applies less aptly , perhaps , to the title-piece than to the two connected one-act pieces that follow , which , for straight , sullen horror have rarely been equalled in English . ''

		Nan , '' a study of a girl whose lover leaves her , whereupon she kills him , is a skilful and forcible bit of dramatic work , which ought to act well .

		But judging Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	by these examples , I should say that at present he has a chip on his shoulder for his dramatic theory : an attitude , whether for life or literature , not without danger to one assuming it .

		The Kussian genius , large , sombre , impres - sive , is not dramatic at all in the sense that the French genius is : I mean , in the feeling for form , development , and climax .

		There never was a more undramatic play than
Gorki	PERSON	's ter - rible `` Nachtasyl , '' and you have the same ex - perience with the dramas of
Ostrovsky	PERSON	and
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	.

		In fact , the Slav 's desire to come to a grapple with life is , in a sense , a menace to his art .

		One realizes all this afresh when in contact with
Leonid Andreyev	PERSON	's strange , slow - moving , awful , yet unquestionably gripping drama '' Anathema . ''

		It is unthinkable as a playing piece .

		That tremendous prologue where the damned creature of earth jeers at the silent guardian of the heavens could not be visual - ized ; it is an effect for the imagination .

		Nor , one would guess , could much that follows be properly shown : the old Jew ,
David Leizer	PERSON	, is given a large fortune by Anathema , the Meph - isto of the story ; he dispenses it all in charity , the world turns and rends him , and Anathema , whose desire is to prove man bad and God cruel , triumphs over
David	PERSON	's mangled corpse .

		It is a scene of frightful force and significance .

		But when , in the epilogue , this evil spirit re - visits the Maker of things , he finds that Good is still conqueror , and in rage returns to do more impotent evil upon the earth .

		The careless and light-minded will pass this creation by as baffling or even as absurd ; but it is a monumental alle - gory of good and evil , richly humanitarian , and of large and noble implications in its philosophy .

		One reads it in somewhat the same mood as that begotten by the Book of Job .

		And certainly it seems intensely Slavonic in character .

		Standing head and shoulders above every - thing else in the present group as drama is Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's superb '' Justice , '' at once a vital piece of life and literature , and a play of un - questionable fine technique and evident acting value .

		In skill , verity , and life values , it stands by itself , so far , among this author 's plays .

		No - wonder we hear that the English government has already been moved , through the influence of such a drama , to improve the existing prison regulations .

		They seem intolerable , thus pre - sented . ''

		Justice '' illustrates the power of the stage when used aright , albeit the dramatist be the sternest and most uncompromising of real - ists .

		Indeed , those who are looking merely for the vacuously pleasant in play form are warned away from this drama ; it is the most consistent and logical of tragedies .

		But it makes you think , it broadens your sympathy , it gives you the pleasure proper to a work of art .

		And therefore , for some of us at least , it is greatly worth while .

		The story concerns the fate of a young
London	LOCATION	clerk who , desiring money to - help the woman he loves -LRB- the wife of a drunken brute who makes her life wretched -RRB- forges , is caught , and is committed to prison .

		On coming - out , after serving his sentence , he feebly tries to be honest ; he secures a position , but his record hounds him ; the woman he loves is still his care , and his employers , kind men but taking the con - ventional view , tell him he must get rid of her .

		In a final scene , as poignantly true and pathetic as modern drama can show , we see the poor , THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, weak fellow caught again , and taking his own life ; while
Ruth	PERSON	, ont of love for whom his sin has been committed , stands dazed with grief beside him .

		It is impossible to read this mov - ing social document , dramatically so masterly that one tingles with its cumulative power , with - out realizing , perhaps as never before , the spirit of good in things deemed evil ; and without registering a vow to be more charitable in the future .

		Although the drama arraigns the present reformatory procedure , it has a larger meaning too , I think ; it suggests the awful complexity of human society , the mystery of failure , the apparent injustice inherent in a world so often at sixes and sevens .

		Yet is the tone not bitter ; Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	is above all an artist : he presents the facts as he sees them , he lets the facts be special pleaders for him .

		It is devoutly to be hoped that a play so sterling , so representative of the best in the modern realistic school , may soon be seen in this country .

		That discriminating student of French cathedrals ,
Miss Elise Whitlock Rose	PERSON	, gives in her two-volume work on `` Cathedrals and Cloisters of the Isle de
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- a fitting sequel or companion to her earlier books on the cathedrals and cloisters of southern and midland
France	LOCATION	.

		As in those works , too , she has been ably seconded by
Miss Vida Hunt Francis	PERSON	in the illustration of her chapters with nu - merous and excellent photographs .

		The grouping of the matter is not geographical , but by archi - tectural periods , early Gothic , mature Gothic , flamboyant , and pseudo-classic .

		The selection of material from so rich a field has been a perplexing question , but the two ample volumes contain enough to do fair justice to the subject .

		Naturally the authors were tempted to overstep the limits indi - cated by the book 's title , and no one will quarrel with them for occasionally yielding to the tempta - tion .

		In general , the present work seems to do for northern
France	LOCATION	what its predecessors accomplished for central and southern
France	LOCATION	.

		The plates are both full-page and of smaller size , giving well both general effects and minute details .

		Following up his studies of the
Borneo Head	LOCATION	- Hunters with similar researches among the natives of another tropical island in the same quarter of the globe , Dr.
William Henry Furness	PERSON	, 3rd , has written a substantial volume on '' The Island of Stone Money :
Uap	ORGANIZATION	of the Carolines '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The medium of exchange which gives its name to the book consists of `` large , solid , thick , stone wheels , ranging in diameter from a foot to twelve et , having in the centre a hole varying in size with the diameter of the stone , wherein a pole may be inserted sufficiently large and strong to IH.-H - tin - weight and facilitate transportation . ''

		The origin and use of this cumbrous currency form the subject of one of the most entertaining chapters in tin - delightfully written book .

		Religion , burial rite - .

		native house * , costumes and adornments ,
Uap	ORGANIZATION	friendships , tattooing , dance and posture songs , and other things curious and novel , together with a treatise on
Uap	ORGANIZATION	grammar and a seventy - four-page vocabulary of the language , fill up the rest of tin - volume .

		Thirty-one pictures , from photographs taken by the author , serve to make more real the strange scenes described .

		To the reader craving something new in the department of travel ,
The Island	LOCATION	of Stone Money '' can be cordially recom - mended .

		The terrible story of the great earthquake in
Sicily	LOCATION	and
Calabria	LOCATION	is told by an eye-witness of its disastrous effects and an active worker for the relief of its victims , in an attractive volume entitled
Sicily	LOCATION	in Shadow and in Sun '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- by that always delightful chronicler of tilings Italian , Mrs.
Maud Howe Elliott	PERSON	.

		As Secretary of the Ladies ' Auxiliary of the American Relief Com - mittee , Mrs.
Elliott	PERSON	had the best of op -RSB- x > rtunities to study the relief work from first to last ; and Mr.
Elliott	PERSON	, who was with her , made drawings and took photographs of the memorable scenes , whereby the book is very greatly enriched .

		As usual with her .

		the author has made her book invitingly conversa - tional and first-personal in its tone .

		Even the hor - rors of the earthquake receive a welcome softening from the charm of the manner in which they are related .

		But there are other things to claim one 's attention besides the sufferings of the stricken dis - trict .

		Chapters on

Taormina	LOCATION	,
Syracuse	LOCATION	, and on the building of the new
Messina	PERSON	, with pas - sing glimpses of famous visitors to the relief cam -RSB- -RRB- .

		diversify and enliven the narrative .

		The book , like its companion volumes from the same pen , is printed in the clearest of type and attractively bound , while in wealth and variety of illustrations it probably surpasses them .

		Conspicuously excellent by reason of its half - hundred photogravure plates , printed in soft and pleasing tints , is Mr.
Joel Cook	PERSON	's handsome two - volume work on `` The
Mediterranean	LOCATION	and its Borderlands '' -LRB- Winston -RRB- .

		The method of treatment is descriptive and historical , the western shores and islands of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	being taken up first , and the older lands of the
Levant	ORGANIZATION	reserved for the latter part of the work .

		The recent large increase of travel , especially in the winter , to the sunny shores of the greatest of inland seas makes timely and useful this attractive guide-book , which is of course indexed and otherwise arranged to facilitate reference .

		Among subjects of modern interest in these pages so largely devoted to old-world topics , occurs a description of the great
Assouan Dam	ORGANIZATION	, which began its beneficent work of irrigation only a few yean ago .

		A good map of the regions de -
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 525 scribed would not have come amiss , but none is to be found in the book .

		Ornate gilt binding , out - side cloth wrappers , and a box of the same material , contribute to the beauty and durability of the vol - umes .

		A volume compactly printed and full of informa - tion acceptable to the tourist , as also to the stay-at - home reader , comes from the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	in Mr.
Edward Hutton	PERSON	's ''
Siena	LOCATION	and
Southern Tuscany	LOCATION	. ''

		Having already written a book on '' The Cities of
Umbria	LOCATION	, '' the author is sufficiently familiar with and sufficiently in love with this section of
Italy	LOCATION	to write enthusiastically and with much first - hand information .

		Rather whimsically , however , he insists on the superiority of the old mediaeval highway , the
Via Francigena	LOCATION	, as the one proper route to follow in journeying through
Southern Tuscany	LOCATION	, partly because it was the way of the
Franks	PERSON	into
Italy	LOCATION	and the road our ancestors followed in visiting
Rome	LOCATION	.

		The exact route signifies little , so one gets a view of all that is worth seeing ; and much of this is embraced in Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	's book , which is made additionally attractive by the twenty - eight illustrations it contains , sixteen of them being beautiful colored views executed by Mr.
O. F. M. Ward	PERSON	.

		After
Siena	LOCATION	, the reader is conducted to
Asciano	LOCATION	,
Rapoland	LOCATION	,
Serre	PERSON	,
Lucignano	ORGANIZATION	,
Sinalunga	LOCATION	,
Montepulciano	PERSON	,
Arezzo	LOCATION	, and many other places of interest .

		Poetry and charm would not be looked for by many in the mud of the
Missouri River	LOCATION	.

		Neverthe - less Mr.
John G. Neihardt	PERSON	, the
Nebraska	LOCATION	poet , has found inspiration in that turbid flood of waters for his volume of romance from real life , '' The River and I '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		From
Benton	LOCATION	, in
Montana	LOCATION	, at the head of
Missouri River	LOCATION	navigation , to
Sioux City	LOCATION	in
Iowa	LOCATION	he and two companions made their leisurely way by row-boat , meeting with divers adventures and enjoying every mile of the journey , so far as head winds and other unavoidable adverse condi - tions would allow .

		On reaching his destination the author confesses that he has never felt at home in a town .

		`` Towns , after all , are machines to facil - itate getting psychically lost , '' he declares .

		Asked at the outset what he expected to find on his journey , the poet-philosopher replied briefly : '' Some more of myself . ''

		Fifty illustrations from photographs that appear to have been taken on the way appro - priately accompany the reading matter .

		The book is one to give the conventionalized city-dweller a wholesome jolt .

		Others beside the doughty Colonel have hunted big game in
Africa	LOCATION	, and have written about it , too .

		Among these author-huntsmen Mr.
John T. Mc	PERSON	- Cutcheon deserves commendatory notice , the more so that he is not only a lion-killer and an agreeable writer , but also able to illustrate with his pencil the thrilling adventures chronicled by his pen , being indeed well known as cartoonist of the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Tribune . '' ''

		In
Africa	LOCATION	: Hunting Adventures in the Big Game Country '' -LRB- Bobbs-Merrill -RRB- is a book about as large as Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's similar volume , and describes events that took place at about the same time as those that form the subject of `` African Game Trails . ''

		In fact , the two American hunters met , and not the least interesting portion of Mr.
McCutcheon	PERSON	's book is that relating the interchange of courtesies and stories between them .

		It was an expedition organized by Mr.
Akeley	PERSON	, the famous African hunter , that Mr.
McCutcheon	PERSON	joined , and its experience was an eventful one .

		Numerous draw - ings , frequently humorous , are sprinkled through the book , which is further illustrated from many photographs .

		No hasty impressions are recorded in Miss
Irene A. Wright	PERSON	's ``
Cuba	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , but rather the matured opinions and convictions of a ten years ' residence -LRB- somewhat interrupted -RRB- oh the island , '' the last four of which have been spent largely in travelling hither and yon through its provinces , on work entailed first by connections with local news - papers , next by an appointment as special agent of the Cuban department of agriculture , and , finally , by the business of editing a monthly magazine which describes the island principally from agricul - tural and industrial points of view . ''

		These words indicate fairly well the author 's point of view in the present work , although her book is rich in miscel - laneous information and incidents of personal ex - perience .

		In a chapter entitled '' '
Cuba Libre	PERSON	' a Farce , '' as occasionally elsewhere in the volume , she does not hesitate to draw aside the veil covering the sordidness and selfishness of many of the motives actuating our late intercession and our inglorious war with
Spain	LOCATION	.

		Half-tone plates are lavishly used in illustrating the book , which runs to the length of five hundred pages .

		In a series of nineteen day-excursions about Lon - don ,
Miss Aida Rodman de Milt	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- or De
Milt	PERSON	, whichever she prefers -RRB- saw so much that is worth seeing , and that the visitor to
London	LOCATION	often omits , that she has prepared an inviting volume , '' Ways and Days out of

Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , fully illustrated with the aid of a camera , describing and depicting the views , the buildings , the incidents , and the people that made those nineteen days so memorable to her and to her tourist companions ,
Sonia	PERSON	and
Diana	PERSON	.

		Among the places thus easily and quickly accessible from
London	LOCATION	are
Hampton Court	ORGANIZATION	,
Ascot	ORGANIZATION	,
Rochester	LOCATION	,
Richmond	LOCATION	,
Ely	PERSON	, Maiden - head ,
Epping	LOCATION	Forest ,
Dulwich	LOCATION	,
St. Albans	LOCATION	,
Canter	PERSON	- bury , and
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		But Oxford we do not find on her list , rather strangely .

		The light and breezy style in which the author has endeavored to present these holiday-makings is indicated by the remark of an aged guide at Harbledown : `` I like to show the church to American ladies .

		They always say something to make you laugh ; and we might as well laugh whenever we can , you know . ''

		The sixty-six pictures in the book greatly stimulate the interest .

		In an unfrequented spot in the Bernese Alps , in a mountain chalet which she christens '' Chalet Edelweiss , '' about a mile and a half from the THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	,
Grindelwald	LOCATION	station on the road to the
Upper Glacier	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Edith Elmer Wood	PERSON	and her family minus its head , who is a naval officer and had been ordered to
the Philippines	LOCATION	passed a recent sum - mer of
Arcadian	ORGANIZATION	peace and happiness and simplicity ; and she now chronicles the blissful experience in engaging fashion , with plentiful illustrations of Swiss scenery , in a book entitled '' An Oberland Chalet , '' published by
Weasels & Bissell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Walking excursions and other innocent and healthful recrea - tions helped to occupy the time , and as the scenes and characters described are not those familiar to the tourist , the narrative successfully avoids the Nth repetition of the Utterly Familiar . ''

		Mrs.
Wood	PERSON	's style has the sparkle of wit and merriment and high spirits , and her book has a wholesome and tonic effect .

		Artistically bound and boxed , it is also a pleasure to the eye .

		The comparatively unknown interior of
Sicily	LOCATION	, with its survivals of ancient customs and supersti - tions , is entertainingly treated in Miss
Louise Caico	PERSON	's `` Sicilian Ways and Days '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		In the province of
Caltanissetta	LOCATION	, the only Sicilian prov - ince with no sea-coast , the author was long a so - journer , mingling familiarly with the natives and snap-shotting them and the scenes amid which they live .

		From these numerous photographs , taken with a small camera , and in no expectation of ever publishing any of them , a large number have been selected for the illustration af the photographer 's book , being arranged two on a page and showing an unexpected clearness of detail .

		Even the surfeited reader of travels will find novelty and piquancy in
Miss Caico	LOCATION	's pages .

		In gaining the confidence and friendship of the inland Sicilians , who are by nature secretive and disposed to suspect the visiting stranger , she has been fortunate , and her readers will profit by her ability to draw the curtain from before much that usually remains hidden to the conventional traveller .

		Dr.
Charles W. Townsend	PERSON	's '' A Labrador Spring '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- is a tale of ornithological travel and adven - ture along northern shores .

		The author is evidently a naturalist , but not of the closest type .

		He is a lover of the out-of-doors , and writes a pleasing narra - tive of the cruise of '' La Belle Marguerite '' from the Acadian village to the
summer	DATE	homes of the Montagnais Indians .

		The book is replete with ob - servations on the peculiar flora , the birds and other denizens of these bleak shores .

		The author is also a student of human nature , and his accounts of his northern friends , both Indian and white , are enter - taining .

		The book is beautifully and abundantly illustrated , and gives on the whole a very satisfactory glimpse into this little-known and inhospitable land .

		A narrative of personal experience among the leaders of thought and action in
Norway	LOCATION	is to be found in
Martha Buckingham Wood	LOCATION	's A Trip to the Land of the Midnight Sun '' -LRB-
Brando	PERSON	's -RRB- , a series of brief chapters devoted to a wide range of Nor - wegian topics .

		The writer 's discourse is mainly of persons , interspersed with casual references to the physiographic , climatic , and social conditions of this the most truly democratic nation of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The intense and serious intellectual activity of this sturdy people is revealed in the author 's converse with one and another .

		Their well-founded pride in their authors , musicians , and artists , and the large share which women take not only in the political but in the intellectual life of the people , is often revealed by the passing comment .

		HOLIDAY ART BOOKS .

		Two large , handsomely printed , and fully illn -- trated volumes are added to the '' Classics of Art '' series -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The pathetic story of that artistic genius who worked his way up from obscurity and poverty to the high level of
Reynolds	PERSON	and Gains - borough in the patronage of fashionable
London	LOCATION	and in the judgment of connoisseurs is again told , and well told , in Mr.
Arthur B. Chamberlain	PERSON	's ''
George Romney	PERSON	. ''

		His life is related in Part I. ; `` The Man and his Methods '' is the heading to Part II. ; and `` His Art '' is considered in Part III .

		More than seventy plates , including one of Romney as painted by himself , and including also , of course , a number of Lady
Hamilton	PERSON	's portraits in various characters , are given as examples of the artist 's style .

		Bibliography , appended details , and copious index are duly provided , and the whole work , for which the public appetite has been whetted by Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's ''
Fenwick	PERSON	's Career , '' should meet with a cordial reception .

		In Mr.
A. J. Finberg	PERSON	's `` Turner 's Sketches and Drawings '' is presented a well - systematized and , in general , a chronological study of
Turner	ORGANIZATION	's art as illustrated by those twenty thous - and and more preliminary sketches with which his death enriched the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	.

		The collection Mr.
Finberg	PERSON	has found to be `` of very great psy - chological interest .

		It shows clearly upon what basis of immediately presentative elements the airy splendour of
Turner	ORGANIZATION	's richly imaginative art was built : and amongst the twenty odd thousand sheets of drawings in all stages of elaboration , the embry - onic forms of most of the painter 's masterpieces can be easily traced . ''

		One hundred plates , including a colored frontispiece , show these initial conceptions of the artist in various stages of completion .

		Of psychologic and also of more general human inter - est to the average reader , the book is sure to appeal strongly to the artist and the artrlover . ''

		French Portrait Engraving of the XVIIth and XVIIIth Centuries '' -LRB- Bell-Macmillan -RRB- is a detailed and more or less technical account of that branch of art , from
Claude Mellan	PERSON	of the early seventeenth to Janinet and others of the late eighteenth century , with some notice of MeUan 's predecessor * and a preliminary chapter on the general characteristics of the French school .

		The author , Mr.
T. H. Thomas	PERSON	, says of this school that it '' had no inde - pendent existence before
1625	DATE	, and it was brought to an end by the Revolution ; since then the por - traits engraved in
France	LOCATION	have either been academic imitations of the old work , or else in a wholly differ -
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 527 ent manner . ''

		Thirty-nine excellent reproductions of noteworthy engravings illustrate and explain the writer 's criticisms and comments , which are grouped under three main divisions , '' The Seventeenth Century , '' `` The Louis XV .

		Period , '' and `` The Louis XVI .

		Period . ''

		The book closes with a com - mendably full list of French portrait engravers of the two centuries under discussion , the list includ - ing the chief foreign engravers who adopted the French method and style .

		Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	has sought to fill a gap in art history , and it is safe to say that no such careful and critical and reasonably exhaustive treatment of the subject has before appeared .

		Napoleonic literature , vast though it is , has hith - erto contained no work treating fully that blithesome branch of art called caricature as applied to the world-familiar form and features of the Little Cor - poral .

		This lack is now abundantly supplied by the two ample volumes of Mr.
A. M. Broadley	PERSON	's '' Napoleon in Caricature '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , to which Mr.
J. Holland	PERSON	Rose contributes an adequate '' Introductory Essay on Pictorial Satire as a Factor in Napoleonic History . ''

		Both men have already written learnedly and at length about
Napoleon	PERSON	, and they enter upon their present task well equipped .

		The first volume is devoted to English caricature of
Britain	LOCATION	's hated foe , while the second takes up French , German , Italian , Spanish , Russian , Dutch , Swiss , and
Scandi	LOCATION	- navian caricature .

		American caricature of Napoleon seems not to have claimed the author 's attention .

		Nearly two hundred and fifty illustrations , of which twenty-four are colored , present the more interesting specimens of Napoleonic caricature and the portraits of some of the more eminent caricaturists .

		Mr.
Broadley	PERSON	has done his work well , and , we should say , has done it for all time .

		Miss
Elisabeth McClellan	PERSON	, whose long superin - tendence , at the
Philadelphia Library	LOCATION	, of that de - partment of literature which treats of the history of costume has made her a trustworthy authority on the subject , supplements her '' Historic Dress in
America	LOCATION	, 1607-1800 '' with a companion volume , `` Historic Dress in
America	LOCATION	, 1800-1870 , '' both handsomely produced by
Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		As is said in the prefatory note to the latter work , `` many books have been written on the houses , the furniture , and the decorations of the century we have so lately seen pass into history , but of the costumes chosen and worn by our immediate ancestors very little - has been recorded in print . ''

		Naturally it is the dress of women that occupies by far the larger portion of Miss
McClellan	PERSON	's book .

		The quarto size of its pages affords space for group - ing the costumes of a period in a striking and extremely interesting manner .

		From old-time wear - ing apparel , from nineteenth-century photographs and prints , from paintings , and from other trust - worthy sources the large number of illustrations have been drawn .

		There are some in pen-and-ink and some in half-tone ,
Miss Sophie B. Steel	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Cecil W. Trout	PERSON	being the artists .

		The de - scriptive matter shows careful study of a large number of authorities , a list of which and an index and a glossary close the book .

		Mr.
Charles H. Caffin	PERSON	, who writes on art in a way so intelligible and so interesting even to those who are neither artists nor very highly educated in art history and criticism , has issued another of his popular manuals on painting .

		This time it is '' The Story of Spanish Painting '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- that he has chosen to tell , in much the same manner as his '' Story of Dutch Painting . ''

		A preliminary chapter on '' The Story of the Nation '' presents the physical environment of Spanish art , and is followed by use - ful chapters on the characteristics of that art and a panoramic view of its development to the opening of the nineteenth century .

		The succeeding chapters are devoted to a few of
Spain	LOCATION	's greatest painters , from '' El Greco '' in the sixteenth century to
Goya	ORGANIZATION	, who died in
1828	DATE	.

		A '' Postscript '' pays brief attention to Fortuny ,
Pradilla	PERSON	,
Zuloaga	PERSON	, and a few others of our own time .

		Thirty-three full-page plates convey such hints of the merits of the masters discussed as can be given in the black-and-white of half-tone reproductions .

		HOLIDAY BIOGRAPHIES AND MEMOIRS .

		A considerable number of entertaining episodes from real life are brought together in a large and handsome volume entitled '' The Rose Goddess , and Other Sketches of Mystery and Romance '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- , enriched with a profusion of portraits and other illustrations .

		Lady
Constance Russell	PERSON	, ex - perienced narrator of such tales of romance -LRB- see her '' Three Generations of Fascinating Women '' and her '' Swallowfield and its Owners '' -RRB- , is the author of the book .

		Each of its component sketches , she says , introduces one or more charac - ters nearly or remotely connected with her family , so that , although several of them are old stories re - told , she has been able to add , from private sources , some new and intimate details .

		These sources she seldom distracts the reader by naming .

		Never allowing a good story to be spoiled in the telling , she carries her willing listeners swiftly and agree - ably along , from the romance of the '' Rose Goddess '' -LRB-
Kitty Kirkpatrick	PERSON	,
Carlyle	PERSON	's supposed first love , concerning whose history in more detail the student should consult Mr.
Raymond C. Archi	PERSON	- bald 's book of a year ago -RRB- through the fortunes of
Louise de KeVoualle	PERSON	and some of her descendants , the marriage of Lady
Elizabeth Keppel	PERSON	to
Lord Tavistock	LOCATION	, and what came of it , the strange dis - appearance of
Benjamin Bathurst	PERSON	, of the British diplomatic service , the history of
Sarah	PERSON	, Marchioness of
Exeter	LOCATION	, and other diverting narratives .

		Appended matter , including notes and a genealogical chart giving
Louise de KeVoualle	PERSON	's pedigree , and an index close the book .

		Of the numerous pictures , twenty - eight are collotype plates , and the remaining twenty - two half-tone prints .

		From a new and rather surprising point of view Mr.
W. R. H. Trowbridge	PERSON	contemplates the char - THE DIAL -LSB- Der .

		!

		; , acter and deeds of that mighty magician , Count Cagliostro , in his book entitled `` Cagliostro : The Splendour and Misery of a Master of Magic '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Entering upon his work with never a doubt that this famous wonder-worker was the arch - impostor he is generally supposed to have been , Mr.
Trowbridge	PERSON	was '' astonished to find how little foundation there was in point of fact for the popular conception . ''

		Accordingly his conscientious study of the man is no parrot-like repetition of the familiar tale of his alleged impostures ; but whether he suc - ceeds in his attempt '' to correct and revise ... a false judment of history , '' we will not , off-hand , undertake to say .

		The reader will enjoy deter - mining for himself what degree of success has been gained in this rather formidable , if not hopeless , enterprise .

		At any rate , the book is unique among the many accounts that have been written of the famous charlatan , as he will still continue to be called .

		Illustrations , chiefly portraits , are abund - antly supplied to heighten the attraction of this undeniably attractive book .

		Women 's looks were
Byron	PERSON	's books , and folly was all they taught him .

		That , in brief , is the lesson of Mr.
Francis Cribble	PERSON	's extended work of nearly four hundred pages on `` The Love Affairs of Lord Byron '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The poet 's whole life , observes the author , '' was deflected from its course and thrown out of gear : first , by his un - happy passion for
Mary Chaworth	PERSON	; secondly , by the way in which women of all ranks , flattering his vanity for the gratification of their own , importuned him with the offer of their hearts . ''

		But in regard - ing
Byron	PERSON	's love affairs as '' the principal incidents of his life , and almost the only ones , '' Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	goes a little too far .

		Byron had his friendships , as well as his loves , he had his literary projects and ambitions , and also his literary squabbles , and he had a most real and active interest in Greek inde - pendence .

		Still , a life of Byron with chief refer - ence to his affairs of the heart is the kind of biog - raphy to appeal successfully to the public , and it is the sort of work Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	has before now engaged in to the satisfaction of his readers .

		The present volume is provided with portraits , and is printed in Urge , clear type , with division into short and invit - ing chapters .

		Biography somewhat after the fashion of
Miss Muhlbach	LOCATION	is presented in Miss
Marie Hay	PERSON	's generous volume entitled `` The Winter Queen : Being the
Unhappy History	ORGANIZATION	of
Elizabeth Stuart	PERSON	,
Electress Palatine	LOCATION	, Queen of
Bohemia	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Both title-page and preface frankly proclaim the book to be a romance ; but as the author prepared herself by special study and a special journey to
Prague	LOCATION	before putting pen to paper , and as her hand is by no means new to this sort of writing , her work merits respectful attention .

		Her heroine , the con - sort of
Frederick V.	PERSON	who reigned in
Bohemia	LOCATION	just one winter -LRB- 1619-20 -RRB- , is truly a romantic character as portrayed in Miss Hay 's pages .

		The
Stuart	PERSON	charm has taken possession of the author , and t la - reader is exposed to the risk of falling a victim to the same fascination .

		The moderate length of tin - chapters , the sufficiency of brisk conversation , the rapid succession of events , and the interspersed portraits of the chief characters , certainly give t la - book an inviting appearance .

		Lady
Dorothy Nevill	PERSON	has followed up her chatty '' Reminiscences , '' of four years ago , with another volume of like anecdotal and retrospective character . ''

		Under Five Reigns '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , completed last sum - mer and edited by her son , was prompted by 1 1 it - fact that , as the writer says , she has come across further notes and letters connected with the social life of the Victorian and Edwardian eras , a number of which it seemed to her might not prove unacct - | > : able to her friendly readers .

		Born in the reign of '' the first gentleman of
Europe	LOCATION	, '' Lady
Dorothy	PERSON	has witnessed the accession of four succeeding monarch - to the throne of
England	LOCATION	.

		Given a good memory and a ready pen , a life of that length , lived in society , affords material for much enlivening reminis - cence ; and the author has not been blind to her opportunity .

		The pictures in the book include , be - side numerous portraits , three pages of amusing sketches from the pen of
Richard Doyle	PERSON	, one of whose letters in fascimile is also given .

		The lunik is a treasury of memories of auld lang syne .

		Mr.
Frank Hamel	PERSON	, whose studies and previou - writings qualify him to speak umlerstandingly on the subject , has prepared a volume on '' The Dauphines of
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Pott -RRB- .

		`` In gathering into one volume , '' he says in his preface , `` the biogra - phies of fifteen princesses , some familiar , others as yet Very little known to English readers , it has been obviously impossible to give an exhaustive history of each , but I have aimed at producing in every case a finished study of life and character . ''

		From
Jeanne de Bourbon	PERSON	in the fourteenth century to Marie-The ` rese in the nineteenth , this portrait gallery of women who had fame thrust upon them exhibits a succession of characters that compel one 's interest if only by reason of the scenes and events amidst which they lived .

		Nor are fascinating per - sonalities lacking among them , as , for instance ,
Mary Stuart	PERSON	,
Marie	PERSON	-
Adelaide	LOCATION	de
Savoie	LOCATION	, and
Marie	PERSON	-
Antoinette	PERSON	.

		Of course the book is not deficient in portraits of these dauphines , nor is it without its full and useful index .

		It also contains , in its open - ing pages , what the author believes to be the first account in English of the position of the dauphine at the French court and of the ceremonial which sur - rounded those in the direct line of succession to the throne of
France	LOCATION	. ''

		A history of fops and foppery has been zealously undertaken and elaborately executed by
Miws Clare Jerrold	PERSON	in a good-sized octavo volume entitled `` The Beaux and the Dandies '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		James Ha \ .

		Earl of
Carlisle	LOCATION	, is the first of a long succession of magnificent leaders of fashion whom the author makes to strut and smile and ogle for our benefit , and Count d'Orsay , more than two centuries later , is the last of this brave company to be met with in
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 529 her amusing pages .

		Beau
Nash	PERSON	of course figures prominently in those pages .

		Chesterfield ,
George Selwyn	PERSON	,
Charles James Fox	PERSON	,
King George the Fourth	ORGANIZATION	, and the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	appear also among those more or less addicted to foppery .

		Seventeen well-chosen pictures help the reader to a better acquaintance with all these delectible dandies .

		An index concludes the hook , but there is neither annotation nor bibliography to temper with too great seriousness the gaiety of its sprightly chapters .

		HOLIDAY EDITIONS OF STANDARD LITERATURE .

		In no more inviting and beautiful form has Miss Mitford 's '' Our Village '' ever appeared than in the large octavo , clearly-printed , wide-margined , appro - priately and profusely illustrated edition now issued by the
Macmillan Company	ORGANIZATION	, with an extended Introduction by Mrs.
Anne Thackeray Ritchie	PERSON	. ''

		For people who are beginning to remember , rather than looking forward any more , '' she says , `` there certainly exists no more delightful reading than the memoirs and stories of heroes and heroines , many of whom we ourselves may have seen , and to whom we may have spoken . ''

		If not
Miss Mitford	ORGANIZATION	's actual characters , we have all seen persons answering well some of her graphic descriptions .

		No sketches in all English literature are more wholesomely engag - ing , in their quiet way , than
Miss Mitford 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The sixteen colored plates provided by Mr.
Alfred Rawlings	PERSON	for this edition breathe the very air of '' Our Village '' ; but not less pleasing , and even more gracefully delicate and beautiful , are the one hundred line drawings executed by Mr.
Hugh Thomson	PERSON	.

		No play of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's bears repeated re - reading better than '' Hamlet , '' and even though one may know it almost by heart it will be most agree - able to read the familiar drama once more in the sumptuous new edition illustrated by Mr.
W. G. Simonds	PERSON	and provided with a detailed synopsis or paraphrase of the play and an account of its origin by Sir
Arthur T. Quiller-Couch	PERSON	.

		The latter writer takes occasion to express his disbelief in Hamlet 's madness .

		The text of the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	edition has been followed , and notes are conspicuously absent .

		Nothing but the frequent highly-colored pictures will distract the reader 's attention , and these well - conceived and not too realistic illustrations will hardly be complained of as an unwelcome distrac - tion .

		They are thirty in number , loosely mounted on heavy inserts .

		The volume in its style and size is suited to the table , not to the unsupported hand .

Hodder & Stoughton	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		`` The History of a Conscript of
1813	DATE	, '' which many readers will remember , with affection or the reverse , as having been imposed upon them at school as compulsory French reading , appears in an ex - cellently printed and generously illustrated edition -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Text illustrations are interspersed with colored drawings , not so artistically excellent as to distract the reader 's attention from the story ; and of the translation we are told in a prefatory note that it '' is based on that issued by Mr.
John Camden Hotten	PERSON	, about
1871	DATE	, '' but that it has been compared with '' an early French edition , and thus numerous verbal errors and inaccuracies have been corrected . ''

		The same note gives a brief sketch of the joint authors of the story ,
Emile Erckmann	PERSON	and
Alexandre Chatrian	PERSON	.

		As a handy , clearly printed , and inexpensive edition of this famous historical romance , the book merits hearty commendation .

		Mr.
Arthur Rackham	PERSON	finds inspiration for his annual holiday volume in
Wagner	PERSON	's '' Nibelung 's Ring . ''

		The cycle is to be completed in two volumes , the one now ready containing '' The Rhinegold and the Valkyrie , '' the text newly trans - lated into English by Miss
Margaret Armour	PERSON	.

		The new book is similar in size and make-up to Mr.
Rackham	PERSON	's other notable volumes ; the illustrations are as usual printed in colors and separately mounted on tinted sheets .

		Mr.
Rackham	PERSON	touches nothing that he does not adorn , and his `` Ring '' pictures are full of imagination , quaintly humorous , mysti - cal , suggesting in sweep of line the colossal grandeur of the theme .

		In comparison with his earlier work , however , they lack a certain spontaneity and a delicacy of fancy that has been one of the artist 's chief charms ; the freshness of genuine inspiration is not upon many of them .

		-LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- A serviceable , well-illustrated , sufficiently-anno - tated , and inexpensive edition of
Goldsmith	PERSON	's poems , with a biographical and critical introduction by Mr.
Horatio Sheafe Krans	PERSON	, is published by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		Nine pictures in photogravure , from original designs by Mr.
Frederick Simpson Coburn	PERSON	, help to interpret the poet , several of them being views executed at
Lissoy	LOCATION	, the '' sweet Auburn '' of `` The Deserted Village . ''

		The biographical intro - duction , filling seventy-six pages , gives in agreeable and handy form the main facts concerning Gold - smith 's life and writings , with eulogistic comment on the poems .

		Dr.
Krans	PERSON	is in love with his theme , and it will not be his fault if the reader fails to conceive a new affection for this most amiable of British poets .

		The immortal love-story of '' Aucassin and
Nicol	PERSON	- ette , '' that perpetual challenge to the dexterous translator , has tempted Mr.
Eugene Mason	PERSON	to essay another version .

		A comparison with the original shows his rendering to be free , but in admirable harmony with the spirit of the romance , and his paraphrases of the metrical portions to be in the metre of the French , and , in every case , nearly or exactly of the same length as the original .

		The typography and decoration of the book , including six fanciful colored illustrations by Mr.
Maxwell Armfield	PERSON	, are tasteful .

		A more agreeable English dress to this old French classic could not reasonably be desired .

		-LRB-
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- A limited edition of Gray 's `` Elegy , '' hand lettered , printed on Italian hand-made paper , sewed by hand with silk , and with a hand-colored frontis - piece and initial letter , is issued by Mr.
F. J. Trezise	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		A decorative border encloses each page 530 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, of text , and the printing is on one side only of the paper , which is folded , however , so as to give the book no unusual appearance on opening it .

		The total effect is distinctly artistic and pleasing .

		Two hundred copies have been printed .

		HOLIDAY FICTION .

		Rural scenes and strongly marked rural char - acters form the staple of Mr.
Frank Waller Allen	PERSON	's The Golden Road '' -LRB-
Weasels & Bissell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which is rendered especially attractive to the eye by Mr.
George Hood	PERSON	's tinted decorations and excellent illustrations . ''

		Oldmeadow , '' a
Kentucky	LOCATION	village on the
Ohio	LOCATION	, is the scene of the story , and
Jean Francois	PERSON	, '' the Happy Pedler , '' and poet as well as pedler and umbrella-mender , is one of the chief dramatis personce .

Abbl Jacques Picot	PERSON	,
Nance Gwyn	PERSON	, and
Charles Reubelt King	PERSON	, the narrator .

		As a quiet bit of character-study and deft character-drawing the book is very pleasing , and does credit to Mr.
Allen	PERSON	.

		As usual , a number of short stories have this year been published in form suitable to the gift season .

		Mrs.

Alice Barber Stephens	PERSON	and decorative page borders lend it a holiday air .

		`` A Christmas Mystery : The Story of Three Wise Men '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , by Mr.
William J. Locke	PERSON	, is a powerfully related episode in the life of three eminent Londoners .

		As a magazine story it attracted much attention ; in a prettily decorated booklet it is sure to prove a popular gift Poetic , delicate , little sketches , often allegorical in form , are Mr.
Emerson Hough	PERSON	's `` The Singing Mouse Stories '' -LRB-
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Accordingly the different sections of
New England	LOCATION	that he became familiar with , and also something of the
England	LOCATION	and the
Italy	LOCATION	of his European days , are successively treated , with a natural emphasis on the relation between his environment and the products of his genius .

		Whether or not that environment was of so great moment to one of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's introverted nature , may remain an open question ; but the story of his successive '' life experiences '' is of per - ennial interest , and the publishers have given of their best , in clear type , handsome binding , and numerous illustrations , -LRB- the latter including many views of old buildings from early prints -RRB- , to make Miss
Clarke	PERSON	's well-written book appeal successfully to a discriminating taste .

		Originality in conception and treatment is to be found in Mrs.
Emily James Putnam	PERSON	's thoughtful , well-written , and sufficiently learned work on `` The Lady : Studies of Certain Significant Phases of her History '' -LRB-
Sturgis & Walton Company	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book 's purpose is `` to suggest in outline the theories that various typical societies have entertained of the lady ; to note the changing ideals that she has from time to time proposed to herself ; to show in some meas - ure what her daily life has been like , what sort of education she has had , what sort of man she ha * preferred to marry ; in short , what manner of terms she has contrived to make with the very special con - ditions of her existence . ''

		The eight chapters into which it is divided take up , successively , the Greek lady , the Roman lady , the lady Abbess , the lady of the castle , the lady of the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	, the lady of the salon , the blue-stocking lady , and the lady of the slave states .

		Available sources for illustrating such a book as Mrs.
Putnam	PERSON	's are not lacking , and they have been freely drawn upon .

		With its richly decorated cover and fair , large print the volume is very inviting .

		Mr.
Warwick Goble	PERSON	, whose colored illustrations for
Kingsley	PERSON	's '' Water Babies '' will be remembered
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 531 as a pleasant feature of last year 's holiday season , now reappears as the illustrator of a large octavo volume entitled '' The Green Willow , and Other Japanese Fairy Tales '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The stories , thirty-eight in number , which make up the text have been gathered by Miss Grace James from various sources . ''

		Some have been selected from the Ko - ji-ki , or
Record of Ancient Matters	ORGANIZATION	, which contains the mythology of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Many are told from memory , being relics of childish days , originally heard from the lips of a school-fellow or a nurse .

		Certain of them , again , form favorite subjects for representation upon the Japanese stage . ''

		Mr.
Goble	PERSON	's forty delicately-colored illustrations are sur - prisingly successful in reproducing the native atmo - sphere of the tales , and altogether the volume is one of the most charming and unusual of the season 's offerings .

		The steam-ship , no less than the sailing vessel , is a thing of beauty and of power .

		The history of this marvellous product of many inventive brains is fully related in Mr.
R. A. Fletcher	PERSON	's '' Steam-Ships : The Story of their Development to the present Day '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , uniform in style with Mr.
E. Keble Chatterton	PERSON	's '' Sailing Ships and their Story . ''

		Not only is the evolution of the modern ocean grey - hound traced from the first rude constructions of
Rumsey	LOCATION	and
Fitch	PERSON	and
Stevens	PERSON	and Fulton , but the author even goes back to such vague mention of ox - driven or man-driven paddle-wheel craft as is to be found in early literature .

		One hundred and fifty illustrations are provided , including views of mach - inery and of vessels in process of building , and the descriptive matter will interest both the naval archi - tect and the general reader .

		We look in vain among the pictures for the famous old stern-wheeler of the
Mississippi River	LOCATION	, and for the '' Great Eastern . ''

		A model of the latter , however , is represented , and also an interesting contemporary caricature .

		Floating docks , the evolution of the battle steam - ship , the development of steam auxiliary , the turbine engine , and other related matters are adequately treated .

		The life of the lowly , sympathetically depicted , has far more of wholesome human interest than many a biography of the high and mighty .

		`` A
Shepherd	ORGANIZATION	's Life : Impressions of the South Wilt - shire Downs '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- has to do with the poor and obscure but on the whole contented and cheer - ful folk of pastoral
England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
W. H. Hudson	PERSON	is the author , and he has been ably seconded in his work by Mr.
Bernard C. Gotch	PERSON	, the illustrator .

		One
Caleb Bawcombe	PERSON	,
South Wiltshire	LOCATION	shepherd , is a prominent character in the rambling narrative , but there are others to divide the interest .

		Curious bits of natural-history lore from various sources enrich the chapters and prove the author to be intellectually acquisitive and also keenly observant .

		Among matters relating to sheep-culture we read with some surprise that sheep-bells in
England	LOCATION	are used chiefly if not solely because the shepherds , unprovided with the pastoral pipe of classic times , crave music of some sort , and get it in the tinkling of many bells , twenty-five or thirty to a flock .

		Mr.
Gotch	PERSON	's many admirable line drawings , and his colored frontispiece view of Old Sarum , display much skill and taste .

		To those readers who find
Gibbon	PERSON	's '' Decline and Fall '' too formidable to undertake , and even
Signer Ferrero	PERSON	's far less ponderous works not suffi - ciently light , Mrs.
Elisabeth W. Champney	PERSON	's '' Ro - mance of Imperial Rome '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is well calcu - lated to prove an acceptable presentation of some of the most interesting episodes in the history of the
Eternal City	LOCATION	.

		From the times of Augustus to the reign of
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	she conducts the reader through a succession of stirring scenes , making free use of anecdote and dialogue to enliven her pages , which are further diversified with numerous and excellent illustrations , partly in photogravure and partly in half-tone , reproducing both famous places and buildings of interest and also celebrated paint - ings having to do with Roman characters and events .

		The colored frontispiece , the ornamental binding , the large type and its open setting , the spacious margins , and , last but not least , the absence of index and notes , proclaim the book a source of enjoyment and diversion rather than a giver of historical in - formation and useful instruction .

		Mr.
M. A. De Wolfe Howe	PERSON	's dignified and inter - esting volume on ``
Boston	LOCATION	Common '' -LRB-
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will find a welcome far beyond the boundaries of that city .

		In four chapters he presents the memorable features and associations of the Common in the seventeenth , eighteenth , nineteenth , and twentieth centuries .

		The last , however , as being not yet in its ` teens , is dismissed with little ceremony and but a few remarks .

		Thirty-five excellent plates from sources more or less ancient adorn the book and greatly enhance its interest .

		Like the careful scholar that he is , Mr.
Howe	PERSON	closes with a list of his `` sources of information '' and an index .

		The book , beside being well bound , is also boxed .

		The edition is limited to five hundred and fifty numbered copies . ''

		Rumbo Rhymes , or The Great Combine '' -LRB- Har - per -RRB- , by Mr.
Alfred C. Calmour	PERSON	, and '' rendered into pictures '' by Mr.
Walter Crane	PERSON	, teaches , in a set of rollicking jingles , the wrongfulness of eating , beating , over-working , and otherwise oppressing our brothers and sisters of the brute creation .

		The book may fall considerably short of making all its readers vegetarians , but it is sure to amuse them if they be young in years , or in heart , or in both .

		The numerous animal pictures , all in a profusion of color , are in Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's well-known style , and most happily match the rhymes in whimsical and good-natured absurdity .

		Marginal pictures in considerable variety , tinted and decorative in effect , as well as full-page colored illustrations , all from the practiced hand of Miss
Sarah S. Stilwell	PERSON	, profusely adorn the new edition of Mr.
Edward Sandford Martin	PERSON	's popular book , '' The Luxury of Children , and Some Other Luxu - THE DIAL , -LSB- I ** - .

		16 , riea '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		These talks on domestic matters a subject on which we all feel qualified to express ourselves in agreement or disagreement with the author , especially if we chance to have no domestic life of our own as a disconcerting check to our abstract theories are of universal appeal , and they are now presented in a form that leaves nothing to be desired .

		Three successful books for the dweller in the open are reissued by the
Outing Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	in uniform bindings of green limp leather and offered together in a neat cloth case as `` The Robinson Crusoe Library . ''

		Mr.
Horace Kephart	PERSON	's `` Book of Camping and Woodcraft '' and '' Camp Cookery '' and Dr.
Charles Stuart Moody	PERSON	's '' Backwoods Surg - ery and Medicine '' are the three volumes comprising the set .

		Kurh is a practical and accredited manual , upon which the camper or woodsman may safely put reliance .

		A more acceptable gift for one who sojourns , either casually or habitually , out-of-doors will not be found among the season 's publications .

		An appropriate and beautiful gift book for
Christ	LOCATION	- mas has been prepared by Miss
Eleanor Hammond Broadns	PERSON	in her `` Book of the Christ Child '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , which presents a number of the more important legends concerning the infant Jesus , simply and interestingly told , alternating with poetical selections from various sources , and abund - antly furnished with reproductions of famous paint - ings by the old masters .

		Both poems and pictures are in harmony with the book 's purpose , which , the author explains , is '' to present picturesque material which is comparatively unfamiliar in a Protestant country , '' and not `` to give religious instruction . ''

		Old and young alike can find something to please them in the handsome volume .

		From a new publishing concern ,
The Abbey Com	ORGANIZATION	- pany of
Chicago	LOCATION	, comes a little group of choicely - printed booklets .

		Whittier 's `` Snowbound '' is an addition to the '' Abbey Classics , '' a series of English poems artistically printed on
Japan	LOCATION	vellum , with rubricated initials and photogravure portrait A beautiful Christmas story is to be found in the late Dr.
Frederic Dewhurst	PERSON	's `` The Magi in the West and their Search for the Christ '' It relates how the Wise Men met again , this time to search for the kingdom of Christ on earth , and how at last they found it in the power of love .

		The third of the group is ' * A German Christmas Eve , '' translated from the German of that popular humorist ,
Heinrich Seidel	PERSON	.

		The story , which is taken from his master - piece , ''
Leberecht Htihnchen	PERSON	, '' is a delightful picture of home life in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The little book is printed in two colors , and daintily bound .

		The
San Francisco	LOCATION	publishing house of
Messrs. Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	maintains its enviable reputation as publishers of artistic and original holiday volumes .

		Their most attractive publication for this season is a limited edition of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's '' Sonnets from the Portuguese , '' printed in italic type on hand - made paper , and tastefully bound in boards , with decorated title label .

		A photogravure portrait and especially designed initial decorations coni -RSB- > ri - .

		Mr.
Arthur Guitcnnan	PERSON	contributes a preface and notes .

		`` The Book of Hospitalities '' is an attractive guest book , with guest greetings in verse by Mr.
Arthur Guilt-mum	PERSON	.

		who also contributes a '' foreword '' on '' Old House Mottoes . ''

		Decorations in green on brown-toned
Brittany	PERSON	paper and binding of brown boards with leather back are in the publishers ' characteristic style .

		`` The Complete Cynic , '' being '' Bunches of Wisdom Culled from the Calendars of Oliver II .

		i - ford ,
Ethel Watts Muniford	PERSON	, and
Addison Mizner	PERSON	, '' is a mirth-provoking collection of distorted proverbs with appropriate illustrations and decorations .

		`` The College Freshman 's Do n't Book , '' by `` G. F. E. -LRB- A. B. -RRB- , '' covers a multitude of college subject - from dress and dining to '' things in general . ''

		Most of the advice is humorous and all of it is good .

		Patience and Her Garden , '' by
Miss Ida Smith Decker	PERSON	, is `` a whimsical parable for club-women , house-keepers , '' and other busy people .

		It is bound in paper , as is '' Love and Friendship , '' a collection of epigrams by Miss
Lillyan Shaffner	PERSON	.

		The '' Im - pressions Calendar '' for
1911	DATE	is composed of fifty - four sheets , each containing a motto beautifully decorated and illuminated .

		First place among the small anthologies of the sea - son belongs to Mr.
Temple Scott	PERSON	's '' The Christinas Treasury '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In outward form the volume is exactly uniform with the same compiler 's collection entitled '' In Praise of Gardens , '' published a few months ago ; and is edited with equal good judgment in the choice of material .

		The dec - orative cover , tinted end-leaves , and inviting typog - raphy are all in the best of taste .

		One of the most popular among year-books has been Mrs.
Florence Hobart Perm	PERSON	's `` The Optimist 's Good-morning . ''

		To it she has now added a companion volume , '' The Optimist 's Good-night '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , full of tonic thoughts for the days of the year .

		Each page contains a helpful quotation and a prayer .

		`` A Manual of Spiritual Fortification '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is a compilation by Mrs.
Louise Collier Willcox	PERSON	, of `` meditative and mystic poems '' expressing `` the abiding sense in man of - the indwelling God . ''

		Besides the intrinsic charm of the poems , the col - lection is interesting historically , as tracing the prog - ress of religious , as distinguished from doctrinal , feeling through the course of English poetry .

		Inspiring quotations from American and foreign authors have been gathered into an anthology by Mr.
H. Wellington Wood	PERSON	, under the title , '' Golden Words Fitly Spoken '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The extracts are printed in large type , in two colors , and portraits of a dozen or more of the authors represented serve as illustrations .

		`` Songs of Sentiment '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an anthology of love lyrics of all ages , printed with decorated page borders and illustrated in color by Mr.
