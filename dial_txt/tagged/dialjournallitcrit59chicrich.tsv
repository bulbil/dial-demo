Philosophy of Common Sense	ORGANIZATION	is considerable .

		For half a century the
Philosophy of Common Sense	ORGANIZATION	was the dominant philosophy in American universities ; and it is to the Scottish president of an American college -LRB-
James McCosh	PERSON	of
Princeton	LOCATION	-RRB- that we owe the most comprehensive study of it .

		In
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	it has never been much appreciated , but in
France	LOCATION	it exercised a great influence through
Victor Cousin	PERSON	-LRB- 1792-1867 -RRB- , who made it the greatest power in French philosophy of the period .

		In recent years , in
France	LOCATION	, there has been a recrudescence of interest in the Scottish philosophy through the writings of Professor
T. T. Laurie	PERSON	, who attempted , in several able works , a critical reconstruction of the traditional
Scottish Natural Realism	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Scottish Philosophy of Common Sense	ORGANIZATION	originated as a protest against the skeptical conclusions of
Hume	PERSON	, and the hypotheses found in
Locke	LOCATION	and
Descartes	LOCATION	.


Thomas Reid	PERSON	was the first man to see clearly the genesis of
Hume	PERSON	's skepticism , and in this little volume he gives an admirable account of his investigations of the principles upon which this skeptical system was built .

		35 THE PITY OF IT !

		The passion aroused in the German breast
last August	DATE	, when it became evident that En - gland , the old-time champion of the menaced liberties of
Europe	LOCATION	, had no intention of evad - ing its honorable obligations toward
Belgium	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, and viewed treaties as being dis - tinctly something more than scraps of paper , was characterized by a peculiar form of petu - lance .

		We read with sorrowful amusement of the
Kaiser	PERSON	's actions in casting off the various honorary distinctions bestowed upon him in happier times by the English government , and in thus reducing to a considerable extent the number of costumes in his wardrobe .

		A more serious matter was offered by the many Ger - man scholars who forthwith disclaimed any further membership in the scientific and lit - erary associations of the enemy nations , and flung back upon the donors their medals and degrees and official titles .

		While this act , also , was so childish as to be amusing , it had besides a very serious and ominous aspect , for it be - tokened a rupture in the intellectual common - wealth that was bound to work much mischief long after the warring peoples should have come to terms upon the battlefield .

		To many of us , this was the most harrowing thought of the war the thought that the world 's comity of intercourse in things spiritual , the strongest bond of brotherhood that civilization has estab - lished among men , was likely to be shattered as regarded the nation to which the rest of the world is in so many fields of achievement so heavily indebted .

		The thought weighed intol - erably upon those whom culture had broad - ened to world-mindedness , and who were brought by it to a more poignant sense of the meaning of warfare than is possible to the homme sensuel moyen who eggs on the com - batants from narrow motives of pelf or mis - guided patriotism .

		The thing was not without precedent .

		We recall the similar amenities which were a by - product of the Franco-Prussian War .

		We recall , for example , the case of Pasteur , who returned his diploma to the
University of Bonn	ORGANIZATION	, saying : '' Now the sight of that parch - ment is odious to me , and I feel offended at 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 24	DATE	seeing my name , with the qualification of Virum clarissimum that you have given it , placed under a name which is henceforth an object of execration to my country , that of
Rex Gulielmus	PERSON	. ''

		The counter was neat and emphatic : '' The undersigned , now Principal of the Faculty of Medicine at
Bonn	LOCATION	, is re - quested to answer the insult which you have dared to offer to the German nation in the sacred person of its
august	DATE	Emperor ,
King Wilhelm	PERSON	of
Prussia	LOCATION	, by sending you the expres - sion of its entire contempt .

		P. S. Desiring to keep its papers free from taint , the Faculty herewith returns your screed . ''

		It was Renan , however , rather than Pas - teur , who carried off the honors in these exchanges of diplomatic notes between the great powers of European scholarship .

		His correspondence with
D. F. Strauss	PERSON	offers a masterpiece of the delicate and deadly satire , or caustic irony , which no stylist but a French - man could possibly have at his command .

		Commenting , nearly a year later , upon the fact that
Strauss	PERSON	had published the correspondence in a pamphlet ,
Renan	PERSON	said : '' It is true that you have done me an honor which I am bound to appreciate .

		You yourself have translated my reply and included it with your two letters in a pamphlet .

		You have had this pamphlet sold for the benefit of an establishment for wounded German soldiers .

		God forbid that I should quibble upon a point of literary property !

		The charity to which you have made me contribute is a work of humanity , and if my feeble prose has been instru - mental in bestowing a few cigars upon the men who looted my little house at Sevres , I thank you for having given me the opportunity to conform my conduct with certain of the principles of Jesus that I believe to be the most authentic .

		But I must call your attention to a delicate distinction .

		Assuredly , if you had permitted me to publish one of your writings , it would never have occurred to me , never in the world , to do it for the benefit of our Hotel des Invalides . ''

		How profoundly
Kenan	PERSON	's nature was stirred by the Franco-Prussian War , and how poig - nantly he felt the disruption of intellectual comity that it inevitably entailed , may be seen on many a page of his '' Reforme Intellectuelle et Morale , '' from which the above passage has been translated .

		This is indeed a volume for the present times , replete with wisdom , and infused w r ith the noblest of feeling .

		We read in the preface : '' It had been the dream of my life to labor , to the extent of my feeble powers , for the intellectual , moral , and political alliance of
France	LOCATION	with Ger - many , an alliance that should bring
England	LOCATION	in its train , and constitute a force capable of ruling the world , directing it in the ways of liberal civilization , equally apart from the naively blind impulses of democracy and from the puerile velleities that would have it retrace its steps toward a past that is definitely dead .

		My dream , I admit , is destroyed forever .

		An abyss is dug between
France	LOCATION	and Ger - many ; centuries will not avail to fill it .

		The vio - lence done to
Alsace	LOCATION	and
Lorraine	PERSON	will long remain a gaping wound ; the guaranties of peace dreamed by German journalists and statesmen will be guar - anties of wars without end ... What we loved in
Germany	LOCATION	, its breadth of view , its lofty conception of humanity , exists no longer .


Germany	LOCATION	is now nothing more than a nation ; she is at present the most powerful of nations ; but we know how endur - ing are these hegemonies and what they leave behind them . ''

		At the close of
Kenan	PERSON	's correspondence with
Strauss	PERSON	comes this melancholy refrain : ''
France	LOCATION	is about to say with your Herwegh : ' Enough of that sort of love ; let us try hatred for a change . '

		I shall not follow her in this new course , the success of which may be doubted .


France	LOCATION	holds to a resolve of hatred less than to any other .

		In any case , life is too short for it to be wise to waste time and dissipate energy in so wretched a sport .

		I have toiled in my humble sphere to bring about friendship between
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	; if now the ' time to refrain from embracing ' has come , as the Preacher says , I will withdraw .

		I will not counsel hatred after having counselled love ; I will keep silent . ''

		How closely all these old matters are par - alleled in the present tragic hour is apparent to every reader of the history that is now being made from day to day .

		The correspondence between
Strauss	PERSON	and Renan finds its counter - part in the letters exchanged
last autumn	DATE	between
Herr Gerhart Hauptmann	PERSON	and
M. Romain Rolland	PERSON	.

		The petulant attitude of German scholarship is once more illustrated by Professor
Kuno Meyer	PERSON	, who has recently taken such offence at some poor verses of anti- German tenor contributed by an undergradu - ate to the ''
Harvard Advocate	ORGANIZATION	'' that he has held the
University	ORGANIZATION	responsible for the '' vile poem , '' and indignantly repudiated the plan to make him an '' exchange professor '' in that institution for the coming year .

		His screed addressed to President
Lowell	PERSON	speaks of '' this gratuitous and shameful insult to the honor and fair fame of a friendly nation , '' declares
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and its President to be '' branded before the world and posterity as abettors of international animosity , as traitors to the sacred cause of humanity , '' expresses the hope that '' no German will again be found to accept the post of exchange professor at
Harvard	LOCATION	, '' and voices his regret that he himself was ever
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL induced '' to set foot in the defiled precincts of a once noble university . ''

		And the occasion for this outpouring of emotion is nothing more than the fact that an irresponsible student , in a publication entirely controlled by students , has written in a sense antagonistic to the Ger - man cause !

		Hinc illce lachrymcc .

		Was there ever so amazing an exhibition of childishness on the part of a man supposed to stand for light and leading !

		Such matters are symptomatic of a breach which is not so much a rift within the lute as an unbridgeable abyss and the gulf has been , if possible , widened by the attitude of the Ger - man nation toward the `` Lusitania '' crime , frankly adopting and defending the Black Hand method of warfare , and openly exulting in its ghastly outcome .

		The intensity of the feeling engendered between
Germany	LOCATION	and the powers she has made her foes finds so many illustrations that it is disheartening to think of the legacy which her aggression will be - queath to the coming generation .

		What hope can there be of a resumption of friendly rela - tions either in the political or the intellectual sphere when such a man as Professor von Ley - den of
Berlin	LOCATION	can utter such sentiments as these : '' No self-respecting German will ever consent to remain in any room of which an Englishman is the occupant .

		If the German can not eject the English - man he will himself leave the room .

		We can not be expected to breathe the same polluted air as our deadliest foes , who fell upon us from the rear and in the dark .

		There can be no compromise on this point .

		We have to swear a national vendetta against the English never to rest , never to cease our preparations for another war , never to spare an effort until the last semblance of English power is destroyed , and there will be no rest or repose for any honest German till the
British Empire	ORGANIZATION	has been swept into the oblivion of past history . ''

		The virulence of hatred found in ` this utter - ance and in the famous Hassgesang is typical of the German attitude in its present aberra - tion .

		While opinion in the opposing camps does not go to such extremes , it is nevertheless determined on the question of future relations with the enemy .

		The French attitude is re - ported by Mr.
Stoddard Dewey	PERSON	, who knows the contemporary French mind in all its workings , in the following words : `` Whatever may be the terms which
France	LOCATION	will have to accept or which will be imposed on
Germany	LOCATION	, all human relations of Frenchmen with Germans have ceased indefinitely ... Every French con - sciousness , erroneously or not , is filled with too keen a sense of intolerable wrong for human intercourse until
Time the Healer	ORGANIZATION	has passed . ''

		Viewed sub specie ceternitatis -RCB- this is clearly an impossible situation , but it is one that will prolong the tragedy of the present clash of arms long beyond the date of the formal treaty of peace .

		It will take many years to bind up these wounds , and bring either of the com - batants to the standpoint of `` malice toward none and charity for all . ''

		But the intellec - tual severance , we feel assured , can not last forever ; to believe that it will so last is to take counsel of despair and to reject utterly the unifying ministry of idealism to the over - wrought mind .

		Perplexed in the extreme though the issue now be , the future , if far dis - tant , must bring a return to acceptance of the faith that in matters of the spirit all the races of mankind have a commonwealth of which the franchise is offered to every sincere seeker after goodness and truth and beauty .

		Every indication of a return to the sanity of outlook in this vitally important matter should be re - ceived with generous hospitality as a welcome harbinger of the reconciliation that the future must bring as an atonement for the distraught present .

		Some such indications are already at hand , significantly from German sources , and we trust that they may be multiplied before too grievous a period of estrangement shall have intervened .

		It is the socialist deputy
Herr Haenisch	PERSON	from whom these hopeful words come : '' There has been some talk that in future German science and art must lead their own life and that foreign scientific work should not be reviewed in German periodicals .

		This is sheer rubbish .

		After the war the nations will be still more dependent upon one another than before , and without the fructify - ing influence of foreign countries our national culture will wither . ''

		And it is the `` Frank - furter Zeitung '' which asks editorially : '' What sense is there in German professors de - claring that they will no longer collaborate with this or that scientific institution in En - gland ?

		Science and art have always appeared as the common possession of civilized peoples , and does not one injure one 's own people and its science by sitting on the stool of isolation and by breaking off scientific intercourse ? ''

		Such utterances as these show that the seed is al - ready being sown of a future comity which it should be the sacred mission of every lover of mankind to further in its growth .

THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
June 24	DATE	In
April of last year	DATE	, the German Shake - speare Society celebrated at
Weimar	LOCATION	the birth - day of the poet .

		It was an international gathering , with guests from many countries ,
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Belgium	LOCATION	being among those represented .

		The delegates came to - gether in the best of good fellowship , joined by the common bond of reverence for Shake - speare 's genius .

		They parted in joyous antici - pation of their next reunion , appointed for
1916	DATE	in the town of
Stratford	LOCATION	, for the tercen - tenary of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		How that dream was shattered a few weeks later we all know .

		But that dream stood for an ideal too precious to be abandoned the ideal of an intellectual community of interest that rises above prejudice , and knows no passion save that of devotion to the high concerns of the spirit .

		One of the privileges of mankind lies in '' beholding the bright countenance of truth in the quiet and still air of delightful studies , '' and it is intolerable to think that this privilege is to be renounced because the fumes of anger have dulled men 's higher faculties .

		For a time , it may well be , such intercourse will be held in abeyance , but it must in the end be resumed , and those who speak the tongues of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and of Goethe must come to real - ize that they can not do without one another , and that no people on earth can do without them .

		Let us pray that the day of that realiza - tion may be hastened , and `` the golden years return . ''

		Meanwhile , pending such consum - mation , we can only say with Othello , '' Oh , the pity of it ! ''

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		THE
A. L. A. CONFERENCE	ORGANIZATION	.

		The thirty-seventh annual conference of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, just com - pleted at
Berkeley	LOCATION	,
Cal.	LOCATION	, has been marked by all the advantages and disadvantages of a convention in an exposition year , near an exposition town .

		The fair induces a large gathering , but it also distracts .

		Not all the librarians who registered as delegates spent their time , or most of it , in attendance upon the sessions of the convention .

		In the election of officers only 87 votes were cast , although the registered attendance was about 700 .

		The absence of a contest partly explains this dis - crepancy , but not entirely so .

		The atmosphere of the meeting was perfect .

		The
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of
California	LOCATION	had opened its hospitable doors to the conference , and not only were general and sectional meetings held in its well-appointed halls , but a large proportion of the delegates found accommodation in the fraternity and sorority houses , besides those who stayed at the hotels and the few who pre - ferred living in
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		There were the usual courtesies , of course .

		The
University	ORGANIZATION	gave a reception in the unique
Hearst	ORGANIZATION	gymnasium ; the City of
Oakland	LOCATION	en - tertained the delegates at a luncheon , and the authorities of
Mills College	ORGANIZATION	, among the resi - dential hills of that city , opened their fine grounds for a lawn party .

		The exposition management welcomed the Association with a brass band , behind which its somewhat amused , but very appreciative , members marched to the Court of the Four Seasons , where they received official welcome on a bronze plaque , and the freedom of the fair .

		The meeting was noteworthy as being some - thing of a family affair among the members .

		No outsider , eminent or otherwise , addressed it .

		Even
California	LOCATION	's lieutenant-governor , announced on the programme to speak at one of the sessions , was called away to
Sacramento	LOCATION	by urgent state business .

		None of the literary stars , of whom
California	LOCATION	has more than one in her firmament , intruded his presence or extruded his opinions .

		There were addresses on books and on printing by two
New York	LOCATION	- ers not members of the Association
Henry W. Kent	PERSON	, secretary of the Metropolitan Mu - seum , and
T. M. Cleland	PERSON	; but these gentlemen spoke as friends of libraries and lovers of books , rather than as outsiders .

		To make up for the absent statesmen and litterateurs ,
the Association	ORGANIZATION	listened to some of the best that its own members were able to furnish .

		Note - worthy among the papers was a charmingly appreciative critique of modern poetry by
Miss May Massee	ORGANIZATION	, editor of the
Association	ORGANIZATION	's '' Booklist , '' in which she showed that poetry - is to-day coming into its own , if we are to judge by the increased use and appreciation of it by readers in our public libraries .

		Mr.
Richard R. Bowker	PERSON	, the veteran editor of '' The Library Journal , '' spoke on '' The Func - tion of the Public Library , '' sketching the his - tory of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	as a typical example of library development a choice perhaps not altogether justified , as few institutions can boast of so remarkable , varied , and interesting a history .

		The tendencies of modern library architecture were sketched , with pictorial illustrations , by Mr.
Chalmers Hadley	PERSON	, librarian of the
Denver Public Li	LOCATION	- brary .

		The trend of branch library develop - ment , according to Mr.
Hadley	PERSON	, is now away from the '' butterfly type , '' with its book body and adult and juvenile wings , about which we
1915	DATE	used to hear so much , and toward a rectangu - lar one - room arrangement , less formal and more homelike .

		This is doubtless true , but it should be noted that this arrangement is hardly suited for large city branches , unless the librarian is willing to exclude adults altogether from his ministrations .

		In such branches we can not yet do without a separate children 's room .

		For large central buildings the speaker commended a kind of '' loft '' plan , with few fixed partitions , and division of book-stacks into sections capable of easy ex - pansion and contraction .

		This type of library is related to those with which we are familiar , somewhat as the Japanese house with its screens is to the familiar American home .

		It is well exemplified in the new library of
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, and we are likely to see a further extension of it in the
Cleveland	LOCATION	build - ing , now planning , where the librarian is con - sidering the abandonment of the orthodox stack room , building his floors strong enough to hold book-shelves wherever he may want to place them .

		Flexibility , however , is not the only desideratum in a library , and we shall probably still continue to see buildings with fixed partitions .

		Among the things done by
the Association	ORGANIZATION	for the improvement of library service throughout the country were the appointment of a committee to cooperate in the expansion of the Decimal System of classification a step taken with the expressed approval of Dr.
Melvil Dewey	PERSON	, the author of the system ; the extension of the schedule for uniform statistical reports to cover the activities of col - lege and reference libraries ; and the authori - zation of a printed manual setting forth the general rules , and especially the limitations , under which loans of books between one library and another are carried out .

		The election of officers resulted in the choice of Miss
Mary W. Plummer	PERSON	for president the second woman who has held the office .

		As head of the
Pratt Institute Library School	ORGANIZATION	, and later of the school established by the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	,
Miss Plummer	PERSON	has long been a conspicuous figure among librarians , and has exercised an undoubted and valuable influence on the progress of libraries in the
United States	LOCATION	, her pupils occupying librarian - ships or other responsible positions in every state of the union .

		The final session witnessed a plea for a more active participation by libraries in pacificist propaganda .

		The speaker , Mr.
George F. Bowerman	PERSON	, librarian of the public library at ``
Washington	LOCATION	, D. C. , argued that the library , as an essentially peaceful institution , would be only adopting a measure of self-preservation by stressing the value of peace whenever it could do so in its activities .

		In the discussion that followed , other members deprecated an attempt to commit libraries in favor of any i movement , no matter how righteous , arguing that their non-partisanship is their most valu - I able asset and that departure from it in one ; instance might make it difficult for them to I resist taking sides in other questions .

		An immediate result of this discussion was the dispatch of a message from the
Associa	LOCATION	- tion to President
Wilson	PERSON	, conveying its sym - pathy and expressing confidence that what - ever course he might pursue in the present crisis would tend ultimately to the establish - ment of international peace .

		While this seems unobjectionable , some members expressed an opinion that the message was capable of inter - pretation as urging '' peace-at-any-price , '' and regretted its form as an excursion beyond those professional limits which such a body as ours usually , with great propriety , establishes for its actions and pronouncements .

		The local and travel arrangements for the convention were carried out with unusual smoothness , the former by a local committee of librarians the latter by
the Association	ORGANIZATION	's own travel committee .

		Most of the eastern delegates proceeded to the conference by spe - cial train from
Chicago	LOCATION	, in an itinerary em - bracing stops at
Denver	LOCATION	and
Glenwood Springs	LOCATION	,
Colo.	LOCATION	,
Salt Lake City	LOCATION	,
Riverside	LOCATION	and
San Diego	LOCATION	,
Cal.	LOCATION	, for the inspection of local libraries and incidental rest and refreshment .

		Altogether , the members have concluded that neither the beauties of
California	LOCATION	's scen - ery nor the hospitality of her citizens have diminished since their last visit , four years a -
ARTHUR E. BOSTWICK	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE CONSOLATIONS OF LITERATURE , like those of philosophy , avail but little against the really serious ills of our mortal lot .

		Neither literature nor philosophy can bake bread to feed a war-devastated
Belgium	LOCATION	or
Poland	LOCATION	, but what little a good book can do to render less intolerable the consciousness of the world 's present wretched plight , seems to be appre - ciated by not a few who are much nearer to the seat of the hideous gangrene than we of the western world .

		In a letter from
Paris	LOCATION	to '' The Book Monthly , '' of
London	LOCATION	, Mr.
James Milne	PERSON	says , among other interesting things : `` Nearly every Frenchman who writes is at the war , or doing something for it other than writing .

		Bookshops which were closed when , the Germans threatened
Paris	LOCATION	, have gradually 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 24	DATE	re-opened and are doing some trade , but not very much ... The Frenchmen and French - women who must read , because reading is part of his or her nature , are turning to the old masters , to the classics , the old familiar faces in print .

		They are reading
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, and
Mirabeau	LOCATION	, and
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, and all the great ornaments of their literature , including that living master ,
Anatole France	LOCATION	.

		They are reading for inspiration , of which they are themselves full , and they are reading for the consolation which a trusty book is in an hour when somebody has lost somebody near and dear .

		They are essentially a literary people , the French , full of all the charm which we associate with the pretty page of a good book , so scholarly in their knowledge , so adept at using it , so logical and clear in their style of writing and their manner of reading .

		They combine poesy with pure reason , and the sun shines through both with a quality which is alike clarifying and warming . ''

		From an - other source of information , the reports of the municipal lending libraries , it is learned that
Paris	LOCATION	is reading many more books than it read a year ago , even though its popula - tion has been diminished by several hundred thousand persons .

		In the
first four months of this year	DATE	the libraries circulated more than thirteen thousand volumes in excess of the circulation for the same period last year ; and the quality of the reading is reported to be as creditable as the quantity .

		If the war is thus really turning the people , or even a small fraction of the people , back to the best things and the serious things in literature , it is ac - complishing at least a grain of good to help offset the mountain of evil .

		AN ARRESTED AUCTION SALE OF VALUABLE AUTOGRAPHS and other kindred matter is one of the recent events of interest to collectors of literary rarities .

		The lately discovered ''
Weare Papers	ORGANIZATION	, '' lost for a century and com - prising a wealth of historical material of great value , were to have passed under the hammer a part of them - , at least in
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia early this month ; but an injunction stopped the sale , the proper ownership of the papers being in dispute .

		As is already known to many , the
Weare	LOCATION	collection takes its name from
Meshech Weare	LOCATION	, first governor of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	after the Revolution , and it is upon the early history of that State that these documents will be found to throw such light as probably to make necessary the re-writing of that history .

		As Americana of inestima - ble worth , their sale at auction would have realized a very pretty fortune for the person or persons now claiming their ownership .

		So far as has yet been determined , the papers seem to have come not quite regularly or legally into the possession of
Jacob C. Moore	PERSON	, an early historian of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, asso - ciated with
John Farmer	PERSON	in the compilation of Farmer and
Moore	PERSON	's `` Historical Collec - tions , '' and this
Moore	PERSON	left the material to his son of the same name , who in turn bequeathed it to a kinsman , Mr.
Frank C. Moore	PERSON	, of
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, in whose possession a part of it was not long ago discovered by persons interested in such researches .

		Another portion seems to be held by another of the original
Moore	PERSON	's - descendants in
Montclair	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, though how the division came about , and who is the right - ful owner of the whole treasure , does not yet appear .

		To stimulate further curiosity as to this collection of rarities , not by any means to satisfy it , let it be noted that it contains , for instance , a deposition before Governor
Brad	PERSON	- ford and
John Alden	PERSON	of
New Plymouth	LOCATION	, with the rare signatures of the Mayflower passen - gers ; twenty-nine autograph letters of Wash - ington ; Governor
Wentworth	PERSON	's proclamation of a day of thanksgiving for the capture of
Quebec	LOCATION	, dated
November 4 , 1759	DATE	; and a copy of the first publication of the Declaration of Independence in
New Hampshire	LOCATION	.

		The
New Hampshire Attorney-General	ORGANIZATION	's attempt to re - cover possession of these precious papers is most natural , and the disinterested outsider must hope that he will succeed .

		A NEW DEVELOPMENT IN COOPERATIVE CATA -
LOGUING	LOCATION	, a branch of library work for which the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	has of late years done so much by its issue of standard cards - ready for insertion in the card-catalogue , comes to public notice in an announcement that appears in `` The Wilson Bulletin '' of recent date .

		This is , in brief , to the effect that the
H. W. Wilson Company	PERSON	, of White -
Plains	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	, has added to its various pub - lications now familiar to most librarians a form of catalogue that can be used by almost any American public library , and is `` practi - cally the fulfilment of Professor
Jewett	PERSON	's idea of a general catalogue of all the books of the country . ''

		In this undertaking '' the work of cataloguing each title is done once for all and the entry preserved by means of the modern linotype slug .

		Each of these slugs contains a line of type in permanent form , and these slugs can be assembled and reassembled an infinite number of times and in any form desired .

		Stock catalogues are issued from time to time , in standard editions of varying sizes , and the library may purchase as many copies as desired of the edition corresponding most closely to its needs , checking in them if
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 11 desirable the titles which the library has .

		It is also possible for a library to have its own catalogue , by merely checking in one of the stock editions the titles desired and sending it in .

		The proper slugs can be withdrawn from their places in the central body of the type , assembled , and if other titles are to be added , slugs for these can be prepared from copy furnished by the library , the whole assembled in proper order and the desired number of copies struck off , after which the slugs are returned to their proper places . ''

		A manifest saving of time and money is thus effected , and one is spared the necessity of doing laboriously what already has been done , or is being done , or will be done , hun - dreds of times , by others .

		THE PATH TO PERFECTION , as someone has said , leads through a series of disgusts .

		With
Bronson Alcott	PERSON	one of these disgusts took the form of distaste for animal food ; or so he tried to persuade himself and the world when he sought refuge at
Fruitlands	LOCATION	from the car - nal allurements of beef , pork , mutton , poul - try , and fish .

		The story of that short-lived colony of vegetarians striving to attain to high thinking by plain living and hard man - ual labor is agreeably told by its founder and some of his associates in ''
Bronson Alcott	PERSON	's Fruitlands '' -LRB- noticed more fully on another page -RRB- , a book that offers many amusing or more seriously interesting passages for quota - tion .

		Here , for example , is a sketch of the method by which mortal frailty and error are to be combated : '' On a revision of our pro- ceedings it would seem , that if we were in the right course in our particular instance , the greater part of man 's duty consists in leaving alone much that he is in the habit of doing .

		It is a fasting from the present activity , rather than an increased indulgence in it , which , with patient watchfulness , tends to newness of life .

		` Shall I sip tea or coffee ? '

		the inquiry may be .

		No ; abstain from all ardent , as from alcoholic drinks .

		` Shall I consume pork , beef , or mutton ? '

		Not if you value health or life . '

		Shall I stimulate with milk ? '

		No . '

		Shall I warm my bathing water ? '

		Not if cheerfulness is valuable . '

		Shall I clothe in many garments ? '

		Not if purity is aimed at . '

		Shall I prolong my hours , consuming animal oil and losing bright daylight in the morning ? '

		Not if a clear mind is an object . '

		Shall I teach my chil - dren the dogmas inflicted on myself , under the pretence that I am transmitting truth ? '

		Nay , if you love them intrude not these be - tween them and the Spirit of all Truth . ''

		And more questions of like sort , with the same negative answer .

		`` Be not so active to do , as sincere to be . ''

		The charms of the sim - ple life have been glowingly depicted by many writers since
Alcott	PERSON	's time , but those unsuccessful attempts , at
Brook Farm	ORGANIZATION	and
Fruitlands	LOCATION	, to perpetuate that life , still re - tain their interest and their pathos for us of to-day ... ANOTHER WORD ABOUT THE WIDENER LI - BRARY , a subject of unfailing interest to book - lovers and book-collectors , comes to our attention in '' The Harvard Crimson , '' from the pen of an unnamed librarian of promi - nence .

		Apropos of the approaching dedica - tion of the new Harvard library building he writes : `` In the centre of the new building will be two rooms in which his -LSB-
Widener	ORGANIZATION	's -RSB- own collection of rare books will be kept .

		Widener began to buy books while in college , and very soon became interested in the first editions of the English writers whom he read .

		He was especially fond of
Stevenson	PERSON	, and the collection of
Stevenson	PERSON	's works became
Widener	ORGANIZATION	's especial hobby .

		He had secured nearly every one of the
Stevenson	PERSON	rarities , and a few others which his mother has since purchased for the collection make this by far the most complete in existence .

		His first edi - tions of
Dickens	LOCATION	,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and other nineteenth-century authors were nearly as complete , and a large number of his vol - umes had autograph inscriptions of the writ - ers ... He had a good many of the famous books of English literature written in the ear - lier centuries .


Caxton	ORGANIZATION	's ` Royal Book , ' the - four Shakespeare folios ,
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's worksy
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	,
Florio	PERSON	's Montaigne , and
Defoe	PERSON	's `
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	' are a few of the more famous of these volumes which will be placed on exhibition next
fall	DATE	. ''

		The loss sustained by young Mr.
Widener	PERSON	's growing collection in the sinking of the '' Titanic , '' which at the same time cut short the life of the collector himself , is a disaster still fresh in memory ... , THE ASCETICISM OF ART , the necessity of forgoing material satisfactions if one would depict with insight and power , whether with brush or pen , some aspect of life as the ideal - ist sees it , is an ancient but an ever-fruitful theme .

		Dr.
Earl Barnes	PERSON	contributes to '' The Popular Science Monthly '' for
June	DATE	an arti - cle on `` The Celibate Women of To-day , '' in which he essays some adequate < answer to the question , `` Why do so many women elect to walk through life alone ? ''

		In recounting the - compensations of celibacy he takes occasion to - say , aptly and well : '' Our real living is never in the mere possession and use of things , but 12 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 24	DATE	in what we think and feel about them .

		Lower animals live in facts ; man lives in his ideas and ideals .

		All life 's values must be found on the way ; when we arrive we are always in danger of becoming unconscious and so losing what we came to get .

		This is why art and lit - erature have always had to find their charac - ters in the struggling classes , the poor and the rich .

		The smug middle classes and the com - fortably rich have the facts of existence ; but they do not know it .

		The universal contempt of those who know for such unconscious living finds expression in the terms bourgeoisie , phil - istines , and bromides .

		On the other hand , struggling and self-conscious groups always attract and interest us .


Bohemia	LOCATION	is poor ; it lacks the facts of property ; but it has the most alluring of all festivals and immortal banquets .

		Who , that has a soul as well as a stomach , would not turn from a banquet of facts at
twenty dollars	MONEY	a plate , with dull un - consciousness of life in the people , to a group of dreamers and wits with very modest fare , and twenty-dollar talk at table ?

		... The poet
Dante	ORGANIZATION	illustrates in his own life the rela - tive value of facts and dreams , of living life directly and living it vicariously , to a singu - lar degree . ''

		All this , with more in the same vein , is everlastingly true , and no wise person would have it otherwise ; although at times , in the unreasoning hunger that will occasion - ally assail even the best of us , it is a little dismaying to reflect that by no possibility can we continue to have our cake if we insist upon eating it .

		THE GROWTH OF THE WHITMAN `` LEGEND . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A few evenings ago I attended the annual ban - quet of the Walt Whitman Fellowship of
Chicago	LOCATION	, held upon the anniversary of the poet 's birth ,
May 31	DATE	.

		The Fellowship is not an '' organiza - tion , '' and its banquets are projected and carried out with as few formalities as possible .

		If you are a '' kindred spirit '' you are welcome .

		Upon the occasion referred to something like 350 men and women falling , supposititiously , in this classifi - cation , sat down to the banquet .

		It is manifestly improper to allude to anything Whitmanic as a '' function '' ; so it may be said that these affairs , originally very limited in scope , have within the past few years assumed quite imposing propor - tions .

		There was an extremely interesting programme .

		The list of speakers included numerous well - known names , and Walt was '' considered '' in various aspects by various devotees .

		Also , poems were read or recited which were offered as typical products of the `` new poetry , '' whose pedigree it need not be inquired too closely how was asserted to trace back , in the direct line of descent , to the
Camden	LOCATION	bard .

		Listening attentively to everything that was presented , I could not but marvel at the rapid growth of the Whitman '' legend . ''

		While Walt died as lately as
1892	DATE	but twenty-three years ago , it is apparent that the day is not far dis - tant when he will assume an aspect almost mythi - cal .

		That the number of Whitman '' fans '' is steadily increasing is evident ; but that their con - ception of the poet is as nebulous as was the classical conception of Homer , the banquet made plain .

		In no other way can their enthusiastic acceptance of and applause for the most gro - tesque assertions about him be explained .

		If
Walt	PERSON	's own word is good for anything , he sought to inculcate nothing so much as tolerance . ''

		There is room for everything in the Leaves , '' he said .

		And when somebody asked him , '' Even for
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	? ''

		-LRB- who was almost his greatest aversion among his own contemporaries -RRB- he re - turned : `` Yes even for him ! ''

		But , listening to the '' interpreters '' who held forth from the speakers ' table , I gathered an overwhelming im - pression of the most fanatical intolerance .

		Broad - sides were poured upon all sorts of hated objects , literary , social , human and divine .

		The vocab - ulary of objurgation and contempt was ransacked for the strongest epithets , and the stream of de - nunciation foamed and lashed about every obstacle in its path .

		And draping it all was what I have previously referred to a series of depictions of
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 13 the poet himself , as distinguished from his ideas and his influence , that was so compendiously un - veracious as to make anyone who really knew the facts stare in undisguised amazement .

		While not occupying the chief position upon the list of speakers , undoubtedly the most eagerly anticipated orator of the evening was a gentleman with a wide reputation as an advocate of '' the new freedom '' in what might be termed its most ultra phases .

		Gifted with a voice of plangent resonance and with marked forensic ability , and throwing himself ardently into his subject , he delivered a discourse that enraptured the vast majority of his auditors .

		That it did not particu - larly enrapture me was , I suppose , because it presented to me a Whitman that I failed to recog - nize ; for the speaker seemed to possess almost encyclopedic ignorance of Whitman the man and of the forces and the environment that produced him .

		Among his statements , for instance , were these : That Whitman was born in poverty , never went to school in his life , was almost wholly without means of literary culture ; that his career was one unbroken struggle against want and discourage - ment ; and that he '' died in a hovel , in poverty and despair . ''

		The facts are that the family into which Walt was born was not poverty-stricken ; that Walt himself enjoyed more '' schooling '' than did many another young American of his time belonging to the social stratum of which he was a part ; that he began work in a newspaper office while in his early teens and for years remained a member of the '' fourth estate '' ; that he was also a school-teacher for a number of years as a young man ; that his early literary efforts were accepted and published in what were then the leading journals of the metropolis , and some of them appeared in book form ; that he was at this period a frequenter of the theatre , the opera , and the libraries , and came into contact with a majority of the `` literati '' and the '' intellectuals '' best worth knowing ; sported a silk hat , a boutonniere , a cane , and affected the appearance and the habits of the carpet knight rather than the shirt-sleeved protagonist of the '' open road . ''

		Furthermore , we know that later on he for a considerable time enjoyed a government clerkship at
Washington	LOCATION	which left him much ef his time to dispose of as he pleased ; that , from the date of the appearance of '' Leaves of Grass , '' while he had a hard fight for recognition as a poet , he was nevertheless never without prominent advocates , eulogists , and '' promoters '' ; that a constantly growing band of enthusiasts gathered around him , with unfailing support , both pecuniary and moral ; that edition after edition of his poems was printed and bought , and that individual pieces appeared in many of the leading magazines and newspapers , while he was also called upon to compose and de - liver special effusions at notable public gatherings and celebrations ; that he had a strong following overseas , and that within his own lifetime the translation of the '' Leaves '' into foreign lan - guages was being taken up .

		Finally , we know that during all his last years a group of the most devoted friends gravitated around him ; that all his wants were sedulously fulfilled ; that he had the best medical attendance procurable ; that he had a nurse and a housekeeper to care for him ; that he lived in a house that was his own property and for years had been ; that he was buried in a mausoleum which he had himself caused to be constructed for the
Whitman	PERSON	family , at a cost , I find it stated , of some
$ 4000	MONEY	; and that his execu - tors , `` much to their surprise , '' found , upon his death , that he had a balance of
several thousands of dollars	MONEY	to his credit in a local bank .

		The orator to whom I refer was either ignorant of these facts , or else , for purposes best known to himself , he not merely ignored but perverted them in order to draw a picture of a persecuted man , upon whom no ray of sunshine ever fell and who died a pauper in the blackest woe .

		At the same time , this orator declared in accents that made the chandeliers vibrate , that the purpose of his re - marks was to elucidate the sacred cause to which Whitman devoted himself and all his works the exposition of the Truth , with a capital T ! ''

		What is truth ? ''

		said an historic inquisitor ages ago , when in doubt regarding an Immortal Personage .

		None of us can be too certain .

		But
Walt	PERSON	, we may take it as assured , is destined to be one of our immortals , and the facts about him are on record .

		That is , some of them are there are others which , for reasons of his own , he chose carefully to suppress .

		Perhaps what we do not know and never can notably , of the '' veiled period '' would be of great help to us in our efforts to unriddle the enigma that , in many ways , he presents to us .

		But what we do know is easily ascertainable , for there is a whole library of the '' documents in the case . ''

		Walt himself , with his unique insight into so many of the peculiarities of what he was fond of referring to as the human '' critter , '' had a pre - monition that it would be wise for him to avoid identifying himself with clubs , fellowships , et cetera , whose avowed purpose was the dissemina - tion of his doctrines .

		Some clairvoyance seemed to warn him , and he steadily refused to give them his personal sanction .

		He had , to be sure , his own little private cenacle , whose incense he found very grateful ; but the spectacle of the
Browning	PERSON	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	societies caused him resolutely to keep within its confines .

		He preferred to '' leave it to the Leaves , '' in which he was not mis - taken .

		At the banquet , however , the '' Leaves '' were not conspicuous .

		Only one of the speakers incorporated any of them into his or her dis - course ; and the table in the anteroom where they were on sale seemed unattractive to most of the banqueters .

		We may say confidently of Walt , however , that , while he chose to maintain an almost sphinx-like reticence regarding certain phases of his career , those which he did desire recorded he wished set down with complete veracity .

		Only recently I have completed my reading of the third and latest volume of
Horace Traubel	PERSON	's bulky series , '' With
Walt Whitman	PERSON	in
Camden	LOCATION	, '' and all are replete with injunctions to alter , expurgate , suppress , or 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 24	DATE	veneer absolutely nothing .

		Nevertheless , the evi - dence is that
Walt	PERSON	's `` legend '' is growing like some tropical parasite , that within no very long time it will so obscure his true proportions as to render them imperceptible save to the student and the historian .

		Creeping all over the surface of this colossal rough-hewn monolith will be an in - sidious growth of '' interpretative '' fable and falsification effectually hiding the reality from view not only hiding , but defacing and defiling it .

		That , during his lifetime , he was the victim of much misapprehension and misinterpretation is a commonplace of Whitman history in which , however , he differed not at all from a host of other great poets and innovators .

		That his posthumous fate will be similar , in degree if not in kind , there is every reason to believe .

		THE
WISCONSIN UNIVERSITY SUEVEY	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The article in your current issue entitled `` A Bull in the
Educational China	LOCATION	Shop '' is enter - taining .

		Will your readers care to have three or four facts which will help furnish a frame into which to fit permanently your picture of the Uni - versity of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	survey ?

		The questions of which you speak as harassing were submitted to the faculty after conference with university officers .

		Including space for answers , they took 39 , not 50 pages .

		Of them the president wrote : '' These questions will give an opportunity to the members of the faculty to pre - sent their cases fairly . ''

		You quote the following statement : '' The sur - vey of the graduate school has been mainly di - rected to its clothes rather than to the living being beneath the clothes . ''

		The survey of the graduate school and graduate work showed the following : Flaunting plagiarism ; slovenly work - manship and unscholarly writing ; lack of orig - inality ; lack of purpose and application ; lack of opportunities for specialization ; presence of graduate students in freshman and sophomore classes , including nine students who were doing exclusively freshman and sophomore work ; in - ability of candidates for a Ph.D. degree to read foreign languages on
November 1	DATE	coupled with certification of their ability to read foreign lan - guages a fortnight later ; lack of plan for re - search ; failure of many departments to develop in absentia graduate work ; the fact that of 389 students enrolled as graduate students 163 had faculty connection ; that of these 389 only 50 were doing exclusively graduate work and that of these 50 , 34 had faculty connection ; lack of supervision ; specific instances of graduate work that was of grammar school grade , high school grade , freshman and junior grade ; the fact that a master 's degree is given by several departments merely for a fifth year of study without speciali - zation ; the university 's endorsement of Ph.D. .

		theses after glaring defects had been pointed out by the survey .

		If these are the '' clothes , '' what is the '' living being beneath the clothes '' in the graduate school ?

		The plagiarism of one thesis is admitted by the university on page 356 of the report .

		Of a second thesis , the fact that it was '' ap - proved by the editor of the series in which it was published '' is cited as contributing evidence of its quality .

		The university comment did not state to the educational world that the editor in question is also the member of the faculty who approved the thesis and who also was joint author .

		Of a third thesis , Professor
Hanus	PERSON	of Harvard wrote : '' It is not a strong presentation .

		On a scale of 10 I should mark the thesis 6 ^ / 2 , it being under - stood that a thesis graded 5 or below would not be accepted . ''

		Of this same thesis a
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	professor wrote : '' I should not accept it with its present organization . ''

		Both letters were written to the university , page 357 .

		In support of the quality of work done by a fourth thesis writer , who specialized in experi - mental psychology and education , it is stated on page 357 that he '' now occupies an honorable post in an eastern university . ''

		The '' eastern '' is
Ohio	LOCATION	, and the '' university '' is an institution that is not considered a university by readers of THE DIAL , or by the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, or by the
Ohio	LOCATION	legislature .

		The work of this specialist in education is minor extension work .

		Of a fifth thesis , page 358 , Professor
Reeves	PERSON	of
Michigan	LOCATION	wrote to the university : '' 6 being fail - ure and 10 excellent I should rank the thesis not over 7 . ''

		Professor
Jenks	PERSON	of
New York Uni	LOCATION	- versity would have accepted this thesis , '' with , however , the condition that it be rewritten . ''

		Of a sixth thesis , it is admitted that one chapter was taken bodily from an English work .

		This chapter is said by the university to be an '' annex , '' although it is the next to the last chapter , with nothing whatever to indicate that it is not an important and integral part of the thesis .

		The university world was not told that the conclusions in this thesis and the greater part of the work appeared in a thesis accepted by the
University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	in
1876	DATE	.

		In defence of a seventh thesis , the university comment , page 355 , says that if the material col - lected and used by the author '' existed for any similar period of mediaeval history , it would be deemed worthy of publication in critical editions . ''

		The university world again was not told that the period for which this material was collected was the Reconstruction period after the Civil War , and that it consists of 35 letters from southern farmers .

		There is evidence of the use of only a small part of even this very small amount of material .

		What the farmers were asked , whether they wrote that they had no time to answer , or could not remember , or whether they wrote facts worth while , was not recorded .

		The other ma - terials upon which this thesis is based have been culled over for the most part by several other writers .

		If American scholarship were to be gauged by this quality and quantity of work , no one would be attributing the revival of learning to the introduction of research methods .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 15 Will your readers also wish to know some of the 37 things which '' the dean of the graduate school of the much lauded
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	is not expected to do '' 1 ?

		First , will you permit me to quote the statement from my report to the effect that these facts were not cited as evidence of incompetence or negligence of that officer , as you said ?

		On the contrary , my report reads , page 163 : '' The above list is given not to raise question as to whether the dean is doing all that may reasonably be expected of his office , but whether the university at present is expecting enough of the deanship of the graduate school . ''

		Who of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	'S readers needs to have evi - dence presented that it is not '' desirable or prac - tical to do any one '' of the following among the 37 ?

		1 To have or act upon , further than through private conference , knowledge as to effi - ciency or inefficiency of instruction in classes attended by graduate students .

		-LRB- No .

		11 , page 161 . -RRB-

		2 To supervise research by graduate students or to have current evidence that research is being supervised or how far it has pro- gressed .

		-LRB- No. 12 . -RRB-

		3 To read theses offered toward advanced de - grees for any other purpose than to see that they fulfill the mechanical requirements as to form .

		-LRB- No. 15 . -RRB-

		4 To require an examiner appointed by the dean to participate in an examination for a doctor 's degree to read the thesis offered .

		-LRB- No. 16 . -RRB-

		5 To have information at the dean 's office as well as in the departmental offices as to qualifications of graduate fellows .

		-LRB- No. 25 . -RRB-

		6 To have any record of examinations for mas - ter 's and doctor 's degrees except the ex - aminer 's certificate that the candidate has or has not been recommended .

		Will your readers wish to know the statement which drove the university to vernacular and to furnish the epitaph for the surveyor 's mausoleum ?

		The statement which is called '' rot '' is this : '' So long as 183 different standards , unchecked and unsupervised administratively are employed .

		.

		in judging students ' work .

		.

		the testing of work can not be well enough done . ''

		Will you invite readers of THE DIAL to write you in case they do not find this statement rot ?

		If it is rot , then a very large number of the faculty are guilty of writing rot because they wrote to the survey pro- testing against present conditions where work that is graded '' failed '' in one class would be called '' fair '' in another .

		One other illustration may help your readers .

		You state that '' so ignorant is Dr.
Allen	PERSON	of the meaning of numbers that he converts a cold sta - tistical statement that class-markings follow the law of distribution of averages into a deliberate intention on the part of the instructor to repress talent . ''

		As stated on pages 484-485 , the purpose of the bulletin on class markings is '' to convince high school teachers that year in and year out with students as they come proper marking will result in
2 %	PERCENT	excellent ,
2 %	PERCENT	failed ,
23 %	PERCENT	good ,
23 %	PERCENT	poor and
50 %	PERCENT	fair . ''

		After showing that this statement did not apply to the university , that the principle was not at work at the university , the survey listed certain defects , page 485 inter alia . ''

		Where attention of supervisors should be directed to quality of instruction this bulletin directs it to distribution of marks . '' ''

		The appli - cation of this principle is not only unfair to indi - vidual children but inhibits where the university should stimulate the determination of teachers to produce excellent results out of seemingly difficult or even seemingly hopeless material . '' ''

		It leaves no hope that a whole class may be brought nearer a standard of excellence than was ever done be - fore . '' ''

		Interest is diverted from the work the child does to the marks other children have re - ceived . ''

		Instead of convincing a teacher that the percentage of failures or poors in her subject should disappear as the quality of her teaching improves and the size of her classes decreases , the bulletin declares , page 10 : '' If the teacher has to do only with small classes the results of several years ' marking , or of several classes in the same subject in the same year , should , when put to - gether , be similar to the marks of a larger group given at one time . ''

		Finally , your readers may wish to know that although the survey set out to be cooperative , although every statement was sent to the uni - versity for confirmation or conference so as to secure agreement as to fact , and although agree - ment was easily reached with respect to early sections until the university discontinued confer - ence with the survey , the following changes were made after I left the state without submitting them to the board of public affairs , or the uni - versity regents , or the advisory committee or to me : Sections publicly agreed to by the university last
October	DATE	are now excoriated .

		Ninety-eight times my name is used in the first five pages , and 259 times in the first 25 pages of the university comment .

		Sections clearly marked as written by others are first called mine and then personally attacked .

		One important section written by a former faculty member who had been for several years in the division which he reported upon , was never shown to me , was written by arrangement with the dean , and yet now for publicity purposes is first called mine and then bitterly criticized with such expressions as '' unsympathetic , '' '' desire to injure , '' `` grossly unfair , '' etc. .

		Will American scholars who do not accept plagiarized theses , who do not assign work for graduate students that can be done by a clerk who has never gone to high school , who do not approve warmed-over , long-winded , disorganized lectures , who are incapable of telling untruth or of intimidating truth , accept ex parte criticism of a work in which 600 faculty members joined , or will the 600 be given a chance to tell their story as they have told it in the survey report ?

June 24	DATE	A GREAT AMERICAN
NATURALIST	ORGANIZATION	.

		* A number of years ago , one of the
Wright	PERSON	brothers was making an aeroplane at
Dayton	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, when an old man , a neighbor , stopped to remonstrate with him . ''

		What a pity it is , '' he said , '' that a clever young fellow like you should so waste his time and money . ''

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	pled , in self-defence , that he really expected to get practical results , when his old friend interrupted , and in solemn tones ad - monished him : '' Young man , let me tell you this : if anyone ever makes a flying machine that will fly , it will not be anybody in
Dayton	LOCATION	! ''

		The Americans are often accused of being a boastful people , who like to hear their eagle scream ; but a close student of our history may find evidences of an excess of humility which has been positively harmful .

		Quite in the spirit of the old man of
Dayton	LOCATION	, we have been slow to recognize scientific ability , not merely in its incipient stages , but even after the work has proved its worth .

		Thus it hap - pens that the name of
Baird	LOCATION	, a truly great man judged by the quality and quantity of his accomplishments , is practically unknown outside of a comparatively small scientific circle .

		Student and teacher at
Dickinson Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege ,
Carlisle	LOCATION	,
Pa.	LOCATION	, he was gratefully remem - bered by his old pupils and associates ; but a recent graduate of that institution assured the reviewer that he had never heard the name of the naturalist .

		He was the creator of the
U. S. National Museum	ORGANIZATION	; yet the visitor to
Washington	LOCATION	finds neither statue nor inscrip - tion on the grounds to commemorate his work .

		At
Woods Hole	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, where he founded a great laboratory for the study of marine life , and where he died in
1887	DATE	, there is indeed an appropriate tablet on a large granite boulder ; while more recently a bust of
Baird	PERSON	was placed in the
American Museum	ORGANIZATION	in
New York City	LOCATION	.

		Agassiz and
Baird	PERSON	belong to the same gen - eral period , and were variously associated in much of their work .

		Yet why is it that
Agassiz	PERSON	is everywhere remembered , while
Baird	PERSON	is forgotten or was never generally known ?

		In many respects their labors ran parallel : each founded and developed a great natural history museum , each published great contributions to American zoology , each in - spired and taught numerous young men who have since continued the work they began .

		A Biography .

		By
William	PERSON
Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
J. B. Lippin	PERSON	- When we compare the results item by item , it is impossible to give
Baird	PERSON	a second place .

		Agassiz came with a great European reputa - tion , was a fascinating and picturesque char - acter ;
Baird	PERSON	was a plain American , hard - working and modest .

		It is impossible to re - sist the appeal which
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	makes to the imagination , and we would grudge him none of his fame ; but after all ,
Baird	PERSON	deserves a much better place in the minds of his coun - trymen than he has ever held .

		Individually and as a nation we need to cultivate a better appreciation of good work done in unsensa - tional ways , and a readier recognition of native American talent .

		After the death of Professor
Baird	PERSON	plans were made for the preparation of a biog - raphy , but for various reasons the work was delayed until it seemed in danger of being abandoned .


Baird	PERSON	's daughter ,
Miss Lucy Baird	PERSON	, was keenly interested in the project , and had accumulated much valuable material , but her death in
1913	DATE	left everything unfin - ished .

		Miss
Baird	PERSON	did , however , leave instruc - tions to her executor to see the memoir completed if possible ; and fortunately at this juncture Dr.
W. H. Dall	PERSON	, on being appealed to , consented to undertake the work .

		Dr.
Dall	PERSON	of the
U. S. National Museum	ORGANIZATION	, eminent as a naturalist and keenly appreciative of
Baird	ORGANIZATION	's character and labors , having worked under
Baird	PERSON	for many years , was in every respect the most suitable person to write the book .

		More than occupied with his own im - portant researches , for the completion of which even the long life we all wish him must be wholly inadequate , it was no small thing to turn aside and undertake the preparation of a voluminous biography .

		Yet it was abun - dantly worth while , and we can not be suffi - ciently grateful that the record has been made in an adequate manner , before it was alto - gether too late .

		Dr.
Dall	PERSON	has not attempted any elaborate or complete analysis of
Baird	ORGANIZATION	's scientific work , which stands as published , and can be re - viewed in detail at any subsequent time .

		He has rather chosen to present to us the man himself , the manner of his life , his friend - ships and ideals , the growth of his personality , and all those intimate things which if not told by those who knew him , could scarcely be known to posterity .

		Perhaps the strongest impression we get is that of wonder at
Baird	ORGANIZATION	's early maturity , his surprising ability as a zoologist when little more than a boy .

		This was well understood by his associates , and by the various eminent naturalists of the day with whom he became acquainted .

		Thus , at the age of seventeen , he discovered a new
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 17 bird , and wrote to the celebrated ornithologist Audubon : '' You see , sir , that I have taken -LRB- after much hesitation -RRB- the liberty of writing to you .

		I am but a boy and very inexperienced , as you no doubt will observe from my description of the Flycatcher .

		My brother last year commenced the study of our Birds , and after some months I joined him .

		He has gone elsewhere to settle and I am left alone . ''

		To which Audubon replied : '' On my return home from
Charleston	LOCATION	, S. C. , yesterday , I found your kind favor of the 4th instant in which you have the goodness to inform me that you have discovered a new species of fly - catcher , and which , if the bird corresponds to your description , is , indeed , likely to prove itself hitherto undescribed , for , although you speak of yourself as being a youth , your style and the descriptions you .

		have sent me prove to me that an old head may from time to time be found on young shoulders ! ''

		The bird proved new , and was subsequently published by the brothers
Baird	PERSON	.

		In
1846	DATE	Baird married
Miss Mary Church	ORGANIZATION	- ill , who , though herself no naturalist , sympa - thetically supported all his endeavors .

		An old servant who was with
Baird	PERSON	for nearly forty years was able to say that he never saw either one angry .

		In illustration of her mother 's kindly tolerance and her father 's sense of the value of time , Miss
Lucy Baird	PERSON	set down the following story , as she got it from Mrs.
Baird	PERSON	herself : '' At the time of his courting , he was exceedingly busy with his college work and also studying very hard .

		After he became engaged , he was anxious of course to spend his evenings with his fiancee and yet did not feel that he could take all that time from his studies ; so he fell into the habit of taking a book with him in order that he might carry on his studies and still have the pleasure of sitting in the room with her .

		Being an early riser and often taking long walks with ^ his class , making collections , my father would be apt to get drowsy towards the end of the
evening	TIME	and was apt towards its close to fall asleep over his book ; so when the hour arrived at which my mother knew he expected to leave , she would wake him up and send him home . ''

		Baird himself , in a letter to Professor
Dana	PERSON	, thus describes his wife in
1850	DATE	: '' My wife is a daughter of Gen.
Churchill	PERSON	, Inspector-General of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, and a first-rate one she is , too .

		Not the least fear of snakes , sala - manders , and such other zoological interestings ; cats only are to her an aversion .

		Well educated and acquainted with several tongues , she usually reads over all my letters , crossing i 's and dotting t 's , sticking in here a period , and there a comma ... In my absence , she answers letters of corre - spondents , and in my presence reads them .

		She transcribes my illegible MSS. , correcting it withal , and does not grudge the money I spend in books .

		In addition to these literary accomplishments , she regulates her family well -LRB- myself included -RRB- and her daughter is the cleanest and most neatly dressed child in town . ''

		The daughter ,
Lucy	PERSON	, then about twenty-three months old , was `` passionately fond of
Natural History	ORGANIZATION	, admiring snakes above all things . ''

		How
Baird	PERSON	, beginning as curator to the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Institution , built up the
U. S. National Museum	ORGANIZATION	, and did many other things in the service of science and of his country , must be gathered from the book itself ; which , while it chronicles
Baird	PERSON	's life , is necessarily also to a large extent a history of the progress of American zoology during a large part of the nineteenth century .

		THE '' MOVIES '' OLD AND NEW .

		* During the World 's Columbian Exposition of
1893	DATE	,
Edison	ORGANIZATION	's Kinetoscope , a contrivance for showing photographs in motion to one person only for about thirty seconds at a time , was displayed to the public .

		Three years later , Sir
Augustus Harris	PERSON	installed
Robert Paul	PERSON	's '' Theatrograph '' at
Olympia	LOCATION	, a ma - chine fundamentally the same as the Bioscope of to-day .

		Contemporaneously with Mr.
Paul	PERSON	's efforts , French inventors were developing the Cinematograph , a machine which was installed at the
Eden Musee	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, during the autumn of
1896	DATE	.

		Only nineteen years have passed , therefore , since the theatrical debut of the motion pic - ture ; yet to-day the business of purveying motion pictures theatrically to the American people is computed to be the fifth largest in - dustry in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Nearly a million people of all ages and of both sexes attend daily the moving-picture theatres of
Greater New York	LOCATION	alone , the attendance throughout the other cities of the country being propor - tionally universal and no hamlet too small to be the home of a `` movie '' theatre .

		Indeed , the motion-picture play , or the photoplay , as it is technically called , far more than the stage play , has become the amusement of the nation .

		Beside the circulation of a photoplay that of a '' best seller , '' or even that of a popu - lar ten cent magazine , becomes insignificant .

		Surely , such a power for good or evil should not be scorned by those having the welfare of the people at heart .

		Better would it be to exclaim : '' I care not who makes the laws of the nation , if I may write its ' movie ' plays ! ''

		Indeed , the photoplay offers to ` the writer his widest means of artistic expression .

		18 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 24	DATE	To the word `` artistic , '' exception will doubtless be taken by those who are in the habit of deriding the `` movies '' as vulgar clap-trap , too crude and garish to be consid - ered artistic ; yet these scoffers seldom , if ever , attend `` movie '' performances and there - fore know little of the possibilities of this new form of theatrical art .

		Scarcely eighteen years old , it is only within the
last five years	DATE	, it might almost be said within the past year , that the photoplay has been developed into the multiple reel play , or the feature film , so - called .

		Previously the slapstick farce , or the crude melodrama in a single reel , was the offering .

		Now the filmed novel or stage play , presented by actors of established reputation , has relegated the one-reel film to the second class theatre , and raised the price of admis - sion in the better class of `` movie '' play - houses from five and
ten cents	MONEY	to twenty-five and
fifty cents	MONEY	, even in some instances to regular theatrical prices .

		This raising of the price has raised the standard of production , the public naturally being unwilling to pay
fifty cents	MONEY	for the former
five cents	MONEY	' worth .

		As in the case of the regular stage , the mana - gers seek plays that will appeal to the public , for without popular plays the '' movie '' indus - try would cease .

		Prior to the advent of the photoplay , thousands wrote for the regular stage , while only tens succeeded in getting their plays produced .

		Tens of thousands write for the movies now , and again it is a case of the survival of the fittest , the man without the dramatic sense having no more chance to succeed as a '' movie '' playwright save in that the volume of production is infi - nitely greater than he had as a writer for the regular stage .

		With such a bait to dangle before the eyes of literary aspirants as the sure attainment of successful `` movie '' authorship , the corre - spondence schools , manuscript readers , and literary advisers have been reaping a rich harvest .

		Small wonder that a considerable literature upon the art of writing photoplays has sprung into being , with the object of ap - pealing to the legion of men , women , and children who aspire to get rich quickly in the '' movies . ''

		One of our comic weeklies recently pub - lished a quip to this effect : `` Jones .

		* -LSB- un - derstand
Robinson	PERSON	is making a good living out of the short story .

		Brown .

		Why , I heard he had never had one accepted .

		Jones .

		He has n't ; he 's writing articles on how to write them for a correspondence school . ''

		If the word '' photoplay '' be substituted here for '' short story , ''
Robinson	PERSON	becomes the type of man who gives instruction in the art of photo - play making , those who are deft in that art being too busily engaged in reaping the rich harvest their skill has brought forth , to find the time in which to initiate the public into the secret of their success .

		Yet to the rule that books on the '' movies '' are valueless , there is the proverbial exception ; since in '' Photoplay Making , '' by Mr.
Howard T. Dimick	PERSON	, many sane ideas are set forth , albeit in a somewhat cumbersome way . ''

		From the drama of the stage , '' says Mr.
Dimick	PERSON	, `` I turned to that of the screen , after an experience as writer and critic of plays . ''

		As no record of his experience appears in that vade-mecum of successful endeavor , '' Who 's Who in
America	LOCATION	, '' and as his book is pub - lished in
Ridgewood	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	, it is easy to suspect Mr.
Dimick	PERSON	of kinship with the
Rob	PERSON	- inson of the comic weekly quip .

		Howsoever that may be , he has profited well by his experience as '' writer and critic of plays , '' the real value of his book lying in the emphasis he lays upon the similarity between the photo - play and the stage play .

		Indeed , funda - mentally they are the same , their construction being governed by precisely the same laws ; for though the technical methods of the two arts may differ considerably , `` yet , '' as Mr.
Dimick	PERSON	acutely observes , `` the underlying dramatic principles of both forms of theatri - cal exposition are identical . ''

		The stage play appeals to the ear as well as to the eye ; therefore conditions that are sup - posed to exist before the commencement of a play may be set forth by dialogue .

		In the photoplay these conditions must be shown in action ; but in the construction of his play the photoplaywright -LRB- if one may be pardoned the use of the word -RRB- is bound by the same dramatic laws as govern his colleague of the regular stage .

		The dramatic action in both instances must be logical , and must proceed from understandable causes to effects that seem so inevitable that they appeal sponta - neously either to our sympathy or our risibil - ity .

		Indeed , unity , sequence , cause and effect are as necessary in the one as in the other , and also atmosphere and characterization .

		The stage dramatist has the benefit of dia - logue , but is hampered by the restrictions which stage appliances impose .

		The photo - dramatist , on the other hand , is unlimited scenically ; but is limited in utterance to the sub-titles and spoken titles he may flash on the screen .

		These , however , must be used sparingly , the ideal photoplay being under - standable , like the ideal pantomime , without a single explanatory word .

		Sir
Arthur Wing Pinero	PERSON	calls drama `` the art of compressing life without falsification , ''
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 19 an apt definition which Mr.
Dimick	PERSON	perti - nently qualifies in so far as it relates to photo - drama .

		`` The complete play , '' he says , `` is not in its ultimate analysis a ' mere screenful ' of life .

		It is or should be ' a screenful ' of art with the likeness of life . ''

		The task of the photo-dramatist , however , is far less arduous than that of the stage dramatist .

		In both instances dramatic sense is required , but the stage dramatist must pos - sess literary sense as well .

		Although both must think dramatically , the dramatist who writes stage plays must clothe his thoughts in language that will characterize not only the persons in his play , so that they appear real , but must unfold the story in a way that the audience may both understand and enjoy .

		It is this literary aspect of the stage drama which makes it the superior art , for in other respects photoplay making and stage play making are governed by the same fundamen - tal laws , the play in both instances being constructed in practically the same way through the preparation of a scene plat or scenario .

		This word , which calls to mind the Italian Commedia dell ` Arte , recalls also the striking resemblance this popular entertainment of the renaissance bears in several particulars to the photo-drama of the present day , not only in its construction , but in the manner of its pro- duction .

		Indeed , it might almost be said that were the camera work eliminated , the photo - play of to-day would become peripatetic
Commedia dell	ORGANIZATION	` Arte , the one appreciable dif - ference between the two being the fact that the scenes of a
Commedia dell	ORGANIZATION	` Arte were acted upon a stationary stage , whereas those of the photoplay take place wherever the imagina - tion of the dramatist elects that they be performed .

		As in the
Commedia dell	ORGANIZATION	` Arte , the dialogue of the photoplay scenario is unwritten , except in the case of passages which emphasize vital points of the story .

		In a
Commedia dell	ORGANIZATION	` Arte these were called the doti or dowries ; in the photoplay they are the '' spoken titles '' or '' leaders , '' and are flashed on the screen .

		The construction , however , is so similar in both instances , that a photoplay producer could take the average Commedia dell ` Arte scenario and '' film '' it almost without alteration , his method of rehearsing his company being so like that of the corago or stage manager of Italian Improvised Comedy , that it is difficult to believe the technique of photoplay acting is not a direct inheritance from that of the
Commedia dell	ORGANIZATION	` Arte .

		The similarity between these two stage forms , which distinguishes them most from the regular drama , is the improvisate char - acter of their dialogue .

		Should the play - wright of the regular stage turn his scenario , or outline of his play , over to the stage man - ager , with no dialogue written except impor - tant lines , which the very blocking out of the play called , forth ; and should the stage man - ager read it to the company , scene by scene , and impress upon its members the various characters they are to play and the situations they are to unfold , but leave to their readiness of wit the extemporization of all dialogue , except a few vital lines absolutely necessary to the unfolding of the story , we would then have in nearly every essential a
Commedia dell	ORGANIZATION	` Arte as it was written and produced in
Italy	LOCATION	during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries .

		Now in the production of a photoplay this is precisely the modus operandi .

		That dia - logue obtains in the photoplay may astonish the uninitiated ; yet not only do the actors speak , so that the effebt of moving lips may be registered , but they speak lines which re - flect both the character and the situation they are portraying .

		These lines , though impro - vised while a scene is in rehearsal , are impor - tant to the effective registration by the camera of the action , for they enable the actors to be `` in their roles , '' as the French say , much more effectively than if pantomime alone were resorted to .

		Moreover , moving - picture actors seldom play without an audi - ence , particularly in the exterior scenes of a play , while during the taking of the interior scenes there are usually a few interlopers or fellow actors in the studio , to witness their histrionic efforts .

		Hence the repetition of a scene which the camera registers becomes not a rehearsal , but a performance .

		Again , the rapidity with which a scene is made by a competent producer , often with but one re - hearsal , seldom with more than two or three , brings the `` movie '' actor into close pro- fessional kinship with the
Commedia dell	ORGANIZATION	` Arte performer , of whom
Luigi Riccoboni	PERSON	says in his Histoire de I ` ancien theatre italien -LRB- 1730 -RRB- : '' To a comedian who depends upon improvisa - tion , face , memory , voice , and sentiment are not enough .

		If he would distinguish himself , he must possess a lively and fertile imagination , a great facility in expression ; he must master the subtle - ties of the language too , and have at his disposal a full knowledge of all that is required for the different situations in which his role places him . ''

		In all except the phrase `` he must master the subtleties of the language , '' this state - ment applies with equal force to the actor in the Improvised Comedy of the Italian renais - sance and the `` movie '' actor of to-day , only those actors who possess '' a lively and fertile 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 24	DATE	imagination , a great facility of expression , and a full knowledge of all that is required for the different situations in which their roles place them , '' being effective histrions in the movies .

		The slow , studying actor , whom the stage manager can by patience whip into a part , or the actor who depends upon read - ing rather than acting for his effects , will fail ignominiously before the camera .

		Indeed , this new histrionism calls for precisely the qualities of which Riccoboni speaks , with the added requirement that the actor must pos - sess a face which in the technical language of the `` movie '' studio `` registers '' effectively ; more than one actor who succeeded because of his good looks on the regular stage has failed in the `` movies , '' because his features do not photograph well .

		A distinctive element of the
Commedia dell	ORGANIZATION	' - Arte was characterization , as exemplified by
Pantalone	PERSON	,
Arlecchino	LOCATION	,
Brighella	LOCATION	,
Pulcinella	LOCATION	,
Scaramuccia	LOCATION	, and their merry mates , each pic - turing the local characteristics of some Italian city .

		These were set characters , one or more of whom appeared in every comedy , the plots being constructed around these known and popular roles .

		Although the `` movies '' have not accepted this plan of construction in its entirety , it nevertheless obtains , a series of plays having been constructed around popular characters , such as Bronco Billy ; while
John Bunny	PERSON	and
Charley Chaplin	PERSON	might with con - siderable verisimilitude be dubbed the
Panta	LOCATION	- lone and Arlecchino of the '' movies , '' the parts they have invariably filled being certainly sim - ilar in conception to those that bore these names in the Italian Improvised Comedy .

		Indeed , although the drama of to-day un - consciously owes much in the way of construc - tion to the adept dramaturgy of those nimble Italian actors who , schooled by experience in stagecraft , developed the Commedia dell ' Art e , or professional comedy , along lines that were followed by
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	and
Goldoni	PERSON	, the `` mov - ies '' have revivified the most distinctive char - acteristics of that popular drama of the renaissance .

		The very word scenario used by the actors of that period survives to indicate the photo - play , which in form differs from those Italian scenari that have been preserved to us only by the addition of camera directions , such as `` close up , '' `` back to scene , '' `` cut , '' `` fade , '' etc. , all of which are called forth by the tech - nical demands of photography .

		Although sprightly Arlecchino and roguish Brighella do not prank in the `` movies '' in Bergamask attire , their ectypes are there in modern garb ; while the actors who extemporize their lines , nimbly play before the camera in the rollick - ing and spontaneous way of the
Commedia dell	ORGANIZATION	` Arte actors , as described by
Riccoboni	PERSON	,
Garzoni	PERSON	,
Barbieri	PERSON	, and other contemporary admirers of this forgotten art .

		Thus it would appear that there is nothing entirely new under the dramatic sun , not even the `` movies . ''

		H.
C. CHATFIELD-TAYLOR	ORGANIZATION	.

		FINDING ONESELF IN Every lover of reading knows something of the anticipatory pleasure in opening a book the title of which suggests a purpose , points a moral , or adorns a promised tale .

		In the title of President ``
Wilson	PERSON	's little volume , `` When a Man Comes to Himself , '' we have just such a pledge of a book with a serious meaning .

		Some books make their appeal with an entirely impersonal authority , as though claiming to be regarded as emanations from the collective intellect of the race , and bringing with them no suggestion of self - revelation .

		Others , again , seem to require for their interpretation and complete comprehension the conception of a known or unknown personality behind them .

		In this latter category we must class the book now under review ; and we trust it may not seem an intrusion into the privacies of a life if we assume it to be something in the nature of an apologia pro vita , a glimpse of the inner workings of an heroic soul , a laying bare for our instruction and edification of the manner in which its writer has escaped from the stifling atmosphere of littleness and self-seek - ing into the upper air of universal aims where `` our souls have sight of that immortal sea which brought us hither . ''

		The parable of the Prodigal Son has ob - viously suggested the title of the book ; b * ut the author in the first few pages has made clear what much requires to be kept in mind , that it is not necessary for a man to have wan - dered into `` a far country '' or to have been reduced to coveting `` the husks which the swine did eat '' before reaching the point where he must come to himself , if his life is not to end in failure .

		The emotional upheaval known as '' conversion '' has become so soiled by the ignoble uses of a cheap evangelicalism as to have lost credit in the world of sober judgment ; but that some analogous change of attitude towards the mystery of existence and the meaning and uses of life must precede the entering upon his highest inheritance , is what every man in his heart probably believes .

		For even among those spiritually '' impotent folk '' who , as the author remarks , `` never come to * WHEN A MAN COMES TO HIMSELF .

Bethesda	LOCATION	for the coming > of the disturbing angel that they might be the first to plunge into its healing waters ?

		The spiritually `` blind and halt and withered '' belong to all classes of society , and are to be found among the wise and prudent , and in the very household of Mr.
Worldly Wiseman	PERSON	of the town of Morality .

		Indeed , that this '' com - ing to oneself '' is as necessary to the man of genius or to him who instinctively prefers to walk in the paths of rectitude and veracity , as to the wayward child of humanity , is the les - son which this book seems to leave with us .

		Where one is in complete agreement with the main conclusions of an author , and in the deepest sympathy with the spirit of his writ - | ing , it may appear ungracious to select points in detail with which to disagree .

		As honest criticism , however , is the proper function of the critic , we must join issue with Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	in one of his dicta where he affirms that the coming to oneself is '' a change reserved for the thoroughly sane and healthy and for those j who can detach themselves , '' etc. .

		Judging j from observation and experience , one might be j tempted to think that complete sanity and i perfect health sometimes act as a bar to the oncoming of the great change , and positively prevent a man 's coming to himself .

		Might it not even be said that a little defect in health or ; a slight touch of insanity sometimes provides !

		~ the conditions under which the change is most !

		likely to take place ?

		The psychological mys - tery which surrounds the motions of the spirit is as inexplicable now as it was to the apostle who said : '' By grace are ye saved and that not of yourselves , it is the gift of God . ''

		For upon whom does the gift seem most readily to descend ?

		Does it not come most frequently to those who are conscious of having lost some - thing of that healthiness and sanity which re - sult from complete adjustment to outward conditions ?

		May it not be that here again the intellectual and emotional invalids or sinners may have at least an equal chance to come to themselves , with those who have observed all the laws of mental and emotional hygiene ?

		It is , at all events , a more cheerful and sustaining TDelief that the change is not reserved for the thoroughly sane and healthy ; as there are so few who can truthfully be so described .

		We believe we interpret the author 's conclu - sions aright in assuming that he regards the coming of a man to himself not as a single and final transaction , but as a process , which hav - ing begun will be repeated as life unfolds its hidden potentialities ; and that we must be re-born not once but many times if we are to expand to the full circumference of our being .

		While there are undoubtedly many to whom the initial awakening arrives gradually , like the return to consciousness of a healthy sleeper , to most of us it comes with more or less of a shock ; to some with the force of a mighty rushing wind ; to others with only a gentle `` click '' indicating that a corner has been rounded , an important point passed , a new outlook gained .

		But every man who has experienced the change and realized the altered perspective in which the world is seen , and who has received the gift in the spirit of true humility , will expect further revelations and adjustments and will not be disappointed .

		Each recurring '' coming to himself '' will take place with less shock and more and more fre - quency , until in a real sense he comes to him - self at the opening of each new day .

		On many other points most readers will find themselves in absolute agreement with Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	.

		That `` men come to themselves by discovering their limitations no less than by discovering their deeper endowments , '' that `` Moral enthusiasm is not , uninstructed and of itself , a suitable guide to practicable and lasting reformation , '' and that '' if the reform sought be the reformation of others as well as of himself , the reformer should look to it that he knows the true relation of his will to the wills of those he would change and guide , '' these are aphorisms of inestimable value for the clarification of thought and the guidance of the social reformer .

		The idea , too , that man reaches his highest degree of individuality in proportion as he identifies himself with his community , was surely never more happily expressed than in the following epigrammatic sentences : `` A man is the part he plays among his fellows .

		He is not isolated .

		His life is made up of the relations he bears to others is made or marred by those relations , guided by them , judged by them , expressed in them . ''

		`` Adjustment -LSB- to those relations -RSB- is exactly what a man gains when he comes to himself . ''

		Would it be possible to find a more felicitous elucidation of the antinomy which accepts Society as an organism yet insists on main - taining the individuality of the man ?

		`` And so men grow by having responsibility laid upon them , the burden of other people 's business . ''

		In these words we seem to feel the inner spirit of the distinguished writer of this edifying little book .

		That the burden our great civic chief t is at present bearing may react in the manner he obviously desires , will be the sincerest wish of every reader of `` When a Man Comes to Himself . ''

		22 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 24	DATE	SCORCHED WITH THE FLAMES OF WAR .

		* Of all who have gone forth to write of the present war for the purpose of influencing the opinion of the world , Mr.
Sven Hedin	PERSON	is the most eminent .

		Educated in
Germany	LOCATION	in his youth , preserving through life an honest love for and admiration of its people in peace , the recipient of many honors and much ap - plause throughout its empire , he was allowed the widest latitude by no less a person than the
Kaiser	PERSON	himself for the acquirement of such knowledge as would most convincingly present the cause of the German Empire to the neutral nations .

		As in so many other cases , he has made over his own into a Ger - man heart , and his large octavo volume con - tains no criticism of the Germans that is not wholly favorable .

		As in so many other cases , too , he is not satisfied to record merely what he sees , though he more than once professes that to be his object ; he argues from his own experiences and observations to sweeping gen - eralities , denies all atrocities , and leaves the German soldier with a clean bill of moral health .

		It may be remarked here , for the .

		purpose of clearing up a great deal of muddy thinking in such matters , that so-called nega - tive testimony of this kind is not testimony at all .

		Mr.
Hedin	PERSON	offers no contradiction , as an eye-witness , of the cases set forth in the
Bedier	PERSON	and
Bryce	PERSON	reports , buttressed as they are by extracts from the diaries of German soldiers ; he is content to present himself as a witness in the spirit in which the twenty friends who had not seen the Irishman steal the pig contradicted the ten who did .

		This is not to be held as vitiating the force of his actual observations ; a traveller of the first distinc - tion and trained both to see and to write , his book is authoritative within its limits , and its faults are those of prejudgment and of mass psychology .

		But even these prejudices are interesting in the record , as when he notes : '' I was told that the wounds of the Germans heal better and quicker than those of the * WITH THE GERMAN ARMIES IN THE WEST .

		Again what we should call British self - respect and independence he characterizes as bad breeding : '' Of the prisoners , it was said that there was a great difference between the British and the French .

		The former would stand with their hands in their pockets and a pipe in their mouth when spoken to by an officer , and a salute was only elicited by a reprimand .

		The Frenchmen , on the other hand , always salute the German officers without being told , and this is probably due to their inherited military spirit and to the trait of inborn courtesy which pervades the whole nation . ''

		Mr.
Hedin	PERSON	met and talked with the
Kaiser	PERSON	three times during his stay in
Germany	LOCATION	-LRB- from .


September 14	DATE	to
November 12 , 1914	DATE	-RRB- , and presents this portrait of him : '' The talk of the Emperor having aged during the war , and of the war with all its labors and anxieties having sapped his strength and health , is all nonsense .

		His hair is no more pronouncedly iron grey than before the war , his face has color , and far from being worn and thin , he is plump and strong , bursting with energy and rude health .

		A man of Emperor
William	PERSON	's stamp is in his ele - ment when , through the force of circumstances , he is compelled to stake all he possesses and above - all himself for the good and glory of his country .

		But his greatest quality is that he is a human being and that with all his fulminant force he is humble before God . ''

		Mr.
Hedin	PERSON	has convinced himself that this is a holy war , in which the
Kaiser	PERSON	, like
Gustavus Adolphus	PERSON	before him , is holding up the arms of Protestantism against what , one does not quite make out .

		After a detailed account of the celebration of mass near the front , he - writes : '' Perhaps one ought to .

		.

		realize what Swedes and Germans have in common .

		At one time we gave each other the best and noblest that we pos - sessed .

		The Lutheran faith preserved by the sword of
Gustavus Adolphus	PERSON	was the seed and life germ which has given birth to that Germanic culture which to-day is fighting for its existence .

		None of us can escape the responsibility for the inviolable preservation of the common heritage .

		Our German brethren are now shedding their heart 's blood in a cause which in equal measure concerns themselves , and for which
Sweden	LOCATION	's greatest Kings gave their all and their lives . ''


France	LOCATION	is held to be the victim of a specious .

		and inhuman diplomacy `` surely one can - not with self-respect refrain from loudly con - demning the policy which alone is the cause of it all . ''

		The use of Turcos and Gurkas and Sikhs brings forth objurgations the actual Turks are not mentioned .

		One of the inter - esting ways in which
Germany	LOCATION	is having the - cost of the war defrayed for her by her ene - mies is worth setting down in full :
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL `` Nothing is taken away off-hand .

		All will be made good to the owners after the war .

		The terms of peace will contain a provision to the effect that the defeated side shall pay the amount of every receipt or voucher -LRB- bon -RRB- representing the value of the things requisitioned during the mili - tary occupation .

		The individual is not to suffer direct , but only as a participant in the misfortune which falls on the country as a whole .

		It is the duty of the
State	ORGANIZATION	to make good the people 's per - sonal losses when the
State	ORGANIZATION	is incapable of pro- tecting the property of the individual against the enemy .

		And if the invading power is defeated in the war , its just punishment is that it must make good the losses of the sufferers . ''

		This reads fairly enough , but it must be remembered that there is nowhere in the large volume any hint of anything but German vic - tory , complete and absolute .

		The French who accept the German vouchers , having no choice in the matter , are to look to their own govern - ment for repayment for the supplies they are forced to give its foes .

		The Hague conven - tions are not silent on this subject , but as Mr.
Hedin	PERSON	observes , `` In more than one respect this war has demonstrated the impotence and futility of all conferences and conventions of
Geneva	LOCATION	, The
Hague	LOCATION	, and other places , bearing names which now have an empty and illusory sound . ''

		It is well to have a categorical state - ment of this sort from such a completely pro-German source .

		After noting the trench warfare in northern
France	LOCATION	, and getting to
Antwerp	LOCATION	just after its fall , Mr.
Hedin	PERSON	re - turned home .

		He had been under French fire and the British naval bombardment of
Ostend	LOCATION	, had been entertained by numerous royalties and high dignitaries , and his tone is that of a man who thoroughly enjoyed himself .

		Mr.
Edward Lyell Fox	PERSON	did not have so elaborate a social experience with German notabilities as Mr.
Hedin	PERSON	, but his opportuni - ties for gaining knowledge were almost equal and of much the same nature .

		His book , '' Behind the Scenes in
Warring Germany	LOCATION	, '' is \ vritten with less reserve and more energy , describing conditions on both the western front in
autumn	DATE	and the eastern in winter , in the form of special correspondence for Amer - ican periodicals .

		Mr.
Fox	PERSON	is much more guarded in his statements about German pro- ceedings which have not fallen under his own eyesight , as when he remarks in this con - nection : `` Were every American who believes these Belgian stories , to live with the German soldiers as I have , and to know them off duty , and to watch them in the trenches , he would be utterly at sea .

		The stories of
Belgium	LOCATION	do not agree with the men of the German army . ''

		This is brought out by nothing more than the accusation that the home-loving
Teuton	PERSON	has wantonly burned houses ; and in the para - graph immediately following he describes a Prussian officer 's bomb-proof in the trenches as filled with loot from a neighboring chateau the sort of thing that Mr.
Hedin	PERSON	gave us his assurance was not done .

		Mr.
Fox	PERSON	was on the firing line during an English charge , and was mightily moved to take an active part in the fighting , being completely carried away by the excitement of the moment .

		His ac - count of the defeat of the enemy must be given : '' I began to notice then , by craning my head from left to right , that the red wavering lines of fire , which had a way of rushing at you and van - ishing to appear again further back , was -LSB- sic -RSB- slower now in appearing after it lost itself some - where in the mud , and then it became even slower in showing itself and finally when it came , you saw that it had disintegrated into segments , that it was no longer a steady oncoming line , rather a slowly squirming thing like the curling parts of some monstrous fiery worm that had been chopped to bits and was squirming its life away out there on the mud .

		And it dawned upon you in horror that the fiery red lines had been lines of men , shooting as they had come ; and that , when one line had been mowed down , another had rushed up from behind , so on almost endlessly it had seemed until they became broken and squirmed like the others had done , into the mud , and came no more .

		And the spell that you had been held in was broken ; and you remembered that there Avas a God , and you thanked Him that your hands had found nothing with which to kill . ''

		-LRB- It could have been wished , when Mr.
Fox	PERSON	came to write , that he had remembered that there is also syntax in English . -RRB-

		He , too , like Mr.
Hedin	PERSON	, visited the prison camps in Bel - gium , and noted that the British did not salute German officers ; also that when he asked an English marine how he liked it there , though an officer stood beside him , the En - glishman answered , `` Rotten . ''

		The fighting in
Poland	LOCATION	was even fiercer ; and the battle of
Augustowo Wald	ORGANIZATION	, at which Mr.
Fox	PERSON	was pres - ent , affords him material for what he calls '' the first complete account of a great battle that has been told in this war . ''

		As recorded , it was one of those overwhelming Russian defeats that have characterized the eastern fighting , an army of 240,000 men being com - pletely obliterated by
General	ORGANIZATION	von
Hinden	PERSON	- berg .

		The last chapter in the book shows , with photographic reproductions , that En - gland possessed accurate military maps of
Belgium	LOCATION	, proof to the Germans that
Great Britain	LOCATION	intended the invasion of that un - happy country ; and equal proof , from the other side , that the British were aware of
Germany	LOCATION	's dishonorable intentions in that regard .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
June 24 From September	DATE	to
December , 1914	DATE	, Mr.
H. S. Souttar	PERSON	was attached to a British hos - pital corps and not under the personal escort of exceedingly polite German officers with the limitation of experiences thus implied .

		In consequence we are given in his book entitled `` A Surgeon in
Belgium	LOCATION	'' a record of personal experiences .

		After discussing the rules of the
Geneva	LOCATION	Convention the author says : '' It is , after all , possible to fight as gentlemen .

		Or at least it was until a few months ago .

		Since then we have had a demonstration of ' scientific ' war such as has never before been given to man - kind .

		Now , to wear a
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	is simply to offer a better mark for the enemy 's fire , and we only wore them in order that our own troops might know our business and make use of our aid .

		A hospital is a favorite mark for the German artillery , whilst the practice of painting Red Crosses on the tops of ambulance cars is by many people considered unwise , as it invites any passing aeroplane to drop a bomb .

		But the Germans have carried their systematic contempt of the rules of war so far that it is now almost impossible for our own men to recognize their Red Crosses .

		Time after time their Red Cross cars have been used to conceal machine-guns , their flags have floated over batteries , and they have actually used stretchers to bring up ammunition to the trenches .

		Whilst I was at Furnes two German spies were working with an ambulance , in khaki uniforms , bringing in the wounded .

		They were at it for nearly a week before they were discovered , and then , by a Tuse , they succeeded in driving straight through the Belgian lines and back to their own ,
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	ambulance , khaki and all . ''

		Later he cites another instance that fell within his personal knowledge : '' But
Ypres	LOCATION	gave us yet another example of German methods of war .

		On the western side of the town , some distance from the furthest houses , stood the Asylum .

		It was a fine building arranged in several wings , and at present it was being used for the accommodation of a few wounded , mostly women and children , and several old people of the workhouse infirmary type .

		It made a mag - nificent hospital , and as it was far away from the town and was not used for any but the pur - poses of a hospital , we considered it safe enough , and that it would be a pity to disturb the poor old people collected there .

		We might have known better .

		The very next night the Germans shelled it to pieces , and all those unfortunate old creatures had to be removed in a hurry .

		There was a sense - less barbarity about such an act which could only appeal to a Prussian . ''

		The book is both witty and wise , and the work of a man who can write excellent En - glish .

		It contains a number of suggestions of a professional sort , such as the establish - ment of hospitals in the country for the better treatment of city dwellers , and records the results of the use of the most modern surgical appliances .


Madame Curie	PERSON	was in Mr.
Sout	PERSON	- tar 's hospital with her wonderful apparatus , and the
King	PERSON	and Queen of
Belgium	LOCATION	were frequent visitors .

		Mr.
Fritz Kreisler	PERSON	, the eminent violinist now touring the
United States	LOCATION	, was for a month on the Austrian firing line , took part in several engagements and a long retreat , was wounded in the leg , and honorably dis - charged from the service as no longer phy - sically fit for its hardships .

		His brief account of `` Four Weeks in the Trenches '' corrobo - rates those given by many others , regarding the ease with which a man of refinement slips back into the barbarism of war , with its at - tendant dirt and filth and lack of everything regarded as humanly decent .

		A week or two of marching under heavy equipment brought him into unexpected health and strength , as in so many other cases .

		His musical ear enabled him to be of service to his army , for it detected the differences in the sounds made by shells before attaining their maximum height and after they had begun their de - scent .

		`` Apparently , '' he writes , '' in the first half of its curve , that is , its course while ascending , the shell produced a dull whine accompanied by a falling cadence , which changes to a rising shrill as soon as the acme has been reached and the curve points down - ward again . ''

		Confiding his observations to his commanding officer , `` it was later on re - ported to me that I had succeeded in giving to our batteries the almost exact range of the Russian guns . ''

		Interesting as this is , it seems a poor use to put a great artistic talent to .

		Several instances are cited of the men exhibit - ing a simple humanity toward their enemies , notably in a case where a Russian officer and his orderly came under a flag of truce to plead hunger , '' offering a little barrel of water which his companion carried on his head and a little tobacco , in exchange for some provisions . ''

		The response was gener - ous , though the Austrians were themselves on scant rations , Mr.
Kreisler	PERSON	's '' proud contribu - tion consisting of two tablets of chocolate , part of a precious reserve for extreme cases . ''

		Mrs.
M. E. Clarke	PERSON	has done nothing more than record the state of feeling suggested by the title of her well written book , ``
Paris	LOCATION	`` Waits :
1914	DATE	, '' during the fearful days of the German advance , and by the respite that came in
September	DATE	when the French pushed their adversaries back to the
Aisne	LOCATION	.

		Of the re - treat immediately before , she writes : '' I never realized how ill men could be from sheer fatigue until I saw a
Seaforth	LOCATION	Highlander and a Rifle Brigade man utterly prostrate in a French hospital after that awful retreat on
Paris	LOCATION	.

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 25 They had marched twenty-five miles a day during four days , with practically nothing to eat , and fighting all the way ... They had been in hospital ten days when we found them , and they were still unable to stand on their feet , although , beyond fatigue , there was nothing the matter with them .

		They craved food , rest , and forgetfulness of all they had seen .

		Their pity for the Belgian refugees was very real , and whatever English soldier you meet it is always the same : they will never forget those heart-rending scenes of mutilated women and children , burning villages , and roads stream - ing with frightened groups of human beings seeking safety by walking away from their own dwellings into the unknown .

		Above all , they will never forget or forgive the Germans for driving j the women and children before their guns as pro- tection for themselves against the fire of the Allies .

		Even the laconic Highlander talked about that , and the Rifle Brigade man became eloquent . ''

		Though the book makes no pretence to con - secutiveness or literary form , it will stand as a psychological cinematograph of the feelings of a great capital in a great historical crisis .

		M. 1 ` Abbe
Felix Klein	PERSON	will be remembered as the author of several books which have been translated and sold widely in
America	LOCATION	.

		He has also travelled and lectured exten - sively in this country .

		Thus it was not inap - propriate that he should attach himself to the
American ` Ambulance Corps	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	as its chaplain .

		His new book , `` La Guerre Vue d'une Ambulance , '' is in the form of a diary , running from the
third of August	DATE	to the
last day of December , 1914	DATE	, in which he sets down the actual events of each day with related impressions and observations .

		Here is con - firmation of Mrs.
Clarke	PERSON	's record from an independent source : '' II ne leur est permis de parler des faits de guerre qu'apres quinze jours ecoules .

		Ce n'est pas , jugent-ils a bon droit , desobeir a cet ordre que de nous confirmer , pour les avoir vues de leurs yeux , les atrocites des Allemands en Belgique , et notamment , le fait tres souvent renouvale , chaque fois , semble-t-il , que c ` etait possible , de placer devant eux les enfants et les femmes , au moment du combat . ''

		There is also the protest , not uncommon in either
France	LOCATION	or
Britain	LOCATION	, against the use of similar devices : ''
Rien	PERSON	, pas meme le sac de
Senlis	LOCATION	, qui a donne lieu , rien ne justifie de pareilles explosions de fureur .

		Je sais bien que les atrocites allemandes depassent , cette fois , toutes limites , et qu'elles revetent souvent un caratere general , officiel , qui en augmente singulierement la portee .

		Mais quoi !

		n'est - ce pas eela meme qui prouve I ` inferiorite de 1 ` adversaire ?

		Loin de nous , a jamais , 1 ` idee de nous abandonner a la plus monstrueuse des emu - lations ! ''

		The impression given is vivid and sincere , and the
United States	LOCATION	has occasion to feel proud of the excellent work accomplished through its
Ambulance Corps	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	.

		Out of the obscurity thrown over the work of the British expeditionary force in
Belgium	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	has come from time to time the writings of an official eye-witness , brief and well worded accounts , sometimes picturesque , which are for the most part from the accom - plished pen of Colonel
Ernest D. Swinton	PERSON	.

		These have been collected into a volume , `` Eye - Witness 's Narrative of the War , '' which needed this presentation of them since the exigencies of daily journalism have often led to omissions large and small .

		The accounts here given run from the victory of the Allies on the Marne to the British advance at
Neuve Chapelle	LOCATION
last March	DATE	, the selection of the two events giving form to the narrative .

		As an example of the information given , the follow - ing statement concerning the event last named may be quoted : '' One wounded Prussian officer , of a particu - larly offensive and truculent type which is not uncommon , expressed the greatest contempt for our methods .

		` You do not fight .

		You murder , ' he said . '

		If it had been straightforward , honest fighting , we should have beaten you , but my regi - ment never had a chance from the first ; there was a shell every ten yards .

		Nothing could live in such a fire . ' ''

		This feeling of resentment against our ar - tillery was shown by several of the prisoners .

		Gratifying as it is to our gunners , it is an exhibi - tion of a curious lack of any judicial sense or even of a rudimentary sense of humor on the part of the apostles of ' Frightfulness . '

		It was the Germans who prepared an overwhelming force of artillery before the war , and they were the first to employ the concentrated action of heavy guns in field warfare .

		When the tables are turned and they have their first taste of what we have so often eaten they actually have the effrontery to com - plain .

		It also especially galled our prisoners that they should have been captured by the British , who , they had been informed , were very inferior enemies . ''

		It was this battle that at last disclosed to the British the only secure method of advancing , and they immediately set about securing the necessary enormous quantity of heavy ammu - nition .

		The book pays full credit to the Ger - man efficiency and personal bravery , and some informing letters secured from prison - ers about the pinch of poverty are of especial interest .

		Miss
Violetta Thurstan	PERSON	, an English trained nurse attached to the
St. John of Jerusalem Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	, went to
Belgium	LOCATION	almost immedi - ately after the invasion of that country , re - mained there until the Germans deported her and her assistants after subjecting them to needless and gross personal insults , and from 26 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 24	DATE	Denmark passed to the
Russian Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	at the flying column detailed to the front .

		Her experiences were thrilling in the extreme , and were borne with that high spirit of valor which characterizes the English gentlewoman at her best .

		Wounded at last and soon after stricken by pleurisy , she has occupied her convalescence in writing the account of her experiences .

		Her book , '' Field Hospital and Flying Column , '' fully bears out the dictum that no autobiography is dull .

		Interesting as the narrative is , still more interesting is the personality of the author , which may be judged in part by the following extract : '' War would be the most glorious game in the world if it were not for the killing and wounding .

		In it one tastes the joy of comradeship to the full , the taking and giving , and helping and being helped , in a way that would be impossible to con - ceive in the ordinary world .

		At
Radzivilow	ORGANIZATION	, too , one could see the poetry of war , the zest of the frosty mornings , and the delight of the camp-fire at night , the warm , clean smell of the horses tethered everywhere , the keen hunger , the rough food sweetened by the sauce of danger , the riding out in high hope in the morning ; even the return - ing wounded in the evening did not seem altogether such a bad thing out there . ''

		No idea that the pacifists have advanced is more convincing than that of making peace as interesting as warfare ; once this is accom - plished , the vastest of all human evils will probably disappear .

		RECEXT POETRY .

		* In a roughly convenient fashion , one may classify all contemporary verse in two grand divisions , according as it represents the fol - lowing of poetic tradition or the distinctive resolution to be new .

		In connection with the second group , no one interested in the subject can fail to be aware of a considerable amount of very interesting experimentation by cer - tain of the younger poets , analogous in a more than superficial way to the various modernist schools of painting .

		Even if we have serious suspicions as to the probable value of these experiments , we should try to understand * SOME IMAGIST POETS .

		them ; and for this reason it is a cause for satisfaction that there should be initiated a `` New Poetry Series , '' designed to represent the work of the latest generation in small , well-printed volumes , modestly priced .

		The first title of this series is an anthology repre - senting the '' imagist '' poets , through the col - laboration of six of them , with a preface setting forth their principles .

		Unfortunately , when one seeks to ascertain the principles of any sect from its leaders , one is likely to be puzzled by the way in which they revert to obvious matters on which it is difficult to believe they have any peculiar claim .

		A Mormon , on being pressed for such a statement , will not mention polygamy or tithes , but will tell you that his Church is characterized by its belief in the coming of the kingdom of God on earth something which you supposed you had always believed yourself .

		A Seventh-day Adventist will not speak of the Sabbath , but will say that his one passion is liberty of conscience , as if this were a new doctrine made for the times .

		It is much the same with the modernist poets .

		The preface before us tells us that the princi - ples of the Imagists are five : to use the lan - guage of common speech , employing the exact and not the decorative word ; to create new rhythms , not to copy old ones ; to allow abso - lute freedom in the choice of subject ; to present an image as distinguished from vague generalities ; to produce poetry that is '' hard and clear '' ; and to practice concentration .

		Now apart from the matter of the new rhythms , it is obvious that these principles are the commonplaces of English poetry since the days of
Burns	PERSON	and of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	, when they are not the commonplaces of good poetry of every age .

		If we look for interpretations of them in the anthology itself , the matter can hardly be said to be cleared up .

		For instance , Mr.
D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	gives us the following images in a poem alluringly called '' Illicit '' : '' You are near to me , and your naked feet in their sandals , And through the scent of the balcony 's naked timber I distinguish the scent of your hair ; so now the limber Lightning falls from heaven .

		Adown the pale-green glacier-river floats A dark boat through the gloom and whither ?

		The thunder roars .

		But still we have each other .

		The naked lightnings in the heaven dither And disappear .

		What have we but each other ?

		The boat has gone . ''

		If these verses were not the product of one who not only is bound to employ the exact word , but who is under no obligation to make use of any rhyme whatsoever , we should be tempted to assume that the interesting words '' limber '' and '' dither , '' applied to the light - THE DIAL 27 ning , were suggested by the rhyme .

		Being forbidden this hypothesis , we hesitate .

		As to the lightning 's being reported as naked , when we should hardly have thought to ask that it be clothed , this may be attributed to a subtle sympathy with the illicit nudity of the feet and the timbers .

		But all this is so far from being new that it was keenly and legitimately parodied by Mr.
Owen Seaman	PERSON	, years ago , in his ballad of the nun who '' passed along the naked road , The road had really nothing on . ''

		Turn now , for further illustration of our principles , to some of the poems contributed `` by Miss
Amy Lowell	PERSON	, who before this has done praiseworthy work in poetry , and note images like these : '' Little cramped words scrawling all over the paper Like draggled fly 's legs . '' ''

		Why do lilies goggle their tongues at me When I pluck them ; And writhe , and twist , And strangle themselves against my fingers ? '' ''

		My thoughts Chink against my ribs And roll about like silver hail-stones . ''

		Is this exactness ?

		Is this to be concentrated , hard , and clear ?

		`` Well , one may not be sure how the words are used .

		But to those familiar with the history of English poetry it looks very much like a reversion , suggestive at times , and not without charm , to rather crude and youthful forms of the old method of the `` conceit . ''

		Not to seek further light on the theory of the poems , we may note that their chief values are of the same character as those of a painter 's jottings and sketches in his note-book , oftentimes suggestive of the materials for an interesting bit of color or of composition , still unformed into any signifi - cant whole .

		Here , from the work of Mr.
John Gould Fletcher	PERSON	, is a view of
London	LOCATION	from a ` bus - top : '' Black shapes bending , Taxicabs crush in the crowd .

		The tops are each a shining square , Shuttles that steadily press through woolly fabric .

		.

		, '' Monotonous domes of bowler-hats Vibrate in the heat . ''

		Silently , easily we sway through braying traffic , Down the crowded street .

		The tumult crouches over us , Or suddenly drifts to one side . ''

		And here , from Mr.
F. S. Flint	PERSON	, is a sketch of liouses at night : '' '' Into the sky The red earthenware and the galvanised iron chim - neys Thrust their cowls .

		` The hoot of the steamers on the Thames is plain .

		No wind ; The trees merge , green with green ; A car whirs by ; Footsteps and voices take their pitch In the key of dust , Far-off and near , subdued .

		Solid and square to the world The houses stand , Their windows blocked with Venetian blinds .

		Nothing will move them . ''

		By far the most effective composition in the anthology is
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	's picture of the bom - bardment of a continentalcity presumably
Rheims	LOCATION	; but this does not even profess to be more than cadenced prose , and is printed accordingly .

		A second issue of the '' New Poetry Series '' is made up entirely of the imagistic work of Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	; and exhibits , for the most part , the qualities that have been noticed .

		The following sketch is of some special interest as attempting the same sort of impression as that familiar in a certain type of painting , strewn broadcast with spots of prismatic color : '' Over the roof-tops race the shadows of clouds ; Like horses the shadows of clouds charge down the street . ''

		Whirlpools of purple and gold , Winds from the mountains of cinnabar , Lacquered mandarin moments , palanquins swaying and balancing Amid the vermilion pavilions , against the jade balustrades .

		Glint of the glittering wings of dragon-flies in the light : Silver filaments , golden flakes settling downwards , Rippling , quivering flutters , repulse and surrender , The sun broidered upon the rain , The rain rustling with the sun . ''

		Over the roof-tops race the shadows of clouds ; Like horses the shadows of clouds charge down the street . ''

		For this little volume Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	, like the editor of the anthology , has written an in - structive preface , explaining something of the doctrines of his group .

		It is more frank than the other , but singularly full of misstate - ments .

		In the brief space here available one must be dogmatic ; hence it can only be shortly observed that the art of poetry in English-speaking countries is not in a greatly backward state ; that the poets have not at - tempted to make of their craft a Masonic secret , declaring that rhythm is not to be analyzed ; that it is not true that each line of a poem represents a single breath ; that every poet of eminence has not felt the fatiguing monotony of regular rhyme and constructed new stanzas in order to avoid it ; that Shake - speare did not abandon rhyme in his mature period -LRB- that is , in lyrical verse , which is ap - parently the only kind under consideration -RRB- .

		Of course , if the reader is disposed to question these denials , we can not claim to have offered 28 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 24	DATE	proof , he can only be referred to any schol - arly authority on the matters concerned .

		But if a preface like this is a specimen of the actual information at the disposal of the imagists , one can only say that their practice may excel their theory , but that the latter is beyond hope .

		Mr.
Horace Holley	PERSON	has collected a number of poems which he calls not imagist but '' post - impressionist . ''

		In form and manner they resemble those we have been considering , but are less sensuously colored and decidedly richer in intellectual substance .

		One called `` In a Factory '' rather strikingly represents the social aspect of the poet 's thought : '' Smoky , monotonous rows Of half - unconscious men Serving , with lustreless glance and dreamless mind , The masterful machines ; These are the sons of herdsmen , hunters , Lords of the sunlit meadow , The lonely peak , The stirring , shadow-haunted wood , Of mariners who swung from sea to sea In carven ships And named the unknown world : Hunters , herdsmen , sailors , all By trade or chase or harvest Winning their substance Rudely , passionately like a worthy game With a boy 's great zest of playing .

		O labour , Whoso makes thee an adventure Thrilling to the nervous core of life , He is the true Messiah , The world 's Saviour , long-waited , long-wept-for . ''

		Finally , for our group of modernists , we may note the '' Spoon River Anthology '' of Mr.
Edgar Lee Masters	PERSON	, which might be called the reductio ad absurdum of certain of the new methods , such as the abandonment of conventional form and the fearless scrutiny of disagreeable realities .

		There is nothing here , to be sure , of the vaporings of some of our imagists , but a stern virility to which one might warm were it not so deliberately un - lovely .

		The contents of this '' anthology '' is a series of monologues d'outre tonibe , sup - posed to be spoken by the inhabitants of the Spoon Eiver cemetery , who one by one tell us something of what they did and felt while living , and in many cases how they met their end .

		Whether Spoon River is meant to be viewed as typical of
Illinois	LOCATION	villages for it appears to be in the vicinity of
Knox College	ORGANIZATION	and
Peoria	LOCATION	or to be a place peculiarly accursed , doth not clearly appear .

		In either case it furnishes an extraordinary study , in mortuary statistics .

		From the first half of the volume , or thereabouts , there may be culled such characters as these : a person who was hanged for highway robbery and murder ; a woman who was slain by the secret cruelty of her husband , the details not revealed ; an inventor who was bitten by a rat while dem - onstrating a patent trap ; a woman who took morphine after a quarrel with her husband ; , another who died in childbirth , the event hav - ing been foreseen by her husband ; a boy who was run over while stealing a ride on a train ; another boy who contracted lockjaw from a toy pistol ; a woman whose lock jaw was due to a needle which had pierced her while she was washing her baby 's clothes ; a citi - zen who fell dead , presumably from apoplexy , while confessing a hidden sin to his church ; a trainer who was killed by a lion in a circus ; a greedy farmer who died from eating pie and : gulping coffee in hot harvest time ; a rural philosopher who was gored by a cow while - discussing predestination ; an innocent man who was hanged on a trumped-up charge ; a courtesan who was poisoned by an Italian count ; and a prohibitionist who developed ' cirrhosis of the liver from over-drinking .

		Enough though the half has not been told .

		Under most of these tragedies lurk a grim pathos , and an irony due to such causes as the - total misunderstanding by his fellows of the life -LRB- and often the death -RRB- of the ghostly speaker .

		A really remarkable series of char - acter-studies , though the half would be much better than the whole ; but for poetry GUI bono ?

		Mr.
Masters	PERSON	has shown before this that he knows what verse is ; how then can he per - petrate , and endure to see in type , trash like - this : '' If even one of my boys could have run a news-stand , Or one of my girls could have married a decent man , .

		I should not have walked in the rain And jumped into bed with clothes all wet , Refusing medical aid . ''

		-LRB- In passing , note this method of suicide , per - haps the most original , because the most indi - rect , of those described in the collection . -RRB-

		It can only be because he was resolved to por - tray in the words of one of his own char - acters a '' wingless void Where neither red , nor gold , nor wine , Nor the rhythm of life are -LSB- sic -RSB- known . ''

		In two or three of the monologues only is the rhythm of life heard sounding underneath the tragedy as it always is in actual poetry and real tragedy ; in the words of Petit the Poet : ; '' Tragedy , comedy , valor and truth , Courage , constancy , heroism , failure All in the loom , and oh what patterns !

		Woodlands , meadows , streams and rivers Blind to all of it all my life long .

		Triolets , villanelles , rondels , rondeaus , Seeds in a dry pod , tick , tick , tick , Tick , tick , tick , what little iambics , While Homer and Whitman roared in the pines ! ''

		All this formless , blundering , but seriously - purposed waiting , under whatever name it
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 29 goes , is of value to the thoughtful reader for inferential and negative rather than positive reasons .

		Practically all the compositions at `` which we have been looking fail to meet the eternal test of poetry : they would perform their function , express their image or their thought , as well in prose form as in verse , sometimes better .

		What does this signify ?

		Their prefaces do not tell us .

		The real char - acteristic common to the group is the delib - erate abandonment of faith in a type , a law , an ideal call it what you will to which the fleeting momentary experiences caught up by the poet are to be referred , and of which his dependence on a persistent form , a stead - ily flowing , ineluctable rhythm , is but a sym - bol .

		Some will cling to form , but throw away the idea for which it stands ; some will cling to beauty of detail , but abandon beauty of the whole ; some will keep their sense of the type , the law , the idea , but throw away out - ward form , just for the zest of difference and novelty .

		When they abandon all faith and form together then we have a complete and instructive pathologic specimen of the process .

		What remains may be called poetry , but it is a poetry like that religion which has aban - doned both religion 's ritual and its faith .

		Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	is of those who keep the ritual without the faith .

		In other words , whether in prose or in verse , he holds to the traditional forms of his art despite the hope - less and unbeautiful creed which is familiar to all his readers .

		In his early volume of verse , the `` Wessex Poems , '' he somewhere expressed himself to this effect : that life would be more tolerable if we could believe ourselves to be in the toils of a malicious power , bent on causing suffering , it would at any rate be a more rational state than to feel that our suffering is without either pur - pose or meaning .

		In later years , as every - one knows , he has achieved the satisfaction merely dreamed of in the poem referred to , and come to something like a solemn faith in a Power not ourselves that makes for un - righteousness .

		This gives a kind of ideality to his pessimism which is quite wanting in the insignificant disillusioned ghosts of
Spoon River	LOCATION	.

		His recent volume of collected poems represents this in many a passage , but in none so nobly as in the lines on the loss of the `` Titanic '' -LRB- called `` The Convergence of the Twain '' -RRB- : '' ... Well , while was fashioning This creature of cleaving wing , The Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything '' Prepared a sinister mate For her so gaily great A Shape of Ice , for the time far and dissociate . ''

		And as the smart ship grew In stature , grace , and hue , In shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too . ''

		Alien they seemed to be : No mortal eye could see The intimate welding of their later history , '' Or sign that they were bent By paths coincident On being anon twin halves of one
august	DATE	event , '' Till the Spinner of the Years Said ' Now ! '

		And each one hears , And consummation comes , and jars two hemispheres . ''

		The title poems of the volume , called '' Satires of Circumstance , '' are brilliant ironic sketches in precisely the mordant manner of Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's most disconcerting prose narrative .

		Quite as keen , and perhaps even more finely balanced in respect to comedy and tragedy , is the neighboring dialogue between a buried woman and some one digging on her grave .

		At first she imagines it to be her lover plant - ing rue , but the answer comes , `` No , he wedded another yesterday . ''

		`` My nearest kin , then ? '' ''

		No , they are saying , ' What use to plant flowers ? ''

		`` My enemy , then , prodding maliciously ? '' ''

		No , she thinks you no more worth her hate . '' ''

		Who is it , then ? ''

		`` Your little dog , my mistress dear . ''

		`` Ah , one true heart left behind I might have known . ''

		But the dog answers : '' Mistress , I dug upon your grave To bury a bone , in case I should be hungry near this spot When passing on my daily trot .

		I am sorry , but I quite forgot It was your resting-place . ''

		It seemed well to paraphrase the greater por - tion of this little narrative , not merely for the sake of brevity , but to exemplify the fact that this is a type of composition , again , which does not lose its essence when transferred to prose .

		The verse points it , to be sure , gives finish and consequent satisfaction ; but the spirit is not that of poetry , because the spirit of poetry is never that of mere negation .

		And this is true of a great part of Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's verse .

		But there are plenty of exceptions , as in the poem on the '' Titanic , '' where , as we have seen , a big and looming imaginative con - cept rises from the very ruins of faith .

		In marked contrast to all these modernists is a new volume of poems representing the spiritual philosophy of Mr.
Henry Bryan Binns	PERSON	.

		Some of the verse seems modern enough , to be sure ; some of it is in vers libre ; but Mr.
Binns	PERSON	is not under the illu - sion that he is contributing , in these irregular forms , to the normal evolution of the poetry of the race .

		He values them , sagaciously , only as means of expressing certain personal `` realisations , '' such as , in some cases , recall 30 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 24	DATE	the ecstatic utterances of seventeenth century mystics like
Traherne	PERSON	.

		From '' High Noon , '' for instance , is this : '' See the sun atop , crowning Noon 's height , Level beneath him the round world !

		Level lies earth beneath and takes to the brim Her full of him , ere , tilting to East The light begins spilling . ''

		While Noon 's now at full Brim-high with this effulgence of light , Who has heart , come , drain it !

		Who has faith , let him drink ! ''

		Of conventional forms , there are many son - nets in the volume , but in this form Mr.
Binns	PERSON	tends to be didactic and unimaginative .

		His happiest vein is perhaps exemplified in cer - tain verses in the four-foot measure , which has often been proved to have possibilities for the combination of thoughtful epigram with lyrical feeling .

		Of this character is the fine conclusion to the title poem : '' Whatever of myself I win Out of my peril or despair , With all the inseparable kin And pilgrimage of life , I share . ''

		Alone in the light the skylark sings And sets us singing in the gloom : I , also , on victorious wings An instant overleap my doom : '' And though I know not how , I know As Earth , whereof we
spring	DATE	, is one , So every spirit 's overflow Eeplenishes the common sun . ''

		The Emersonian flavor evident in these lines is still more noticeable in the lighter vein of `` The Scolding Squirrel . ''

		There remains space for only two or three stanzas of this : ''
Squirrel	ORGANIZATION	, squirrel up in the tree , While you jerk that tail at me I mock at you and blithely dine On the other fruit of the pine ... '' All about me for my food Drops the wisdom of the wood : What a thousand pine-trees think Is distilled to be my drink ... '' An ever-living tide of mirth That flows for aye about the
Earth Begins	LOCATION	to sing its song in me ,
Squirrel	ORGANIZATION	, underneath your tree . ''

		We return to
America	LOCATION	for a volume which should have found earlier notice in these col - umns , Mr.
Arthur Ficke	PERSON	's sequence of `` Son - nets of a Portrait-Painter . ''

		Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	's work in the sonnet has won many a friendly word before now , and the new collection marks progress in his art .

		The sequence is a genu - ine one , with dramatic values over and above the lyrical ones , such as every such work must have to give it unity .

		Unfortunately this element is not developed as effectively as the opening portion of the series gives warrant for hoping .

		There the character of the painter and that of his environment come out with some vividness , and the poet is not afraid to heighten these with homely and humorous realism , as in this admirable quatrain , from Sonnet 5 : '' Heaven knows what moonlit turrets , hazed in bliss ,
Saw Launcelot	LOCATION	and night and Guinevere !

		I only know our first impassioned kiss Was in your cellar , rummaging for beer . ''

		But of this distinctness there seems not to be enough .

		At least one is not without fears , though the painter does live and grow throughout the sequence , that he sometimes draws from his portfolio a sonnet on things , in general , which might have been written by poets in general , as distinguished from him - self .

		Nevertheless , there have been few more successful experiments in this difficult type in recent times .

		Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	uses the English or Shakespearean form of sonnet , with a vivid sense of its characteristic movement , which is less generally understood in our day than that of the `` Italian '' form .

		Even Shake - speare seems frequently not to have troubled to make his final couplet more than a tag or appendix to a lyric already complete in twelve lines .

		This tendency Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	avoids with skill .

		The movement and unity of his lyric may be represented by the rapturous love - sonnet , Number 20 : '' Ah , life is good !

		And good thus to behold From far horizons where their tents are furled The mighty storms of Being rise , unfold , Mix , strike , and crash across a shaken world : Good to behold their trailing rearguards pass , And feel the sun renewed its sweetness send Down to the sparkling leaf-blades of the grass , And watch the drops fall where the branches bend .

		I think to-day I almost were content To hear some bard life 's epic story tell , To view the stage through some small curtain-rent , Mere watcher at this gorgeous spectacle .

		But now the curtain lifts : my soul 's swift powers Else robed and crowned for lo !

		the play is ours !

		NOTES ON NEW NOVELS .

		The author of `` The Hat Shop , '' Mrs.
C. S. Peel	PERSON	, seems to promise a work of the same kind in her later novel , `` Mrs. Barnet Robes '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , but there is considerable difference .

		The titular character is deserted , with a small daughter , by the gentleman she loves , and after hard work establishes herself as a dressmaker of fashion .

		He marries in his own class after a time , and his first child is a daughter .

		The narrative divides itself fairly between the two girls , who meet with - out knowledge of any relationship , but with recognition of an unusual personal resemblance .

		The marriage is unfortunate , and the legitimate daughter grows up in an atmosphere of tragical misunderstanding , while the other develops in a
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 31 humbler walk of life into a happiness entirely normal .

		It is a study of environments , thoughtful and carefully considered .

		Such a book as `` His English Wife '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- , translated by Mr.
A. C. Curtis	PERSON	from the German of
Herr Rudolph Stratz	PERSON	, is bound to have more than fictional value at the present time , written as it was before the outbreak of the war .

		It was widely popular in
Germany	LOCATION	, and has reached a second edition in
England	LOCATION	.

		It describes the difficulties attending the married life of a young German officer and a young English girl whose father was born in
Frankfort	LOCATION	.

		It is just to
Herr Stratz	PERSON	to say that he has contended against the usual impulse to set one 's countrymen a pace or two forward while the foreigner takes two steps to the rear .

		The capture of English trade by
Germany	LOCATION	, one of the industriously ex - ploited fictions of the time , bears no small share in the story .


James Hay , Jr.	PERSON	, has brought the '' temperance '' tract fairly up to the compass of a novel in '' The Man Who Forgot '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- .

		The protagonist has steeped himself in drink until he emerges from his last debauch absolutely forgetful of his past and with no clue to his identity .

		Determined to overthrow the Demon Rum in revenge , as well as for the benefit supposed to enure , he enlists the resources of two millionaires whose sons have turned out drunkards , organizes a nation-wide demonstration at the Capital , and secures thereby the adoption by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of a constitutional amendment forbidding the importation , manufac - ture , and sale of alcoholic beverages .

		Incidentally he gains a desirable wife and comes to a knowledge of his earlier life ; but the propaganda , as usual in such books , outweighs the romance of the tale .

		Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	seems determined to prove that fiction can be stranger than fact , in spite of warring
Europe	LOCATION	's example to the contrary , and '' The Scarlet Plague '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a doughty effort to that end .

		By a world-wide epidemic , humanity is almost obliterated from the world , and the few who outlast the scourge are selected without reference to the survival of the fittest .

		The story is placed in the mouth of a former pro- fessor of a Californian university , transformed into '' a dirty old man clad in goatskins . ''

		Mankind is placed at the foot of the ladder once more , to begin a toilsome ascent , and the grandchildren of the survivors are depicted on the plane of the Digger Indians .

		It is difficult to be sympathetic with such a story ; the realities are sufficiently ghastly nowadays .

		Civilization is at present so shaken by calamity that cataclysmic stories seem necessary if fiction is to make itself as absorbing as the daily news - paper tale of slaughter and destruction .

		Accord - ingly , Mr.
Arthur Train	PERSON	has written '' The Man Who Rocked the Earth '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- to show that science may still have a few things up its sleeve to add to the horrors of daily living ; but he reconciles his readers by invoking this awful power on the side of peace .

		He makes the old dream of Archimedes come true by giving the mysterious '' Pax '' of his narrative an electric lever which shifts the earth 's axis , and promises to twist it further around if the nations do not stop fighting .

		It is an absorbing tale , made plaus - ible in the face of evident difficulties .

		Mystery , complicated by theosophy , makes '' The Brocklebank Riddle '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Hubert Wales	PERSON	, a puzzling story indeed .

		After a man 's wife and his partner have seen him die , and one of them has seen his body cremated , he appears at his office .

		The situation becomes more and more strained when a woman whose husband has disappeared without warning comes to inquire after him .


Brocklebank	PERSON	himself is puzzled , but dismisses all thought of anything supernatural .

		The last pages of the book solve the riddle as ingeniously as the earlier pages proposed it .

		Two German apologists .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		In General von
Bernhardi	ORGANIZATION	's ``
Germany	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Dil - lingham -RRB- , the erstwhile lion of militarism roars you as gently as any sucking dove .

		Americans are sufficiently familiar with the doughty general 's stout defence of war as a biological necessity and a moral and political tonic .

		They will now be amazed to learn from this little book , which is intended for American consumption , that the author never meant to say the things one finds in his earlier volumes , or that somehow , as the Ger - man Chancellor implied of his own unlucky `` scrap of paper '' phrase , he `` had his fingers crossed '' when he did say them .

		War is here justified only when peaceful means have failed , and of course
Germany	LOCATION	had exhausted all such means last
summer	DATE	before the plunge was taken .

		The earlier
Bernhardi	PERSON	had the merit of candor ; the present
Bernhardi	PERSON	is an unpalatable mixture of disingenuousness and naivete .

		He is disingenuous in attempting to explain away his own sincere utterances , and he is naive in supposing that people will be fooled by that attempt .

		Like most of the German apologists , including even the dear departed Dr.
Dernburg	PERSON	, he grievously under - estimates the intelligence of the Am ; erican public .

		The book also comes at a most inop - portune moment , just when pro-Germans in this country have been doing their best to dis - avow and forget
Bernhardi	PERSON	and all his ways .

		A somewhat better statement of the German case is to be found in Dr.
Paul Rohrbach	PERSON	's ''
Germany	LOCATION	's Isolation '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , which has been well translated by Dr.
Paul H. Phillip	PERSON	- son .

		Nevertheless , readers of the same au - thor 's `` German World Policies '' -LRB- reviewed in THE DIAL for
April 15	DATE	last -RRB- will be dis - appointed .

		The book , though written for the most part before the present struggle began , 32 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 24	DATE	was evidently composed in the shadow of com - ing events .

		The tone is aggressive , and even menacing ; it fairly vibrates with the note of approaching conflict , thus unconsciously fur - nishing interesting testimony to the state of mind of some observant Germans in the months before the war broke out .

		An intro - duction and a final chapter have been added by Dr.
Rohrbach	PERSON	since the opening of hostili - ties .

		In the latter he appears as an apologist for all of his country 's acts :
Germany	LOCATION	was not the assailant , the
Kaiser	PERSON	strove almost un - duly to keep the peace , the invasion of Bel - gium was justified because
England	LOCATION	violated Danish neutrality in
1807	DATE	, etc. .

		Yet the sig - nificant admission is made that it is difficult to think of '' a phase more favorable to the German cause than the present alignment of
Germany	LOCATION	's forces and those of her opponents . ''

		The book closes with the inevitable denuncia - tion of
England	LOCATION	as the one unpardonable foe .

		` The stereotyped nature of German thinking on the war has scarcely ever been more patheti - cally revealed than in this volume by an intelligent publicist whose mind in normal times has not lacked proper elasticity .

		The story of From the early
summer of 1843	DATE	a short-lived to the following mid-winter , a little company of `` consecrated cranks , '' as they have since been called by the irreverent , strove to realize the higher life and to set an example to the rest of the world by practising , on a farm at
Harvard	LOCATION	,
Massachu	PERSON	- setts , the principles of strict vegetarianism , `` brotherly love , simplicity and sincerity , and other virtues with next to nothing in the way of material resources whereby to prevent this life of the spirit from becoming as inde - pendent of the body in actual fact as it was in ideal and aspiration .

		But the rigors of a
New England	LOCATION	winter proved too severe a trial of their faith to these apostles of `` the New - ness , '' in their linen tunics and canvas shoes , and unsustained by more invigorating diet than a fast-diminishing ration of barley ; and so the high-hearted enterprise of ushering in the millennium on a regimen of cereals and water came to a premature end .

		``
Bronson Alcott	PERSON	's Fruitlands '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- rehearses the pathetic tale of this adventure in spir - ituality .

		Miss
Clara Endicott Sears	ORGANIZATION	, a dweller upon the hill overlooking the scene of the undertaking , has compiled , in a spirit of mingled `` pity , awe , and affection , '' this account of the ''
Consociate Community	ORGANIZATION	'' founded by
Alcott	PERSON	, with his long-suffering wife and his four daughters , and a half-score of more or less earnest and ascetic souls from different quarters of the globe .

		Letters and diaries , including the bits of journals kept by two of the
Alcott	PERSON	girls ,
Anna and Louisa	PERSON	, with other contemporary records , have been diligently searched and judiciously utilized by Miss
Sears	ORGANIZATION	, who has also added , by permis - sion .

		Miss
Alcott	PERSON	's ever-entertaining '' Trans - cendental Wild Oats , '' and has given in an appendix the very interesting '' catalogue of the original Fruitlands library , '' about a thousand volumes brought from
England	LOCATION	by
Alcott	PERSON	and his friend
Charles Lane	PERSON	, and de - scribed in `` The Dial '' of that time as `` con - taining undoubtedly a richer collection of mystical writers than any other library in this country . ''

		Views of the
Fruitlands	LOCATION	house , exterior and interior , with portraits of the Alcotts and other inmates , are abundantly supplied .

		To readers of discernment the book will commend itself as a veritable treasure .

		avic work most rec ently published of women volume in the `` National Mu - nicipal League Series '' -LRB- Apple - ton -RRB- is Mrs.
Mary Ritter Beard	PERSON	's `` Woman 's Work in Municipalities . ''

		The original plan of the author was to present simply a col - lection of readings illustrating the various phases of her subject .

		It was found , how - ever , that there are not in existence docu - mentary materials adapted to the purpose , and consequently the chapters of the book were written out by the author herself , with free use of passages from reports , correspon - dence , newspaper comment , and other scat - tered `` sources . ''

		The result is a volume covering every important aspect of the civic work of women in this country in the
past quarter-century	DATE	, notably in relation to educa - tion , public health , recreation , housing , cor - rections , the social evil , the assimilation of races , and public safety .

		The fourfold pur - pose of the book is explained by the author to be : -LRB- 1 -RRB- to give something like an adequate notion of the extent and variety of women 's interests and activities in cities and towns , without attempting a statistical summary or evaluation ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- to indicate , in their own - words , the spirit in which women have ap - .

		proached some of their most important prob - lems ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- to show to women already at work and those just becoming interested in civic matters , the interrelation of each particular effort with larger social problems ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- to reflect the general tendencies of modern social work as they appear under the guidance of men and women alike .

		It may be said that , in the main , these praiseworthy objects are accomplished .

		Information concerning thei civic activities of women , in smaller towns no less than in the great cities , is brought to -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 33 gether from widely scattered quarters , sifted , digested , correlated , and presented in form both unassuming - and convincing .

		And the temptation -LRB- which must have been strong -RRB- so to stress the part played by women in civic betterment as to produce an incorrect impres - sion has been resisted .

		Our literature estimated by a foreigner .

		Of considerable interest for the opportunity it gives of seeing ourselves as others see us is the little book on `` American Literature '' -LRB- Double - day -RRB- , by Professor
Leon Kellner	PERSON	of the Uni - versity of
Czernowitz	PERSON	, translated by Miss
Julia Franklin	PERSON	.

		Professor
Kellner	PERSON	's estimates of the greater American writers and their works are , on the whole , those with which we are familiar ; though it seems strange , for example , to find no mention of the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	'' Commemoration Ode '' when three of Low - ell 's lesser odes are praised .

		The peculiarities of the work are found chiefly in the attention bestowed on a.uthors who , at home , are consid - ered '' minor , '' but who to the foreign observer are especially significant .

		Eugene Field and
C. G. Leland	PERSON	are each given as much space as
Bryant	PERSON	; and the former , who is highly praised , almost as much space as
Whittier	LOCATION	.


Emily Judson	PERSON	,
H. C. Dodge	ORGANIZATION	, and
A. W. Bellow	PERSON	are among the names which appear in Professor
Kellner	PERSON	's book , and are not commonly found in native histories of our literature .

		For these judgments of a distant observer , even those which seem most erratic , there are conceivable reasons which the American student would do well to ponder .

		Statements of fact are mostly accurate , but unfortunately the book abounds in crude misprints of proper names which might have been avoided if translator or proofreader had been even moderately famil - iar with American literary history .

		Typical of such blunders are ``
Hannah W. Forster	PERSON	'' -LRB- p. 9 -RRB- , `` Quabi '' -LRB- p. 21 -RRB- , `` Natty Bumppo '' -LRB- p. 33 -RRB- , `` Duyckink '' -LRB- p. 147 -RRB- , ``
Edgar Allen	PERSON	Poe '' -LRB- p. 159 -RRB- , '' The Facts in the Case of M. Waldemar '' -LRB- p. 165 -RRB- the last evidently the result of a double transliteration .

		On page 47 , '' Expostulation '' and ''
Massachusetts	LOCATION	to
Virginia	LOCATION	'' seem , either through a.n error or through awkwardness of the English sentence , to be credited to
Bryant	PERSON	.

		The development ofaninfant phenomenon .

		what is `` Natural Education '' ?

		If we are to accept the view of .

		- , , - , / , - , , TIT - / - i the mother of Miss
Winifred Sackville Stoner	PERSON	, Jr. , whose account of her daughter 's training is published under that title by the Bobbs-Merrill Company , in the '' Childhood and Youth Series , '' it is a '' natu - ral education '' for a girl to be lulled to sleep by the hexameters of
Virgil	PERSON	when six weeks old , to know one forgets how many languages at five , to have written a play in Esperanto at four , to have kept a carefully written diary from the age of two , and to have convinced '' an old-fashioned Professor '' at five that she '' knew all the famous myths handed down by the Grecians , Romans and Vikings , '' etc. , etc. .

		After reading the pages which tell of her knowledge of Latin , another '' old-fashioned Professor '' is tempted to suggest that if this little girl really knows Latin it is a pity that she was not called upon to read the proof of this volume and correct the sad blunders in Latin words and sentences which have passed unchallenged the eyes of her mother , who taught her the language and wrote the book , and of Professor
O'Shea	PERSON	, the general editor of the series .

		The average parent who reads the book will scarcely conclude that the kind of education which it describes is either natural or desirable .

		And yet Professor
O'Shea	PERSON	boldly challenges comparison of the book with
Rous	PERSON	- seau 's ''
Emile	PERSON	, '' claiming for it a style fully as attractive as that of the French classic , and the advantage of being an account of what has actually been accomplished , rather than an exposition of what an educational theorist thinks desirable . ''

		It is not beyond reason , '' he adds , '' to expect that the present volume will do for the practise of teaching at home and in the school what '
Bmile	PERSON	' has done for the theory of education . ''

		Prophecy , of course , can be met only with counter prophecy ; but the style of written books is open to inspection , and .

		Professor
O'Shea	PERSON	will search long for a disinterested and competent critic to agree with him in the dictum that the style of this volume is on a level with that of
Rousseau	PERSON	, or of any other fairly competent master of French prose , an instrument of expression which no other modern tongue equals save in very rare instances .

		The noblest of the arts , in the opinion of the late Governor
Altgeld	LOCATION	, is oratory .

		A new printing of his little book on '' Oratory , '' which originally appeared in
1901	DATE	, now comes from the press with this year 's date on its title-page .

		In discussing the principles of public speaking the author falls little short of poetic fervor in praise of the oratorical gift . ''

		Oratory , '' he declares , '' is an individual accomplishment , and no vicissitudes of for - tune can wrest it from the owner .

		It points the martyr 's path to the future ; it guides the reaper 's hand in the present , and it turns the face of ambition toward the delectable hills of achievement .

		One great speech made to 34 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 24	DATE	an intelligent audience in favor of the rights of man will compensate for a life of labor , will crown a career with glory and give a joy that is born of the divinities . ''

		Like Demos - thenes , Mr.
Altgeld	PERSON	makes '' action , '' or deliv - ery , the first , second , and third requisite of oratory .

		Admirable , and not exactly to be expected from an effective public speaker , is his insistence on literary excellence as a prime essential of good oratory .

		`` Literary excel - lence is the robe of immortality without which no speech can live . ''

		True , but many an un - literary and even illiterate harangue has wrought powerfully upon its hearers .

		Not without autobiographic interest and meaning is the following concerning the orator of , unselfish purpose : `` If he would reach the highest estate possible on this earth he must stand resolutely with his face toward the sun ; and when the cry of oppressed humanity calls for sacrifice he must promptly say , ` Here , Lord , am I. ' '' The greatest orators have not seldom been the champions of lost causes , as the writer notes , and '' defeat is often the baptism of immortality . ''

		A lofty idealism reveals itself on almost every page of this remarkable little treatise , and nowhere more clearly than in the assertion that '' isolation is the price of greatness , and the stars are all the friends an orator needs . ''

		The book is issued by '' The Public , ''

		, ... - , - , r TT i University , entitled '' The Holy War : Made in
Germany	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , is in - tended to clear up misconceptions as to the nature of a jihad or '' holy war . ''

		Following the coup d'etat by which
Germany	LOCATION	dragged hesitant
Turkey	LOCATION	into the war
last October	DATE	came the proclamation of the jihad , by which
Germany	LOCATION	hoped to incite all Moslems to a general attack on
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		That the attack failed to ensue is now a matter of common knowledge .

		Dr.
Hurgronje	PERSON	ex - plains the reasons , and shows how German expectations were based on ignorance .

		Ac - cording to Islamic doctrine , no wars are per - missible except those against the infidels , and every such war is a jihad .

		But modern
Turkey	LOCATION	is mainly made up of Christians , and , con - versely , the majority of Mohammedans are citizens of other countries .

		Moreover , not only is there no political unity in the modern Moslem world , but even the Caliphate or central religious authority of the Ottoman Em - pire is no longer recognized .

		Hence the mis - calculations of
Germany	LOCATION	in trying to revive a mediaeval institution so hopelessly out of place in the world of to-day .

Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first series , en - titled '' The Religion of Science Library , '' was begun just after the World 's Columbian Exposi - tion held in
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1893	DATE	.

		Its purpose was to put the study of religion on a scientific basis , and was the direct outcome of the founding of the
Open Court Publishing Company	ORGANIZATION	by the late
Edward C. Hegeler of La Salle	ORGANIZATION	, 111 .

		He was very much interested in the Religious Parliament idea , the first meeting of which was called the World 's
Congress of Religions	ORGANIZATION	, held in
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1893	DATE	.

		This series deals largely with the philosophy of religion .

		It now numbers seventy volumes .

		The second series will consist of reprints of classics marking the historical development of science and philosophy .

		The first volume of the series is still in preparation ; but the second volume , made up of '' Selections from the Scottish Philosophy of Commonsense , '' has just appeared .

		In thus mak - ing available in convenient and inexpensive form the classics of philosophic thought , the publishers are rendering a service that should be widely appreciated .

WALDO R. BROWNE	PERSON	Two Very Important New Books De
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's Budget of Paradoxes By
AUGUSTUS DE MORGAN	PERSON	Edited with Full Bibliographical Notes and Index By
DAVID EUGENE SMITH	PERSON	Teachers ' College ,
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	Author of
Kara Arithmetica	PERSON	,
Portfolio of Eminent Mathematicians	ORGANIZATION	, etc. , etc. .

		THE BUDGET OP PARADOXES .

		As a piece of delicious satire upon the efforts of circlers of squares , and their kind , there is nothing else in English literature that is quite so good as the delightful Budget of Paradoxes of
Augustus de Morgan	ORGANIZATION	.

		While absolutely scientific in its conclusions , the work is not technical , but is written in a popular style which any one can appreciate .

		THE PRESENT EDITION .

		Many names which were common property in
England	LOCATION	when this work was first published
50 years ago	DATE	, and incidents which were subjects of general conversation then have long since been forgotten , so that some of the charm of the original edition would be lost on the reader of the present day in publishing a reprint .

		Accordingly , in this new edition , it was arranged to leave the original text intact , to introduce such captions and rubrics as should assist the reader in separating the general topics , and to furnish a set of footnotes which should supply him with complete information .

		The publishers feel that this unique work will prove a source of delight to all who peruse its pages .

		THE EDITOR .


David Eugene Smith	PERSON	, Ph.D. , LL.D. , has worked in de
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's library , is thor - oughly familiar with all of de
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's writings , and has a type of mind , tastes , experience and learning , which are sympathetic with those of the author of the Budget .

		VALUE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES .

		This new edition may properly take its place among the valu - able works of reference in our public libraries .

		The circle-squarers and the angle-trisectors are present everywhere and always , and a popular work that will show them their folly is a thing that every library should welcome .

		The great care taken by Dr.
Smith	PERSON	in his notes also renders the work invaluable on a shelf of general reference .

		Two Volumes , pp. 500 each .

		Goethe : With Special Reference to His Philosophy By DR.
PAUL CARUS	PERSON	A sympathetic study of one of the most notable men in the world 's history .

		The author delineates to us
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, the man , the poet , the thinker , and Goethe the man is almost a more attractive figure than the poet or the thinker .

		He was sanely human ; liberal , but not an infidel ; religious , but not dogmatic or addicted to church partisanship ; he worshipped God in Nature , so that we may call him either a pantheist or a monist .

		He was positive in his inmost nature and so opposed the destructiveness of all negativism .

		A positive attitude was so characteristic of Goethe that he denounced the methods of so-called higher criticism as applied to Homer , as well as to the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	.

		His satire on
Barth	PERSON	, the New Testament higher critic of his day , and many of his philosophical poems are here translated for the first time .

		Goethe 's relations with women have often been criticized and rarely understood .

		His friendship with
Friederike	PERSON	is described in this book and judged with fairness .

		The facts are stated , not in a partisan spirit , but purely from the historical standpoint .

		Among the large number of books on the interpretation and appreciation of the ethics and philosophy of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's writings , this one contains the best statement of its undercurrent of philosophic thought .

		74 ESSAYS AND ESSAYISTS .

		We doubt whether any kind of reading yields more easy pleasure than the good essay .

		Of course it lacks the excitements of the higher forms of literature , the vivid lightning and appalling thunder of tragedy ; the epic splendor , where verse marches on like captive kings and warriors in a Roman tri - umph ; the ordered disorder of the comic med - ley , which makes our sides ache and our tense minds relax ; the interest of the novel , which seizes upon us with the first page and keeps us in pleasing torment until we turn the last ; the keen , instantaneous joys and pains of the lyric .

		All these it lacks ; or rather , it has them only by hints and recollected visions .

		The essay is something like an autumn stream which flows before us gleaming white or sombre through its matted debris of red and yellow and green and brown , a carpet which has been blossoms , which has been foliage waving in the wind and sun .

		Half our inter - est in the essay is in the current of mind and personality it reveals , and half in the rich burden which it bears .

		All other literary kinds are fenced about with restrictions : they have laws and methods which they can not overstep ; a circle is drawn about them to keep out the evil influence which would tear them to pieces ; they must retain their form , like a Prince Rupert drop , which if it be pinched in the tail shatters into fragments .

		But the only rule of the essay is to have no rule .

		It is most like a little piece of original chaos .

		Of course it generally has a subtle evolution ; and like everything that tangibly exists , it must have a beginning , a middle , and an end .

		Subject , however , to the slightest restrictions it can be anything and do everything .

		It can jump from one business to another , some of De Quincey 's essays are one monstrous digression .

		It can mingle heroic outlines with the homeliest details , as
Cellini	PERSON	threw his household utensils into the molten bronze to eke out the cast of his Perseus .

		It can be a traveller 's sketch or a Dutch painting of an interior .

		It can be gay and lively with adventure , or can rise to solemn fugues of thought as in Sir Thomas 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE
Browne	ORGANIZATION	's `` Urn Burial , ''
Milton	PERSON	's `` Areopa - gitica , ''
Addison	PERSON	's `` Vision of Mirzah , '' or De Quincey 's '' Our Ladies of Sorrow . ''

		It is the miscellaneous form of literature : an olla podrida ; in its poorest manifestations a hash , what the Bowery waiter calls '' a graveyard stew . ''

		Essays divide into two main species : those which deal with life , and those which voice opinions about books , pictures , art of all sorts .

		We hope we are not pushing analysis too far , but the first of these species again divides into two kinds : the essay where the personality of the author is dominant , and that in which , as in a
Claude Lorraine	PERSON	glass , we get minia - ture glimpses of the outside world .

		In the first we are talking with the man himself , as with the most intimate acquaintance .

		`` We are seated in
Sieur de Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	's library , and he '' rolls us out his mind . ''

		The flood of erudi - tion is much ; but more are his frank revela - tions about himself , his friends , his tastes , even about the gravel which afflicts him .

		Or we are in
Charles Lamb	LOCATION	's chambers , among that wonderful circle of wits and oddities whom he attracted as a loadstone does metallic dust , and we listen to his crackling fire of puns , his rhapsodies about old books and brawn and suckling pigs .

		Or we are with
Hazlitt	PERSON	in the hut at
Winterslow	LOCATION	, watching the red sunset die upon the hills ; or we walk with him a
summer	DATE	's day while he discourses of the poets he has known or the lodging - house keeper 's daughter whom he worshipped .

		Or we are with
Stevenson	PERSON	in the wynds of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, or on the neighboring hills , listen - ing through him to the mighty talkers of his acquaintance .

		All these men are nothing if not autobiographical .

		They are intensely in - terested in themselves and everything that happens to them .

		Why is it that such egotism does not revolt us ?

		They fling themselves upon our interest with the most naive confi - dence , and we receive them with open arms .

		The more they tell us the more we want to know .

		Nay , if an essayist comes along who rather holds us at a distance , we get in a huff and want little to do with him .

		Bagehot is almost as clever as
Hazlitt	PERSON	, and a good deal wittier than
Stevenson	PERSON	; but the world hardly knows that
Bagehot	PERSON	lived .

		He has the reserve of the man of the world , an air of good society ; and , to paraphrase one of his own sayings , it ' is very much as if a steam engine was making phrases .

		To unbosom oneself seems to be a short cut to the affection of the world , which likes to play the part of a priest in the confessional and hearken to sins and peccadilloes , vaunt - ings and vaporings .

		That is the secret of the perennial charm of memoirs , whether Cel - lini 's grim and boasting tale or
Pepys	PERSON	's can - did one .

		It is what gave
Marie Bashkirtseff	PERSON	's book its vogue not long ago ; the world recog - nized that she simply told what most young girls think , though no one before had had the courage to set it down .

		If
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, instead of writing queer verse , had put into good prose all that laudation of himself , he would probably have ten readers where he now has one .

		But the great essayists , those we have named and others of the same blood , min - gle their egotism with modesty and geniality and humor .

		It is their enormous enjoyment of life which they communicate to us .

		The older English essays , those of Addison and
Steele	PERSON	and
Johnson	PERSON	and
Goldsmith	PERSON	, were not nearly so individual , so pregnant with personality , as the later ones .

		These writers , hid themselves under an assumed character ^ or created a club to carry on their miscella - nies .

		They were novelists in miniature , satir - ists and moralists at large .

		They set out to - picture the life about them , to scourge the follies and lighter vices of the world .

		They give vignettes of characters , kit-cat portraits ^ thumb-nail sketches , Sir
Roger de Coverley	PERSON	, .

		Will
Honeywood	LOCATION	,
Beau Tibbs	PERSON	, the Man in Black , and many others .

		The short story exists in their works , in germ at least ,
East	LOCATION	- ern apologues , fables , and the like .

		But in the main they were curiously journalistic .

		They gave the world about them a report of itself .

		And their world was the Town : a world of paint and powder and patches and pomatum .

		When this world was driven from the stage it found refuge in the miscellany prints .

		Bright and charming and various as this form of the essay is , it can not compete with the novel , the comedy , the large satire .

		The essay proper still remains the essay of personality , the intimate talk , that is , of one who is revealing himself at every word .

		The critical essay , however , is perhaps more important , and is certainly the most widely cultivated .

		Authors , artists , creators of every kind , , have .

		always , been contemptuous of the critic .

		.

		But what , do they publish or show their works - for if they do not want people to have opinions about them 1 At its worst , a
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 47 criticism is an advertisement .

		It is true that probably fifty per cent of contemporary criti - cism is always ludicrously wrong .

		But the other fifty per cent is penetrating , just , help - ful .

		After three hundred years of Shake - spearean laudation , there is nothing that sur - passes
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's famous lines on the poet .

		Side by side with Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's sneering remarks about Gray , are his keen and true sentences about
Collins	PERSON	.

		Side by side with ''
Blackwood	PERSON	's '' denunciation of
Keats	PERSON	is Hunt 's enthusiastic appreciation of him .

		Side by side with
Lady Eastlake	PERSON	's description of
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	as one who had forfeited the companionship of her own sex is
Sydney Dobell	ORGANIZATION	's noble eulogium of
Emily Bronte	PERSON	.

		The fact is that really great critics are rarer than great artists .

		In all English literature , there are only four of the former class
Johnson	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Hazlitt	PERSON	, and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	; while there are a good many more than forty great writers .

		Even about the accepted authors of the past the spirit of ignorance and envy is always surging up in revolt .

		We are always being told that Homer and
Virgil	PERSON	,
Shakespeare	PERSON	and
Milton	PERSON	, are passe , and of small account besides some new luminary .

		The critical essay , also , is of two sorts : that which deals with the underlying principles of art , and that which is devoted to appreciations of single authors or works .

		In its greatest manifestations the former kind rises to the treatise ; and a few of these , Aristotle 's '' Poetics , ''
Longinus	LOCATION	's '' On the Sublime , '' and
Lessing	PERSON	's `` Laocob ` n , '' are monuments of genius which dispute place with the great creative works of the world .

		But the brief , discursive , appreciative , critical essay is the more delightful .

		Like an actor 's interpreta - tion of a part on the stage , it adds something to the original .

		It gives the work studied un - der new lights , helps it with caressing tones and endearments of admiration , brings it into focus with other pieces of the same kind .

		It is the critic 's soul and mind thrown in as a makeweight to the author 's .

		It is the greatest reward the artist can receive .

		And for the reader , as Sir
Richard Steele	PERSON	said , there is no greater favor that one man can do another than to tell him the manner of his being pleased .

		The best criticisms are excursions and forays into the past .

		They are onsets to re - cover the body of Patroclus in order to bear him to his tent , cleanse his wounds , and give him splendid funeral .

		Or to change the figure , the undergrowth which is continually
spring	DATE	- ing up tends to choke and kill the giants of the forest ; it is the main business of the critic to make these giants visible and accessible so that their shade and shelter may be of use ; to mankind .

		It is not worth while to exaggerate the im - portance of the essay , either the personal , the creative , or the critical kind .

		Its slippered ease and sauntering pedestrianism are not con - ducive to the great actions of art .

		When the artist is really inspired , soul fuses itself with body .

		Form is a necessity , and that form is succinct , supple , rapid in motion .

		Here and there , essays stand out which fulfil the condi - tions of creative art .

		The '' Urn Burial , '' the '' Reverie in Boar 's
Head Tavern	LOCATION	, Eastcheap , '' the `` Vision of Sudden Death , '' these are some of its triumphs .

		But if the essay is sel - dom great , it is often pleasurable and lovable in the extreme .

		It is literature in undress , the soul uttering itself in artless and unpre - tending ways .

		CHARLES
LEONARP MoORE	PERSON	, CASUAL COMMENT .

		SUPERIMPOSED CULTURE is but a thin var - nish , at best .

		In fact , it is no culture at all , in the true sense of the word .

		Every person capable of culture claims the right to work out his own intellectual salvation from within , aided only by such hints and helps as shall not compromise his spiritual independence .

		In the current issue of '' The
Hibbert Jour	PERSON	- nal , '' a protest against ``
America	LOCATION	's Bondage to the German Spirit '' is made by Dr.
Joseph H. Crooker	PERSON	, whose many years ' observation of the workings of Teutonic academicism in our own colleges and universities has qualified him to speak on the subject with understand - ing and conviction .

		That such a protest should be called for in this one hundred and thirty-ninth year of our national existence is a rather surprising and still more humiliat - ing development , but it is useless to blink the facts as set forth by Dr.
Crooker	PERSON	.

		Too long has it been true , with certain modifications and exceptions , that `` the one thing that makes an impression in our university circles is the scholarship that is marked : Made in
Germany	LOCATION	!

		And just here lies some of the mischief .

		.

		` made ' in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It has been , too often , a scholarship , not ripened in the warm , brooding atmosphere of a humane and humanising culture , but a standardised 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	erudition , intent on ' accumulation of mere facts , tested by cubic measure , sought for ends of efficiency , fitted to help man as a mechanism , and imbued with a vast conceit of knowledge . ''

		Due tribute is paid to all that is best in the spirit that
America	LOCATION	has breathed in from the
Germany	LOCATION	of the past ; nevertheless the question for us to-day is this : '' Is it wise and wholesome to have tens of thousands of our susceptible American youths , in our colleges and universities the intellectual aristocracy of the land , the future leaders of American opinion and action constantly under the training of men who have been thoroughly Germanised and to a decided degree de - Americanised ? ''

		Of course such a question would be pertinent whether our educational ideals and methods were im - ported from
Germany	LOCATION	or
China	LOCATION	or
Mozam	LOCATION	- bique or the planet Mars ; it is the fact of wholesale importation that , first and fore - most , is fraught with possibilities of evil .

		Hope of better things as soon as peace is re - stored brightens the close of Dr.
Crocker	PERSON	's article , which , let it be added , covers a larger field , in its consideration of German influ - ence on
America	LOCATION	, than has been indicated in this brief notice .

		THE DEDICATION OF THE FINEST OF UNI - VERSITY LIBRARY BUILDINGS , the splendid
Widener Memorial	ORGANIZATION	at
Harvard	LOCATION	, took place
June 24	DATE	, with Senator Lodge as the orator of the occasion .

		As he truthfully said , `` no other university and scarcely any state or nation possesses a library building so elabo - rately arranged , so fitted with every device which science and ingenuity can invent for the use of books by scholars and students . ''

		The address was notable from beginning to end for its fine enthusiasm for all that is true and noble in literature and learning .

		It revealed , by quotation and allusion , the wide reading and sound scholarship of the speaker , and showed also his sympathies with all who love good books and find their solace and sus - tenance in the masterpieces of literature .

		Excellent was this passage , toward the end of the speech : '' Here , as to all great collections of books , as to all books anywhere which have meaning and quality , come those who never write , who have no songs to sing , no theories with which they hope to move or enlighten the world , men and women who love knowl - edge and literature for their own sakes and are content .

		Here those who toil , those who are weary and heavy-laden , come for rest .

		Here among the books we can pass out of this workaday world , never more tormented , more in anguish , than now , and find , for a brief hour at least , happiness , perchance consola - tion , certainly another world and a blessed forgetfulness of the din and the sorrows which surround us . ''

		Finely fitting , too , were the lines quoted from a living English poet who writes thus of Shakespeare in these trou - bled times : '' 0 , let me leave the plains behind , And let me leave the vales below ; Into the highlands of the mind , Into the mountains let me go . ''

		Here are the heights , crest beyond crest , With Himalayan dews impearled ; And I will watch from
Everest	ORGANIZATION	The long heave of the surging world . ''

		A NATION 'S UNFAITH IN ITS OWN LITERATURE is not an inspiring spectacle , any more than is a nation 's excessive pride in its own literature .

		Something of that timid questioning of its right to hold up its head in the literary world which this country is thought even yet not to have wholly outgrown is noticeable in modern
Japan	LOCATION	's attitude toward foreign authors .

		Translations and importations hold a noto - riously prominent place in the Japanese book - trade ; and more than one native writer is commenting regretfully on this fact .

		A late issue of '' The Japan Advertiser '' cites an in - stance of this disapproval .

		`` Nation 's ambi - tions , '' it quotes from an unnamed author , ``
spring	DATE	from firm convictions .

		Without the latter there can be no former .

		When we look at the conditions of our world of thoughts , which is easily conquered by foreign ideas and litterateurs , we can not but question the self - confidence of our nation . ''

		The writer then notes the influx of Russian literature that fol - lowed the Russo-Japanese war , and names other European authors that are eagerly read in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		A leading article in '' The
Japan	LOCATION	Times '' makes similar reference to the native fondness for occidental literature of all kinds , and adds : '' The comparative scarcity of new original works undoubtedly promises badly for the intellectual independence of the coun - try .

		The truth is , we have been accustomed to importing ready-made thought and have felt no inconvenience as long as this facility has remained open .

		The present closing up of the intellectual centre of
Europe	LOCATION	by war has , how - ever , awakened us keenly to the disadvantage we are under , and we feel confident that the genius of the race will meet the deficiency , even as necessity will father more original thinking . ''

		A recent remarkable increase in the reading habit is among the best of signs for
Japan	LOCATION	's future , but her considerable literary use of a language not her own , with the occa -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 49 sional inevitable departures from that lan - guage 's proper idiom , is not wholly to be approved , however much the western world is indebted thereto for its knowledge of things Japanese .

		By all means let
Japan	LOCATION	adopt a manageable alphabet in which to write her beautifully expressive tongue , and then let her develop her literature according to her native bent ... OUR ANCESTORS ' RESPECT FOR BOOKS was greater than ours of the present time , partly , of course , because books were far less plenti - ful in the early days than now , and most of them came from the other side of the broad
Atlantic	LOCATION	an ocean much wider then than in this age of steam and electricity .

		At Wil - mington ,
Vermont	LOCATION	, there has been found an old book of records revealing the interesting fact that there existed a `` social library '' in that town as early as
1795	DATE	.

		On the
last day of that year	DATE	the
Wilmington	LOCATION	Social Library was organized , and the record book gives its constitution and by-laws , with a list of sub - scribers .

		Among the miscellaneous entries in the book is one to the effect that
Israel	LOCATION	Law - ton was fined
seventeen cents	MONEY	for dropping tallow on book No. 93 a sufficiently heavy fine , one would think , considering the relative value of money then and now , and the re - movability of grease spots from paper by expert methods -LRB- which , however , may not have been known in the
Wilmington	LOCATION	of
1795	DATE	-RRB- .


Timothy Castle	PERSON	was fined
six cents	MONEY	for spill - ing one drop of tallow on book No. 16 .

		-LRB- Poor fellow !

		He was doubtless so absorbed in his reading and so eager to make the most of the scant hour or so before bedtime that he did not notice how he was tilting the candle . -RRB-


Levi Packard	PERSON	was mulcted in
sixty cents	MONEY	for tearing the binding of book No. 106 a griev - ous offense , surely .

		Other fines were imposed for dogs ' - ears and finger-marks .

		And to think that to-day one can go to the public library , especially in the rush hours , and hand in without fear or trembling a book pretty well stuck up with chewing gum and candy , and quite freely annotated and under - lined in ` pencil if not in ink !

		though of course the library of any librarian reading this is too carefully conducted to admit of any such outrage .

		THE RUSSIAN PEASANT 'S APPRECIATION OP SHAKESPEARE is strikingly illustrated by an incident recorded in Professor
Leo Wiener	PERSON	's recent book , `` An Interpretation of the Rus - sian People . ''

		In a chapter devoted to '' The Peasant '' and containing other instances of unexpected good literary taste among the lowly , the author tells of certain readings be - fore a peasant
Sunday	DATE	school where the hear - ers ranged in age from early youth to forty years or more , and where '' Oliver Twist '' and `` Uncle Tom 's Cabin '' met with high favor , especially when offered in unabridged form ; but still more marked appears to have been the preference for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, uncut and unadapted , to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in short narra - tive prose -LRB- like the Lamb `` Tales '' -RRB- or other - wise shorn of his full glory .

		`` King Lear '' was read to these unsophisticated hearers in .

		three forms , the short tale by
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, a native adaptation with happy ending , and the com - plete tragedy in literal translation .

		The listen - ers ' quick appreciation of the latter , despite its confusing foreign names and unfamiliar setting , was astonishing .

		The success of the reading was complete .

		When one of the younger girls referred to the general simi - larity between '' King Lear '' and the Russian adaptation , '' Old Man
Nikita	PERSON	and his Three Daughters , '' she was met with the contemptu - ous retort : '' What a comparison !

		That was written for peasants , while this is for gentle - folk . '' ''

		This is much better , '' she was prompt to admit , adding that whereas the peasant version had a happy ending , `` such a story never could end well . ''

		Significant was the refusal of this company of working people to be moved to mirth by
Dickens	PERSON	's humor ; it left them blank , it touched no responsive chord , though in other respects
Dickens	PERSON	's genius met with gratifying appreciation .

		It would be interesting to learn whether the same hearers showed themselves at all appre - ciative of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's humor as displayed in his comedies ; they were quick to indicate their enjoyment of the fool in ''
Lear	PERSON	. ''

		But probably life is too serious and even tragic a thing to the mujik to admit of much place for careless merriment .

		MISPLACED BOOKS are for the time being as good as lost , or as bad as lost .

		This is notably true in the case of library books carelessly returned to the open shelves by readers whose regard for order and system is so slight as to render them indifferent to the consequences of carelessly tossing Miss
Alcott	PERSON	's `` Little Women '' on to the shelf containing
Zola	PERSON	's novels , or of tucking away '' The Light of
Asia	LOCATION	'' by the side of '' Vestiges of Creation . ''

		No little act more clearly betrays a person 's lack of that courtesy which consists in a scrupulous regard for the rights and the convenience of others than this thoughtless misplacing of books on the public library shelves .

		At the
Minneapolis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, as appears from the librarian 's '' Twenty - 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	fifth Annual Report / ' these reckless raids of the irresponsible are by no means wholly outside the experience of those in authority .

		Hence it is announced : '' The Shelving De - partment has been reorganized .


Curtis Krake	PERSON	h , as been appointed head shelver , and with the help of two boys has kept the shelves '' ` ready for company ' seven days in the week .

		In addition there was daily revision of the shelves by members of the staff , not only to correct mistakes in shelving , but to remove books ready for mending or binding , or which had lost their labels . ''

		If every library could have its careful
Curtis Krake	PERSON	and corps of assistants , there would be fewer application slips returned to disappointed applicants with the disheartening and often uncon - vincing word , '' Out '' unconvincing because the ' applicant may feel morally certain that no one else in town could possibly desire just that book at just that time .

		Misplacement is more than likely to be at the bottom of the mischief .

		A MONUMENT OF ENCYCLOPAEDIC RESEARCH , bearing witness to the rare devotion , the en - lightened public spirit , the untiring energy , and the comprehensive scholarship of Dr.
Takami Modzume	PERSON	, of
Tokyo	LOCATION	, is now awaiting publication .

		Whether it will be published , or left in manuscript -LRB- of two thousand two hundred volumes -RRB- to the
Imperial Household Department	ORGANIZATION	, depends on the author 's success in obtaining three thousand subscribers of one hundred and
thirty yen	MONEY	each to defray the cost of printing .

		He has spent the best part of his sixtV-eight years , and
140,000 yen	MONEY	of his money , besides incurring a debt of half that amount , in preparing this work for the instruction of his own people in what they ought to know about themselves and their country .

		For thirty years he has been delv - ing in the lore of
Japan	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	, and
India	LOCATION	, going through more than one hundred thou - sand volumes , in the compilation of a refer - ence work having sixty thousand entries , alphabetically arranged , relating to Japanese life and usages , and also in making a vo - luminous compendium -LRB- if that be not a con - tradiction in terms -RRB- of extracts from the hundred thousand volumes examined , these extracts treating of the topics enumerated in his reference work .

		In a country where dis - astrous fires are as frequent as they re in
Japan	LOCATION	, books of the sort required by Dr.
Modzume	PERSON	in prosecuting his self-imposed task .

		are often extremely rare and difficult of access .

		Hence the time and labor and expense involved in his undertaking , which will have a corresponding value when completed . ''

		The
Japan	LOCATION	Times , '' in an appreciative editorial containing the foregoing facts , recalls the ex - ample of another and much earlier Japanese scholar and public benefactor , the Buddhist priest
Ankaku	PERSON	, who in the infancy of Bud - dhism in
Japan	LOCATION	visited
China	LOCATION	and committed to memory all the scriptures of
India	LOCATION	that had been translated into Chinese ; then he re - turned home , hung a small desk to his neck , went from house to house begging a sheet of paper at each , and so in twenty-five years of pilgrimage succeeded in putting into writing the precious results of his arduous studies .

		HOW TO BECOME AN EXPERT BOOK - COLLECTOR is not to be explained in three words , or even in a whole lecture ; but a course of lectures , supplemented by the inspection and handling of some examples of fine book-making , some products of the famous presses of early and later times , will accomplish something toward opening the eyes to what is genuine and what is shoddy in book-manufacture .

		Announce - ment is made of such a course of lectures at
Harvard	LOCATION	, Division of the Fine Arts , for the coming academic year .

		Mr.
George Parker Winship	PERSON	, Lecturer on the
History of Printing	ORGANIZATION	, will give this course , which `` is intended for men who are interested in books as objects of art , and who desire to possess or to produce beautiful books . ''

		From the period of the illuminated manuscript to the present time the history of book-production will be traced , with such attention to mechanical details as ; to enable the pupil to distinguish honest merit from pretentious sham .

		The `` Widener Memo - rial room in the new library building will be the appropriate meeting-place of the class , and not only the Widener collection , but also other special collections from the Treasure Room of the
Harvard Library	ORGANIZATION	will be avail - able as object lessons .

		The
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	and other libraries in the vicinity , private as well as public , will be visited for the purposes of demonstration and instruc - tion ; and in addition to the required reading a written report will be expected from each student on some bibliographical topic of especial interest to him .

		PLUMED KNIGHTS , as we meet them in the pages of romance , are a picturesque and pleasing spectacle .

		When , however , the plume takes the form of a goose-quill -LRB- de - servedly honored symbol of the literary art -RRB- the spectacle seems somehow to lose a great part of its picturesque and pleasing quality .

		Were we not , years ago , a little resentful at being called upon to cease speaking and writing of Mr.
Walter Besant	PERSON	, and to call him
1015	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 51 Sir
Walter	PERSON	?

		Already there was one Sir Wal - ter enshrined in our hearts , and this other , despite his acknowledged modesty and worth , almost seemed like an interloper . ''

		Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	'' also came with some diffi - culty from the tongue long accustomed to the more democratic title ; and , considerably later , '' Sir
James M. Barrie	PERSON	'' caused a little vocal fumbling .

		Harder still would it be to shape our mouths to '' Sir Rudyard Kipling '' or `` Sir
Herbert G. Wells	PERSON	'' or `` Sir
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	. ''

		But who would dare predict , in this be-knighted age , that some such demand may not be made upon us before long ?

		Only the other day that admired Bengalese poet and sage , the author of '' Gitanjali , '' became transmogrified from what his honorable East - Indian ancestry and traditions and his own achievements had caused him to be in our minds and imaginations , and appeared before us in tasteless hybrid form as Sir
Rabin	PERSON	- dranath Tagore .

		It is almost as if , for example , one so distinctive and inimitable as our own
Mark Twain	PERSON	had suddenly been metamor - phosed into '' Sir
Samuel Clemens	PERSON	, '' or ''
Lord Stormfield	PERSON	, '' or some similar inconceivable absurdity .

		In the republic of letters what place or need is there for titles and orders and other bedizenments bestowed by royalty 1 ?

		And yet , after all , this is very much a ques - tion of taste and personal point of view ; and therefore the old adage , de gustibus , will be the short and sufficient rejoinder of anyone not like-minded .

		... THE LIBRARY AS AN AID TO EFFICIENCY is not exactly the kind of library some of us delight in .

		The library of our dreams is likely to resemble , in one respect at least , the ideal university as defined by
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	.

		He used to say a true university is a place where nothing useful is taught ; and it is pleasant to imagine a library as a collection of books containing nothing useful .

		Nevertheless , if books must be turned to other purposes than those of pure delight , one can bear the thought of their promoting the prosperity and happi - ness of some of the hundreds of thousands who daily have access to the thickly sprinkled public libraries of our broad land .

		And there are now many other collections of books , not quite so public , maintained by the great business houses of our large cities as instru - ments for the perfecting of the efficiency of those whom they employ .

		The growing im - portance of these collections has only recently been revealed by the new and enterprising - periodical , `` Special Libraries , '' and there are other kindred publications that call occa - sional attention to the utilitarian aspect of the library .

		For instance , the
June	DATE	issue of the ``
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Library Bulletin '' has an '' eye-opener '' in the shape of a sketch of `` Libraries in Business , '' by
Miss Pearl I. Field	PERSON	, of the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, who is officially connected with the business libraries of the city , so far as they maintain relations with the public library , whose head , be it added , has shown himself energetic in the establishment of such special book-collections in commercial houses .

		THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN READING AND STUDYING is not clearly marked .

		In
England	LOCATION	the university man '' reads '' for honors , or for a coming examination , or to fit himself for a chosen profession .

		He `` reads , '' even though it be algebra or geometry or trigonometry that claims his attention , whereas in
America	LOCATION	these and far more literary subjects would be made the object of '' study . ''

		But it certainly sounds pleasanter and easier and perhaps more dig - nified and gentleman-like to `` read '' for a double-first than to `` study '' for the same prize .

		Therefore it may be well that the Yale authorities , in adopting a well-established custom of
Cambridge University	ORGANIZATION	, have an - nounced that a '' reading term '' rather than a `` studying term '' is to be introduced at
New Haven	LOCATION	in
September	DATE	.

		Thus , it is explained , the students will have '' an opportunity to do special reading a few weeks before the regular opening of the university . ''

		They will be free from the ordinary college routine , and no ex - tra tuition fee will be demanded .

		Shall we , in course of time , have the vacation '' reading parties , '' in rural retreats , so agreeably de - picted in English fiction and elsewhere as a pleasant and profitable part of the English university system ?

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		THE
WISCONSIN	LOCATION	SURVEY ONCE MORE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It is the recognized privilege of a defeated attorney to appeal his case from the trial court to the press , and there to urge , ex parte , evidence that has not found credence and views that have not prevailed in the original tribunal .

		This privi - lege is exercised in THE DIAL of
June 24 , 1915	DATE	, by Mr.
William H. Allen	PERSON	, who there sets forth , at some length , matter submitted by him as '' Joint Director '' of the
University of Wiscqnsin Survey	ORGANIZATION	to his employers , the
State Board of Public Affairs	ORGANIZATION	, and not adopted by that body .

		With its eyes open to all the evidence , that
Board	ORGANIZATION	has chosen to write its own report , which is wholly different in tenor from the findings of its agent and which constitutes a substantial repudiation of those findings .

		The interested reader will do well 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	to compare the report of the
Board	ORGANIZATION	with the report of its employe , and with
University	ORGANIZATION	com - ment thereon , all officially published by
the State of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	.

		* It is not the purpose of this communication to object in any way to Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's right of appeal to the public , but it seems necessary to warn the public in considering that appeal not to give credence to alleged facts or conclusions without specific verification from original sources or com - parison with
University	ORGANIZATION	comment .

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's letter teems with misstatements which have been publicly challenged and refuted by the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		This refutation need not be here repeated , since it is readily accessible in the official report ; but one case of gross misrepresentation seems to call for some comment , viz. , the eight doctors ' theses dis - cussed by Mr.
Allen	PERSON	with much condemnation of their alleged slovenly , unscholarly , and dishonest character .

		The facts are as follows : Eight doctors ' theses were read , under Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's direction , by persons professing no compe - tence in the subject matter of the theses , but under instructions to look for misspelled words , errors of punctuation , citation , and other mechanical de - fects .

		Some of these theses , although accepted by the
University	ORGANIZATION	for substantial merit , were , at the time chosen for their inspection , incomplete work in that they were fresh from the hands of the amanuensis and had not been revised for the printer .

		Numerous errors of the kind sought were here available , as is common in such unrevised '' copy '' ; and the following specimens , incor - porated in the printed
Allen	PERSON	report , illustrate his standards for measuring the value of research work .

		He found '' coust '' for `` coast , '' `` ofra '' for `` of a , '' `` chashed '' for `` clashed , '' '' cof rec - tion '' for '' correction , '' etc. .

		They are all pre - served for posterity , as the transient ripple on some beach of past ages is preserved in fossilized mud .

		Some of the theses read were in their defini - tive , published , form , and the critic graciously acknowledged that here '' there were relatively few errors in spelling , '' '' relatively few typographical mistakes . ''

		The
University	ORGANIZATION	protested and protests this whole procedure as directed only to '' its clothes , '' and in no way furnishing a criterion of substantial merit in its work .

		Criticism directed toward such merit , made by Mr.
Allen	PERSON	, in the revision of his report for the printer , apparently under the stimulus of the phrase last quoted ,
the University	ORGANIZATION	regards as a wholly different matter , directed in fact '' to the living body , '' and legitimate in aim if not in execution .

		Although often flippant in tone and showing little competence in respect of the matter criticized , these Survey queries and innuendoes -LRB- positive statements are conspicuously lacking -RRB- have received detailed reply that is published in the official volume .

		The
University	ORGANIZATION	justifies its acceptance and approval of the theses in question '' , with one exception , and defends their substantial * Report upon the Survey of

		worth .

		One thesis contains many quotations from a book often cited .

		In three cases the quoted mat - ter , of considerable extent , is not accompanied by the proper marks and references , and the Uni - versity here concedes a technical plagiarism -LRB- pos - sibly flagrant -RRB- that should not have escaped detection .

		Among the other seven theses there is doubtless a considerable range of excellence , although in Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's hands they fall under a common con - demnation having little relation to differences in their real merit .

		An accurate estimate of such merit is indeed difficult , since different critics of like competence may , and do , differ considerably in their judgment of the same thesis .

		With respect to these differences , always unavoidably present , the
University	ORGANIZATION	conceives its duty to be : To main - tain a standard of excellence below which no thesis shall be accepted , and to secure in the average thesis a degree of merit considerably exceeding this minimum standard .

		In
University	ORGANIZATION	opinion the theses in question satisfy the requirement thus formulated , but recognizing that neither its own officers nor Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's agents can pass definitive and final judg - ment in this respect ,
the University	ORGANIZATION	, conforming to a recognized practice , seeks through publication to submit every doctor 's thesis to the judgment of all scholars interested in its field .

		For each thesis here criticized by Mr.
Allen	PERSON	, where such publica - tion has not yet been made ,
the University	ORGANIZATION	has submitted the work to the judgment of two or more scholars of recognized eminence in its field , and with their approval has published over their names their judgments concerning it .

		None of these scholars was in any way connected with the preparation of the theses or with
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	.

		A few of the less favorable of these judgments are reproduced by Mr.
Allen	PERSON	, who neglects , however , to point out that in every case the weight of opinion is that the
University	ORGANIZATION	would have erred in refusing approval to the thesis .

		He ignores hearty commendation of theses scorned by himself , and is quite oblivious to com - ment by two eminent scholars upon the thesis most sharply -LRB- but wrongly -RRB- condemned by himself as plagiarized .

		In their phrase , '' it is a good thesis , '' '' good enough to print with credit to the
University	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' I have been unable to find any errors '' ; and there follows sharp comment by one of these scholars upon the presumption dis - played by the Survey critic in dealing with a thesis outside the range of his competence .

		It is not here purposed to inflict upon the reader a review of Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's aberrations .

		They and the commentary upon them must be sought in the official printed record ; but the foregoing ex - hibit is fairly typical of the points at issue .

		To the reader having some familiarity with
University	ORGANIZATION	life and work , the fatuous character of much of the material furnished by Mr.
Allen	PERSON	to THE DIAL will appear sufficiently evident without comment , e. g. , that any one person should '' supervise research '' and '' read theses offered toward ad - vanced degrees by graduate students '' working in the most diverse fields of knowledge , astronomy ,
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 53 bacteriology , chemistry , dairying , electrical engi - neering , forestry , geology , history , language , mathematics , etc. .

		The day of the Admirable
Crichton	PERSON	is past , at least in university circles ; and such universal genius as would be here re - quired seems reserved for non-academic folk .

		Possibly a revelation of such abnormal genius should be recognized in Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's assurance to the reader that '' the Survey set out to be coopera - tive '' and agreement as to fact '' was easily reached with regard to early sections . ''

		The writer of these lines recalls with mixed feelings the long list of corrections to such early sections , furnished by himself , in writing , formally ad - dressed by name to the '' Joint Director , '' but never acknowledged , never discussed , and appar - ently without effect upon his published report .

		If an '' agreement '' may be thus reached '' with - out difficulty , '' whose are the minds that meet in it ?

		We deeply regret that an opportunity to render large service to academic interests through a com - petent and judicial survey of the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	has been worse than wasted by em - ployes of the
State Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nevertheless ,
the University	ORGANIZATION	will consider in detail the study made by them , and will doubtless find among much chaff some good grain for which it will be pleased to make due acknowledgment .

		A WORD FOE DR.
ALLEN	PERSON	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		If THE DIAL was mistaken in its editorial enti - tled `` A Bull in the
Educational China	LOCATION	Shop , '' it was gratifying to see that it had the fair - ness to acknowledge its fallibility by allowing Dr.
Allen	PERSON	to present his version of the story to your readers .

		It is true that '' no one expected this - kind of a survey . ''

		Not even the
University of Wiscon	ORGANIZATION	- sin , though it was opposed to the idea of a survey from its inception , expected that the truth , so carefully hidden through its bureau - cratic organization , its clever advertising , and its ingenious appeal to the people of the state through its agricultural and extension work , would be so frankly and completely laid before the pub - lic .

		The
University	ORGANIZATION	wanted generalities .

		It got detailed facts .

		It wanted a report picturing the
University	ORGANIZATION	as a few in authority wished it to be seen .

		It got a report as the six hundred faculty members saw it .

		Had Dr.
Allen	PERSON	submitted to the intimidation brought to bear upon him in an effort to suppress certain findings , had he been willing to overlook the faults of those high up in educational circles , his report would have been lauded and extolled , and he himself doubtless taken into the inner circle of the elect .

		Surely it is time that we have found some one who is not afraid to tell the truth as he sees it , who will not be bound by the educational autocrats of the country , but who will come forth as a leader of the many who know , as he knows , that freedom of speech and freedom of action in the field of higher education are but rights in name alone .

		KUNO MEYER AND THE HARVARD PRIZE - POEM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		While agreeing fully with the general tenor and point of view of the excellent leading article , '' The Pity of It ! ''

		in your issue of
June 24	DATE	, I should like to point out that your statement of fact regarding the recent
Kuno Meyer	PERSON	incident at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	is not accurate .

		After quoting from Professor
Meyer	PERSON	's denunciation of the university , you say : '' The occasion for this outpouring of emo - tion is nothing more than the fact that an irrespon - sible student , in a publication entirely controlled by students , has written in a sense antagonis - tic to the German cause ! ''

		But in reality Pro- fessor
Meyer	PERSON	's resentment , however immoderate , rested on sounder grounds .

		The offending poem , though written by an undergraduate , and pub - lished in '' The
Harvard Advocate	ORGANIZATION	, '' an under - graduate magazine , had been awarded the prize in a competition for poems about the war con - ducted by the `` Advocate , '' and the two judges who made this award were Dean
Briggs	PERSON	and
Professor Bliss Perry	ORGANIZATION	.

		Was it wholly unnatural that Pro- fessor
Meyer	PERSON	should interpret this action of two such prominent representatives of
Harvard	LOCATION	as indicative of the university 's attitude toward his country ?

		At any rate , it seems to me that your writer 's statement of the circumstances connected with the incident , as quoted above , is quite unfair in view of the facts which I have cited .

		A TRANSLATOR 'S ERROR .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In one of your recent issues a contributor cites some amusing mistakes of authors , and among these instances one from
Henry Bordeaux	LOCATION	.

		A passage from that writer 's novel '' Les Yeux qui S'ouvrent , '' issued in English as '' The Awaken - ing , '' is quoted , in which the heroine speaks of a '' telegraphed letter , '' and a few pages further on , a reader of this '' telegraphed letter '' is made to recognize the handwriting .

		The mistake is not
Bordeaux	LOCATION	's , but the translator 's .

		The original French reads : '' C'est une lettre sous enveloppe pneumatique . ''

		In other words , it was a letter sent by special pneumatic tubes or cjiutes , one of the '' petits bleus , '' with which dwellers in
Paris	LOCATION	are familiar as being the French equivalent of our '' special delivery . ''

		In a letter so sent there would of course be nothing absurd about one 's recognizing the handwriting .

July 15	DATE	THE MODERN THOREATI .

		*
Longfellow	LOCATION	, so it is reported , is being less and less read in
America	LOCATION	.

		What the statistics may indicate as to
Thoreau	LOCATION	, I have no means of ascertaining ; but I am confident that in the future he will be read more and more .

		His publishers are evidently of the same faith , for they have just issued a new and most convenient pocket edition of his com - plete works , in eleven volumes , bound in attractive leather covers , with good illus - trations -LRB- many of them new -RRB- , and other embellishments suggesting an author whose circulation is to be wide and permanent .

		But I do not base my thesis as to
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's increasing popularity on the appearance of this fine new edition , although that is a good commercial argument .

		I believe in his widen - ing audience because I believe in his increas - ing value for American life and American thinking .

		This is not merely because
Thoreau	PERSON	is the most satisfying student of nature , certainly since
Gilbert White	PERSON	, perhaps in English lit - erature .

		Nor is it solely because of his vigor - ous philosophy .

		You can not separate his natural science from his speculation without injustice .

		You can as little appreciate Tho - reau 's philosophy without his science , or his nature without his thought , as the song of a woodthrush away from the cool darkness of the
June	DATE	woods .

		It is the combination that makes this shy and courageous New En - glander an enduring figure .

		Thoreau entered upon his research into the secrets of nature in the spirit of wonder , not romance , or sentiment , but intelligent and stimulating wonder .

		And he came back from wondering with his mouth full of shrewd say - ings and intensely practical thought .

		No one can read `` Walden '' or `` Spring '' without feeling that this man stood with his feet firmly on the ground of fact ; no one can read them without realizing that here is one American at least who has made a permanent contribution to the theory of what is worth while in living .

		The modern schools of `` nature students '' have diverged widely from the path which
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	followed .

		The scientists have eschewed philosophy , and confined themselves to ascertainable fact .

		Well enough for them ; but unfortunate , perhaps , for us , who wish some profit from nature in our time , and may * THE WRITINGS OF

		Would Plato have been a specialist in egg-fertilization in
1915	DATE	?

		one wonders .

		If so , the worse for the world and for Plato !

		As for the mere '' nature lovers , '' they have gone to the other extreme ; they have foregone the ideals of science completely , and lapsed into sentimentality .

		Thoreau was thrilled by a wild duck , a rhodora , even a muskrat .

		For the romantic nature lover , beast , bird , and flower must be given false per - sonality and all the attributes of man before his imagination kindles .

		This is the decadence of nature study , as the ultra-scientific atti - tude threatens to become its Alexandrianism .

		Thoreau 's practice was first to study nature honestly , and then to think from it into terms of human life .

		His observations are pain - fully exact , without perhaps always being accurate .

		See how he measures his dead moose , makes notes upon the webs of his flying squir - rel , records the flowers of each
Maine	LOCATION	back - .

		water , and studies the habits of the musquash whenever and wherever he finds him .

		But his notes are seldom complete .

		They are not , indeed , an end in themselves .

		Many of his records would be scorned by a professional classifier .

		But for their own purposes they are complete enough .

		Thoreau studies the
Maine	LOCATION	forests that he may think out the value of the pine tree for man .

		He tramps the frozen marshes of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	that he may speak honestly of what thrills him in wild nature after knowing it as one knows a friend .

		Always he is pushing down to fact , always rising again to correct and renew his specula - tions .

		He did not live to classify , he classi - fied to live .

		A casual reader might well suppose that
Thoreau	PERSON	's passionate attempt to know his environment was merely a phase of self - development .

		He is constantly speaking of the '' flow '' of his life , always moving toward some unattained goal .

		He is ever allowing the personal joy which observation gave him to escape into his pages .

		But
Thoreau	PERSON	's ardent independence is deceptive .

		Walden was a social , not an individual , experiment , paradoxical as it may seem .

		It was an at - tempt to discover how man will live when self-dependent and free of the conventions , rather than a call to the hermit 's life .

		And this is true of all
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		They are social , in a very excellent sense .

		They consti - tute , one and all , an attempt to link the American to his environment , to his soil .

		See with what intense curiosity he studies the Indian .

		See with what entire absence of illu -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 55 sion or sentimental romance he delights in his instinctive responses to natural phenomena .

		How he rejoices when
Polis	PERSON	finds a hidden trail , or hears the moose across miles of water .

		The Indian is in accord with his background he has sunk roots in his soil .

		Compare
Thoreau	PERSON	's
Maine	LOCATION	studies with his ramblings in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and you will find that he does his
Massachusetts	LOCATION	better .

		He finds more soil for the white man there .


Maine	LOCATION	, for
Thoreau	LOCATION	, is impressive ; but a little alien , a little monotonous .

		It fits the Indian ; it does not fit him .

		He prefers it to
Boston	LOCATION	; but not to the country that lies about Con - cord .

		The rapprochement with nature that he seeks is more difficult in the endless for - ests of spruce and fir , than upon Lee 's cliff , and round
Walden	PERSON	pond .

		If I am right in my speculation ,
Thoreau	PERSON	is best understood in the simile of civilized man in a new country , trying to strike spir - itual roots into the environment it offers , as .

		his pioneer ancestors had in a very real sense made physical roots to grow there .

		This ex - plains the alternation of fact and ` philosophy that characterizes every one of his books , and most of all his best . ''

		It is not important that the poet should say some particular thing , but that he should speak in harmony with nature , '' he says ; meaning , I think , that the creative artist 's first duty is to know his environment .

		And for
Thoreau	LOCATION	, environment was primarily nature . ''

		Properly speaking there can be no history but natural history , for there is no past in the soul , but in nature . ''

		This may not be absolutely true ; but it is true enough for the white man in
America	LOCATION	.

		One fault , at least , in
Thoreau	LOCATION	's work may be assignable to this pioneer quality .

		His writing often lacks form .

		It is best when it is closest to the diary , the most formless of literary modes .

		This has hurt his reputation with contemporary readers .

		The present is an age of form at least in
America	LOCATION	.

		We have achieved technique .

		Our short stories , our novels , our plays , and our photo-plays , are well built , even when there has been little with which to build them .

		A child recognizes form in a short story , and is troubled by its absence .

		A grown man often can not tell good substance from bad .

		We read our Thoreau by excerpt selected where form has been at - tained , the wrong way to read him .

		The fault in part is
Thoreau	LOCATION	's .

		His life , as he says himself again and again , was always flowing .

		Like all faithful students , he never reached his goal .

		Unlike many philosophers , he was ever willing to test his creed .

		Hence his books are all experimental , all , even `` Walden , '' mere notes upon life .

		He did not live long enough to find the ultimate form his imagination required .

		A deficiency this , if we are to judge him as an artist , although the age was quite as responsible as his genius .

		But even in this artistic incompleteness one finds a tonic .

		He is good medicine for the careless modern reader , who has come to believe that a well-worded description , a well - balanced narrative , an essay properly con - ducted to its final `` punch . ''

		is , by reason of its successful form , necessarily true and good . ''

		Nothing can be more useful to a man than a determination not to be hurried . ''

		Thoreau was not hurried into a deceptive , a prema - ture , a hollow perfection .

		His notes on life are unfinished , but they are true .

		And yet , though every one of his books , in a sense , is unfinished , I believe , as I have already said , that
Thoreau	PERSON	will remain the most appreciated of all our earlier writers .

		His attitude toward the American background is more familiar now that most of us '' take to the woods '' at least once a year , than before the Civil War .

		His value becomes greater in measure as it becomes more difficult to breed such independent livers and thinkers .

		Civili - zation weighs upon us with a greater weight of complexity .

		The luxuries he despised are not only more abundant , they are more desirable than in his sparse
New England	LOCATION	.

		- Convention is more difficult to escape , because it has crys - ^ tallized in a vast and bourgeois society .

		Fur - thermore , even when we produce Thoreaus , they do not speak out .

		They are self - regard - ing , not social .

		The mass of mediocre Amer - icans for whom our magazines are edited `` and our books written daunts them .

		They may follow his advice of not hurrying .

		They may keep themselves free from the incumbrance of convention , as
Thoreau	PERSON	kept his freedom by distrusting the ownership of land .

		But the weight of the vast majority keeps them silent .

		In idiosyncratic , free-thinking
New England	LOCATION	of the ` forties a `` crank '' like
Thoreau	PERSON	could be sure of a hearing .

July 15	DATE	SOCIALISM AND THE GREAT WAR .

		* Almost as soon as German feet touched Belgian soil , books of crimination and re - crimination , of explanation , history , poetry , and prophecy , began to pour from the press .

		The first nine months of the war have given birth in
America	LOCATION	alone to two hundred and thirty-eight independent publications , as listed in the '' Cumulative Book Index '' under the title , '' the European war . ''

		What the European presses have added to this number is only a matter of conjecture .

		Needless to say , much of this current history , born of the moment , dies in the next moment .

		Some of it will furnish valuable grist for future histo - rians , however , especially those works which aim at compilation of documentary evidence .

		Of such books , Mr.
William English	PERSON	Waiting 's '' Socialists and the War '' deserves and no doubt will receive high place .

		Whatever one may think of Socialism , the student of the times finds it of growing inter - est and importance to know what the socialists think .

		What they think of war and of the war is just now supreme .

		Mr.
Walling	PERSON	, a trained student of politics and economics , a socialist himself of robust , independent , and non-sectarian opinions , undertakes to satisfy this interest in a volume containing the con - centrated essence of socialist pronouncements .

		He conceives his task as purely editorial ; and with remarkable judgment he sifts and culls , and with remarkable restraint he limits him - self to a minimum of comment .

		To present a brief adequate review of a book already so condensed and digested is of course an impos - sible task ; yet one may hope to give some general topographical features .

		The book is planned in five parts .

		Part I. gives the general position of the socialists on war , including their attitude toward nation - alism , militarism , and imperialism .

		Impor - tant chapters are devoted to the
General Strike	ORGANIZATION	as a remedy against war , and to the refusal of money aids for military purposes .

		Part II .

		deals with the period immediately before the war , the Balkan affairs with their sequels , and the revolutionary general strikes in
Russia	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Part III. , `` The Out - break of the War , '' is a splendid digest of the statements of official bodies and prominent socialists of the world , defining their attitude toward the inpending conflict .

		Part IV. , the largest and by far the most important section , gives an account of socialist action and opin - ion during the war .


Germany	LOCATION	naturally is con - sidered with greatest particularity .

		Part V. * THE SOCIALISTS AND THE WAR .

		By
William English Wall	PERSON	- ing .


New York	LOCATION	:
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		takes up the socialist peace policy , and the consideration of various alleged socialist measures to which the belligerent governments have been driven .

		From these five hundred pages bristling with fact , opinion , and argument , certain salient observations are to be made .

		First , it is plain that Marxism is not synon - ymous with Socialism .

		A group of Marxian or '' classical '' socialists is everywhere con - fronted by a group of `` revisionists , '' social - ists who believe in a progressive revelation .

		It seems worth while to note this , because a common assumption of the opponents of Socialism is that every socialist must hold to
Marx	PERSON	or , socialistically speaking , be damned .

		Nothing could be more absurd .

		However , it might be remarked that
Marx	PERSON	was no mean prophet regarding the present war .

		In
1870	DATE	, three days after Sedan , he wrote : '' Whoever is not totally stupefied by the noise of the moment , or has no interest in stupefy - ing others , must realize that the war of
1870	DATE	bears within its womb the necessity of a war with
Russia	LOCATION	... If they -LSB-
Germany	LOCATION	-RSB- take
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	, then
Russia	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	will make war on
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It is superfluous to point out the disastrous results . ''

		Second , clear and abundant evidence is pre - sented here to prove what is now pretty gener - ally admitted : that despite the lapses of occasional groups into jingoism or junkerism or Chauvinism , socialists have been both in season and out of season the season of war fever the pioneers and champions of peace .

		On
July 30 , 1914	DATE	, at the demonstration of the
Internationalist Socialist Bureau	ORGANIZATION	in
Brussels	LOCATION	, the German delegate
Haase	PERSON	said : '' The Austrian ultimatum was then , in reality , an actual provocation for a war both longed for and awaited .

		Servians answer was , it is known , drawn up in a spirit so moderate that if good faith were admissible on the part of the Aus - trians , peace would be assured .


Austria	LOCATION	wanted war .

		But what is so dreadful is the fact that this criminal madness can cover all
Europe	LOCATION	with blood .

		.

		.

		The German proletariat contends that
Germany	LOCATION	ought not to intervene even if
Russia	LOCATION	should in - tervene . ''

		What French socialists thought before the violation of
Belgium	LOCATION	is seen in the words of the martyred
Jaures	PERSON	on the same occasion : `` As for ourselves , it is our duty to insist that the government speak forcibly enough to Rus - sia to make her keep hands off .

		But if
Russia	LOCATION	unfortunately should not take notice , our duty is to say , ' We know but one treaty , the treaty that binds us to the human race . ' ''

		It is not difficult to conceive why a
Chauvinistic France	LOCATION	demanded the life of the author of
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 57 this unpatriotic sentiment .

		Everywhere one can read the same stubborn story .

		On
August 1 , 1914	DATE	, after the outbreak of the war against
Austria	LOCATION	, the Servian socialists in
Parliament	LOCATION	refused their support to the government .

		In
1911	DATE	the sole socialist deputy in the Bulgarian Assembly ,
Sakasoff	LOCATION	, cast the only ballot against war .

		Marx and
Engels	PERSON	were not pacificists , and practically all socialists believe with
Bebel	PERSON	in purely defensive war ; yet it is marvellous how long , in the present world - madness , their internationalism kept them sane .

		For instance , Mr.
J. Ramsay Macdon	PERSON	- ald , Chairman of the
Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	, in an article in '' The Labor Leader '' of
August 13	DATE	last , '' excused
Germany	LOCATION	's declara - tion of war against
Russia	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, and put upon
England	LOCATION	the chief responsibility for the war between
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		The best statement of the tragic socialist fail - ure , despite everything , to keep out of the war , is found in the `` Arbeiter Zeitung '' rep - resenting the Austrian socialists : '' In all countries we Socialists , German , French , English , Belgian , Austrian , Servian , have done our duty as internationalists , as long as it was possible ; we warned against the war , and with every drop of our blood have sought to hinder it ; and we tried to make use of every possible chance of maintaining peace up to the very last minute . ''

		But since Fate has overtaken us and over - come us , the proletariat in all countries , which formerly did its international duty , now does its duty as sons of its people , who risk everything in order that the people shall not be conquered , in order that its soil will not be delivered to the horrors of a defeat .

		We all suffer wrong ; we all do right to protect ourselves against it ... But even in this tragic moment we do not forget that we are International Social Democrats .

		Our hearts bleed because of the frightful necessity of this conflict , but we give to our people and to the
State	ORGANIZATION	what belongs to the people and the
State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This is clearly meant to apply in justification , not of Austrian socialists alone , but of all combatants .

		No franker , braver , or more chari - table utterance has been evoked by the war .

		Third , it becomes clear that socialists have no stereotyped diagnosis and panacea for war .

		While they believe with Mr.
Morris Hillquit	PERSON	'' that modern wars are mainly caused by the industrial competition between nations , '' wide variations in emphasis appear .

		Kautsky , `` the intellectual leader '' of German radical socialists , thinks `` that there may develop in the present war a combination of the stronger nations which will put an end to the competi - tive building of armaments . ''

		Thus war would be ended not by Socialism , but by a developed capitalism .


Otto Bauer	PERSON	attributes war squarely to Nationalism , the economic in - terests of all classes .

		On the other hand the majority of the French socialists , including
Jaures	PERSON	, announced at
Stuttgart	LOCATION	in
1907	DATE	: '' Militarism is to be viewed exclusively as the arming of
the State	ORGANIZATION	in order to keep the work - ing classes in political and economic subjec - tion to the capitalist class . ''

		Needless to say , this is also a common view in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Fourth , it is demonstrated absolutely that the German socialists were not a unit in the support of the government at the outbreak of the war , and that there is a strong and grow - ing opposition in the party to the war 's con - tinuance .

		Geyer of
Saxony	LOCATION	led a strong minority , 37 to 52 , against the war budget of
1913	DATE	; and the majority voted for it solely because it called for a direct tax upon the capitalist class , thus coinciding with their principles .

		On
December 2	DATE	, when
Karl Lieb	PERSON	- knecht was the only member of the Reichstag to vote '' no '' to the second war loan , he was not the only socialist to think '' no . ''

		Twenty - five stood by him in the
Party Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and fourteen of these absented themselves when the vote was taken , indicating in the only ' legitimate socialist manner their dissent to the majority .

		At the voting of the third loan on
March 20	DATE	,
Ruehle	PERSON	stood with Liebknecht , and thirty other party members stayed away . ''

		Vorwaerts , '' the most powerful organ of German Socialism , has never defended the Reichstag vote , and has opposed the war up to the extreme limit of the censor 's blue pencil .

		Fifth , it is perfectly clear why the majority of German socialists support the righteousness of the cause of enlightened
Germany	LOCATION	against the encroachments of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Sixth , socialists in every belligerent coun - try are divided roughly into two groups : de - fenders of the war as defensive , and a minority sternly pointing to the same issues they have always pointed out , commercial rivalry and militarism .

		In each country , with the ex ?

		ception of
France	LOCATION	, where the completest una - nimity against the German invasion exists , certain prominent socialists arraign their own government with the same impersonal justice that is to be found in neutral countries . ''

		Vorwaerts '' in
Germany	LOCATION	, Messrs.
Ramsay Macdonald	PERSON	and
Keir Hardie	PERSON	and
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	, and
Martoff	ORGANIZATION	in
Russia	LOCATION	illus - trate this remarkable socialist sanity .

		Seventh , socialists in neutral countries de - sire
Germany	LOCATION	to be successful against ` despotic
Russia	LOCATION	, but not against democratic
England	LOCATION	and republican
France	LOCATION	.

		The Poles , to be sure , feel that there is little choice between
Russ	PERSON	and Pruss .

		An article in '' The American Socialist '' of
January 9 , 1915	DATE	, sums up the 58 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	American view on this point : '' Whatever the cause of human progress may gain through a punishment of Prussian militarism , it will lose a hundredfold through a victory of Rus - sian despotism . ''

		Mr.
Hillquit	PERSON	is for a draw and a return to the status quo , while Mr.
Debs	PERSON	, and also evidently Mr.
Walling	PERSON	, are strongly opposed to such a no-termination .

		An inter - esting passage from Betel 's Memoirs reads like an extract from
Norman Angell	PERSON	's thesis in '' The Great Illusion '' : '' My view is that defeat in war is rather advantageous than dis - advantageous to a people in our unfree condi - tion .

		Victories make a government that stands opposed to a people arrogant and exact - ing .

		Defeats compel them to approach the people and win their sympathy . ''

		The back - ground is very different from Norman An - gell 's , but the conclusion is identical ; and by the same token , diametrically opposed to that of Plechanoff , who thinks that a German vic - tory over
Russia	LOCATION	would mean `` an almost indefinite triumph of Russian despotism . ''

		Eighth , socialist peace plans have thus far , through mutual distrust and international war divorcements , proved as frustrate as any others .

		Little can or need be said on this topic .

		The end is not yet .

		One further question is of prime interest .

		It has been said by socialist and non-socialist press alike that the exigencies of war have forced several of the governments engaged to adopt socialist measures .

		Is this true ?

		Yes and no .

		Take two prominent illustrations .

		State Socialism in
Germany	LOCATION	was undoubtedly making rapid progress before the war , through graduated inheritance and income taxes and taxes on the unearned increment in land .

		The war chest was filled by a direct tax on capital , even amounting to confiscation .

		To raise the immense amounts necessary to pay interest on the war loan , it will be necessary to increase taxes of this sort .

		This would tend to redis - tribute large fortunes , and would really amount to Socialism .

		`` Vorwaerts , '' on the other hand , stamps as a dangerous illusion the tendency to regard government organization of industry for war purposes as socialistic .

		Government ownership , as Kautsky points out in `` Die neue Zeit , '' gained by purchase at the market price and not by confiscation , has no vital resemblance to Socialism .

		Again , it is asserted that the British Gov - ernment , in nationally organizing the rail - roads of ` the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	at the beginning of the war , took a long step toward Socialism .

		In a sense that is true .

		It was shown how easy and natural such a change could be effected .

		But at the core this measure no more resembles Socialism than does martial law .

		The government agreed to pay the railroads '' the sum by which the aggregate net receipts of the railways for the period during which the government is in possession of them , fall short of the aggregate net receipts for the corresponding period for
1913	DATE	'' ; also to guar - antee them against any injury they might sus - tain , thus providing the railways assurance of kindly government aid in making long de - ferred improvements .

		Only the worst enemy of Socialism would see a real resemblance here .

		However , as Mr.
Lloyd-George	PERSON	has pointed out , '' the British people are essentially a peo - ple who act on example and experiment rather than on argument , '' and other peoples are pretty much of the same stripe ; so if these various experiments in nationalization and municipalization prove successful , there is reason to expect that in the future they will become what they are not now , socialistic .

		The culture which it considers was first brought into prominent notice by
Schliemann	PERSON	's finds at
Mycenae	LOCATION	.

		It has been made more fully known by later investigations , to some degree in the Greek mainland but principally in

		No archaeological studies have produced greater surprises , or forced more far-reaching criticism of earlier-held views .

		As a whole , the cul - ture represents the `` bronze age , '' and is of remarkable beauty and interest and has had a great influence .

		As regards nomenclature , the Minoan culture , the full Cretan development , is divided into three main divisions Early ,

		Mr.
Hall	PERSON	devotes a long early chapter to the history of exploration and discovery from
Schliemann	PERSON	down to the present .

		Workers of many nationalities have been engaged in the fascinating pursuit , the most famous being
Arthur Evans	PERSON	, of
England	LOCATION	.

		Americans are justly proud of the work done by
Harriet Boyd	PERSON	-LRB- -
Hawes	PERSON	-RRB- , whose excavations at
Gournia	LOCATION	were of high character .

		A number of Greeks have been industrious , and have made valuable con - tribution .

		In following chapters , there is presented a detailed study of the archaeo - logical material unearthed , stone , metal , pottery , towns , houses , palaces , fortresses , tem - ples , tombs , decoration , painting , sculpture , hieroglyphic system , weights and measures , costume , armor , weapons , tools , ships , and domestic animals , being among the more im - portant topics considered .

		We can here make but a few comments upon this material .

		In - teresting and characteristic are stone vessels of the
E.M.	LOCATION	and
E.G.	ORGANIZATION	cultures .

		Vases and lidded boxes are among the forms ; graves of
E. M. III	ORGANIZATION	.

		age at Mochlos '' yielded innumera - ble small vases of multicolored stone , steatite , marble , and breccia , wrought with the utmost skill , and using the actual veins of the stone to form a coherent pattern . ''

		Beautiful metal work was done in gold , silver , and bronze .

		While the famous gold cups from
Vaphio	LOCATION	per - haps still remain the masterpieces of the ^ Egean goldsmith 's art , lovely specimens found at other localities come as close seconds .

		They are wonderfully attractive in their grace and beauty of form , and in the boldness and delicacy of tjeir repousse ornamentation .

		In all the art work of this culture , the student constantly comes upon charming examples of the law of copy and this often in strangely unexpected ways .

		Thus , the potter of the M. M. imitated metal vases in form , and stone vessels both in form and color `` the varie - gated hues of the stone vases were imitated and polychromy first appeared in the JEgean ceramic . ''

		Another interesting , and unex - pected , exemplification of the law of copy is to be seen in steatite vessels upon the surface of which the repousse decoration of gold vases is imitated .

		In the decoration of metal work , splendid raised designs represent groups of men and animals in action , and throw a flood of light upon the life of the time .

		In pottery , the culture finds remarkable expression : the art can be traced in its whole development , step by step ; form , decoration , color handling , polychromy , show the working out of an exu - berant fancy .

		The representation of sea ani - mals in color design is remarkable : '' the accu - rate observation of the artist shews itself in the splendid impressions of octopods , squids and nautili , tritons , anemones , seapens and shells , amid jagged rocks from which seaweed waves , which cover the best vases of this age . ''

		Where such mastery was gained in the appli - cation of color designs to the surfaces of vessels , there is no reason for surprise that mural decoration flourished .

		No subject , however , in JEgean archaeology surpasses the written system in interest .

		This was discovered and investigated by Mr.
Evans	PERSON	.

		It presents itself as cut on seal-stones and scratched or pressed on clay tablets .

		Two periods in the development of the script are recognized .

		The earlier , pictographic char - acters , on seal-stones , may date back to 3000 B. c. ; the latest script is from about
1200	DATE	B. c. Sir
Arthur Evans	PERSON	connects the Cretan - ^ Egeau script with the Cypriote syllabary , and sug - gests that the Phoenician alphabet -LRB- with its Greek and Latin descendants -RRB- owes its origin to the Cretan script .

		While the characters have been identified and their evolution has been traced , their decipherment has not been accomplished .

		The numeral signs have been worked out , but we do not even know whether the syllabic characters represent the sounds of an Aryan or a non - Aryan language .

		It must be evident from what we have said that the matter of Mr.
Hall	PERSON	's book is of ex - traordinary interest ; unfortunately his pre - sentation of it is dry and heavy .

		The book is amply and beautifully illustrated .

		In closing his work , the author presents a brief summary of conclusions .

		Crete was the centre of ^ Egean culture , and its whole history is to be traced there .

		To a remarkable degree it underwent an independent and individual development .

		From
Crete	LOCATION	, it passed into
Greece	LOCATION	, gaining a foothold in the
Peloponnese	LOCATION	and spreading out from there as a new centre .

		Crete itself prob - ably received population and the beginnings of its art from
Africa	LOCATION	the Nile valley , and always remained to some degree in touch with
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		`` The ^ gean culture was a maritime one , the civilization of a sailor - people of the islands , and its progress was rendered possible only by the sea .

		By the sea it lived , and when a stronger people com - ing from the North , and bringing with it the use of iron , dispossessed the J3geans of the exclusive control of the seaways their power collapsed , and with it the great civilization of which we have described the remains . ''

		60 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	AN AMERICAN DKAMA OF THE ISTH CENTURY .

		* `` Ponteaeh , or The Savages of
America	LOCATION	, '' often described as the first tragedy written by an American on an American subject , has hitherto been available only in the original
London	LOCATION	edition of
1766	DATE	, of which but five copies are known to be in existence .

		By re - printing the play with an introduction , a bib - liography , and an elaborate biography of the author , the
Caxton Club of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	has ren - dered a service to students of American litera - ture , even though the chief interest of the editor , Mr.
Allan Nevins	PERSON	, is evidently in his - torical rather than in literary questions .

		The attractive appearance of the volume is highly creditable to its sponsors .

		Colonel
Robert Rogers	PERSON	, the author of the play , was born in
Methuen	LOCATION	on the
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts frontier in
1731	DATE	.

		As a mere boy he saw service in Indian conflicts , and while still a young man became a noted leader of rangers in the French and Indian wars .

		In
1760	DATE	he was appointed to receive the submission of the French posts on the
Great Lakes	ORGANIZATION	, and it was on his journey westward for this purpose that he first met Chief Pontiac .

		His fame by this time was such that the next year he was hastily summoned , only six days after his mar - riage , to take part in the campaign against the Cherokees in the
Carolinas	LOCATION	.

		Two years later , on the re-opening of hostilities in the North , he fought against
Pontiac	LOCATION	at
Detroit	LOCATION	.

		In
1765	DATE	he went to
England	LOCATION	, where his two prose .

		works , the Journals and the '' Concise Account of
North America	LOCATION	, '' were published . ''

		Ponteach '' followed early in
1766	DATE	.

		He re - turned to
America	LOCATION	as governor of
Mackinac	LOCATION	, and in the administration of this post became engaged in controversies with Sir
William Johnson	PERSON	.

		Later he went to
England	LOCATION	to plead his cause , possibly served a few months in
Algiers	LOCATION	, and returned to
America	LOCATION	to take a slight part , on the British side , in the
Revolu	LOCATION	- tion .

		The later years of his life were spent obscurely as a half-pay colonel in
London	LOCATION	, where he died in
1795	DATE	.

		The private character of this picturesque soldier is of little concern to the student of his tragedy ; yet the casual reader of Mr.
Nevins	PERSON	's portrayal may be tempted to protest against what seems a tendency to use the blackest possible colors .

		The biographer 's habitual treatment of motives may be seen from the following quotations chosen almost at random : '' In the
Browne	PERSON	home ,
Rogers	PERSON	met and fell in love with the youngest daugh - * PONTEACH , OB THE SAVAGES OF

		ter ,
Elizabeth	PERSON	, a beautiful girl of nineteen , and into this domestic circle he determined to push himself .

		Apart from all reasons of sen - timent , he could have taken no step more advantageous '' -LRB- p. 74 -RRB- ; `` Certificates of his usefulness and bravery he secured from al - most every considerable American leader during the Seven Years War ,
Amherst	LOCATION	,
Abercrombie	ORGANIZATION	,
Howe	PERSON	,
Moncton	LOCATION	,

Eglinton	LOCATION	, and others ; some of them , delivered with an alacrity strongly suggestive of jealousy of
Gage	PERSON	and
Johnson	PERSON	, added warm personal recommendations to the more per - functory testimonials '' -LRB- pp. 147-8 -RRB- .

		That the dashing young ranger who had fallen in love with a beautiful girl married her only to push himself into the family of a
Portsmouth	LOCATION	clergyman , or that the most distinguished generals in
America	LOCATION	were guilty of praising
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	only to warm a grudge against some one else seem gratuitous assumptions .

		There is no doubt that
Rogers	PERSON	had , probably in high degree , the improvidence and the personal vices often developed by the frontiersman and the soldier .

		But it is difficult to see how a man completely sunk in dissipation could have attained the self-culture which
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	shows ; or how so despicable a character as Mr.
Nevins	PERSON	pictures could have held for years the respect and friendship of Indians , traders , army officers , and leaders of the British gov - ernment .

		The authorship of `` Ponteach '' has at times seemed open to some doubt , partly be - cause the Indians are portrayed in a way hardly to be expected of a frontier fighter ; partly , perhaps , because the copy most readily accessible to scholars , that in the British Museum , contains an early manuscript entry ascribing it to '' Richd .

		Rogers . ''

		All such doubts , so far as they concern the main re - sponsibility for the work , Mr.
Nevins	PERSON	seems effectively to have set at rest .

		He points out that the estimate of Indian character in the appendix to the '' Concise Account '' is essen - tially that which pervades the play .

		He also quotes from a writer in '' The Critical Review '' who in discussing the '' Concise Account '' said : '' The picture exhibited of the
Emperor Pontiac	LOCATION	is novel and interesting , and would appear to vast advantage in the hands of a great dramatic genius . ''

		It was some four months after this hint that `` Ponteach '' was issued by
John Millan	PERSON	, who had published
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	's other works ; and although its au - thorship was never acknowledged , it was almost universally ascribed by the
London	LOCATION	critics to
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	.

		As a work of literary art '' Ponteach '' is negligible .

		As Mr.
Nevins	PERSON	remarks , it is un -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 61 likely that
Rogers	PERSON	had attended a stage per - formance before he reached
London	LOCATION	, and he had probably read few plays .

		The plot as distinguished from the setting is weak and conventional .

		The form is a rude blank verse , with occasional rhymed passages .

		An amusing indication of the author 's provincial pronunciation is perhaps found in what looks like an attempt to rhyme '' home '' and '' gun '' -LRB- Act .

		I. Sc .

		II . -RRB-

		.

		The diction is often collo - quial to an extent that was more troublesome to the
London	LOCATION	critics of
1766	DATE	than it is to us .

		Yet different passages of the play , in par - ticular , different Indian speeches , vary so much in tone as to suggest the possibility of a double authorship .

		The first act is the rough - est and most direct .

		In Act I. , Sc .

		III .

		occurs the following dialogue between
Ponteach	PERSON	and the English Commander : ''
Ponteach	PERSON	.

		Well , Mr.
Colonel Cockum	PERSON	, what d' they call you ?

		You give no Answer yet to my Complaint ; Your Men give my Men always too much Rum , Then trade and cheat 'em .

		What !

		d'ye think this right ? ''

		Cockum .

		Tush !

		Silence !

		hold your noisy cursed Nonsense ; I 've heard enough of it ; what is it to me ?

		`` Ponteach .

		What !

		you a Colonel , and not command your Men ?

		Let ev'ry one be a Rogue that has a Mind to ` t. '' Cockum .

		Why , curse your Men , I suppose they wanted Rum ; They 'll rarely be content , I know , without it . ''

		Ponteach .

		What then ?

		If Indians are such Fools , I think White Men like you should stop and teach them better .

		`` Cockum .

		You may be d d , and all your Frenchmen too .

		`` Ponteach .

		Bed d !

		what 's that ?

		I do not understand . ''

		In contrast to this is the absurd discourse of the Indian maiden to her lover in Act III. , Sc .

		I. : '' The Earth itself is sometimes known to shake , And the bright Sun by Clouds is oft conceal 'd , And gloomy Night succeeds the Smiles of Day So Beauty oft by foulest Faults is veil 'd , And after one short Blaze admir 'd no more , Loses its Lustre , drops its sparkling Charms , The Lover sickens , and his Passion dies .

		Nay worse , he hates what he so doted on .

		Time only proves the
Truth of Worth	ORGANIZATION	and Love , The one may be a cheat , the other change , And Fears , and Jealousies , and mortal Hate , Succeed the Sunshine of the warmest Passion . ''

		A speech like that just quoted may have been composed with the aid of some hack writer , or , as Mr.
Nevins	PERSON	suggests , of
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	's secretary ,
Nathaniel Potter	PERSON	; but the pictures of fron - tier life and the portrayal of Indian character are clearly
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	's own .

		There is room for a study of the treatment of the Indian in literature which shall con - sider how far the interpretation of aboriginal character has been determined by the tem - perament and the social philosophy of indi - vidual writers .

		In the preparation of such a study '' Ponteach '' will be a valuable docu - ment .

		From the earliest times there have been two extreme opinions that the `` noble red man '' was in his native state possessed of every essential virtue , and that '' the only good Indian is a dead Indian . ''

		Neither of these views has been confined either to the frontiersmen who knew the Indian intimately , or to the city-dwelling disciples of
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		Colonel
Rogers	PERSON	was a man whose life from early boyhood had been spent in fighting Indians , yet who felt that they were essen - tially noble , and that they had been the vic - tims of cruelty and fraud .

		In his play the French priest is licentious , the British traders are cheats , the hunters are murderers , the military officers Cockum and Frisk are super - cilious and insulting , and the governors , Sharp ,
Gripe	LOCATION	, and
Catchum	PERSON	, are all that their names imply .

		Of the Indians ,
Philip	PERSON	is a villain ; but the others , though showing hu - man weaknesses , command our sympathy , and
Ponteach	ORGANIZATION	is really noble .

		Rogers undoubtedly believed that the French plan of mingling on terms of equality with the Indians was better than the English show of authority and supe - riority , but he wrote in no sense as a propa - gandist .

		He seems to have interpreted the Indians in the light of his own temperament ; and if he did , his work is a commentary both on the Indian character and on his own .

		As Colonel
Rogers	PERSON	was far more important as ranger and frontiersman than as author , it would be unfair to blame Mr.
Nevins	PERSON	for mak - ing his biographical sketch an historical rather than a literary monograph .

		Yet it may be pointed out that he has not traced so far as he might parallelisms between the play and
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	's prose works ; and that he has left for later students the tasks of searching for the models that the author used in preparing his plot , and of comparing his treatment of the Indians with that of other English writers of the hour .

		Anyone who is but slightly famil - iar with English magazines in the decade in which '' Ponteach '' appeared has noticed how much space is given to American matters , including those which concerned the Indians .

		The fact that '' Ponteach '' itself seemed worth the attention if not the approbation of Lon - doners is shown in the fact that '' The Gentle - 62 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	man 's Magazine '' for
February , 1766	DATE	, places it first in the list of '' Books Published , '' and gives it as much space as is given to the other twenty-one titles of the month combined .

		THE NEW SPIRIT IN AMERICAN POLITICS .

		* To the many extant interpretations of pro- gressivism in contemporary American politics President
Wilson	PERSON	's '' The New Freedom , '' Mr.
Weyl	PERSON	's '' The New Democracy , '' and Mr.
Croly	PERSON	's '' Progressive Democracy , '' to men - tion but three has lately been added Mr.
Benjamin P. De Witt	PERSON	's '' The Progressive Movement . ''

		Mr.
De Witt	PERSON	writes sympa - thetically , but \ \ dth a due measure of re - straint ; and he fixes the scope of his subject broadly and sanely .

		He very truly says that so much attention has been given to the rise and development of the Progressive party in the
United States	LOCATION	that there has been a ten - dency to overlook the larger and more funda - mental movement of which it is a part a movement which had struck its roots far back in the past and had assumed formidable pro- portions before the campaign of
1912	DATE	began . ''

		The progressive movement is broader than the Progressive party and , in fact , than any single party .

		It is the embodiment and expression of fundamental measures and principles of reform that have been advocated for many years by all political parties .

		Although differences in name , in the specific reforms advocated , and in the emphasis placed upon them , have obscured the identity of the movement , the underlying purposes and ideals of the progressive elements of all parties for the
past quarter	DATE	of a century have been essentially the same .

		To make clear this uni - versal character of the progressive movement is one of the objects for which this book has been written . ''

		The common substratum of progressivism in all political parties is declared by Mr.
De Witt	PERSON	to consist in three main tendencies : -LRB- 1 -RRB- insistence by the better element that special , minority , and corrupt influence in government national , state , and city be removed ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the demand that the structure or machinery of government , which hitherto has been admirably adapted to control of the few , be so modified that it will be more diffi - cult for the few , and easier for the many , to control ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the rapidly growing convic - tion that the functions of government at pres - ent are too restricted and that they must be increased and extended to relieve social and .

		economic distress .

		These three tendencies , with varying emphasis , are seen to-day in the platform and programme of every political party ; they are manifested in the political changes and reforms that are advocated and made in the nation , the states , and the cities ; and , because of their universality and defi - niteness , they may be said .

		to constitute the real progressive movement .

		Mr.
De Witt	PERSON	's method is both historical and analytical .

		Following a chapter devoted to the meaning and general aspects of the history of the progressive movement , he writes at some length of the movement in each of the five principal parties of the pres - ent day , that is , the Democratic , the
Kepub	PERSON	- lican , the Progressive , the Socialist , and the Prohibitionist .

		Thereupon he turns to the development and the achievements of pro- gressivism in the nation , in the states , and in the municipalities .

		It is these later portions of the book that are most valuable .

		The earlier chapters comprise only rapid sketches of recent and familiar party history .

		The later ones , however , summarize in a helpful manner recent triumphs of progressive prin - ciples and characterize pending problems in - volving the application of progressive ideas .

		We are told that the progressive movement is not so far advanced in the nation as it is in the states , and that therefore so far as the nation is concerned emphasis must be placed primarily upon the preliminary steps of gov - ernment and corporation control , while in the states these matters are becoming more and more incidental to the extension of the func - tions of government to afford social , economic , and industrial relief .

		In the city , while the broader phases of the movement are the same as in the states , there are some differences of emphasis .

		In the first place , the city must be made free from the domination of the state legislature must , in other words , have municipal home rule .

		In the second place , the city must adopt that form of charter that will afford to its voters the largest oppor - tunity for direct and effective participation in municipal affairs .

		Furthermore , the gov - ernment of the city must be put upon a business basis , with much stress upon efficient and economical organization and methods .

		Finally , the functions of city government must be extended to promote the welfare and comfort of the inhabitants so far as is com - patible with free government and democratic institutions .

		The municipal programme out - lined in the closing chapters is attractive , and considerable portions of it are being carried into execution to-day in many cities .

		1915 THE DIAL 63 RECENT FICTION .

		* Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	has the lecture habit in an aggravated form , and it is seriously impair - ing his function as a novelist in any artistic ense .

		Probably he will not be much stirred by this criticism , for when a man thinks that lie sees a gigantic evil , and feels that he has .

		a mission to expose and overthrow it , he is apt to be somewhat reckless of the means employed .

		If he happens to be a popular novelist , he will unhesitatingly jettison the equipment which makes for lasting literary .

		achievement , and ram the object of his attack at the risk of sinking his own craft .

		Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	clearly believes that he has such a mission , and employs all his persuasiveness to impress his readers with its importance .

		In '' The Inside of the Cup , '' his attack was upon the hypocrisy which makes of religion a crust without substance ; in `` A Far Coun - try , '' his artillery is aimed at the methods of '' `` big business '' in the modern American world .

		We do not say that he has lost all sense of the artistic demands made upon him as a novelist , but he has distinctly subordi - nated them to the purpose of preaching an effective sermon .

		Of his earnestness there can be no doubt , and he does not scold his fellow-men for their lack of vision in the monotonous manner of Mr.
H. G. `` Wells	PERSON	, but he makes himself wearisome by excess of argument , and he distorts the facts of life by excess of emphasis .

		There are , heaven knows , evils enough in the business world of to-day , and the moralist , even if he be a writer of fiction , is justified in making them his target , but the rapier of indirection and suggestion is far more likely to reach their vitals than the bludgeon , the sling and the '' five smooth stones '' than the `` weaver 's beam . ''

		Briefly , '' `` A Far Country '' is the autobiography of
Hugh Paret	PERSON	, son of a lawyer of the old school of high ethical standards , and himself a law - yer of the new school which promotes cor - porations , grabs franchises , and corrupts courts and legislatures .

		He believes in the new business gospel of efficiency , and is per - suaded that the small group of financiers to which he belongs is the group best fitted for leadership and for mastery of the political and industrial life of the nation .

		temporary history will no doubt supply chap - ter and verse for every one of the nefarious activities whereby Paret acquires wealth and commanding influence , but the men of his type illustrate only one aspect albeit a sin - ister one of the American business life of to-day .

		It is well that this aspect of life should be exposed in all its vicious ugliness , but it is not well that these methods should be presented as universally prevailing .

		The pointing of Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's moral is a con - tinuous process .

		Even in
Paret	LOCATION	's most suc - cessful hours , he has stirrings of a better nature that make him uncomfortable , and in the end , through the influence of the radical agitator
Krebs	PERSON	, who has antagonized him throughout his career , he experiences a revul - sion of feeling in which the bitter truth is brought home to him that his success has been but as dust and ashes in the mouth .

		He real - izes the meaning of the old text about the futility of gaining the whole world if a man thereby loses his own soul , and tardily sets about the recovery of his soul before it is lost forever .

		Two women are intimately asso - ciated with his fortunes the one whom he marries only to become estranged from her , and the one for whom he entertains a guilty passion without being dragged beyond the verge of the precipice .

		The necessity for renunciation , caused by this woman 's native strength of character , becomes the instru - ment of his conversion , and turns his groping steps backward from the `` far country '' in which his manhood life has been spent , bring - ing him once more within sight of a region of simpler and saner ideals .

		This study of an erring soul , perplexed in the extreme by the amazing discovery that worldly success does not bring spiritual satisfaction , makes a strong appeal to our sympathies , despite its many desert tracts of self-analysis , despite the encumbrance of a mass of insignificant detail , and despite the handicap of a literary style that rarely has the note of distinction , and has stodginess for its chief characteristic .

		The type of whimsical humor w r hich makes an intellectual appeal is the salient character - istic of Mr.
Locke	PERSON	's later work , and is once more exemplified in `` Jaffery . ''

		It enables him to invest an exotic character with human interest , and to lend probability to a situation which the logical mind would be forced to reject as beyond the pale of possibility .

		Both these audacious feats are here accomplished , the one in the case of the Albanian heroine Liosha , and the other in the success -LRB- for a time -RRB- of
Jaffery	PERSON	's device for sparing the feel - ings of the woman he adores by covering up 64 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	the fraudulent literary career of her deceased husband .


Adrian Boldero	PERSON	finds among the possessions of a dead comrade the manuscript of a complete novel .

		This he publishes under his own name , thereby gaining both fame and wealth .

		He also gains
Doria	PERSON	, who marries him , worships him as a genius , and envelopes him in an atmosphere of incense .

		He prom - ises his publishers a second novel , but is utterly incapable of writing it , and wears his life out -LRB- aided by many potations -RRB- in the effort to perform his impossible task .

		His widow believes that he has finished this sec - ond work , and it lies with
Jaffery	PERSON	to safe - guard her delusion .

		Thereupon he writes the novel himself , gives it to the publishers as
Boldero	PERSON	's work , and it repeats the success of the first production .

		It is true that the pub - lic is puzzled by the new theme and the new style , but no doubt is cast upon the authen - ticity of the authorship .

		Such a thing is , of course , frankly impossible , for
Jaffery	ORGANIZATION	is a burly , explosive , Rabelaisian person , having not a single intellectual trait in common with
Boldero	PERSON	, but Mr.
Locke	PERSON	almost makes the reader accept it .

		Of course
Doria	PERSON	has to dis - cover the double imposition , and her clay idol has to come down from his pedestal .

		Mean - while ,
Jaffery	PERSON	discovers that his true mate is Liosha , and that his love for
Doria	PERSON	has been a delusion .

		Doria deserves nothing better than this , for she is a very silly , selfish , and parasitical young woman , and one feels like shaking
Jaffery	PERSON	for his dog-like attendance upon her footsteps .

		As for Liosha , she is indescribable at any less length than the novel itself .

		Born of Albanian parents in the
Chicago	LOCATION	stock yards , her later years of life among her ancestral mountains have not obliterated the
Chicago	LOCATION	idiom from her speech .

		When
Jaffery	PERSON	, who is a war corre - spondent in the
Balkans	LOCATION	, comes into her life , she is the wife -LRB- and soon thereafter the widow -RRB- of one of his fellow - journalists .

		She is left in
Jaffery	LOCATION	's charge , and he brings her to
England	LOCATION	.

		The people who attempt to civi - lize her she characterizes as '' damn fools , '' she is disposed to stick a knife into any one who crosses her will , and her manners are , to say the least , primitive .

		These traits , added to her Amazonian frame , make her a terror in more senses than one , and we are led to regard her as a comic diversion rather than as a serious heroine of romance .

		But Mr.
Locke	PERSON	has made up his mind that we shall take her seriously , and in the end almost makes us accept her as the life companion predestined for
Jaffery	ORGANIZATION	.

Doria	PERSON	and
Liosha	PERSON	are set forth may be seen in the following quotation : '' He imag - ined himself to be in love with a moonbeam .

		And the moonbeam shot like a glamorous , enchanted sword between him and Liosha , and kept them apart until the moment of dazed revelation , when he saw that the moon - beam was merely a pale , earnest , anxious , suffering little human thing , alien to his every instinct , a firmament away , in every vital essential , from the goddess of his idola - try . ''

		It will be seen from the preceding remarks that `` Jaffery '' is to be read with an undercurrent of subconscious protest against the tricks of the author 's invention ; but for all that , J ; he story is no less capti - vating than its predecessors , and we would not for anything have missed our acquain - tance with either
Jaffery	PERSON	or his Albanian charge .

		The six hundred pages of '' Empty Pock - ets , '' by Mr.
Rupert Hughes	PERSON	, may be recom - mended as providing ideal entertainment for the vacation leisure of any reader who wishes to avoid the strenuous , yet who demands tense and sustained interest of his fiction .

		Something is happening all the time in these pages , and their manifold incidents are woven into a fabric of close texture which never allows the pattern of the plot to escape the eye .

		There is also much lively humor of the journalistic sort which works its effects by unanticipated similitudes and quaint tricks of expression .

		The story is concerned with a murder mystery , and the first fifty pages supply the stage-setting and the climax .

		Then the author steps a year backward , and proceeds to pick up the threads of the com - plication , and to show us exactly how it came about that the body of
Perry Merrithew	PERSON	,
New York	LOCATION	clubman and rake , was found one morning in the
summer of 1914	DATE	, upon the roof of a tenement building in the slums of the
East Side	LOCATION	, his skull fractured , and his fists tightly clenching the strands of copper - colored hair which some woman had cut away for the purpose of freeing herself .

		After some five hundred pages of narration , we are brought to the point at which the story began , and thence proceed swiftly to the close , to learn that Merrithew had really died of apoplexy at the very moment of an attempted outrage upon the woman , and that she had been guilty of no other crime than self - defence against his attack .

		This is a com - forting revelation , for the heroine , the daugh - ter of one of
New York	LOCATION	's wealthiest families , is a very charming girl , and her indiscretions are really of the most innocent and warm - hearted description .

		During the narrative , four or five other red-haired girls are drawn
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 65 across the trail , and we are kept until near the end from getting on the right scent .

		When we learn that it was really
Muriel	PERSON	who was Merrithew 's companion on that midnight excursion into the slums , we receive a severe shock , for it is not until after that revelation that we are led to abandon the pre-conceived theory of murder for the explanation that rehabilitates the heroine and shows
Merri	PERSON	- thew to have got no more than his deserts .

		Two aspects of metropolitan life alternate in claiming our interest .

		There is the pleasure - seeking aspect of the dinner-dance and the amusement resort , and there is the grim and sordid aspect of the underworld of poverty and vice and crime .

		Perhaps the most excit - ing episode is the kidnapping of Muriel by a gang of bandits , and the breathless taxicab race from the Bowery to the
Bronx	LOCATION	in which she is finally rescued by the pursuers .

		It all seems to have been transferred bodily from a film-melodrama to the pages of a book .

		Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	is minutely realistic in both descrip - tion and dialogue , and his East Side types , in particular , are done to the life .

		We must hasten to add , however , that his characteriza - tions are purely external ; of character - portrayal in the deeper sense , he does not give us a single instance , and his figures are no more life-like than the marionettes in a puppet-booth .

		He manifests , moreover , a cynical temper that is anything but whole - some , and his efforts to swing the satirical lash over the back of society are amusingly ineffective .

		But he has told a good story , in spite of its over-sophistication , and its read - ers will regret that it is too long to be read at a single stretch .

		A Catholic home for aged paupers provides the setting for
Miss Florence Olmstead	ORGANIZATION	's `` A Cloistered Romance . ''

		It is situated , we fancy , somewhere in rural
New England	LOCATION	, al - though that is a detail which does not greatly matter .

		The mother superior and the sisters are mostly of French extraction .

		One day the community mule Goliath , driven by one
Samuel	PERSON	, who earns his keep by the perform - ance of such services for the sisterhood , gets out of hand , greatly to the peril of the sisters who occupy the wagon .

		At this critical mo - ment , a young man , who happens to be a popular novelist strolling along the country - side , springs to the rescue , and checks Goliath in his mad career , but is himself run over by the wagon and seriously injured .

		He is thereupon taken into the home , and given the attention his case requires .

		Now it so hap - pens that Miss
Alethea Lawrence	PERSON	, a young woman of wealth and social standing , is a frequent visitor to the home , and its benefac - tress in many small ways , reading to the in - valids , and bringing them delicate things to eat .

		She is a very charming young woman , and when
David Paget	PERSON	becomes the subject of her ministrations , he decides to play the game , and allow her to believe him as the others , a penniless dependant upon the sisters ' charity .

		Thus begins the '' cloistered romance '' of Miss
Olmstead	PERSON	's devising .

		How it ends is another matter , and one not difficult to imagine .

		David lingers in the home rather longer than is strictly necessary for his phy - sical needs , and when he takes a reluctant departure , reveals himself in his true colors by bestowing upon the institution a generous cheque for the building of the much-needed addition .

		The narrative is one of '' humors '' rather than of plot , and includes several char - acters who are an unfailing source of delight the bibulous and philosophical
Samuel	PERSON	, the grouchy Mr.
Shultz	PERSON	, the suspicious and gos - sipping
Mary Giffin	PERSON	with her passion for chocolate crackers , the austere but very hu - man mother superior who will do anything for the sake of her pet cat Hafiz , and the efficient and sympathetic Sister
Gertrude	PERSON	.

		Even Goliath provides a character-study of deep mulish interest .

		Aside from the artifice of the main complication , the story has all the naturalness of a transcript from real daily life , and the by-play of dialogue is inimitable .

		A brief example , with
Mary Giffin	PERSON	in the foreground , may be given : '' ' I had my day , Mr.
Paget	PERSON	/ she said proudly , ' an ' she ai n't nothin ' to the handsomeness of me . ' '

		I guess you must have been good-looking ,
Mary	PERSON	, ' he admitted . '

		I was a corker ! '

		said
Mary	PERSON	.

		` And think o ' me takin ' up with
John Giffin	PERSON	, an ' him dyin ' without so much as a nickel 's worth of insurance !

		I could er had
Meggs	PERSON	's father , an ' that would er meant an interest in the store . ' '

		Is that all you think about ,
Mary	PERSON	? ' '

		It comes to that sooner or later , ' said
Mary	PERSON	, ' an ' the sooner the better .

		If I 'd a-thought about featherin ' my nest , like some , I would n't be settin ' in a Catholic home to-day .

		My people was hard - shell
Baptis	PERSON	' long before anybody ever heard about Catholics . ' '

		You need n't to look for no partic ` lar luck in makin ' wealthy connections .

		It do n't come to the poor , ' she added by way of warning . ''

		This novel seems to be rather dull at the out - set , but its insinuating charm gains upon the reader , and holds his interest more deeply with every added chapter .

		The freshness of its thematic material , and the knowledge of human nature which it displays at every point , added to its genuine humor , show us once more how the most commonplace of sub - jects may supply the artist with all that he 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	- needs in the way of objective stimulus .

		The creative instinct will do the rest , as it notably does in the present instance . ''

		Along came
Ruth	PERSON	, '' and her appearance in the town of
Freeport	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Illinois	LOCATION	? -RRB-

		had the effect qf a moral bombshell ,
Ruth	PERSON	had been a
Freeport	ORGANIZATION	girl some ten years earlier , and had scandalized the community by running away with a married man , whose wife inconsid - erately refused to divorce him for
Ruth	PERSON	's benefit .

		She returns because of her father 's mortal illness , and her family and former associates make things very uncomfortable for her .

		This is the story of Miss
Susan Glaspell	PERSON	's `` Fidelity , '' a title which expresses
Ruth	PERSON	's persistent belief that she has done nothing essentially wrong , and that all the people who refuse to take her back on the old terms are unfeeling pharisees .

		This is the plain unsophisticated statement of the moral situation presented by the novel .

		As
Miss Glaspell	PERSON	puts it ,
Ruth	PERSON	is a noble creature , deeply misunderstood , and a victim of pro- vincial cant and hypocrisy .

		By every device of indirection and insinuation , this view is thrust upon us , and the woman 's sin is glossed over .

		It seems to us a very unwhole - some story , and it is an amazingly dull one , made so by its interminable passages of analysis and introspection .

		We are spared nothing of what goes on in the minds of all these commonplace people , and chapter after chapter is spun out of their uninteresting reflections and mutual reactions .

		When
Ruth	PERSON	returns to her paramour , she finds that his love has grown cold , and when the news comes of the divorce tardily consented to by the wronged wife , she rejects his offer to legalize her status , and deserts him to shape a new life for herself .

		So confused a study of moral values is not often met with , even in these days of `` advanced '' thought and chatter about '' the rights of the soul . ''

		Our only war novel for this month is a crude and amateurish performance styled ''
L. P. M.	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
J. Stewart Barney	PERSON	.

		This enigmatic title turns out to stand for '' Little Peace Maker , '' which is the invention of a philanthropic American millionaire .

		This person , whose name is
Edestone	LOCATION	, has discov - ered how to free objects from the force of gravity , leaving mass and momentum un - affected .

		This is accomplished by means of a '' deionizer , '' and an airship is constructed with six-foot steel plates and the dimensions of an ocean liner .

		Being impervious to at - tack , this monster can hover close to the earth , and rain destruction upon cities and fleets .

		Its effectiveness is such that it soon brings the warring powers to terms , and a world agreement for perpetual peace is made in consequence .

		The chief scenes are in Ber - lin , where the inventor '' cheeks '' the German Emperor to his heart 's content , and thwarts , the efforts of the enraged General Staff to - compass his destruction and capture his air - ship .

		The science of the story is childishly unconvincing , and its language bears no rela - tion to that of real life .

		A most disgusting - injection of American slang into the closing chapters makes them even more intolerable than their predecessors .

		This book is dis - tinctly an example of how not to do the sort , of thing that Mr.
Wells	PERSON	does so effectively .

H. K. Fly Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		As the work of a brother of the author of ''

		The latter becomes a voluntary assistant to a young Episcopalian clergyman and his bride , who take a small parish and carry on their work under circumstances which but for

		This airship depends for its flight upon what may be termed '' negative gravity , '' a screen of radium shutting off the attraction toward the earth 's surface , whereupon it rises by centrifugal motion .

		This is not only unsatisfactory as physics , but the same idea , minus the radium , was used in a magazine story not many years ago .

		The book is highly sensational , and is not likely to help us solve our difficulties with

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The European war has brought A Belgian s prophecy of into general notice certain neg - mr - lected books which now appear in the light of subsequent events to have been singularly clairvoyant .

		The late Professor
Cramb	PERSON	's eloquent lectures afford the best - known example .

		But for defmiteness of forecast no other work equals Dr.
Charles Sarolea	PERSON	's `` The Anglo-German Problem '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- .

		We have here to do not merely with intelligent anticipation , but with almost un - canny prophecy .

		Published in
1912	DATE	to warn
England	LOCATION	of the menace from
Germany	LOCATION	, the book fell flat and was even contemptuously dismissed by leading English newspapers as alarmist and sensational .

		The following sen - tences , scattered through the book , now seem more like portents than scare mongerings : ''
Europe	LOCATION	is drifting slowly but steadily towards an awful catastrophe which , if it does happen , will throw back civilization for the coming generation . '' ''

		It is true that in theory the neutrality of
Belgium	LOCATION	is guaranteed by international treaties ; but when I observe the signs of the times , the ambitions of the German rulers , and when I con - sider such indications as the recent extension of strategic railways on the Belgian-German frontiers , I do not look forward with any feeling of se - curity to future contingencies in the event of a European war . ''

		`` And not only is German Socialism not as strong , neither is it as pacifist as is generally sup - posed ... Many things in
Germany	LOCATION	are national which elsewhere are universal .

		And in
Germany	LOCATION	Socialism is becoming national , as German po - litical economy is national , as German science is national , as German religion is national . '' ''

		German contemporary history illustrates once more a general law of history , that the dread of a civil war is often a direct cause of a foreign war r and that the ruling classes are driven to seek out - side a diversion from internal difficulties . '' ''

		Very few observers have pointed out one special reason why the personal methods of the
Kaiser	PERSON	will prove in the end dangerous to peace namely , that they have tended to paralyze or destroy the methods of diplomacy . '' ''

		In vain does the
Kaiser	PERSON	assure us of his pacific intentions : a ruler can not with impunity glorify for ever the wars of the past , spend most of the resources of his people on the prepara - tions for the wars of the future , encourage the warlike spirit , make the duel compulsory on officers and the Mensur honorable to students , place his chief trust in his Junkers , who live and move and have their being in the game of war , foster the aggressive spirit in the nation , and hold out am - bitions which can be fulfilled only by an appeal to arms . ''

		In view of the above passages , to which others of a like nature might be added , it is small 68 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	wonder that the book is now attracting - wide - spread attention .

		Apart from any adventi - tious interest , it deserves careful reading for its fairness , moderation , and political insight .

		Although Dr.
Sarolea	PERSON	is a Belgian , and was therefore in
1912	DATE	a disinterested neutral , his attitude was even then one of frank sympathy for
England	LOCATION	, because British rule `` is to-day the most just , the most moderate , the most tolerant , and the most adaptable , the most progressive , government of the modern world . ''

		Japanese an As an interpretation of `` The interpreted by Spirit of Japanese Art , ''
Yone Noguchi	PERSON	's little book in the ex - cellent `` Wisdom of the East Series '' -LRB- But - ton -RRB- would be more convincing were the author 's command of English adequate for the expression of his ideas with clearness and pre - cision .

		Professor
Noguchi	PERSON	is , however , a poet and a thinker ; and if , to the
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	mind , his verbal imagery is sometimes obscure , no great effort on the part of the reader is re - quired to penetrate the meaning of even such sentences as the following : `` As a certain critic remarked , the real beauty flies away like an angel whenever an intellect rushes in and begins to speak itself ; the intellect , if it has anything to do , certainly likes to show itself up too much , with no consideration for the general harmony that would soon be wounded by it . ''

		This is the way he looks upon the criticism of
Utamaro	PERSON	's works made in that artist 's day by those who '' saw the moral and the lesson but not the beauty and the picture . ''

		The ten short papers that make up the volume have for their themes the works of eight artists of the last three centuries , `` Ukiyoye Art in Original , '' and `` Western Art in
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		Their chief claim to consideration lies in their presentation of the views of an educated Japanese of the present day who is impressed by the inherent worth of the classic art of the
Far East	LOCATION	, and yet is able to perceive much intrinsic merit in the work of such artists as
Kyosai	LOCATION	and
Tsukioka Yoshitoshi	PERSON	.

		Such catholicity of taste savors somewhat of indiscriminate admiration .

		But Professor
Noguchi	PERSON	does not write as a critic ; indeed he exclaims , '' Criticism ?

		Why , that is the art for people imperfect in health , thin and tired . ''

		He aims instead to present the emotional sub - jectivity of which he asserts that to lose it '' against the canvas , or , I will say here in
Japan	LOCATION	, the silk , is the first and last thing . ''

		With some of his dicta it is impossible to agree , as when he claims that the greatest praise we can give to any works of art is that `` they never owed one thing to money or payment for their existence . ''

		A few misspellings of proper names , as '' Hopper '' instead of Hap - per , and '' Fenellosa '' for
Fenollosa	PERSON	, mar the pages ; and in saying that Katsukawa Shun - sho '' died in
1792	DATE	at the age of ninety-seven '' the author overstates that artist 's years by thirty-one .

		Against these slight blemishes he must be credited with having coined some de - lightfully felicitous phrases .

		.

		Of Kwaigetsudo Dohan he says '' he might be the cleverest '' of the Kwaigetsudo group , but '' his colour - harmony is marred by ostentatious impru - dence . ''

		And in the opening sentences of the Introduction we have these significant words : `` In the Ashikaga age -LRB- 1335-1573 -RRB- the best Japanese artists , like
Sesshu	PERSON	and his disciples , for instance , true revolutionists in art , not mere rebels , whose Japanese simplicity was strengthened and clarified by Chinese suggestion , were in the truest meaning of the word Buddhist priests , who sat before the inextinguishable lamp of faith , and sought their salvation by the road of silence ; their studios were in the Buddhist temple , east of the forests and west of the hills , dark without and luminous within with the symbols of all beauty of nature and heaven .

		And their artistic work was a sort of prayer-making , to satisfy their own imagination , .

		.

		they drew pictures to create abso - lute beauty and grandeur , that made their own human world look almost trifling , and directly joined themselves with eternity . ''

		It is not easy to see how this could be put more finely or more cogently .

Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- is modern drama .

		^ logical succeS sor of , though it does not supersede , Dr.
Archibald Hender	PERSON	- son 's '' The Changing Drama . ''

		Dr.
Lewisohn	PERSON	has paid less attention to the social , scientific , moral , and aesthetic causes underlying con - temporary drama , arid has shown us the change accomplished , so far as that is possi - ble , rather than the process .

		It is the drama as literature with which he is chiefly con - cerned .

		His first chapter , on '' The Founda - tions , '' begins with
Ibsen	PERSON	, and is a rapid historical and critical treatment of the Scan - dinavian and French movements , including mention of the Theatre Libre , the
Freie Biihne	PERSON	, and the Independent Theatre .

		The succeeding chapters are entitled '' The
Realis	PERSON	- tic Drama in
France	LOCATION	, '' '' The Naturalistic Drama in
Germany	LOCATION	, '' `` The Renaissance of the English Drama , '' and '' The Neo-Roman - tic Movement in the European Drama . ''

		At the end , for the convenience both of those who wish to make a serious study of drama and of those who wish merely to read profitably in a fascinating field , are a number of study lists , which group representative plays ac - cording to character -LRB- realism , etc. -RRB- , subject
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 69 matter -LRB- social justice , sex , etc. -RRB- , and struc - ture -LRB- unities -RRB- .

		The book concludes with a valuable critical bibliography .

		Dr.
Lewisohn	PERSON	writes from the fulness of exact knowledge that might be expected , has the rare faculty of knowing what to leave out , possesses a rapid and easy style , and has the poetic gift of communicating delicate critical apprecia - tions in the happy phrase .

		He covers the vast field -LRB- vast even without
Italy	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	, which the reader will miss -RRB- without a heavy or uninteresting page .

		His criticism is exacting without being unsympathetic .

		If the reader sometimes feels that full justice has not been rendered the individual drama - tist , he will probably detect the cause in the fact that Dr.
Lewisohn	PERSON	sees all drama against the background of
Hauptmann	PERSON	and natural - ism .

		A certain liability to injustice must in - here in a book that includes such opposites as German naturalism and Irish neo-roman - ticism .

		Surely we may like both
Hauptmann	PERSON	and
Synge	PERSON	; but we can hardly like , as well as he deserves , either one in the presence of the other .

		Yet no one could ask for greater judicial temper in a critic than Dr.
Lewisohn	PERSON	displays .

		Especial note should be taken of Dr.
Lewisohn	PERSON	's opinion that under present conditions it is more important for American universities to train audiences than to attempt the production of dramatists .

		The student and general reader could do nothing more profitable than to use this book and Dr.
Hen	PERSON	- derson 's in connection with the twenty repre - sentative plays reprinted in Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	's `` Chief Contemporary Dramatists . ''

		All of these books reflect the greatest credit upon American critical scholarship .

		-LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which comes out at this time in an English rendering by his compatriot , the Abbe
Ernest Dimnet	PERSON	, who also contributes a most acceptable biographi - cal introduction of nearly fifty pages , tracing the development of the tardily discovered military genius from his boyhood in southern
France	LOCATION	to his appointment as generalissimo of the French forces and his masterly han - dling of the difficult situation of
last August	DATE	and
September	DATE	.

		General
Joffre	PERSON	is now mid - way in his sixty-fourth year , and was already forty-one when , as major , he was sent to the Soudan to superintend the construction of the railway from
Kayes	LOCATION	to
Baf	ORGANIZATION	oulabe ; and it was in the course of this three years ' sojourn in
Africa	LOCATION	that he undertook the expedition de - scribed by him with military conciseness and published with the sanction of the
Minister for Colonial Affairs	ORGANIZATION	.

		The march from
Segou	LOCATION	to Timbuctoo and back , with subordinate ex - peditions about the latter place , all for the purpose of establishing French influence in that important though almost inaccessible region , occupied little more than six months ; and if the march was as rapid as some of
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	's in
Gaul	LOCATION	, the account of it is even more terse and direct than the famous '' Commentaries . ''

		The same unpretentious plainness and simplicity that charm the reader in
Grant	LOCATION	's soldierly chronicle are found here , though the French commander has little of fighting and nothing of complex military strategy to record .

		He had been asked to tell his story , and he told it with no waste of words .

		That it was worth the telling may be inferred if merely from the fact that in the two centuries preceding his expedition only three Europeans had visited
Timbuctoo	LOCATION	.


M. Dimnet	PERSON	, who has written books in French and books in English , shows a perfect com - mand of the latter tongue .

National Municipal League	ORGANIZATION	a volume devoted to the city manager plan .

		The question , however , may well be raised as to whether the time is yet ripe for the preparation of such a book .

		Certainly no one can feel that Mr.
Harry A. Toulmin	PERSON	, in his volume entitled '' City Man - ager : A New Profession '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , has presented more than the most tentative sort of discussion of the subject .

		The first city manager was employed by the city of Staun - ton , it is true , as many as seven years ago .

		Constitutional restrictions made it necessary in that instance , as in Staunton 's sister city of
Fredericksburg	LOCATION	, to superimpose the city managership upon a municipal organization of the old mayor-council type , and it was not until Sumter ,
S. C.	PERSON	, adopted the plan in
1912	DATE	, and , more notably ,
Dayton	LOCATION	and
Springfield	LOCATION	in
1913	DATE	, that the city managership was first em - ployed in conjunction with the commission form of city government .

		It is only as a fea - ture of the commission plan that the city managership has exhibited large usefulness or prospect of importance .

		This means that 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	Mr.
Toulmin	PERSON	's data are very meagre , being drawn almost entirely from the experience of Dayton -LRB- the author 's home city -RRB- and

		At that , one searches the book in vain for even a brief history of the establishment of the plan in these cities .

New York	LOCATION	legislature but was widely influen - tial throughout the country , the subject is dropped abruptly with no indication of the outcome , and is resumed only by the presenta - tion of a synopsis of the plan in a chapter far removed .

		To students of municipal affairs , few subjects are just now of larger interest than the city managership and its possibili - ties , and it will be regretted that the volume under review is not a better piece of work .

		But it must be reiterated that there has been insufficient development to warrant the pub - lication just now of a book upon the subject .

		A fifty-page pamphlet presenting the history and first results of the city managership in
Dayton	LOCATION	and
Springfield	LOCATION	, or in
Dayton	LOCATION	alone , would have met the present need .

		Into it could have been put all that is new or worth while in Mr.
Toulmin	PERSON	's volume of six times the size .

		Men and women of new
France	LOCATION	.

		The war has revealed a new
France	LOCATION	, `` silent , resolute , and im - perturbable '' ; decadent
France	LOCATION	lias disappeared .

		Who has wrought the change ?

		Mr.
Charles Dawbarn	PERSON	attempts to answer this extremely interesting question in liis volume entitled '' Makers of
New France	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Pott -RRB- , containing sixteen biographies , sketchy newspaper descriptions of fourteen men and two women .

		He has evidently seen or met all the persons dealt with in his book ; but the information contained in the various chapters is very meagre , and in many cases does not justify the inclusion of the subject of the chapter among the `` makers of new
France	LOCATION	. ''

		More objectivity , more `` meat , '' more definiteness , less fine writing , would nave made the volume more valuable .

		Fur - thermore , there is no clear evidence that Mr.
Dawbarn	PERSON	had a well defined idea of what the `` new
France	LOCATION	'' is like , or that he used this idea as a touchstone in selecting the `` makers of new
France	LOCATION	. ''

		Take , for example , the two women ,
Madame Paquin	PERSON	and Mile .

		Miropol - sky , the one a world-famous dressmaker , the other a lawyer of twenty-six .

		By no stretch of the imagination can this interesting young avocate be made responsible for the `` new ''
France	LOCATION	of which she is clearly a product .

		And what that is '' new '' in
France	LOCATION	shall we attribute to
Madame Paquin	PERSON	, bril - liant and successful woman though she is ?

		All Mr.
Dawbarn	PERSON	's subjects are important figures in the
France	LOCATION	of to-day , some more so , some less ; but that is nowise equivalent to saying that they are the makers of
France	LOCATION	.

		And what shall we say of the names that have been omitted ?

		Among the `` makers of new
France	LOCATION	, '' we look in vain for the name of an artist ; not even
Rodin	PERSON	has found favor .

		A
France	LOCATION	without an artist is indeed a '' new ''
France	LOCATION	!

		Among the writers there is no Ros - tand and no
Rolland	LOCATION	, only
Anatole France	LOCATION	,
Finot	ORGANIZATION	, and
Brieux	ORGANIZATION	.

		To be sure ,
Rostand	PERSON	is of the older generation ; but so also is
Ana	LOCATION	- tole
France	LOCATION	, and
Rolland	PERSON	must be numbered among the big men of the new generation .

		Mr.
Dawbarn	PERSON	had a suspicion that we might `` wonder why one is admitted and another refused , '' and attempted to forestall unfavor - able criticism by explaining that '' the gallery is obviously limited by the covers of a book . ''

		What he has given us is but `` the head of the procession moving toward the sun . ''

		Per - haps ; but he had no clear vision of the '' new
France	LOCATION	, '' no means of infallibly discerning its makers , and he has failed to make clear to us the importance of the role of those upon whom his choice fell .

		In the last few years a number A comprehensive o f serviceable handbooks on the library manual .

		, use or the library have come from authoritative sources and have met cer - tain needs with different readers and with different emphasis upon the various subdivi - sions of the general theme .

		We have had Mr.
Gilbert 0	PERSON	.

		Ward 's elementary manual on '' The Practical Use of Books and Libraries , '' and Mr.
Charles P. Chipman	PERSON	's `` Books and Libraries , '' and
Miss Gilson	PERSON	's '' Course of Study for
Normal School Pupils	ORGANIZATION	on the Use of a Library , '' not to mention the series of practical treatises on library matters by Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	and his corps of assistants .

		Now we have , from the librarian and the assistant librarian in the
University of Ten	ORGANIZATION	- nessee , Miss
Lucy E. Fay	PERSON	and Miss
Anne T. Eaton	PERSON	, respectively , a more generally compre - hensive and , one might say , popularly useful work than any of the above-named .

		It is enti - tled '' Instruction in the Use of Books and Libraries '' -LRB-
Boston Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ; and though announcing itself '' a textbook for normal schools and colleges , '' it is equally adapted to self-instruction , and might well have a place in the bookcase of every family as a compe - tent guide to the intelligent use of the local public library or to the formation of a private library .

		Divided into three parts in : one
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 71 octavo volume of 449 pages , it considers , first , '' the use of books , '' then '' selection of books and children 's literature , '' and , finally , ' '' the administration of school libraries / ' a more technical or professional theme than the general reader will care to concern himself with .

		Its book-lists and other bibliographical matter show care and judgment , with a reliance on the best authorities .

		Pen-and-ink drawings , where needed to explain the text or .

		add to its interest , are supplied by Mrs. Nor - man
B. Morrell	PERSON	, and a good general index closes the book .

		The authors have done their work so well as to make it improbable that the same task will have to be undertaken again for a long while .

		.

		Strathcona as the evil genius of
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
W. T. R. Preston	PERSON	wisely waited until his subject was dead before publishing his book on ''
Strathcona	ORGANIZATION	and the Making of
Canada	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
McBride , Nast & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Among the least offensive of the comments upon Lord Strath - cona 's life and character of which the book mainly consists is this : `` He was as punc - tilious about paying off personal scores as in paying his debts . ''

		The same statement would perhaps be as charitable a way of character - izing Mr.
Preston	PERSON	's attitude toward his subject as one would be justified in adopting .

		The book is , in fact , a fairly clever sketch of the life of
Strathcona	ORGANIZATION	, particularly of his connec - tion with the
Canadian Pacific Railway	ORGANIZATION	, in which every public scandal of the past half century of Canadian history is dragged out to serve as a background for one who is pictured as the evil genius of his country .

		Chapter after chapter is made up for the most part of .

		statements and insinuations , damning to
Strathcona	ORGANIZATION	's memory , for which we are offered no better proof than Mr.
Preston	PERSON	's word , or a reported conversation between Mr.
Preston	PERSON	and some contemporary of
Strathcona	ORGANIZATION	's , who curiously enough always happens to be dead .

		The book is decidedly one that leaves an un - pleasant taste in the mouth .

		The only point about this vindictive biography which is left in the dark is the particular grievance which Mr.
Preston	PERSON	had against
Lord Strathcona	ORGANIZATION	, when he set himself the task of writing the latter 's life .

		There must be many readers l h hu?n e anbTing .

		who are utterly weary of books on the war .

		To such be it said that `` The Human German '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , by Mr.
Edward Edgeworth	PERSON	, has not the remotest connection with the struggle now convulsing
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It is a whimsical , ironical , yet sym - pathetic estimate of the human qualities in the individual German and in his collective achievements .

		Though the author is evidently an Englishman , he has written without na - tional prejudice ; indeed , he has as sharp things to say of his own countrymen as of foreigners .

		With
Berlin	LOCATION	as his centre , he sur - veys the 67,000,000 Germans , their habits and institutions , and finds them all menschlich , allzumenschlich , that is to say , creatures of human frailty , but for that reason of human interest and likableness .

		Even in the porten - tous and forbidding
German State	ORGANIZATION	, a human nucleus is discovered .

		This genial tolerance is plentifully spiced with a sense of humor and a perception of the ridiculousness of most of the ways and works of men .

		The author is a capital raconteur , and some of his stories -LRB- for example , that of the disconcerting experi - ment of the eugenics professor -RRB- are memora - ble .

		Happily , however , his book is not for the most part anecdotal , but is pitched in a more impersonal key .

		Though ideas are not fon - dled for their own sake , the human material is everywhere discussed in a vein of philoso - phic banter .

		The result is highly amusing , if not always formally instructive .

		When the reader has finished , he has perhaps not learned many new facts about
Germany	LOCATION	, but he has certainly come to know the Germans better ; and more surely still he has made the acquain - tance of Mr.
Edgeworth	PERSON	, whose idiosyncrasies of mind and temperament make up a person - ality well worth cultivating .

		Altogether this is a very human book by a very human writer about a people who are by no means as inhu - man as their methods of warfare indicate .

		The development in pre-revolu - tias l s-ma ~ ier .

		tionary times in
Eastern Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania of a notable industry in the manufacture of glassware of considerable artistic merit both in form and color is related in Mr.
Frederick W. Hunter	PERSON	's `` Stiegel Glass '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The work is the result of the au - thor 's enthusiastic efforts as connoisseur and collector in gathering the
Hunter	PERSON	collection of colonial glassware now in the Metropolitan Museum of
New York	LOCATION	.

		It recounts his diffi - culties and successes in ferreting out the his - tory of
Baron Stiegel	PERSON	, his family connections , his land , iron , and glass ventures , his colonial and foreign trade , his efforts -LRB- by means of the
American Flint Glass Lottery	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- to recoup his losses due to over-zealous expansion and to the approach of the War of Independence .

		There is much information about the methods of manufacture employed , verified by excava - tions on the sites of
Stiegel	PERSON	's three factories , and comparisons of these findings with extant specimens of the handicraft of these colonial 72 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 15	DATE	artisans .

		The work is illustrated by twelve plates in color , and 159 fine half-tones por - traying the range in shapes and decorations .

		Diaries and account books have been ran - sacked to determine the dates of the enter - prises , and to develop an interesting picture of the efforts of this enthusiastic but vision - ary manufacturer to extend the sale of his wares in competition with those from
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean makers .

		Brief accounts of other colonial ventures in glass-making are also given .

		The work is well written , and is full of interest as a picture of industrial conditions in colonial times , as well as of colonial art and handicraft .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
E. Belfort Bax	PERSON	, the author of several works on Socialism , has written a volume entitled '' Ger - man Culture , Past and Present '' -LRB-
McBride	ORGANIZATION	,
Nast & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which describes the mediaeval civilization of
Germany	LOCATION	during the Reformation period .

		As a socialist , the author believes in the economic inter - pretation , rather than the '' great man '' theory .

		Consequently , there is less mention of Luther than of the peasants ' revolts , the Anabaptist movement , the collapse of knighthood , and such like general tendencies .

		The two concluding chapters , dealing with that modern German culture which is based on militarism and national efficiency , seem an afterthought suggested by the war .

		Five titles constitute the beginning of a new series to be known as '' The Nation 's Library , '' each volume being written especially for the series by a well-known authority .

		They are as follows : '' Eugenics , '' by Dr.
Edgar Schuster	PERSON	; '' Modern Views on Education , '' by Dr.
Thiselton Mark	PERSON	; '' The Principles of Evolution , '' by Mr.
Joseph McCabe	PERSON	; `` The Star World , '' by Professor A. C. de la
Crommelin	LOCATION	; and '' Socialism and
Syndical	PERSON	- ism , '' by Mr.
Philip Snowden	PERSON	.

		In each instance , both in these volumes and in those in prospect , the aim is to view the specialized information on the subject in its relationship to modern life and thought .

		-LRB-
Baltimore	LOCATION	:
Warwick & York , Inc.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Arnold Wynne	PERSON	's '' The Growth of English Drama '' -LRB-
Oxford Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a simply and ad - mirably planned book .

		After four chapters on '' Early Church Drama on the Continent , '' '' En - glish Miracle Plays , '' '' Moralities and Interludes , '' and '' Rise of Comedy and Tragedy , '' the writer treats comedy and tragedy separately down to and including
Nash	PERSON	and
Marlowe	PERSON	, and concludes the work with an appendix on the Elizabethan Stage .

		The feature which gives Mr.
Wynne	PERSON	's book individuality , insures it against the charge of repetition of familiar matter , and makes its writing a real service to literature , is his generous use of well-selected passages in illustration of characteristic plays .

		There is enough of this in the volume to make it a study of literature as well as a study about literature .

		The special student will find the book a convenience , while for the general reader it will supply a real need .

		NOTES .

		`` The Landloper '' is the title of Mr.
Holman	PERSON	Day 's new novel , which Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	will issue this month .

		Mr.
George Kennan	PERSON	, whose '' Tent Life in
Siberia	LOCATION	'' originally appeared forty-five years ago , has a volume of Russian stories and sketches in the press , to be published during the
summer	DATE	under the title of `` A Russian Comedy of Errors . ''

		Of especial interest in '' The English Review '' for
June	DATE	is the first instalment of
Maxim Gorki	ORGANIZATION	's vividly written autobiography .

		As with nearly all other English periodicals at this time , the contents of this issue are devoted almost wholly to contribu - tions having to do with the great war .

		A series of about one hundred letters , many of them never before published , written by Washing - ton Irving to
Henry Brevoort	PERSON	between the years
1807	DATE	and
1843	DATE	, will appear in the autumn with the imprint of Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		The volume is edited by Mr.
George S. Hellman	PERSON	, who also contributes an Introduction . ''

		Why
Europe	LOCATION	is at War '' is the title of a vol - ume soon to come from Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		It is made up of essays by writers from each of the belligerent Powers , giving reasons why their re - spective countries are at war , together with a con - cluding chapter expressing the point of view of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Goncharov 's '' Oblomov , '' in which the author created a type which has taken its place in Rus - sian literature as firmly as that taken by
Pecksniff	PERSON	in English literature and Tartuffe in the literature of
France	LOCATION	, has been translated from the Russian by
C. J. Hogarth	PERSON	for an English edition which is now in preparation .

		Arrangements have been completed by Mr.
Lau	PERSON	- rence
J. Gomme	PERSON	for publishing '' The Anthology of Magazine Verse for
1915	DATE	, '' compiled , as usual , by Mr.
William Stanley Braithwaite	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Gomme	PERSON	has found it necessary to issue a new edition of the anthology for
1914	DATE	, which he now has ready .

		He has also published Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	's '' The
Vale of Shadows	ORGANIZATION	, and Other Poems of the Great War . ''

		A new volume in the '' Countries and Peoples Series '' is in preparation by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	and will be published before long .

		It is entitled ''
Scandinavia	LOCATION	of the Scandinavians '' and is writ - ten by Mr.
Henry Goddard Leach	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, Secretary of the American Scandinavian Founda - tion , who has lived several years in
Scandinavia	LOCATION	.

		It will describe the daily life and the habits of thought of the three northern nations ,
Denmark	LOCATION	,
Norway	LOCATION	, and
Sweden	LOCATION	.

		Sir
Henry Newbolt	PERSON	has written a book for boys on the European War , entitled '' The Book of the Thin Red Line , '' which is announced for early issue by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	.

		From the same house will come Mr.
Maurice S. Evans	PERSON	's '' Black and White in the
Southern States	LOCATION	, '' a study of the race problem in the
United States	LOCATION	from a South African point of view ; and a revised and enlarged edition of Dr.
Charles Gross	PERSON	's '' The Sources and Literature of English History . ''

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 73 Two books on the Renaissance may shortly be expected .

		One of these is Mr.
Christopher Hare	PERSON	's illustrated '' Life and Letters in the Italian Renaissance , '' in which the author contrasts the lives of writers and thinkers from
Lorenzo	LOCATION	the Magnificent to
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	and
Baldassare Castig	PERSON	- lione with the pomp and splendor of their time ; the other is a '' History of the Renaissance : The Protestant Revolution and the
Catholic Reforma	ORGANIZATION	- tion in
Continental Europe	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
Edward M. Hulme	PERSON	, of
the University of Idaho	ORGANIZATION	.

		Due to the war , the '' Statesman 's Year Book '' for
1915	DATE	, which Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	will soon issue , has been subjected to a large amount of revision .


Egypt	LOCATION	has been transferred to the British Empire , the Turkish pages have been largely rewritten , and all the countries included have been brought as far as possible up to date .

		A diary and bibliog - raphy of the war are included , together with a list of important publications on the struggle , arranged according to the countries of origin .

		Among the books to be issued in the autumn by the
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	are : `` The Port of
Boston	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
Edwin J. Clapp	PERSON	; ''
Jour	PERSON	- neys to
Bagdad	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Charles S. Brooks	PERSON	; '' Symbolic Poems of
William Blake	PERSON	, '' by Pro- fessor
Frederick Erastus Pierce	PERSON	; '' The Liberty of Citizenship , '' by the Hon.
Samuel W. McCall	PERSON	; '' The New Infinite and the Old Theology , '' by Professor
Cassius J. Keyser	PERSON	; `` A Voice from the Crowd , '' by Mr.
George Wharton Pepper	PERSON	; aud ''
Henry Fielding	PERSON	's Covent-Garden Journal , '' edited , with an introduction and notes , by Pro- fessor
Gerard E. Jensen	PERSON	.

		The autobiography of
Richard Whiteing	PERSON	, whose '' Number 5 John Street '' is still remembered and read nearly a score of years after its first publica - tion , is among the forthcoming publications of Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Whiteing	PERSON	's inti - mate association for the
last half century	DATE	with all that was best in art and literature , and with much of what was most interesting in social progress both in
England	LOCATION	and on the Continent , and his skill with the pen ought to make his recollections an interesting volume .

		Before its appearance in book form a series of chapters from the work will be published in '' The
Bookman	PERSON	, '' beginning with the
July	DATE	number .

		Publishing in
England	LOCATION	, except for the war - books , is almost at a standstill , says '' The New Statesman . '' ''

		In the
autumn	DATE	and
spring	DATE	a con - siderable number of books were published ; but these had been almost all arranged for , and most of the expenditure upon them contracted , before the war .

		But the publishers are now drawing in their horns .

		Few new books are coming out , and authors are finding it difficult to get commissions or place manuscripts .

		Some even of the largest firms are postponing publication of important books , commissioned long since , until after the war .

		New enterprise now is altogether too specu - lative for most people . ''

		The first volume of the English translation of Treitschke 's '' History of
Germany	LOCATION	in the Nine - teenth Century '' will be published at once in this country by Messrs.
McBride	PERSON	,
Nast & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, with an Introduction by Mr.
W. Harbutt Dawson	PERSON	on '' The Extinction of the Empire . ''

		It carries the narra - tive from ''
Germany	LOCATION	after the Peace of West - phalia '' to the end of '' The War of Liberation . ''

		Volume II. , dealing with '' The Beginnings of the Germanic Federation , 1814-1819 , '' will follow in
September	DATE	, and the remaining five volumes at quarterly intervals .

		Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	will write the supplementary volume , dealing with the history of
Germany	LOCATION	from the point at which it was left by
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	down to date .

		Lovers of the writings of
John Muir	PERSON	will be glad to know that he left at his death a large body of important manuscript material which Messrs.
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	, his authorized publishers , will issue in the near future .

		Arrangements are pending for the publication of several character - istic records of travel similar to Mr.
Muir	PERSON	's well - known books on the Sierras and the
Yosemite	LOCATION	, as well as for a notable '' Life , Letters , and Journals '' which promises to take its place with the most important American publications of this type .

		This will be the only biography of Mr.
Muir	PERSON	authorized by the family , and all persons who have letters or other material likely to be of value to the biographer will confer a favor by sending such material to the publishers for forwarding .

		The Concordance Society issues , in '' Circular No. 9 , '' a brief report of progress and prospects .

		Though no publishing has been done since the appearance of the
Wordsworth	PERSON	concordance
four years ago	DATE	, there are in preparation two similar works , a concordance to
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	, and one to
Browning	PERSON	, only one of which will the Society be able to assist in a pecuniary way .

		All members are invited to indicate their preference .

		A
Keats	PERSON	concordance , finished by its compilers more than a year ago , has recently been accepted for publica - tion by the
Carnegie Institution	ORGANIZATION	.

		Other like under - takings enjoying assistance from the same quarter and soon to be completed , in book-form , are Pro- fessor
Lane Cooper	PERSON	's '' Concordance to Horace '' and a '' Concordance to Spenser . ''

		A concordance to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's poems is also projected .

		Stronger support and increased membership are asked for by the Society .

		Mr.
Sidney Low	PERSON	has edited a series of essays on '' The Spirit of the
Allied Nations	ORGANIZATION	, '' contributed by various writers , each of whom is an authority on his subject . ''

		The Spirit of
France	LOCATION	'' is dealt with by
Paul Studer	PERSON	,
Taylorian Professor of the Romance Languages	ORGANIZATION	in the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	; '' The Spirit of
Russia	LOCATION	, '' by
Alexis Aladin	PERSON	, late a member of the Russian Duma ; '' The Spirit of
Belgium	LOCATION	, '' by
Paul Hamelius	PERSON	, Professor of English Literature in the
University	ORGANIZATION	of
Liege	LOCATION	; '' The Spirit of the Serb , '' by Dr.
R. W. Seton	PERSON	-
Watson	PERSON	, author of `` The Southern Slav Question '' ; `` The Spirit of
Japan	LOCATION	, '' by
J. H. Longford	PERSON	, Professor of Japa - nese at
King 's College , University	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	; and '' The Spirit of the British Empire and its Allies , '' by the editor .

		Mr. Low also summarizes the con - clusions of the various writers in an introductory essay , and adds some personal notes of a recent visit to the French battle zone .

		The volume is announced for immediate publication .

		121 THE FINE FLOWER OF AMERICAN THOUGHT .

		The five young men of
William	LOCATION	and
Mary College	ORGANIZATION	who foregathered on the fifth of De - cember ,
1776	DATE	, to organize the first Greek letter society in
America	LOCATION	, builded better than they knew .

		`` A happy spirit and resolution of attaining the important ends of society enter - ing their minds , '' they chose as their emblem a square medal with S. P. engraved on the one side , and Phi Beta Kappa on the other , '' for the better establishment and sanctitude of their unanimity . ''

		Within a year , the society had grown to a membership of fourteen , and had provided itself with officers , laws , and an oath of fidelity .

		Such were the modest begin - nings of the organization which has since flourished apace , which now includes chapters in eighty-six American institutions of collegi - ate and university rank , with a living mem - bership of more than thirty thousand men and women , and which for over a century has set admission to its ranks as a shining goal upon which every college student of serious purpose has centred his ambition .

		The par - ent idea of the society found so many imita - tors that the combinations and permutations of the Greek alphabet have been heavily drawn upon to supply the mystic designa - tions needed , and in too many cases the idea has been perverted to serve purposes that are anything but academic , to stand for snobbish exclusiveness or a brummagem college aris - tocracy ; but the
Phi Beta Kappa	LOCATION	has re - mained the society of scholarship in the severest sense , and its badge has continued to denote intellectual distinction and nothing else .

		The progress of the war caused the society to languish in
Virginia	LOCATION	, and it was in danger of an early death , when steps were taken for its extension into
New England	LOCATION	, and the establishment of chapters at
Harvard	LOCATION	,
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, and
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	made its future secure .

		It was the North , and later the West , that gave it enduring vitality , and it is a noteworthy fact that only a dozen of the chapters existing to-day are south of
Mason	ORGANIZATION	and
Dixon	PERSON	's line .

		When the society gave up its attributes of 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	secrecy , owing to the anti-masonic agitation of
1826	DATE	, and abandoned the tomfoolery of oaths and cipher codes , it still further empha - sized its unique position among academic organizations , and opened its path to a future growth that would hardly have been possible under the old conditions .

		The
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	chap - ter seems to have been mainly responsible for what has been for more than a century the chief manifestation of Phi Beta Kappa activ - ity the annual celebration by an oration -LRB- and sometimes a poem -RRB- in which each branch of the society pays tribute to the ideals of the founders .

		The early records of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	men - tion an oration in
1788	DATE	by
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	, then a graduate of twenty ; and a poem in
1797	DATE	, by
Robert Treat Paine	ORGANIZATION	.


Lafay	PERSON	- ette in
1824	DATE	, after listening to an oration nearly two hours long by
Edward Everett	PERSON	, offered the following toast : `` This
Antient University	ORGANIZATION	, this
Literary Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		This
Holy Alliance of Learning	ORGANIZATION	and Virtue and
Patri	PERSON	- otism is more than a match for any coalition against the rights of mankind . ''

		The Har - vard roll alone of orators and poets is almost a catalogue of the chief mountain peaks in the range of American literature , including as it does the names of three Adamses , Tick - nor ,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Beecher	PERSON	,
Curtis	PERSON	,
Phillips	PERSON	,
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	,
Bryant	PERSON	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Longfel	PERSON	- low , and
Gilder	PERSON	.

		For the foregoing facts , together with much other interesting histori - cal material , we are indebted to an article in `` The
Sewanee	LOCATION	Review , '' by Professor
John M. McBryde , Jr.	PERSON	, the editor of that quarterly .

		How the history of
Phi Beta Kappa	LOCATION	throughout the nation has justified
Lafay	PERSON	- ette 's toast is triumphantly shown in the volume of `` Representative Phi Beta Kappa Orations '' recently published under the edi - torship of Professor
Clark S. Northup	PERSON	.

		It is the aim of every chapter , for the occasion of its annual meeting , to obtain for its orator the most eminent man within its reach , and the honor of the invitation is such that it is rarely declined .

		The speaker feels that some - thing better than his normal best is demanded by the occasion , and strives to emulate the great men who have preceded him in the function .

		The consequence is that Phi Beta Kappa oratory has now for a century em - bodied the best thought and the finest powers of expression of the intellectual leaders of the nation , and offers a wealth of material which American literature treasures as one of its most valuable assets .

		This is the reason for which we have ventured to characterize the volume now before us as the unfolding of '' the fine flower of American thought . ''

		Here we have , in a commentary ranging over the greater part of a century , the voice of Amer - ican idealism in its purest strain , the voice which expresses what the nation is funda - mentally thinking upon religion , literature , science , politics , education , and the conduct of life , in short , upon all the great subjects of human concern .

		Only an anthology of the noblest American poetry could be equally indicative , in a typical way , of the essential genius of the nation .

		The papers here reprinted are twenty-six in number ,
1837	DATE	and
1910	DATE	being , respectively , the earliest and the latest dates .

		The former year is that of
Emerson	LOCATION	's stirring Harvard address upon '' The American Scholar , '' our intellectual declaration of independence , which fired the youth of that early generation with the exalted purpose to realize the mission of democracy in the wider spheres of thought and action .

		The latest date is that of Pro- fessor
Paul Shorey	PERSON	's Oberlin address upon '' The Unity of the
Human Spirit /	ORGANIZATION	' with its calm assurance of refuge for the mind in the fortress which guards the permanent achieve - ments of the human intellect from all the winds of doctrine that buffet its impregnable defences .

		And between these two dates , how imposing an array of our greatest thinkers is marshalled , and how wide a range of subjects of the first importance is considered !

		Let a few only of the speakers and their themes be instanced to show what manner of writing is here to be found .

		Besides the two already mentioned , we have
Andrew Preston Peabody	PERSON	on '' The Connection between Science and Religion , ''
George William Curtis	PERSON	on `` The American Doctrine of Liberty , ''
Francis Andrew March	PERSON	on '' The Scholar of To-day , ''
Charles Kendall Adams	PERSON	on '' The Relations of Higher Education to
National Prosperity	ORGANIZATION	, ''
Wendell Phillips	PERSON	on '' The Scholar in a Repub - lic , ''
Andrew Dickson White	PERSON	on `` Evolution vs. Revolution in Politics , ''
Charles William Eliot	PERSON	on `` Academic Freedom , '' and
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	on `` The Spirit of Learning . ''

		Here are ten names that stand for our intellectual best , the names of men to whom we can point with confidence that no ill-considered teach -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 85 ing and no unworthy thought will proceed from their lips .

		And many of the other names are of hardly less weight .

		If those of Job
Durfee	PERSON	and
Charles Henry Bell	PERSON	are not exactly household words , those of
John Jay Chapman	PERSON	,
Bliss Perry	LOCATION	,
John Franklin Jame	PERSON	- son ,
Josiah Royce	PERSON	, and
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	rep - resent men who are held in high esteem as broad-minded and penetrating analysts of our social and intellectual life .

		It is only natural that some of the earlier utterances among these orations should show unmistakable signs of '' dating . ''

		It seems curious to find
Horace Bushnell	PERSON	speaking of '' the new science of political economy '' ; and there is an echo from a remote past of igno - rance and prejudice in
Andrew P. Peabody	PERSON	's remark that '' if people choose to admire Vol - taire and worship
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, none can gainsay them . ''

		We are far indeed from the time when the Frenchman might be dismissed as a mere scoffer at things sacred , or the German as an immoral devotee of the cult of self - realization .

		Even
Emerson	PERSON	's great plea for the scholar 's individuality and independence seems now a little antiquated .

		Peabody 's sug - gestion that the '' Natural Orders have not in a scientific aspect superseded the Linnsean system '' sounds quaint to a modern botanist .

		When Curtis tells us that '' the foundation of liberty in natural right was no boast of pas - sionate rhetoric from the mouths of the fath - ers , '' he gives expression to a doctrine that is unfashionable among the young lions of our new political theorizing , although we suspect that he was nearer the truth than they are .

		And a later critic of literature than
F. A. March	ORGANIZATION	would hardly make contemptuous ref - erence to `` the long-drawn eunuch dallyings of Swinburne or Whitman , '' whatever in
March	DATE	's imagination these may have been .

		But the substance of even the oldest of these addresses is of the essence of wisdom , because the speakers , true to the ideals of the society , have concerned themselves with the eternal rather than the temporal , and have planted their feet upon the solid foundations of truth .

		It is not surprising that
Emerson	PERSON	's classical essay on '' The American Scholar '' should have fixed a type for Phi Beta Kappa orations to which many of his successors have sought to conform .

		The society stands for scholarship , and the exaltation of the scholarly function .

		Thus , in the present collection , we find '' The Scholar of To-day , '' `` The Scholar in a Re - public , '' and '' The Attitude of the Scholar . ''

		Closely related to this theme are , of course , such matters as '' Intellectual Leadership in American History , '' '' Humanities Gone and to Come , '' `` Academic Freedom , '' '' The Spirit of Learning , '' `` The Mystery of Education , '' and `` The Unity of the Human Spirit . ''

		These are all lights shed upon the function of the scholar in society .

		The second Leitmotiv of the collection is democracy , as instanced by such titles as '' The American Doctrine of Liberty , '' '' Evolution vs. Revolution in Poli - tics , '' ''
Jefferson	PERSON	's Doctrines under New Tests , '' '' The Hope of Democracy , '' and `` Democracy and a Prophetic Idealism . ''

		Science , religion , and social welfare also con - tribute their themes to the counterpoint of this symphony of idealism .

		If we are to seek for a text which shall stand for the collective meaning of the volume in its essen - tial attributes , and , indeed , for the underly - ing thought of all Phi Beta Kappa oratory which is true to type , it will be in Professor
Shorey	PERSON	's address on `` The Unity of the Human Spirit , '' which is perhaps the best piece of writing , compact of pregnant wisdom , among all these modern instances .

		The writer 's thesis is `` the identity of the highest
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean thought of the past two or three thou - sand years , '' which is practically all the thought that counts for civilization , and his protest is against the notion that there is much that is either new or important in the speculative vagaries of our noisy contempora - ries .

		One of his most valuable suggestions is that our distracted minds would be well - advised to go back to Mill , from whom they may learn '' lessons of comprehensive and con - secutive thinking , judicial weighing of all considerations pro and con , temperance and precision of expression , and scrupulous fair - ness to opponents , which they will hardly get from the undigested mixtures of biology , nervous anatomy , anthropology and folk - lore , answers to questionnaires , statistics , and reports from the pedagogical or psychological seminar , with a seasoning of uncritical his - torical and illiterate literary illustration , that compose the made-to-order text-books of pedagogy , sociology , ethics , and psychology on which their minds are fed . ''

		We know of no finer or more persuasive call to the spirit of humanism than is found in the following : 86 THE DIAL '' There is one great society alone on earth , the noble living and the noble dead .

		That society is and will always be an aristocracy .

		But the door of opportunity that gives access to it opens easily to the keys of a sound culture , and is closed only to the ignorance and prejudice that fixes our hyp - notized vision on the passing phantasmagoria .

		A certain type of educator is given to denouncing the tyranny of the classics .

		There is no intellectual tyranny comparable to that exercised over the imagination by the present , the up-to-date , with its incessant panorama of self-representation , its myriad-voiced iteration of itself from the news - papers , the dime magazines , the platforms that mould or enforce the opinions of ninety million men .

		The new psychologists have coined a ques - tion-begging epithet into a pseudo-scientific term , ' misoneism , ' or hatred of novelty , to stigmatize the hesitation of culture to accept every popgun of hypothesis as the crack of doom .

		What Greek compound will do justice to that hatred of the old , that distaste for everything not mentioned in yes - terday 's newspaper , which seals their minds , and the minds of the generation which they are edu - cating , to so much of the inherited beauty and wisdom of the world ?

		.

		.

		But if , to wrest the old Platonic phrases once more to our purpose , the flux is not all , if the good , the true , and the beau - tiful are something real and ascertainable , if these eternal ideals reembody themselves from age to age essentially the same in the imaginative visions of supreme genius and in the persistent sanity and rationality of the world 's best books , then our reading and study are redeemed , both from the obsessions of the hour , and the tyranny of quanti - tative measures and mechanical methods .

		The boundless ocean of books is before us , and the courageous reader will make many a bold voyage of discovery to rarely visited shores .

		But more and more as the years go by will he concentrate his attention on the books that preserve from age to age the precious distillation of the human spirit in its finest flower .

		They are not so many but that he may in time hope to seek them out and in some sort to know them .

		They are comparatively few , but * That few is all the world with which a few Doth ever live and move and work and strive . ' ''

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		`` THE NATION 'S '' JUBILEE .

		The passing of the half - century mark in the life of `` The Nation '' is an event well worth the attention which it has received .

		With a circulation small in comparison with that of the popular magazines , an expense to its owners much of the time rather than a source of profit , it has nevertheless been the most powerful and the most healthful single influ - ence , in American periodical literature during the period which its life has covered .

		To have read its pages means to have been brought into serious contact with every important field of human thought and action , and sooner or later with all the most important workers in those fields .

		A prominent New Yorker once remarked , whether justly or not does not mat - ter here , that he read a certain paper when - ever he wanted absolute intellectual rest .

		No such remark could ever plausibly be uttered concerning '' The Nation . ''

		To provoke vital thought on vital questions was the aim of its sponsors from ' the outset , and that aim has been abundantly realized .

		And for such a purpose the profession of journalism has pro- duced no more effective pen that that of
E. L. Godkin	PERSON	, its first editor .

		His intellect and energy and character were so inextricably woven into its columns during the first dec - ades of its existence that one might easily make the mistake of thinking of it as his per - sonal organ , a mistake , because
Godkin	PERSON	's work for '' The Nation '' was always wholly above personal motive .

		But
Godkin	PERSON	unaided could not have made '' The Nation '' what it was .

		The excellent editorial management of
Wendell Phillips Garrison	PERSON	, associated .

		with
Godkin	PERSON	from the beginning , gave just the setting which the latter 's writing needed .

		It was Garrison who chose the numerous staff of reviewers who lent weight and dignity and continuity to '' The Nation 's '' literary columns , and hun - dreds of letters are in the hands of these reviewers to-day bearing testimony to the con - scientiousness with which his duties as literary editor were performed and to his kindly per - sonal interest in his widely scattered staff .

		With
Godkin	PERSON	and
Garrison	PERSON	in control , it is no wonder that '' The Nation '' drew to its stand - ard a large percentage of the most capable leaders of thought and action in the land .

		And through its influence on the leaders , it has reached and benefitted multitudes who do not even know of its existence .

		The strength of '' The Nation '' has been that of sincere devotion to high ends , and intelligent management in the pursuit of those ends .

		This is abundantly brought out in the contributions which fill its Jubilee issue .

		It is pleasant to know that the pas - sage of its fifty-year mark finds '' The Nation '' in a position of renewed energy and pros - perity , its owners and editors thoroughly devoted to the standards which
Godkin	PERSON	and
Garrison	PERSON	created for it , and its circulation on the ascending pathway .

		The efficiency of democracy lies in the willingness of indi - viduals to do just such work as
Garrison	PERSON	and
Godkin	PERSON	inaugurated , and to inspire others in succession to take hold of that work and maintain it as a permanent institution .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 87 CASUAL COMMENT .

		A SPUR TO LITERARY EFFORT IN THE SOUTH , where the people seem tolerably content to live their lives without romancing about them in print , has for fifteen years been sedulously applied by
the State Literary and Historical Association of North Carolina	ORGANIZATION	, which now , un - der the zealous leadership of Professor
Archi	PERSON	- bald
Henderson	PERSON	, shows the world what it is doing in the '' Proceedings '' of its fifteenth an - nual session , a notable document that tends to disprove the truth of those famous lines of the bard of
South Carolina	LOCATION	: `` Alas for the South !

		Her books have grown fewer ; She never was much given to literature . ''

		That the
Old North State	ORGANIZATION	has become or is becoming addicted to literature in a creditable measure , is the im - pression gained from reading the papers -LRB- included in these `` Proceedings '' -RRB- on
North Carolina	LOCATION	historians , novelists , ballad litera - ture , poetry , and oratory ,
North Carolina	LOCATION	bibliography for the year ,
North Carolina	LOCATION	's famous `` 0 .

		Henry , '' and her late poet lau - reate ,
Henry Jerome Stockard	PERSON	.

		A tablet , with medallion portrait , in memory of
William Sidney Porter	PERSON	-LRB- '' 0 .

		Henry '' -RRB- was unveiled in the
Hall of History	ORGANIZATION	, at
Raleigh	LOCATION	, where the meetings of the Association were held ; the
Patterson	LOCATION	Memorial Cup for literary achieve - ment was presented to Dr.
J. G. de R. Hamil	PERSON	- ton , whose recent book , `` Reconstruction in
North Carolina	LOCATION	, '' brought him this honor ; an address on '' Some Argentine Ideas '' was delivered by Ambassador
Naon	PERSON	; and from first to last President
Henderson	PERSON	was active in promoting the success of the entire series of exercises , his opening paper on `` The New North State '' sounding an unmistakable note of high-hearted hopefulness and determina - tion .

		Prominence was given , in the addresses and discussions , to the need of historical study and writing throughout the state , with a view to the production of worthy histories of the counties of
North Carolina	LOCATION	, only a few of which have yet been made the subject of such study .

		Outside of
Virginia	LOCATION	, it would be diffi - cult to point to more creditable endeavor of this literary-historical sort , in any of our southern states , than that which has for more than a decade been led and inspired by Professor
Henderson	PERSON	.

		REMINISCENT OF THOREAU and his sturdy though ineffectual protest against what he considered an unjustifiable tax levy , was the prompt refusal , the other day , of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's most distinguished living fellow - townsman to pay a fine of
ten dollars	MONEY	for failing to make the drainage system of his
Concord	LOCATION	house tributary to that of the town .

		For more than a year considerable publicity has attended Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's resolute defence of his case before the authorities and in the courts of law ; and the end is not yet . ''

		I shall die before this case is settled , '' was the defen - dant 's prophecy as he appealed the question to a higher court on the ground of unconsti - tutionally in the existing law .

		There must be many still living who can recall that char - acteristic manifestation of recalcitrancy which brought the hermit of
Walden	LOCATION	into close acquaintance with the town lock-up .

		It was his refusal on one occasion to pay his yearly tax that procured him this inside knowledge , and of course it was on high moral grounds that he took his stand in the matter , with what one suspects to have been a real enjoy - ment of his brief martyrdom in the supposed cause of justice .

		As the story goes , when
Emerson	PERSON	, upon hearing of his friend 's incar - ceration , hastened to the house of detention and , appearing at the door of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's cell , sorrowfully demanded of him , ``
Henry	PERSON	, why do I find you here ? ''

		the other promptly re - joined , in a like tone of voice , `` Waldo , why do I not find you here ? ''

		The spectacle of Thoreau in the common jail may well have appeared too incongruous to admit of long continuance ; at any rate , some one , probably
Emerson	PERSON	himself , effected an early adjust - ment of the difficulty with the tax-collector , and the prisoner , considerably against his will , found himself at liberty .

		It is impossible to believe that this later instance of opposition to the constituted authorities of
Concord	LOCATION	in - volves any disregard , on the opponent 's part , of the best interests of the community ; and his picturesque appearance in court as able and fluent counsel in his own defence must breed a rather general desire for the success of his cause .

		THE TRAGIC END OF
ARTHUR SEDGWICK	PERSON	, wllO took his own life on the fourteenth of
July	DATE	in a moment of despondency caused by ill health and other anxieties , has evoked some interest - ing reminiscences of the man 's noteworthy achievements in more than one branch of activity , and his repeated exhibition of the best qualities of mind and heart .


Arthur George Sedgwick	PERSON	was born
October 6 , 1844	DATE	, in
New York	LOCATION	, was graduated from
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1864	DATE	, entered the volunteer army of the North in the same year , as lieutenant of the
Twentieth Massachusetts Regiment	ORGANIZATION	, fell into the hands of the Confederate forces at Deep Bottom ,
Virginia	LOCATION	, soon afterward , and became acquainted with the interior of
Libby Prison	ORGANIZATION	, THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	where he contracted an illness that disabled him for further service in the field .

		At the close of the war he studied law and practised in
Boston	LOCATION	until 1872 ; edited , with Mr.
Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr.	PERSON	, `` The American Law Review , '' and about
1875	DATE	was admitted to the
New York	LOCATION	bar .

		He practised his profession in
New York	LOCATION	until
1881	DATE	, but the inclination to literary pursuits seems to have drawn him more and more from the dry technicalities of the law .

		He joined the editorial staff of '' The Nation '' and '' The Evening Post , '' and contributed to other journals as well .

		A course of
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	lectures on law was delivered by him in 1885-6 , and he was
Godkin Lecturer	PERSON	at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1909	DATE	.

		With Mr.
F. S. Wait	PERSON	he produced a work on land titles , also wrote `` Elements of Damages , '' edited the fifth edition of his father 's '' Measure of Dam - ages , '' assisted in editing the eighth edition of the same treatise , and was one of the authors of '' Essays on the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		But what he gave to the world as a writer can not be taken as an adequate measure of his abil - ity in letters .

		His personality stood for far more than his writings .

		Original and uncon - ventional in his habit of mind , he appears , especially in view of his sad end , as one some - what too keenly conscious of the ironies of life , too acutely appreciative of the cruel joke played upon man at the moment of his birth .

		NOVELTIES IN LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION , some of them merely experimental and short-lived , and others having the qualities of perma - nence , come from time to time to the attention of him who is interested in the never-ceasing evolution of `` the people 's university '' if one may be allowed still to use the hackneyed and often ridiculed but nevertheless servicea - ble and appropriate Carlylism .

		One of the latest of these innovations is described by Dr.
Bostwick	PERSON	in his current annual report of the
St. Louis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the instal - lation of a public writing room , for corre - spondence and similar purposes , first in a small upper room designed for study , and then , as the new department gained in popu - larity , in larger quarters originally designed for the storage of pamphlets , but affording unused space enough for four writing tables accommodating twenty-four persons .

		Pens , ink , and inexpensive stationery are supplied without charge , while a better quality of paper and envelopes , as well as postage stamps and illustrated library postcards , may be pur - chased at cost .

		Furthermore , the attendant in charge `` takes dictation , does typewriting and notarial work , and receives orders for translations from foreign languages , at cur - rent rates . ''

		Thus the department is made self-supporting , and the public convenience is served .

		It is true that many libraries have long made a practice of furnishing , in a more or less irregular and haphazard fashion , similar accommodation on request ; but an organized and equipped secretarial depart - ment is something of recent origin .

		A word of praise must not be omitted for the rather unusual art features of Dr.
Bostwick	PERSON	's report , all contributed by the
St. Louis School of Fine Arts	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- connected with
Washington	LOCATION	Uni - versity -RRB- and comprising a colored frontis - piece and numerous sketches and designs in black-and-white .

		Nor are there lacking still other features of notable interest in this record of a year 's library work .

		* STEVENSON AT SARANAC sought , not very successfully , physical reinvigoration , and won , with less of premeditated design , a considera - ble fraction of his present renown as a writer .

		It was here that in the winter of 1887-8 he produced most of those admirable essays that made their first appearance in print in '' Scribner 's Magazine '' during the ensuing year , and that include such favorites as '' The Lantern-Bearers , '' `` A Christmas Sermon , '' '' Pulvis et Umbra , '' '' Beggars , '' '' Gentlemen , '' and `` A Chapter on Dreams . ''

		Here too he conceived the plot and structure of his novel , '' The Master of
Ballantrae	LOCATION	'' ; and what else of ferment and germination took place in his mind as he walked about the secluded ham - let on the lake , who shall attempt to say ?

		Memorable enough , at any rate , is the fact of his sojourn in that retired nook of the
Adiron	PERSON	- dacks to warrant the erection there of some statue , urn , tablet , bust , or other worthy memento in his name ; and therefore the
Saranac Lake Stevenson Memorial Committee	ORGANIZATION	has been formed to accomplish this end .

		The noted sculptor , Mr.
Gutzon Borglum	PERSON	, has enthusiastically entered into the plan , and will design the proposed memorial as a labor of love , it is announced .

		Popular subscription is invited for meeting the necessary expenses of the undertaking , and contributions may be sent to Dr.
Lawrason Brown	PERSON	, chairman of the committee , at
Saranac Lake	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		THE DEATH OF A DICTIONARY-MAKER WOuld ordinarily attract little attention even in the world of letters ; for dictionary-makers are , as a class , as obscure as their work is useful .

		In the death of Sir
James A. H. Murray	PERSON	, however , at
Oxford	LOCATION	,
July 27	DATE	, the learned labors of a distinguished philologist at the head of the
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 89 most important lexicographical work ever un - dertaken in our language are brought to a premature close .

		It had been his hope to finish before he reached the age of eighty the great `` New English Dictionary / ' commonly known as the
Oxford Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, on which he had been engaged since
1888	DATE	; but with the final volume still in preparation he died at his post two years before the time set for the writing of '' Finis '' after the last entry under the letter Z. Dr.
Murray	PERSON	, as he was known to the world until he became a knight in
1908	DATE	, was born in
1837	DATE	at the little town of Den - holm , Roxburghshire ; received his academic training at
London University	ORGANIZATION	and afterward at
Balliol College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	; and subsequently was the recipient of honorary degrees in gen - erous number and variety from various seats of learning .

		His published writings have been almost wholly of a philological character , and are chiefly scattered through the publications of learned societies devoted to his chosen branches of research .

		But his great work is , of course , the dictionary so ably planned and edited by him with the help of thirty assistant editors for the sorting of the mountains of material submitted by more than fifteen hun - dred co-workers engaged in the vast amount of reading required in such an enterprise .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, with his six amanuenses , would in a whole lifetime have made but little headway on so vast a work .

		Happily , the successful termination of
Murray	ORGANIZATION	's magnum opus is as - sured by the zeal and ability of his editorial staff and the stability and resources of the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		HAROLD
SKIMPOLE	PERSON	ONCE MORE comes to our attention in a hitherto unpublished letter which Mr.
Clement K. Shorter	PERSON	tells us , in '' The Sphere , '' he recently had the good for - tune to acquire , and which he prints for the benefit of his readers .


Charles Dickens	PERSON	is the writer , and
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	his correspondent , the date of the missive being
June 23 , 1859	DATE	, seven years after the perpetration of the notorious caricature to which the first paragraph of the brief letter so lightly refers .

		That paragraph is as follows : `` Believe me , I have not for - gotten that matter ; nor will I forget it .

		To alter the book itself , or to make any reference in the preface of the book itself , would be to revive a forgotten absurdity , and to establish the very association that is to be denied and discarded . ''

		And yet the world will never deny or discard the association ; and how
Dickens	PERSON	himself felt about it at an earlier date , when the ink was scarcely dry on the pen that drew the distorted portrait , appears un - mistakably in a private letter reproduced by Mr.
Shorter	PERSON	.

		Unremorsefully , self-compla - cently even ,
Dickens	PERSON	writes to Mrs.
Richard Watson	PERSON	of Rockingham Castle : ''
Skimpole	PERSON	I must not forget
Skimpole	PERSON	of whom I will proceed to speak as if I had only read him and not written him .

		I suppose he is the most exact portrait that was ever painted in words !

		I have very seldom , if ever , done such a thing .

		But the likeness is astonishing .

		I do n't think it could possibly be more like himself .

		It is so awfully true that I make a bargain with myself ' never to do so any more . '

		There is not an atom of exaggeration or sup - pression .

		It is an absolute reproduction of a real man .

		Of course , I have been careful to keep the outward figure away from the fact ; but in all else it is the life itself . ''

		Here evi - dently was an instance where the writer should have prayed to be protected from his own excess of cleverness .

		Significant , in this con - nection , is the invariably cordial and admir - ing mention of '' my friend
Charles Dickens	PERSON	'' which occurs in Leigh Hunt 's autobiography .

		THE DANA CENTENNIAL , the hundredth re - currence of the day -LRB-
August 1	DATE	-RRB- on which was born the author of `` Two Years before the
Mast	LOCATION	, '' has passed with some appreciative mention , here and there , of the early devel - oped talent of the young man who at nineteen , for his health 's sake , shipped as a common sailor for the voyage round the Horn , and at twenty-five published , in what has proved one of the best and most popular books of its kind , a detailed account of this seafaring experience .

		It is his one and sufficient claim to literary immortality ; for neither his later volume , `` The Seamen 's Friend , '' nor his edition of
Wheaton	PERSON	's '' International Law , '' nor anything else from his pen , is ever mentioned in the same breath with his early masterpiece , which was in very truth `` a voice from the fore - castle , '' presenting `` the life of a common sailor at sea as it really is - the light and the dark together . ''

		This booky which has been reprinted no one knows how many times , and which only two or three years ago reappeared in two simultaneous and rather elaborate edi - tions , was sold to its first publishers for
$ 250	MONEY	, but brought considerably more to its author from its conscientious English re-publisher .

		Indeed , its success in
England	LOCATION	among persons of note in literature was most ` gratifying .

		Formal celebration of
Dana	ORGANIZATION	's centennial will be held , somewhat belatedly , under the aus - pices of the Historical Society of his native town ,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, on the 27th of
October	DATE	, with Mr.
Joseph H. Choate	PERSON	, Professor Bliss 90 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15 Perry	DATE	, and others as speakers , and
Bishop Lawrence	PERSON	as presiding officer .

		About the same time there will be an exhibition of
Dana	PERSON	relies in
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	's new library .

		A NATIONAL HOME FOR THE PUBLISHING AND BOOKSELLING ARTS AND CRAFTS WOUld meet a need that must have been at least vaguely felt for a long time by those engaged in the manu - facture and sale of our large and increasing annual product of reading matter of the more respectable sorts .

		Such a permanent home , like that so successfully maintained in
Leipzig	LOCATION	by the German book-trade , seems bound to come in the not distant future ; and its com - ing has been hastened , it is to be hoped , by the recent able plea for its establishment in `` The Publishers ' Weekly , '' from the pen of Mr.
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	, who would have in the proposed building headquarters for the Authors ' League , the Booksellers ' League , the Publishers ' Co-operative Bureau , the Amer - ican
Booksellers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	, and other simi - lar organizations .

		Here , too , the recently started Booksellers ' School would have its abode , and here would be maintained a bureau of information for all interested in books and their production , with a competent superintendent at its head .

		As Mr.
Huebsch	PERSON	explains his plan , '' the building would be an exchange ; all of the agencies engaged in the production and distribution of books , pic - tures , and music would co-operate , preserving their present identity and autonomy , but act - ing as a whole when a temporary union seemed desirable . ''

		Further practical details are added , so that the whole scheme is made to appear entirely feasible as well as highly desirable ; and the home itself , delightful in anticipatory contemplation , is to be architec - turally worthy of its high purpose .

		THE VIGOR OF RUSTIC SPEECH , such speech as those may hear who spend their
summer	DATE	vaca - tion in the far backwoods and among the mountains , lies largely in the clinging to old forms and idioms that date back perhaps to rugged sixteenth-century days , or even earlier , and have survived the wear and tear of the intervening centuries only by virtue of an exceptional geographical remoteness from the centres of progress and the abodes of unrest .

		It is in such rural retreats that one still hears the good , mouth-filling possessive pronouns , liisn and
Kern	PERSON	, yourn and ourn and theirn , as logically formed as thine and mine , though no longer countenanced in polite society or in literature .

		There , too , a healthy preference for strong preterites lingers , and is responsi - ble for the diction of the small boy who tells how he '' clum '' up a tree , or '' whup '' his schoolmate , or '' fotch '' the doctor to minister to grandpa 's '' rheumatiz . ''

		In the current ''
Harper	PERSON	's Monthly '' is published an interest - ing account of linguistic and other usages in ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's
America	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
William Aspenwall Bradley	PERSON	.

		By ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Amer - ica '' is meant the secluded region of the
Cumberland Mountains	LOCATION	where speech and cus - tom have suffered little modification from the changing fashions of the world at large .

		There , for example , present participles enjoy all the rights and privileges of adjectives , including the ability to express degrees of comparison by adding the regular endings .

		Mrs.
Jones	PERSON	may be the `` talkingest '' woman in town , or
Lucy Lindsay	PERSON	the '' smilingest '' girl ever seen .

		One
Cumberland Mountain	LOCATION	matron was being complimented on her skill in knitting as she followed the rough country roads or climbed the steep trails . ''

		Oh .

		that 's nothin ' ! ''

		she exclaimed , deprecatingly . ''

		Now ther 's
Aunt Mandy	PERSON	.

		She 's the knittingest woman ever I saw .

		She takes her yarn to bed with her ever ' night , and ever ' now and then she throws out a sock . ''

		JAPAN 'S ANNUAL BOOK-TRADE is increasing , as a writer in '' The
Japan	LOCATION	Times '' notes with satisfaction , though he is pained to observe the subordinate place it still holds in com - merce when compared w r ith the traffic in alco - holic beverages of various sorts ; and he casts an eye of envy upon the much larger sale of reading matter that this country can boast larger per capita as well as in the total .

		Books of all sorts , except school textbooks , have a yearly sale in
Japan	LOCATION	amounting to about
three million yen	MONEY	, or half as many dollars ; maga - zines show an equal circulation ; elementary schoolbooks are in demand to the extent of
two million three hundred thousand yen	MONEY	; and textbooks for the intermediate schools call for an annual outlay of about half as much .

		What the high schools and colleges have to say in regard to textbook-purchase is not recorded by the '' Times . ''

		This yearly disbursement of almost
ten million yen	MONEY	for literature is credita - ble , though we must remember that
Japan	LOCATION	's population is fifty-six millions , so that an average of only fifteen sen is spent annually on reading matter by the Japanese man , woman , or child .


Seven cents	MONEY	a year will not buy much of a library .

		LEXICOGRAPHY IN WAR AND PEACE continues sedately to pursue its appointed course .

		In - deed , it is in times of war more than in years of peace that lexicographical industry should be in requisition .

		Language is never more
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 91 briskly in the making than during such times as these , as every newspaper reader has abun - dant cause to know .

		And so we cease to wonder that the makers of the great
Oxford Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	allow themselves no vacation on account of current conditions in
Europe	LOCATION	, and we read without surprise in the
Paris	LOCATION	`` Figaro '' that `` the French Academy de - voted yesterday 's session to its work on the French Dictionary '' a work that has gone on , with little interruption , for nearly three centuries , while empires rose and fell and dynasties succeeded one another , and will con - tinue to go on as long as there shall be a French nation and a French language .

		Ger - man armies may come and go , may surge to the gates of
Paris	LOCATION	and roll back again ; but the French Dictionary goes on forever .

		THE INDUCTION OF CHILDREN INTO BOOKLAND calls for tact and skill , and often for inex - haustible patience and an abundant store of kindliness .

		It was fourteen years ago that the art and science of this branch of modern librarianship received full recognition in the establishment of a training school for chil - dren 's librarians at the
Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh	LOCATION	, this school being the outgrowth of a training class formed the year before for the preparation of young women to serve in the juvenile department of that library .

		It is supported by an endowment fund given by Mr.
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	, and in its plan and purpose it has had many imitators on a smaller scale , chiefly in the form of training classes connected with public libraries or library schools .

		The
Pittsburgh	LOCATION	school enjoys the advantage of an immediate environment em - bracing juvenile representatives of almost every European nationality , and there are eight branch libraries as well as the central library for the active prosecution of this kind of work among the children of the city .

		Thus is furnished a vast laboratory for purposes of practice , and it is not surprising to learn that the school attracts pupils from far beyond the borders of its own community .

		A full account of its w r ork is given in the '' Circular of
Infor	ORGANIZATION	- mation '' which it issues in this its fifteenth year ... THE UNIVERSITY OF TSINGTAU has only a prospective existence at present , but if the plans of prominent Japanese educators , aided by certain men of wealth in both
Japan	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	, and with the support of leading schol - ars in the two countries , are carried out , we shall ere long see the tenets of Confucianism taught where not long before the principles of Teutonic militarism were undergoing demon - stration .

		It is urged by the promoters of this laudable enterprise that as Shantung is the native province of the great Chinese philoso - pher , it is eminently fitting that it should have a university devoted to the study of Confu - cianism and of the Chinese classics in general .

		Count
Okuma	ORGANIZATION	is said to favor the plan , and such a noted scholar as Dr.
Unokichi Hattori	PERSON	, who is to lecture at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	next term , is also interested .

		Among other signs of a sort of re - vival of learning in this part of the far East , there is remarked a quickening of interest in current philosophic thought .

		Sir
Rabin	PERSON	- dranath
Tagore	PERSON	, the Hindu poet and philoso - pher who has already won many disciples and admirers in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, is expected to visit
Japan	LOCATION	in
October	DATE	and expound the principles of his philosophy .

		In fact , an im - pulse that might be called a Tagore movement is now said to be manifest in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Such signs of intellectual activity are more than welcome in days like these .

		BOOK-COLLECTING WHILE YOU WAIT is prom - ised on the most reasonable terms and with the utmost promptness by a certain western firm which wishes it to be known that '' every book in any language , new or old , published either in this country or abroad , may be obtained through us at a moderate price '' a joyful bit of news , surely , for all collectors not in the multimillionaire class .

		Furthermore : `` We know no such word as fail !

		Nearly every man of intelligence wants some book which he can not find .

		We make it our busi - ness to hunt up such books and get you any book printed anywhere at any time .

		The longer you have looked for the same without success , the better it will suit us , as you will be all the more pleased with our services .

		We have filled thousands of orders for books which could not have been supplied by ordi - nary booksellers .

		Sometimes it may take months to trace a book which is ' out of print / but we emphatically wish to state to the book - buying public that it would be a waste of time to ask if we can furnish a certain book .

		Send your money -LRB- or if price is unknown ,
$ 1.00	MONEY	to
$ 2.00	MONEY	on account -RRB- and the book will be for - warded to your address , or if not in stock , ordered for you , otherwise the amount paid will be returned . ''

		What a chance to secure , '' at a moderate price , ''
John Eliot	PERSON	's Indian Bible , for example , or a first folio Shakespeare !

		THE
LONGFELLOW HOUSE	ORGANIZATION	, otherwise known as the

		Another daughter ,

		BEYANT AND '' THE NEW POETKY . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor o THE DIAL . -RRB-

		What constitutes the perishable and what the imperishable element or elements in poetry ?

		The question is perennial .

		It has been asked and answered innumerable times , but still it confronts the poetry lover ; who , howsoever much light he may seek or find upon the subject , is always , in the end , obliged to answer it anew for himself .

		That is , if he be truly a poetry lover .

		If his love for it is mere lip-service , it is quite otherwise , for then the anthologists and the appreciators are at his elbow to settle the matter for him without further ado .

		.

		Nowadays , it must be allowed , there is a multi - tude of counsellors , and those disinclined to think or to feel , to weigh or to ponder , are blessed with an infinitude of opportunities for having such things done for them , the results of these opera - tions being dealt out on demand , by the yard or by the pound , and served over the counter as is any other merchandisable commodity .

		Some of them , too , are very attractively done up ; and while the contents of the carton may not invariably be all that the label incites the purchaser to suppose , it is an old story that predigested pabulum is not intended for hearty appetites .

		Moreover , expecta - tion and fulfilment never have been and never will be any more necessarily synonymous in a literary than in any other sense .

		Some such thoughts as these came unsummoned to my mind one evening not long ago when it was my privilege to hear the '' what 's what '' of poetry expounded by no less an authority than Miss Har - riet
Monroe	PERSON	.

		She was addressing a large assem - blage of presumed poetry-lovers , and was speaking upon a variety of verse in which , presumably , their interest , like her own , was intense namely , '' The New Poetry . ''

		Her expression of opinion was , therefore , devoid of dissembling or weak con - cession .

		Perhaps , though , the term '' expression of opinion '' is inadequate as applied to her re - marks , for they were rather a statement of doe - trine , a promulgation of law , than a mere outline of idea or theory .

		Miss
Monroe	PERSON	stated , without hesitation , that the '' new poetry movement '' in
America	LOCATION	was the most important thing in the literary world to * - day ; and that this so-momentous '' movement '' had originated in the sanctum of her magazinelet , '' Poetry . ''

		I gathered that , something as Dr.
Franklin	PERSON	, upon a celebrated occasion , sent up a kite and brought down the lightning among an astounded populace ,
Miss Monroe	PERSON	sent up '' Poetry '' and brought down '' the new poetry . ''

		Apparently , also ; her experiment was fully as elec - trical as that of the Doctor .

		For later in the eve - ning , when one of the stars in the '' new poetry 's '' firmament , Mr.
Carl Sandberg	PERSON	, delivered two origi - nal poems , entitled , respectively , ''
Bobby Burns	PERSON	'' and ''
Billy Sunday	PERSON	, '' the thrills which his recita - tion or , to speak more correctly , reading pro- duced far exceeded many that I have seen evoked by the application of the galvanic battery .

		Miss
Monroe	PERSON	was also kind enough to throw some explicit and , so-to-speak , ex-officio illumina - tion upon the newness which is the distinguishing trait of '' the new poetry . ''

		Incidentally , of course , she found it expedient to animadvert upon the old - ness of other poetry .

		In doing so again of course it was necessary to exhibit a
Horrible Example	ORGANIZATION	, and the one that she selected was
William Cullen Bryant	PERSON	.

		I can not pretend to recall more than the drift , the purport , of Miss
Monroe	PERSON	's references to
Bryant	PERSON	, but among other things that she said were these : That she had spent a considerable portion of that very day in re-reading
Bryant	PERSON	, and , with his best work thus fresh in mind , she felt compelled to state that , of his entire copious poetical output , there were only two pieces which '' would live . ''

		These pieces , she said , were '' Thanatopsis '' and '' To a Water-fowl . ''

		But she qualified this fiat by adding that the '' Water - fowl '' was '' doubtful , '' as in certain respects it was '' very faulty . ''

		But , at any rate , these were the only two poems of
Bryant	PERSON	's , she declared , that , under any circumstances , she would think of ac - cepting for publication in '' Poetry , '' were they contemporaneously composed and offered to her for that purpose .

		It was quite like the '' Off-with-his-head-so - much-for-Buckingham '' line that
Colley Gibber	PERSON	, they say , wrote into ''
Richard III.	PERSON	, '' and more than a few of Miss
Monroe	PERSON	's hearers turned to each other with subdued oh 's and ah 's .

		But they felt conscious that , while perhaps participating in something almost sacrilegious , from the poetical point of view , they had been `` in at the death , '' just the same ; also that , in the language of the street , they were being '' put wise to the real thing . ''

		And many fair hands were clapped in applause by ladies present of whom , I have an idea , more than a few , in times it would be impo - lite to say how long past , had recited from the rostrum '' The Death of the Flowers '' as typical of what they then considered most beautiful and most moving in American verse .


Bryant	PERSON	, then , is poetically '' a dead one . ''

		Miss
Monroe	PERSON	bas said so , and
Miss Monroe	PERSON	knows .

		She
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 93 spoke in behalf of Time , and with an accent that betrayed her intimate familiarity with that hoary functionary .

		But the only trouble was that she did not go far enough .

		For instance , I at least would have felt grateful if she had singled out those poems , let us say , of Mr.
Sandberg	PERSON	's , which '' would live . ''

		Or , for that matter , any others which have appeared in '' Poetry '' to date .

		I have read it pretty regularly , and my uncertainty re - garding such items is so utter that a little enlight - enment from Miss
Monroe	PERSON	would have been to me as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land .

		While , just as Baudelaire invented decadence , Mallarme symbolism ,
Poe	PERSON	the grotesque and ara - besque , and Hugo romanticism , '' the new poetry '' was invented in the sanctum of '' Poetry , '' as Miss
Monroe	PERSON	unequivocally declared , she did at least by inference assert that the patron saint of the '' movement '' was
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, that if any one '' great influence '' was the springboard from which its practitioners took their flying leap into the poetical empyrean , it was that of Walt .

		This being so , it occurred to me to turn to what Walt had said of
Bryant	PERSON	for I remembered , although I could not recall its precise phrasing , that it was not at all like what Miss
Monroe	PERSON	had said .

		I find it to be as follows -LRB- see '' Specimen Days '' : '' My Tribute to Four Poets '' -RRB- : '' In a late magazine one of my reviewers , who ought to know better , speaks of my ' attitude of contempt and scorn and intolerance ' toward leading poets of my ' deriding ' them , and preaching their ' uselessness . '

		If anybody cares to know what I think and have long thought and avow 'd about them , I am entirely willing to propound ...
Bryant	PERSON	pulsing the first interior verse-throbs of a mighty world bard of the river and wood , ever conveying a taste of open air , with scents as from hayfields , grapes , birch-borders always lurkingly fond of threnodies beginning and ending his long career with chants of death , with here and there through all , poems or passages of poems , touching the highest universal truths , enthusiasms , duties morals as grim and eternal ; if not as stormy and fateful , as anything in ^ Eschylus . ''

		Such was Whitman 's tribute to
Bryant	PERSON	.

		It does not strikingly resemble that of the editress of '' Poetry '' ; but , somehow , it seems to come nearer '' touching the highest universal truths , enthusi - asms , duties '' of poetry .

		To me , I must also confess , the selection of
Bryant	PERSON	as a Horrible Example by propagandists of the '' new poetry '' is singularly ill-judged .

		For is it not both illogical and unjust that an exponent of rers libre and allied affairs should '' knock '' a poet who , generations before most '' new poets '' were born , himself wrote : '' No smooth array of phrase , Artfully sought and ordered though it be , Which the cold rhymer lays Upon his page with languid industry .

		Can wake the listless pulse to livelier speed , Or fill with sudden tears the eyes that read . ''

		The secret wouldst thou know To touch the heart or fire the blood at will ?

		Let thine own eyes o'erflow ; Let thy lips quiver with the passionate thrill ; Seize the great thought , ere yet its pewer be past , And bind , in words , the fleet emotion fast . ''

		Then , should thy verse appear Halting and harsh , and all unaptly wrought , Touch the crude line with fear , Save in the moment of impassioned thought ; Then summon back the original glow , and mend The strain with rapture that with fire was penned . ''

		Still , I think
Miss Monroe	PERSON	was entirely correct when she declared the unfitness of
Bryant	PERSON	's poetry for her publication .

		As
Walt	PERSON	says , it '' ever con - veys a taste of the open air '' and if there is anything that the verse printed in '' Poetry '' does not convey , it is precisely that quality . ''

		The new poetry '' is , manifestly , manufactured in sanctums , as was the '' movement '' that it features .

		Hence , the thought of anything of
Bryant	ORGANIZATION	's in the pages of '' Poetry '' is indeed impossible .

		And , by the way , what , oh , what , do you suppose Walt would have thought of Miss
Monroe	PERSON	's magazine if he had lived to see it ?

Chicago	LOCATION	,
July 27 , 1915	DATE	.

		EESULTS OF THE
WISCONSIN	LOCATION	SURVEY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The words `` once more '' in the title given by you to Dean
Comstock	PERSON	's letter in your issue of
July 15	DATE	, '' The Wisconsin Survey Once More , '' recall how quickly even students tire of controversy over things that can be settled .

		It is on this fact that the
University	ORGANIZATION	counted from the first .

		For a time it wavered between the policy adopted by the normal schools , that is , ad - mitting the truth and proceeding to correct defects , and the other policy of standing pat , denying everything , and diverting attention from defects of the
University	ORGANIZATION	to personalities of surveyors .

		When a dean of a graduate school of a university with international reputation makes a statement , readers of THE DIAL naturally expect that this statement is truthful as well as scholarly .

		Dean
Comstock	PERSON	writes that the
State Board of Public Affairs	ORGANIZATION	failed to adopt the report of survey investi - gators , wrote a report of different tenor , and sub - stantially repudiated the Survey findings .

		Casual examination will show that the conclusion is con - trary to fact .

		The
State Board	ORGANIZATION	agreed with the Survey in all but three of the matters touched upon by both the Survey and the
State Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		It dis - agreed on trifling matters only : -LRB- 1 -RRB- substitution of state pensions for
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	pensions ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- sub - stitution of Madison-owned for University-owned high school ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- substitution of optional for com - pulsory military drill .

		In other matters the
State Board	ORGANIZATION	supported the Survey , inter alia : 1 .

		Research is unsupervised and needs to be supervised , p. 12 .

		2 .

		Social sciences have not grown with the Uni - versity , p. 14 .

		3 .

		More practical field work is needed , p. 14 .

		4 .

		Supervision of instructors is inadequate and needs to include class-room visiting , p. 16 .

		5 .

		Student adviser system not as effective as it might be and needs strengthening , p. 17 .

		6 .

		Junior colleges are needed and are practical .

		p. 28 .

		7 .

		University should discontinue high school in - spection for purposes of accrediting and should 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	continue it for the sole purpose -LRB- the board said -RRB- of improving the quality of instruction in the subjects each community decides to place in its high school .

		p. 31 .

		8 .

		Regular courses leading to graduation and degrees without foreign language requirements should be established , p. 32 .

		9 .

		Students have too little contact with the older and stronger men on the faculty , p. 32 .

		10 .

		Further attention to organization and admin - istration of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	high school is needed , p. 33 .

		11 .

		Only such small classes should be continued as are fully justified upon investigation , p. 34 .

		12 .

		Better organization and more systematic management of the Extension Division are needed and the instructional force should be strengthened .

		p. 36 .

		13 .

		The
University	ORGANIZATION	has failed to follow rigidly the legislative requirements in giving preference when allotting dormitory accommodations to stu - dents in this state , p. 62 .

		14 .

		A high percentage of non-use of certain class - rooms is shown , p. 62 .

		15 .

		Accounting system is not in accordance with modern business methods , pp. 124 , 126 .

		16 .

		Some few members of the faculty have taken unwarranted advantage of the opportunity offered them for outside work , and their service to the
University	ORGANIZATION	has been impaired through a division of their interest , p. 15 .

		Do these statements from the
State Board	ORGANIZATION	's report look like wholesale endorsement of the Uni - versity 's efficiency and like repudiation of fact reports showing in what particular places ineffi - ciency exists ?

		A similar discrepancy between fact and
Dean Comstock	ORGANIZATION	's report will be found at whatever point the reader cares to follow up Dean
Comstock	ORGANIZATION	's statement .

		The thesis which he says I wrongly referred to as plagiarized covers a ground that was incomparably better covered in a thesis submitted to the
University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	in
1876	DATE	.

		One chapter of it is taken almost verbatim from an English work , with the scant acknowledgment that the chapter is based upon that work .

		The fact that eastern schol - ars found the work satisfactory means absolutely nothing until the readers of THE DIAL know whether those scholars had seen the works upon which it was based and had critically read the thesis itself .

		If the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	professors who liked the thesis read it with no greater care than the
Wisconsin	LOCATION	professor who approved it their liking is meaningless .

		If they approved it after reading
Piggeoneau	ORGANIZATION	's thesis of
1876	DATE	and
Colvin	PERSON	's
Godfrey	PERSON	, so much the worse for
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	scholar - ship .

		If they approved it without reading these works , again so much the worse for
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	scholarship .

		The fact is that there is not one of these eight theses which a
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	professor would be willing to send to
Paris	LOCATION	,
Berlin	LOCATION	, or Oxford as a fair sample of American scholarship .

		The history of the thesis now admitted to be technically plagiarized is more sordid than any experience I had in ten years ' dealings with
Tam	PERSON	- many
Hall	PERSON	.

		Dean
Comstock	PERSON	first wrote a blanket denial : the thesis was admirable , absolutely origi - nal in a field entirely lacking in secondary sources .

		When these statements were proved to be untrue , he secondly wrote in the Survey report that only a small part of the thesis was plagiarized .

		Now he writes to THE DIAL that considerable portions were given without proper reference .

		The fact is , and he knows it and the president knows it and the two regents who compared this work with original sources know it , that the thesis was from cover to cover paste and scissors work taken from other sources with a brazenness that would cause the
University	ORGANIZATION	to drop a freshman .

		Is there not some reader of THE DIAL who is interested enough in the nation-wide aspects of this situation to make a personal inspection of this thesis and of the Galland thesis above referred to and of the other six theses ?

		If so , I will pay his board in
Madison	LOCATION	and all travelling expenses if he does not report that the Survey understated rather than overstated the scholarship deficiencies of these theses , provided that Dean
Comstock	PERSON	will pay for board and travelling expenses if such student reports that we overstated these deficiencies .

Wis.	LOCATION	,

		W ' H '
ALLEN	PERSON	- -LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The communication printed above , of which I have seen an advance proof , furnishes an excellent illustration of certain methods characteristic of the
Allen Survey	ORGANIZATION	.

		The incautious reader who is tempted to infer an official approval of the
Allen	PERSON	report from the sixteen to three comparison above made should turn to pp. 909-926 of the report cited .

		He will there find set forth , in all the pomp of serial numbers , 339 separate recommendations made by Mr.
Allen	PERSON	to the
State Board of Public Affairs	ORGANIZATION	.

		If we assume nineteen of these to be accounted for by Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's foregoing exposition of the case , shall we infer that the remaining 320 constitute the material to which reference is made in the Findings of the
Board of Public Affairs	ORGANIZATION	, under the heading , '' Conclusion '' p. 36 of the official volume ?

		This reference is as follows : `` Absence from this report of specific recommenda - tions relative to any matter commented upon by any investigator employed by this board is not to be construed as an endorsement of his views .

		In several particulars the

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Let me express my appreciation of the spirit of fairness you exhibit in printing simultaneously in your columns two such diverse views of the Uni - versity of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Survey as Dean
G. C. Corn	PERSON	- stock , of the
Graduate School of the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, and
Margaret A. Friend	PERSON	, of
Milwaukee	LOCATION	, present in your issue of
July 15	DATE	.

		I personally was one of the number who reported on doctors ' theses accepted and approved of by
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	.

		I was amazed at the triteness , the mediocrity , the superficiality , and the dishonesty of the work .

		The author of one of these theses dealt with ' the history of a great family dur - ing the time of the Crusades , as treated in a cycle of poems produced in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		The fol - lowing are some of the things that appeared in the course of my work : I .

		The author 's thesis served no purpose in the world of scholarship ; it was merely the duplica - tion of the work of a Trench scholar , who in
1876	DATE	presented a thesis on the same subject before
the University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	.

		The French scholar 's han - dling of the subject was infinitely more compre - hensive and incomparably more brilliant than that of the
Wisconsin	LOCATION	man .

		II .

		The
Wisconsin	LOCATION	man incorporated bodily into his thesis a section of an introduction to a prose work in English .

		This extract forms an in - tegral part of his thesis , constituting a whole chapter .

		It consisted of an historical sketch of the main character treated in his thesis .

		Dozens of accounts of the hero 's life were available , but this account happened to be of just the right length to serve as a chapter in his thesis .

		III .

		The whole of the thesis of 120 pages if we leave out the 20 blank pages that are numbered is merely a technical exercise to prove the author a linguistic virtuoso in three old Romance lan - guages : Old French , Old Spanish , and Old Italian .

		Seven of the nine texts used by the author were in Old French , only one text in Old Spanish and that in prose the thesis purported to be a '' Poetic History , '' and the other one in Old Ital - ian , of which a half dozen good translations exist .

		The two latter texts are treated only cursorily by the author .

		IV .

		Not a statement occurs in the last chapter of the thesis , termed '' Conclusion , '' that can not be found in the thesis of the French author written in
1876	DATE	.

		Many statements are translated verbatim without giving the French scholar credit .

		The style of the thesis does not yield a trace of bril - liancy ; and the observations , the conclusions , and in fact the whole , of the thesis fails to show a single gleam of originality .

		And this is the type of work that the great
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	accepts as an original contribution , and rewards the perpe - trator with the highest possible reward of scholar - ship , the degree of Doctor of Philosophy !

		Every statement made here can be readily sub - stantiated by detailed and concrete proof .

		When the borrowed and unaccredited sections were read aloud to two of the regents ,
Dean Comstock	PERSON	and the head of the department concerned , the regents were convinced of the validity of the criticisms .

		Later , in the final Survey report , I was surprised to discover that the '' lifted '' chapter above re - ferred to is called an '' annex '' to the thesis by the
University !	ORGANIZATION

		As late as
July 1 , 1915	DATE	, not a sign existed to show that the author regarded it as such .

		MR.
ALLEN	PERSON	AND THE
WISCONSIN	LOCATION	FACULTY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your issue of
July 15	DATE	is a letter signed Mar - garet A. Friend , defending Mr.
W. H. Allen	PERSON	's Sur - vey of
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its essential point is the following : ''
The University	ORGANIZATION	.

		.

		wanted a report .

		.

		as a few in authority wished it to be seen .

		It got a report as the six hundred faculty members saw it . ''

		Though Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's methods , purposes , stand - ards , and findings , as investigator , educator , and efficiency expert , have been extensively canvassed in the intellectual press of
America	LOCATION	notably in the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post , '' '' The Nation , '' and THE DIAL , `` the six hundred faculty members '' have heretofore expressed their opinion only in private .

		Thus your correspondent 's statement may well suggest to some readers a new and important aspect of the subject ; administrative tyranny , whether of president , deans , or board of trustees , over an oppressed and voiceless faculty has often been alleged and sometimes proved in the uni - versity world of
America	LOCATION	.

		Is Mr.
Allen	PERSON	, then , fight - ing for such '' six hundred faculty members '' at Madison ?

		No , and absolutely no .

		But it has become Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's policy to attempt to enlist , or to pretend to have enlisted , the faculty against the administration .

		A cardboard folder , dated
May 28 , 1915	DATE	, and signed by Mr.
Allen	PERSON	, enti - tled '' Open Letter to
Faculty Members of the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, '' begins thus : '' In your name a new glossary of vituperation is being cre - ated ; ` academic freedom ' at
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	is being so defined as to prohibit free and impersonal consideration of opportunities for increasing efficiency , '' etc. .

		The whole lengthy docu - ment is a masterpiece of folly , and was so ad - judged , I fancy , by every one of '' the six hundred '' who took time from better things to peruse it .

		All '' the six hundred '' filled out the elaborate questionnaires on which a part of Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's report was subsequently based , only to find their evidence in many cases misunderstood or curiously manipulated .

		Later , a large number of those '' six hundred '' directly cooperated , by written memo - randa or by oral conference , in furnishing the materials from which was made up that scholarly , keen-witted , and high-minded rejoinder , the appen - dix entitled '' Comment by
Committee of , University Faculty	ORGANIZATION	upon Report of Investigators . ''

		Note , in - deed , the significant words , '' Committee of Uni - versity Faculty '' not Miss Friend 's '' few in authority . ''

		Moreover , the present writer , through many months of pretty wide contact and conversation , has not heard from a single colleague one word of 96 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	defence or even of apology for Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's work .

		Whatever useful details of criticism may be found here and there in its voluminous pages , as a whole Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's report , while certainly an attack upon '' the few in authority , '' is still more certainly an attack upon the entire faculty .

		But it is chiefly an attack upon university ideals and the yet broader principles of candor , justice , and intelligence .

		The above statement has been read to a repre - sentative group of university colleagues ; they unite in the hope that THE DIAL may give it the fullest publicity .

		EDITOR . -RSB-

		AN IMAGIST TO THE DEFENCE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		My attention has been drawn to an article in your issue of
June 24	DATE	, entitled '' Recent Poetry . ''

		The author of this review takes exception to the preface of my book of verse , '' Irradiations . ''

		As he has taken the trouble , in a series of dogmatic statements , to deny about everything I wrote in that preface , surely it is only fair to me to permit me to undogmatically defend myself .

		Let the pub - lic be the judge between us .

		First of all , Mr.
Alden	PERSON	assumes that in my preface to '' Irradiations '' I was speaking of the theories of the Imagists as a group .

		Surely he should have known that I was doing nothing of the sort .

		The preface to '' Some Imagist Poets '' contains all that the Imagists desire to hazard concerning themselves collectively .

		The preface to '' Irradiations '' is purely a personal utterance .

		Mr.
Alden	PERSON	next says that the art of poetry in English-speaking countries is not in a greatly back - ward state .

		That is a question of Mr.
Alden	PERSON	's taste or rather , of the scope of his reading , about which he tells us nothing . ''

		Poets have not attempted to make of their craft a Masonic secret , declaring that rhythm is not to be analyzed . ''

		Apparently , then , many English poets have written technical treatises on rhythm !

		Yet I know of only three who have tackled this subject :
Poe	PERSON	,
Lanier	PERSON	, and
Robert Bridges	ORGANIZATION	.

		If Mr.
Alden	PERSON	knows of more , he should enlighten my ignorance . ''

		It is not true that each line of a poem repre - sents a single breath . ''

		Then what does it repre - sent ?

		Why should there be any rhythmical unit at all , if the breath of the bard or reciter is not to be taken into account ? ''

		Every poet of eminence has not felt the fatigu - ing monotony of regular rhyme . ''

		It depends on how you class eminence .

		Milton says Satan was raised '' to that bad eminence . '' ''

		Shakespeare did not abandon rhyme in his maturer period -LRB- that is , in lyrical verse -RRB- . ''

		Does Mr.
Alden	PERSON	seriously suppose that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, when he was writing '' The Tempest , '' said to him - self : '' Go to !

		this is sung by
Ariel	LOCATION	; I must write lyrical verse , and lyrical verse must rhyme '' ; and later : '' Hold !

		this is spoken by
Prospero	LOCATION	; hence it is not lyrical and must be in blank verse '' ?

		Does Mr.
Alden	PERSON	suppose this ?

		I have a problem , then , for his solution .

		Which is more lyrical ,
Ariel	ORGANIZATION	's `` Ding dong bell '' or
Prospero	PERSON	's `` Leave not a rack behind '' ?

GOULD FLETCHER	ORGANIZATION	.

		Bay View ,
Mich.	LOCATION	,
July 27 , 1915	DATE	.

		-LSB- I am glad to see some further discussion by Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	of the matters touched on in his Preface , and should also enjoy pursuing the subject of two or three of them ; but it is clear that this can not be done , except with more of assertion than proof , in the incidental space appropriate to the discussion of my review .

		A note or two of explanation may be added .

		It is quite true that the question whether the art of English poetry is in a greatly backward state is largely one of taste and judgment .

		I can only say , therefore , that my own impres - sion is shared by all the competent judges with whom I am acquainted , to the effect that the past few years have shown a marked and growing revival of poetry as a vital expression of contemporary thought in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, and that an encouraging amount of decidedly creditable verse is finding both pub - lication and sale .

		Perhaps I may claim some liberality in adding that I find evidence of the same thing even in the `` new poetry , '' which I do not greatly admire , since it implies that an increasing number of persons , including some with no great rhythmical endowment , are turning to poetry as a means of sincere and serious expression .

		If in saying that '' poets have attempted to make of their craft a Masonic secret . ''

		Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	meant only that they have not writ - ten many treatises on versification , I shall not press my denial .

		But I know of none who have not welcomed opportunities to discuss the subject and to give hints to younger men regarding their understanding of the rhyth - mical art .

		This is particularly true of two such great progressive metrists as
Coleridge	PERSON	and
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		I can not answer the question , What does each line of a poem represent if not a single breath ?

		except by saying that it represents an arbitrary art pattern , like a unit of decoration on a Greek pediment , or the pitch intervals in the tempered scale .

		Various eccentric theo - ries have been suggested , from time to time , connecting our rhythmic types with the breath , as in the effort to conjecture why one race prefers longer lines than another , or rhythm of fours rather than threes , and the like ; but no authority on prosody accepts any of these .

		But here let me ask , if we assume that each line of verse does represent a breath ,
1915	DATE	THE DIAL 97 is not the art of vers libre alarmingly unhy - gienic , in tending to develop such irregular breathing as it implies ?

		Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	appears to have understood me to say that Shakespeare never used un - rhymed verse for lyrical passages .

		I should be very far from making such a statement , or even from undertaking to answer the difficult question just what a lyrical passage is .

		The matter concerned was Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's state - ment that in his maturer period Shakespeare abandoned rhyme .

		Now the only change which is known to Shakespearean criticism , in the poet 's use of rhyme , is his dropping of the early fashion of using it in dramatic speech .

		His later plays are peculiarly rich in rhymed lyrics , and there is not the slightest evidence that he ever wearied of rhyme for ordinary lyrical purposes .

		Neither , so far as I know , has any eminent English poet save one
Milton	PERSON	given evidence of a distaste for regular rhyme in his maturer years .

		It is harmless for any private person to dislike regu - lar rhyme and to abandon it , and quite un - necessary that he should twist metrical theory and history in his defence .

		THE REVIEWER . -RSB-

		THE AUTHOR OF '' PONTEACH . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have read with much interest the review by Mr.
William B. Cairns	PERSON	, in your issue of
July 15	DATE	, of the reprint of '' Ponteach , '' edited by Mr.
Allan Nevins	PERSON	and published by the
Caxton Club of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago .

		Of the author of '' Ponteach , ''
Robert Rog	PERSON	- ers , a celebrated Ranger during the French and Indian War , Mr.
Cairns	PERSON	says : '' It is difficult to see how a man completely sunk in dissipation could have attained the self - culture which
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	shows . ''

		I am sure it would be a favor if Mr.
Cairns	PERSON	or somebody else would point out to the students of this period of our history any evidence to prove that
Rogers	PERSON	was a man of culture .

		It is at least my own opinion that
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	's '' Journals '' and his '' Concise Account '' were written by some hack writer in
London	LOCATION	, who secured his information from
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	or from Rog - ers 's note-books .

		Anyone who will take the trouble to consult the '' Documentary History of the State of
New York	LOCATION	, '' Vol .

		II. , p. 205 , etc. , will see from
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	's reports of his scouting expeditions as there printed , presumably from the originals , that he was so illiterate that he could not even spell his own name correctly at least not all the time , and some of the simplest words in the language were misspelled .


W. H. S.	PERSON
New York City	LOCATION	,
July 23 , 1915	DATE	.

		-LSB- As I wished to make plain in my review , my interest in '' Ponteach '' is in the literary values and relationships of the play , and on matters of historical and biographical research I speak purely as a layman .

		The journals of
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	's scouting expeditions in
1755	DATE	, to which your correspondent refers , seem to me to show neither more nor less of crudity than might be expected in the work of a man with
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	's lack of early training .

		This same ranger , whose orthography in
1755	DATE	so shocks your correspondent , was apparently able
ten years later	DATE	to impress favorably the social , official , and military circles of
London	LOCATION	, and to win , without money and in the face of strong American opposition , an important appoint - ment .

		He was also the author , or at the very least was believed by those who knew him to be the author , of two prose works and a verse drama which show some slight acquaintance with books as well as with life ; and his manu - script letters and journals of later date which I am able to examine in the library of the
State Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	are not in penmanship , wording , or even in spelling the work of a man who could be called illit - erate .

		This development indicates what I called `` self-culture , '' though I should not quarrel in defence of the term .

		My argu - ment was that it made against the contention that
Rogers	PERSON	was wholly given over to low vice .

		When I wrote I was not aware that the authorship of the '' Journals '' and the '' Con - cise Account '' was seriously questioned .

		I note that your correspondent , though he speaks without apparent hesitation of `` the author of ` Ponteach , '
Robert Rogers	PERSON	, '' ex - presses the opinion that
Rogers	PERSON	did not write the prose works named .

		Doubtless Mr.
Nev	PERSON	- ins would be glad , as I should , of any substan - tial evidence in support of this somewhat peculiar view .

		It would require more than the inconsistent spelling in the journals of
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	's scouting days to have much weight .

		THE REVIEWER . -RSB-

		AUTHORS AND KNIGHTHOOD .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It is not my place or desire to criticize , but as a regular reader of THE DIAL I feel constrained to utter a feeble protest against the tone of the edito - rial paragraph , '' Plumed Knights , '' in your issue of
July 15	DATE	.

		It seems trivial and foreign to your practice to decry any time-honored custom of any land , much less the one that holds first place in the production of the best in literature .

		While we in
America	LOCATION	may have but little regard for knighthood , should we not at least respect it as being an outward sign of the appreciation of a people , bestowed by royalty though it may be , for one who has done something worthy ?

		Since the authors of to-day accept this honor , we are not justified in belittling it , but should rather esteem it because of their acceptance .

		A BREVIARY FOR CRITICS .

		* Close upon the heels of Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	's criti - cal credo , recently reviewed in these pages , follows the manifesto of Mr.
George Edward Woodberry	PERSON	, who takes rank with Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	himself , Professor
Irving Babbitt	PERSON	, and Mr.
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	among the most conspicuous critics in
America	LOCATION	to-day .

		Like Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	, Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	combines a kindly attitude toward the later modes of impressionism and appreciation with an eager desire to hold fast to the best in the old magisterial conception .

		He weighs and sifts the historical method for its dross of death and its life-gold , and he passes on to a sober but hymnlike adoration of art in its immortality which is perhaps the most exalting prose of its special kind since
Shelley	PERSON	's `` Defence of Poetry . ''

		In his first essay , Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	reminds us of an alluring conception of criticism as re-creation , but sets such a definition aside for a space while he considers how far the his - torical critic may understand a work of art as it was in another nation and in a dim past without re-creating it and thereby inevitably adding to it the color of his own personality .

		Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	calls upon us to remember
Taine	PERSON	with admiration , but to make the large generalizations of the French critic more valid by putting against them the psychological crit - ic 's absorption in the individual -LRB- with a pass - ing frown at the modern habit for hounding out the abnormal as essential in genius -RRB- .

		A third group , '' a hybrid of the sociologists and the psychologists , '' has arisen to dwell on great personalities amidst a maze of influences from nations and epochs , making criticism `` an anatomy of texts . ''

		Criticism seems to draw '' ever further away from the work of art itself ; it leaves the matter of life , which art is , for the matter of knowledge . ''

		Should we not then take warning and accept after all the definition formulated by recent critics ?

		Can we re-create , however , and re-create '' the work of art as it was in the mind of the original artist '' ?

		To re-create not '' a vision of our own '' but the identical vision in the mind of the artist of the past is to enter the realms of history .

		Despite the universal qualities which we may readily perceive , there are '' local and temporal associations '' which require a most complete absorption to re-create in their integ - rity .

		In fact , you can not re-create from any point of view -LRB- for all the hopes of recent * Two PHASES OF CRITICISM , HISTORICAL AND .

		^ ESTHETIC .

George Edward Woodberry	PERSON	.

		impressionists -RRB- unless you pay some attention to the historical method . ''

		What , you will say , ' is not line the same beauty in a Greek or Japanese or Trench work ?

		has not color the same value ?

		is not the human eye the same the world over ? '

		Well , to begin with , the line is not the same , and it has different connota - tions ; and so , also , of the color ; and the human eye is as various as the soul that sees through it .

		Art is not like mathematics , something to be cast into identical formulas in every time and place ... It is not so simple as observing a sunset ; it is not merely to open your eyes and see ; you must first create the eye to see with . ''

		And when we remember further that not only is art '' a Protean play of personality in many places and ages '' but also that no one of us sees the same thing in the same way , historical criticism may seem at best `` only a doubtful resurrection of the soul that has passed away , a portrait , perhaps , but one in whose eyes and expression there is an unshared secret . ''

		Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	, however , warns us against growing lax in the great quest of the historical method , for it is the critic 's only hope of qualifying himself '' to undertake that purely aesthetic criticism '' by which he '' may at last become one with the soul of the artist and see his vision with the meaning and atmosphere it had to himself .

		So much of art is antique and foreign , so much of what is racially our own has become alien to my feelings and ideas by the grad - ual detachment of time , that I need an interpreter between me and this dead and dying world of the past , I need precisely the interpretation of knowl - edge that historical criticism gives .

		True , it is not aesthetic criticism ; but aesthetic criticism , in the sense of a re-creation of art as it was in the past , for me is impossible without it . ''

		Nor should we excuse criticism from the func - tion of judgment as well as interpretation .

		It must do more than content itself with asking : What was in the mind of the artist ?

		Has he expressed it ?

		Was his method well or ill adapted ?

		Is his result worth the pains ?

		The artist may hold himself free from rules : but not so , with impunity , the critic .

		Mr.
Wood	PERSON	- berry comes close to Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	when he declares that '' we who find in the merely hu - man world no guide so safe as reason , look to criticism to declare the judgment of reason on the intellectual and moral values of art . ''

		Nor is art itself , as is so often averred , mere '' sense - perceiving ; but it gathers into its energy the whole play of personality , and is a power of the total soul . ''

		Reason aids in its fashioning . ''

		It is a rationalized and spiritualized world , the world that ought to be , an ideal world , though found only fragmentarily in any individual or period or country .

		Art is not a spontaneous gen - eration and geyser , as it were , of the senses at play in their world of mere phenomena ; but it is a
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 99 world-creator , the maker of a new and complete world , one not superficial and momentary merely , but a world with meaning , loaded with all the sig - nificance that man has found in his spiritual life . ''

		Hence the permanence of great art , even though it may happen that the artist himself be no thinker but rather one who expresses half unrealizingly the vision of a community .

		He may not speak as some others do , in abstractions ; but he utters what is neverthe - less `` intellectual and moral truth , spiritual truth . '' ''

		The prime contrast between art and nature -LSB- is -RSB- ... an opposition of freedom to necessity , of the soul to the body , of spirituality to materialism .

		Art is the soul 's confession .

		I should be ill-content if works of art , taken individually , yielded to the critic only a momentary experience of the senses and feelings , as if they were merely disparate objects of nature .

		I desire to know their meanings to the soul ; and that intellectual and moral ele - ments enter into their meaning , and that without the cooperation of the reason they are incompletely known , seems to me plain ... Each school , each age , each race has its own art , often highly indi - vidualized and peculiar to itself ... The diversity of art not only makes interpretation necessary to its understanding , but also renders judgment of its value , intellectual , moral , technical , very useful , both in guiding the mind in its choice and in estab - lishing the relative place that any particular artist or art period has in the whole field ...
Contempla	LOCATION	- tion without judgment is a barren attitude , though judgment need not confine itself to comparing greater and lesser . ''

		The revolt against such criticism springs prob - ably from '' a discontent with that immersion in the dead past of knowledge which is often the scholar 's lot , and from a desire to confine our interest in art within those limits where art is alive . ''

		With this we may sympathize .

		But many of these hardships are inevitable .

		Let us not , like the futurists , consider the past as merely in the way .

		Even '' in realizing the dead selves of mankind , the soul accumulates power , breadth of outlook , tolerance and espe - cially , I think , faith and hope . ''

		But for all this solace , '' one is often fain to ask , ' Is there no rescue from this reign of death , which is history , and how shall it be accomplished ? ' ''

		The answer , thinks Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	, should lie in aesthetic criticism . ''

		Is it an error to relegate art to the dead past and translate it into history ?

		Works of art are not like political events and persons ; they do not pass at once away .

		The
Hermes of Praxiteles	ORGANIZATION	is still with us .

		Is it really the same
Hermes	ORGANIZATION	that it was when it was made ?

		Is its personal identity a fixed state , or does its personality , like our own , change in the passage of time ?

		May it not be the nature of art to cast off what is mortal , and emanci - pate itself from the mind of its creator ? ''

		Is there something beyond '' that mortal and temporary part which historical criticism pre - serves '' ?

		Yes .

		^ Esthetic criticism may try to re-create '' the image before us apart from any attempt to realize what was in the artist 's mind , or with only a passing reference to that . ''

		Expression , '' the nucleus of the artist 's power , '' is '' the process of externalizing what was in the artist 's mind , in some object of sense which shall convey it to others . '' ''

		The natural object .

		.

		is enveloped in his feeling , '' his personality , which is immaterial .

		Sugges - tion , half-lights , the inexpressible , play about a work of art . ''

		In so far as a work of art is a thing of nature , it can be expressed materially with the more adequacy ; in so far as it is a thing of spirit , of personality , it is less subject to complete and certain expression ; and in all art there are these two elements . ''

		No two people can realize this play of spirit in exactly the same way .

		`` Rifts of temperament and varieties of expression between artist and spec - tator make chasms of misunderstanding and misappreciation . '' ''

		Every reader thinks that he is Hamlet . ''

		To make every reader think so is to be a genius , a universal writer .

		`` Whence arises this paradox , so common in art , of infinite diversity in identity ?

		It comes from the fact that , so far from realiz - ing the image as it was in the artist 's mmd and receiving it charged with his personality merely , it is we ourselves who create the image by charging it with our own personality . '' ''

		It is one of the charms of art that it is not to be completely understood .

		In an age in which so high a value is put upon facts , in - formation , positive knowledge , it is a relief to have still reserved to us a place apart where it is not necessary to know all . ''

		The truth of art grows ever with time '' more rich in signifi - cance , more profound in substance , disclosing heaven over heaven and depth under depth . ''

		The greatest books grow old with us .

		So it is that great artists become lifelong studies .

		Our powers of appreciation vary , and our way is .

		`` commonly blocked by certain inhibitions which are so lodged in the mind by education and opinion that they effectively paralyze any effort at re-creation . ''

		The Puritans feared the drama .

		The respectable American turns hastily and pruriently away from the nude figure and the shame is his , not the artist 's .

		With such limitations we fall short of the artist 's vision .

		Yet , on the other hand , we may give his work of art beautiful meanings of which he did not dream . ''

		The essence of the work , its living power for us , is not what the artist put in it , but what we draw from it ; its world-value is not what it was to the artist , but what it is to the world ... Thus arises the paradox .

		.

		that it is not the poet , but 100 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	the reader , who writes the poem ... New ages appropriate the works of the past by accomplish - ing a partial transformation in them , and unless art is capable of such a remaking it can not last . ''

		So it was that
Pater	PERSON	in his '' creative criticism '' re-created art , `` a marvellous blend of the modern spirit with ancient material . ''

		All his figures , `` Dionysus , or French gallants , or Roman gentlemen , .

		.

		are developed in the dark chamber of his own singularly sensitive and refined artistic temperament . ''

		Thus the Puritans re-created the Old Testament .

		We need not abolish war and the wine-cup as beautiful poetic imagery even in chaster days ; they may adorn and vivify the poetry of an age of new ideals , and do these rich service .

		Works of art are not , then , to Mr.
Wood	PERSON	- berry '' historical monuments valuable for the information they give of the past , '' but '' new material , for us to work our own statues and pictures and poems out of ; or , in a word , to create the forms of our own souls out of ; for the soul must be given forms in order to be aware of its being , to know itself , truly to be .

		The soul moves toward self-expression in many ways , but in finding forms for itself the soul discovers its most plastic material in the world of art .

		It is in forms of ideality that the soul hastens to clothe itself ; and while it is possible for us to elaborate such forms from the crude mass of nature , as the first artists did , yet later generations are the more fortunate in that they possess in art and literature a vast treas - ure of ideality already elaborated and present .

		Works of art thus constitute a select material wherein the artist-soul that is in each of us can work , not only with our own native force of pene - tration and aspiration , but , as it were , with higher aid , the aid of genius , the aid of the select souls of the race . ''

		Thus art casts off `` what is mortal , '' and emancipates `` itself from the mind of its creator '' '' to enter upon a life of its own , con - tinually renewed in the minds of those who appropriate it . ''

		The reader who appropriates may be a Pater ; he may be far humbler , he may be far greater .

		Such fame outlasts biog - raphy .

		The poet 's memory becomes ideal .

		`` And then this miracle arises that into the soul of
Virgil	PERSON	, for example , enters a Christian soul , new-born , and deepening its pathos ... That is earthly immortality , the survival and increment of the spirit through time .

		Thus arises another paradox , that as art begins by being charged with personality , it ends by becoming impersonal , solv - ing the apparent contradiction in the soul universal , the common soul of mankind .

		Each of us creates art in his own image , it seems an infinite varia - ble ; and yet it is the variable of something identical in all the soul ... It is thus in the artistic life that one shares in the soul universal , the common soul of mankind , which yet is manifest only in indi - viduals and their concrete work .

		Art like life has its own material being in the concrete , but the spir - itual being of both is in the universal . ''

		Now observe that when , '' from time to time in history our ancestors encountered suc - cessively alien literatures , and as each was in turn appropriated , a Renaissance resulted , '' and thus '' civilization has grown in body and quality , ever enriching itself by what it ab - sorbs from this and that particular race and age . ''

		It is tragic folly to isolate nations and races , to learn race self-sufficiency and , after that , race suspicion and race hate .

		Beware of the reactionary tendency growing in
America	LOCATION	.

		Remember , too , that the individual , like the nation , like civilization , must have his periodi - cal renaissance .

		Goethe needed his Italian journey .

		Shelley was reborn when he read Plato .

		The artist-life is '' a life of discovery , '' not of truth but of faculty ; not so much '' an ac - quisition of knowledge '' as '' an acquisition of inward power . '' ''

		The most wonderful thing in the soul is the extraordinary latency of power in it ; and it is in the artist-life , in the world of art , that this latent power is most variously and brilliantly released .

		What happens to you when you begin to see , really to see , pictures , for example ?

		It is not that a new object has come within the range of your vision ; but that a new power of seeing has arisen in your eye , and through this power a new world has opened before you , a world of such marvels of space , color , and beauty , luminosity , shadow , and line , atmosphere and disposition , that you begin to live in it as a child begins to learn to live in the natural world .

		It is not the old world seen piecemeal ; it is a new world on another level of being than natural existence .

		So , when you begin to take in a poem , it is not a mere fanciful arrangement of idea and event added to your ordinary memory of things ; new powers of feeling have opened in your heart that constitute a fresh passion of life there , and as you feed it with lyric and drama , a signifi - cance , a mystery , a light enter into the universe as you know it , with transforming and exalting power .

		To the lover of pictures the visible world has be - come something other than it was , even nature herself flowers with Corots and Manets , coruscates with
Turners	ORGANIZATION	and Claudes , darkens with Rem - brandts ; to the lover of poetry also the visible world has suffered change and lies in the light of
Wordsworth	PERSON	or of
Shelley	LOCATION	, but much more the invisible world of inward life is transformed into visions of human fate in ^ Eschylus and Shakspere , into throbs of passion in
Dante	LOCATION	and
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, into cries of ecstasy and pain in how many generations of the poets world-wide .

		It is not that you have acquired knowledge ; you have acquired heart .

		To lead the artist-life is not to look at pictures and read books ; it is to discover the faculties of the soul , that slept unknown and unused , and to apply them in realizing the depth and tenderness , the elo - quence , the hope and joy of the life that is within .

		It is by this that the life of art differs from the life of science : its end is not to know but to be . ''

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 101 Therefore we revolt against the historical treatment of art because we feel that it endan - gers art 's own true nature , degrades it into mere knowledge , loses sight of life . ''

		The first place is held by life .

		It is against the substitu - tion of knowledge for life in scholarship , espe - cially in the literary and artistic fields , that the protest is made . ''

		`` A second main trait of the artist-life of the soul .

		.

		is that it is a life of growth by an inward secret and mysterious process .

		There is nothing mechanical in it ; it is vital .

		It was this aspect of the soul 's life which
Wordsworth	PERSON	brought so promi - nently forward , and made elemental in his verse , advocating a -LRB- wise passiveness ' in the conduct of the mind ... ' Consider the lilies , how they grow : they toil not , neither do they spin . '

		That is the type of the artist-soul ; in the artist-life there is neither toiling nor spinning .

		In an economical civilization like ours , leisure is apt to be confounded with indolence , and it is hard to see how the poet watching ' the sun illume The yellow bees in the ivy bloom ' is not an idler in the land .

		Especially is it hard to see how things will come without planning .

		In our own day planning has become an all-engrossing occupation .

		A belief in organization has spread through the country , and is applied in all quarters of life , as if success were always a matter of machinery .

		Even in the churches , which have been the home of spiritual force , organization plays an ever-increasing part , as if failure in driving-force could be made up for by appliances in the machine ; to a certain extent this is possible , but the driving force is not the machine .

		The practical reason so occupies all the field of our life that the result is to belittle and destroy whatever has not its ground of being in the useful .

		Art , by its own nature , excludes the useful . ''

		`` A third main trait of the world of art is that it is a place of freedom , '' not merely `` from the manacle of utility '' but , on the positive side , a power to transcend nature and to reconstitute `` the world in the image '' of the souPs '' own finer vision and deeper wisdom , realizing ideality in its own consciousness and conveying at least the shadow of its dream to mankind ... Each of us , in reading the play , may well believe he is Hamlet , but each is well aware that he is identify - ing himself with a more perfect type of himself , such as is known only to the mind 's eye ... The fruit of this large freedom is the ideal world , in which each realizes his dream of the best .

		It is here that experiments are made , that revolutions sometimes begin ; for the ideal , .

		.

		once expressed , passes back into the ordinary world , and there it may be made a pattern , a thing to be actualized , and it falls under the dominance of the practical reason and has this or that fortune according to the wisdom or folly of mankind at the time ... There are times .

		.

		when the ideal world does enter into the actual world , and partly permeate it , if it does not wholly master it .

		The classic , the chivalric , the Christian world attest the fact broadly ; and in individual life how must we ourselves bear witness to the mingling in ourselves of the poets ' blood , which is the blood of the world .

		In the intimacy of this communion is our best of life , and it is accom - plished solely by the re-creation in us , in our minds and hearts , our hopes , admirations and loves , of what was first in the artists of every sort , according to our capacity to receive and reembody in our own spiritual substance their finer , wiser , deeper , power .

		Their capacity to enter thus into the life of human - ity is the measure of their genius , and our capacity to receive the gift is the measure of our souls . '' ''

		The poets are often spoken of as prophets , and in history the greatest are those most lonely peaks that seem to have taken the light of an unrisen dawn , like
Virgil	PERSON	, whose humanity in the Aeneid shines with a foregleam of the Christian tempera - ment , or like Plato , whose philosophy in many a passage was a morning star that went before the greater light of Christian faith in the divine .

		But it is not such poets and such prophecy that I have in mind .

		I mean that in our own experiences in this artist-life with the poets , sculptors , and musi - cians there abides the feeling that we shall have , as
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	says , * the wages of going on , ' there is our clearest intimation of immortality .

		Words - worth found such intimations in fragments of his boyhood and youth .

		I find them rather in frag - ments of manhood and maturer life .

		Life im - presses me less as a birth initially out of the divine into mortal being than as birth into the divine at each step of the onward way . ''

		Such a life is not reserved for the select alone ; it is open to all . ''

		The child with his picture - book and the dying Laureate reading the Shaksperian ` Dirge ' in the moonlight lead the same life and follow the same method .

		The boy with Homer , the sage with
Plato	PERSON	, it is all one : each is finding his soul , and living in it . ''

		We must strive for a more just economic order `` to lessen the burden of common life '' and give each individual time to rejoice in this artist-life , his birthright , no matter how humble he may be . ''

		We are all proud of
America	LOCATION	, and look on our farms and workshops , the abundance of work , the harvest of universal gain dispersed through multi - tudes reclaimed from centuries of poverty , we see and proclaim the greatness of the good ; but I am ill-content with the spiritual harvest , with the absence of that which has been the glory of great nations in art and letters , with the indifference to that principle of human brotherhood in devotion to which our fathers found greatness and which is most luminous in art and letters ; our enormous success in the economical and mechanical sphere leaves me unreconciled to our failure to enter the artistic sphere as a nation . ''

		Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	is certainly timely in his warnings against history and historical criti - cism , which tend to-day so often to substitute knowledge for life .

		But I should be inclined 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	to say that he turns away from historical criti - cism , after he has said many fine things in its praise , with a too audible sigh of relief .

		The greatest critics in the generations to follow , now that the new genre of criticism has devel - oped so rapidly and so richly , must be so robust that their '' aesthetic criticism '' may be superimposed on a very massive foundation of historical research .

		I can conceive of a criti - cism which could wed the dryasdust but in - valuable method of the most plodding and terrify ingly erudite contributions to `` schol - arly journals '' -LRB- contributions bristling with citations -RRB- with the most alert receptivity and nimble play of moods and soaring imagination of the most sensitive impressionist .

		This may seem to Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	, and to the readers of his book or even of my synopsis , but an exag - gerated underlining of certain of his own statements .

		Yet if I am but underlining his fundamental precepts , I would do it even at the risk of masquerading with the plumage and the voice of a parrot .

		I underline because I feel a certain danger in many of Mr.
Wood	PERSON	- berry 's passages .

		Time and again he seems to conceive of idealism and fact as enemies as implacable as the Persian deities Ormuzd and Ahriman , with their endless armies of radiant angels and swart demons .

		Surely idealism which is not fragile in the face of the first stroke of healthy disillusionment must rise phoenix-like out of fact , which it does not oppose but from which it is splendidly born .

		Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	has communed with
Plato	PERSON	and within himself , in many an awed and happy vigil , over the problem of the One and the Many , and has clearly seen with Spenser how change does but again and again dilate with - out destroying an eternal being .

		But some of those other opposites which bewilder us in all but our most adventurous moments , for all his care -LRB- though he often manages them bravely , like two fiery coursers held for a time in yoke -RRB- , fly apart and almost shatter his chariot at times in the highest moments of his Phaethon - ride .

		Not only is Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	's reconciliation of historical and aesthetic criticism a little faltering , but at .

		times he seems to think of society as led by a few highly endowed critics as well as poets , at times a benignant Utopian anarchy in which everybody may be a critic with a poet 's soul , a richly trained creative reader .

		I know that he would make sorrowing concessions that many are debarred within the fell clutch of circumstance .

		He protests elo - quently against our unjust economic order .

		But he passes by a fundamental protest with - out which we can never have a just economic order when he concedes with so many agstheti - cians that the useful and the artistic can not be reconciled . ''

		Our bodies and our mortal inter - ests , '' he says , '' are subject to the world of use ; but our spirituality , our immortal part , is above use . ''

		Here I for one am prepared undauntedly to open the pages of a book often reviled by artist and economist ,
Buskin	PERSON	's '' Crown of Wild Olive , '' at the opening pages of the chapter called '' Traffic , '' and protest with the writer against the false opposition of art and utility .

		I also -LRB- though I am one of those who believe that after death we go on as individuals , in being dilated but fundamen - tally the same -RRB- am here on earth to say that I will brook no deep distinction between my `` physical '' and my `` spiritual '' self .

		The highest love is uncompromisingly physical and uncompromisingly spiritual , though few are strenuous enough to learn its deep and lasting rewards because few are strenuous to learn with their comrade how to love before they love .

		The highest art should be useful ; there is no distinction there , any more than there is here on earth between body and soul .

		Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	has fallen into an asceticism , not the athletic asceticism of temporary re - straint for purposes of purer enjoyment , but the asceticism of fear : an asceticism , with Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	, delicate , more tender , warmer than its old parent of the grey twilight but born out of it , bred of its bone , marked with its lineaments .

		Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	remains , after all , a champion of the old feudalistic art , an art which now would be communal but fails , an art which now loves but also still fears the populace , an art which fears the useful .

		The Greeks created something like a communal art at the expense of slaves who did the drudgery .

		To-day , though we have declared ourselves against slavery and have freed all nominal slaves -LRB- and to have declared our - selves , merely , means great progress -RRB- , we live in an age of actual slavery more widespread than that of any previous age .

		And this is partly because we refuse to face squarely the problem of drudgery .

		Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	makes a wise distinction between soft indolence -LRB- that herald of all the other deadly sins -RRB- and beau - tiful leisure .

		But he should realize that so long as drudgery remains a reality , the toiler in the realms of drudgery -LRB- if he survives -RRB- or his son or daughter -LRB- if he is successful -RRB- will never distinguish between leisure and more obvious , most alluring indolence .

		We must face the problem that the Greeks shirked .

		We must declare that nothing is impossible but that one word `` impossible . ''

		We must declare drudgery to be a phantasm which has been tricked out in borrowed flesh and blood too long .

		And we may make at least one fair
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 103 beginning at this gigantic and quixotic but ultimately most practical task by dreaming ceaselessly and doing ceaselessly that these two apparent opposites , art and utility , may be wedded .

		CHILDREN OF THE CITY .

		* '' Public opinion has a curious trick of suddenly regarding as a living moral issue , vital and un - appeasable , some old situation concerning which society has been indifferent for many years .

		The newly moralized issue , almost as if by accident , suddenly takes fire and sets whole communities in a blaze , lighting up human relationships and public duty with a new meaning , in the end trans - forming an abstract social ideal into a political demand for new legal enactments .

		When that blaze actually starts , when the theme is heated , molten as it were with human passion and desire , it is found that there are many mature men and women of moral purpose and specialized knowl - edge who have become efficient unto life .

		Among them are those who have long felt a compunction in regard to the ill-adjustment of which society has become conscious and are eager to contribute to the pattern of juster human relations . ''

		Thus writes Miss Addams in her preface to '' Safeguards for City Youth , '' a book de - scribing the work and experiences of the
Juvenile Protective Association of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		These same winged words might well have stood 011 the title-page of each of the five books now before us , for all are symptoms of the same awakening , the same desire of `` mature men and women of moral purpose '' to be doing something to mend the evil of their day , and prevent that of the days to come .

		This new impulse , developing '' almost as if by acci - dent , '' is nevertheless the fruit of the toil of years , as Miss Addams well knows , being her - self chief among the toilers .

		It is fortunate that it is so , for herein is a certain guarantee of stability , an assurance that this new birth of the social conscience is but the emerging into the light of a growth which has been patiently maturing for many a day .

		the conditions surrounding childhood in Chi - cago , and remedy some of the evils for which Society is responsible .

		Indeed , the word `` juvenile '' is interpreted broadly , as includ - ing young people of mature growth , who need protection as they enter the ranks of labor .

		This protection must come largely through enlightened public opinion ; so we are begged to note that `` all of the stores make large profits at the holiday season , but they are made at the expense of thousands of employ - ees , whose weary feet and aching backs are the result of the mad rush on the part of thou - sands of Christian people who are thus seek - ing to express the kindliness and good will which our Christmas commemorates ! ''

		or again that '' the same kind-hearted people who , in great concern , would quickly gather around the victim of a street accident , carelessly eat food placed before them by a frail girl almost fainting with fatigue or heedlessly walk through a hotel corridor lately scrubbed by a Polish woman who has spent ten hours upon her hands and knees . ''

		The object of Mrs.
Bowen	PERSON	's book is to enable us to see the machinery back of the passing show , and real - ize the cruelty and stupidity of so much of it ; thereby arousing not merely the wish for reform , but the hope of being able to better things .

		A minute study of the social environment would be largely futile with the other element of the problem , the nature of the individual , left out of account .

		Consequently '' the Asso - ciation is at present making a careful study of sub-normal children , of whom it is esti - mated that there are about 6000 in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Approximately only one-tenth of this number can be received at the one State Institution for the Feeble-Minded in
Illinois	LOCATION	. ''

		This ap - palling problem is matched by another , not wholly unrelated , and we read : '' One of the most pathetic sights in
Chicago	LOCATION	is the venereal disease ward for children in the County Hos - pital .

		In twenty-seven months , 600 children under twelve years of age passed through this ward 60 per cent of them had contracted the disease accidentally ; 20 per cent of them had inherited it , and another 20 per cent had been criminally assaulted by diseased per - sons . ''

		Mrs.
Schoff	PERSON	, in her study of '' The Wayward Child , '' approaches the subject with the same zeal , and writes with the knowledge gained from many years of work .

		Her point of view is not scientific , and she is inclined to regard the problem in an old-fashioned way .

		Thus we are assured that `` when carried back to
William	LOCATION	the Conqueror each child has , accord - ing to President
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	, eight billion 104 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	ancestors .

		From so many as eight billion ancestors , each child must certainly have a very mixed heredity , and we may be encour - aged about the matter even more by remem - bering that man was created in the image and likeness of God and that consequently there must be some good in every one . ''

		The propo - sition that every human life is '' worth while , '' and should be given the best possible chance , is one to which we may cordially assent ; but even the testimony of President
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	will not make us believe in those eight billion ancestors .

		By the same arithmetical process it will be apparent that at the time of
Julius Caesar	PERSON	our ancestors covered the earth many layers deep .

		These , however , are minor matters ; and when it comes to the practical things of life , Mrs.
Schoff	PERSON	has much good advice to give .

		Thus : '' More than half of the children in the juvenile court during eight years were there for stealing .

		No one could listen to the stories of theft of every sort told by these children without reaching the conclu - sion that honesty does not come without con - structive parental teaching . ''

		Judging from the testimony of thousands of prison inmates , it is concluded that reform schools have ex - actly the opposite effect from that suggested by their name .

		Recognizing the unconscious prejudice of the narrators , who in telling their experiences tend to place all the blame on their surroundings , we must nevertheless ad - mit that the testimony is weighty , and after all not different from what we might reason - ably expect .

		Even high class boarding schools for `` young gentlemen '' are sometimes nests of more corruption than we care to admit . ''

		Street-Land , '' by Mr.
Philip Davis	PERSON	of Bos - ton , is a volume of '' The `` Welfare Series , '' edited by Mr.
E. T. Hale	PERSON	.

		It gives a clear account of the life of city children in the streets , their efforts to find work and amuse - ment , their troubles and temptations .

		It also describes the
Newsboys	ORGANIZATION	' Republic , and sets forth a programme for the future .

		Ulti - mately , the solution must be found in a radical reorganization of city life . ''

		Since it is the almost savage environment which makes many city children little savages , we must learn that our chief task is to civilize the environment .

		Nor can this be accomplished by philanthropy or law .

		These are curative , not preventive , agencies .

		Sound economics , made popular by safe investments in homes for the people built by the municipality or
State	ORGANIZATION	, as in
Letch	LOCATION	- worth ,
England	LOCATION	, and in
Belgium	LOCATION	, alone will ultimately abolish slums and slum products and prevent their reproduction in the rising cities of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		It is to be noted , however , that if mere legal enactments can not do away with the evil , they can and do perpetuate it , preventing municipalities from taking the steps necessary to create decent conditions .

		Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's book on `` The Juvenile Court and the Community '' is an attempt to define the status of the
Juvenile Court	ORGANIZATION	, and deter - mine its proper functions .

		It is recognized that the Court has undergone an evolution , whereby the court business proper has dimin - ished in proportion to the ever extending pro- bation system .

		Volunteer probation is giving way to organized municipal work , and `` in most places needs simply a death blow to ' put it out of its misery . ' ''

		The probation officer is called upon to cooperate with all existing agencies , and thus finds himself no longer exclusively connected with the Court .

		The point is made that probation is a part of the educational system , and should have its prin - cipal point of contact with the schools rather than with any judicial system .

		The
Domestic Relations Court	ORGANIZATION	could take care of the other functions of the
Juvenile Court	ORGANIZATION	, which would thus disappear , its activities having been absorbed by other agencies .

		* ' The writer be - lieves that the evidence shows that the juve - nile court has been for its time a splendid institution , '' but that it represents a stage in evolution , leading to better things .

		If the
Juvenile Court	ORGANIZATION	represents a transitory stage , it is still evident that in most places this stage has not yet passed .

		All students of the
Court	ORGANIZATION	recognize that it is changing , growing in various directions to meet the public need , and , as it were , producing new departments by a process of budding .

		The time is ripe for such discussions as that of Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's , but they are perhaps to be taken with a grain of salt , on Bergsonian grounds .

		It is probable that different cities , attempting to solve their problems in different ways , will find that there is no single road to municipal efficiency .

		Escaping from one difficulty we meet some other .

		The
Juvenile Court	ORGANIZATION	has had a hard struggle with the politicians ; but let the diffi - cult work of probation fall under the direc - tion of the
School Board	ORGANIZATION	, and we may find that timidity , indecision , and fear of `` injur - ing business '' are harder to combat than downright crookedness .

		In any case , the onus is thrown back upon the community , and no mere system will make amends for a stupid public .

		The '' West Side Studies '' carried on by the
Russell Sage Foundation	ORGANIZATION	constitute a most valuable contribution to descriptive sociology .

		They have the merit of being exceedingly well written , so that the narrative flows and has coherence , instead of appearing to be a patch - work made up from accumulated memoranda .

		1915 THE DIAL 105 While the purpose is descriptive , and there is little direct propaganda for reform , the vivid accounts of conditions found point so clearly to the weak spots in civic life that the reader can not help drawing his own conclusions con - cerning remedies .

		The writers enter into their subject with such a warmth of human sym - pathy that we no longer see merely things to criticize , but come to feel that after all the very troubles of the city carry with them the germs of hope for better times .

		THE BLUE-STOCKINGS AND THEIR When
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	,
Fanny Burney	PERSON	,
Hannah More	PERSON	, and other celebrities of their time meet together in a critical volume , that book is assured of readers ; for who can resist the appeal of the Age of Tea and Talk ?

		If the book succeeds , it may be due to no special merit of its author , his audience is predis - posed to enjoy his work .

		However , in the case of Professor Tinker 's study of `` The Salon and English Letters , '' the author 's part is of an unusually important and distinctive char - acter .

		Unostentatious , sympathetic , thor - oughly keen in his analyses , this professor of English Literature at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	has presented a new view of the years 1760-1790 by means of centring his observations on the salon and its influences .

		Until the publication of this book we have had no authority , in English , upon the salon , and have been forced to gain information from dozens of scattered volumes .

		Now we possess , in Professor Tinker 's work , a scholarly and succinct account of one of the most interesting , and often amusing , phases of human history .

		Beginning with the French salon , Profes - sor Tinker outlines rapidly the origin and development of those `` literary courts , '' and traces their relationship to the courtly groups of the Renaissance which were presided over by such women as
Beatrice d'Este	PERSON	,
Caterina Cornaro	PERSON	of
Browning	PERSON	's Asolo , and the ladies mentioned in
Castiglione	PERSON	's '' Book of the Cour - tier . ''

		The Hotel de
Rambouillet	LOCATION	, most dis - tinguished of all the French salons , was established , in direct imitation of these Ital - ian assemblies , by a lady half Italian herself ; and in the chavnbre blue d'Arthenice the select few , not more than eighteen , carried on their exalted conversations .

		showing how important was the place of gath - ering , the aesthetic background , in establish - ing the right tone ; and he makes clear the earnest effort of the leaders to promote a real democracy of intellect , by giving encourage - ment to any person of genuine wit and origi - nality .

		Dominated by woman , the salon expressed her `` instinct for society and for literature , '' arousing discussion , provoking conversation on topics literary or philosophi - cal .

		Sermons and profane literature were themes for all to discourse upon ; and in those days `` club '' folk read the works they dis - cussed .

		Out of the talk grew some species of literature , chiefly those forms which express more intimately the ideas and sentiments of every-day life , letters , memoirs , and similar friendly productions in both prose and verse .

		Perhaps more significant than the attitude toward letters and art are the relationships , the friendships , fostered by the salons .

		On this topic Professor Tinker is almost too brief ; he does not bring out the fullest mean - ing of the development of personality , the shaping and enriching of individual talents , stimulated by the familiar intercourse of these coteries .

		From
France	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	the sentiment for similar literary groups was speedily trans - ferred ; and
England	LOCATION	did justice to the ideal , not by any means wholly new .

		Elizabethan England had had literary courts , and the
Countess of Pembroke	ORGANIZATION	will be remembered as one of the noblest patronesses of all time .

		With the Restoration came the insidious amorousness which vitiated the salons , turn - ing the library coterie into a school for scan - dal .

		By the
end of the seventeenth century	DATE	the feminist movement was well under way ; and of the manifestations of literary mili - tancy Professor Tinker has little to say , since that aspect of life has little to do with the salons , which are devoted to conversation .

		It is with the rise of the
Bluestocking Club	ORGANIZATION	that the salon definitely reappears in
England	LOCATION	.

		This Club , which was probably in existence by
1760	DATE	, was composed of `` Vesey , '' `` Bos - cawen , '' ''

		`` Bluestocking , '' that genteel by - word of con - tempt , is discussed by Professor Tinker very fully , although he says plainly that no defi - nitely satisfactory conclusions can be reached concerning its origin .

		It would seem that it arose from the practice of ridiculing the severely plain dress of the Puritans , who , in their homely woolen hose , made up that '' Blew-stocking Parliament '' so odious to the silk-clad Cavaliers .

		A term thus used to cast reproach upon really sincere and high - 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	minded folk was no bad title for a group who , feeling the popular associations with that word , rather enjoyed assuming its connota - tions . ''

		Blues '' and '' blue '' came to mean cultured ladies , or '' shocking females '' ac - cording to the intelligence of the critic .

		It is in these chapters dealing with the
Bluestock	PERSON	- ings that the volume is most interesting , for the author has put together various fragmen - tary bits , making a comparatively unified whole .

		Of course any work which considers so miscellaneous a subject as the lives and atti - tudes and accomplishments of numerous minor personages can not possess perfect smoothness of transition .

		The difficulties of the case , however , have been well met ; and Professor Tinker has furnished us with a storehouse of information , anecdote , criticism , interpretation of character , and small talk delightfully arrayed .

		Special praise is due for the sane , generous , respectful tone in which he writes .

		To all except anti-suffra - gists his studiously judicial manner will ap - peal strongly .

		It is easy to be flippant and witty at the expense of the shallow and artifi - cial intellectual life of the Bluestockings .

		For instance , revered
Hannah More	PERSON	has been made the subject of many gibes ; but just as Pro- fessor Tinker publishes a charmingly youth - ful portrait of her , so he endeavors to present , not the apparent pedant and literary trifler , but the woman who sincerely strove for high accomplishment .

		With the best of opportuni - ties for making merry over `` lovely woman / ' the critic has not indulged in caricature , or satire , or condescension .

		This is not saying that he lacks humor .

		Some of the charm in these chapters lies in the shrewd brevity of the recitals that reveal all the truth , the ludi - crous self-esteem , as well as the inner motives , the highest aspirations , the fine ideals of the members of the English salons .

		Engaging minor details are given generously , and in such a quotation as the following one per - ceives the Spartan nature of the day : '' I never knew a party turn out so pleasantly as the other night at the
Pepys 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		There was all the pride of
London	LOCATION	every wit and every wit-ess .

		.

		but the spirit of the evening was kept up on the strength of a little lemonade till past eleven , with - out cards , scandal , or politics . ''

		For portraiture there is the sketch of Mrs.
Vesey	PERSON	, or `` the sylph , '' who was most supreme when youth and beauty had long left her alone with her unflagging imagination and her friends .

		The third section of the book concerns itself with the expression of the social instinct in Conversation , Familiar Correspondence , the Diary , and the Intimate Biography , illus - trated of course by the famous names of the day ,
Johnson	PERSON	,
Fanny Burney	PERSON	,
Walpole	LOCATION	, and
Boswell	PERSON	.

		These chapters , dealing with mat - ter more familiar to the general reader , are written in a lively yet non-partisan fashion .

		They show the results of long study of these special themes , hence they will prove to have critical freshness .

		Johnson is revealed in all his irrevocable humanness , not as
Ursa Major	ORGANIZATION	, but as the intensely social being who lived on talk , and whose talk roused and galvanized others into effective expression , the supreme art in conversation .


Boswell	PERSON	's efforts are ap - preciated in the spirit of understanding vouchsafed him by later criticism .

		Instead of listing him , as
Fanny Burney	PERSON	did , as `` that biographical , anecdotical , memorandummer , '' Professor Tinker interprets
Boswell	PERSON	very justly .

		The immortal diarist herself is al - most too summarily dealt with ; and at the conclusion of the chapter , the critic mourns the presence in the Diary of so much self - praise , so much quotation of the agreeable things said to the blushing but quite appre - ciative
Miss Burney	LOCATION	.

		Why mourn over this trait in her more than over a similar trait in the great lexicographer ?

		Is vanity a man 's right ?

		Within the book is a mass of information gleaned from very extensive reading , but so effectively and so crisply condensed , so briskly phrased , that each re-reading will yield a reward .

		The author 's individual ap - preciation of his subject gives vivid insight into that age which has a singular charm for our mad epoch , in which such things as polite conversation and long , fastidiously composed letters are genuine antiques .

		So also , are those staunch convictions of ponderous size .

		It is a pleasure , in these days when '' open - mindedness ' '' is synonymous with vacuity , to read of people who were not only positive , but actually bigoted .

		What an enviable age it was !

		No automobiles , no electricity , no strikes , no
Sunday	DATE	papers , time for dignity , deliberation , reading , and thinking !

		They had a happiness , a content , we shall never know , except in retrospect through the charmed medium of the printed page .

		One of the most interesting announcements that has come to us for several months is that of the forthcoming publication of a selection from the letters of

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 107 DIPLOMACY AXD THE GREAT WAR .

		* Whoever desires to study the proximate causes of the mighty conflict in which
Europe	LOCATION	is now plunged will find a wealth of material in the official publications issued by the various belligerent governments since the outbreak of the war , the British and German AVhite Books , the Russian Orange Paper , the Bel - gian Gray Paper , the French Yellow Book , the Austrian Red Book , and the Servian Blue Book .

		The entry of other powers into the conflict will doubtless be followed by other similar publications .

		The promptness with which these documents were issued , and the somewhat lavish manner in which they have been circulated , are quite without precedent in the wars of the past , and can only be explained by the desire of the governments concerned to put their qases before the world in the hope of obtaining a favorable verdict upon their conduct .

		The whole procedure affords a striking illustration of the fact that civilized nations are not only not indifferent to the opinions of mankind , but that , on the contrary , they eagerly court the approbation of international public opinion for their acts , the good faith and rectitude of which are suspected .

		It is one of the happy results of the new diplomacy and of government by public opin - ion that important diplomatic correspondence which in former times would have been care - fully concealed in the archives of foreign offices for generations , is to-day made public almost as soon as it is dispatched ; so that it is possible to write the history of the events with which it deals before that history be - comes ancient .

		With the aid of the published diplomatic documents which the present war has produced , it is possible for contemporary historians to determine and fix the responsi - bility for the war which is now ruining
Europe	LOCATION	, while those upon whom the responsi - bility rests are still living .

		The task of examining this large mass of diplomatic material , and of unravelling the tangled skein of a multiplicity of notes , has been greatly simplified by the work of Pro- fessor
Stowell of Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, who has made a systematic digest and critical analysis of these documents , and has so ar - ranged and coordinated the results that it is now possible for one to get the gist of it all without the necessity of reading the various documents in their entirety .

		If , for example , one desires to study the question of the viola - * THE DIPLOMACY OF THE WAR OF

		tion of the neutrality of
Belgium	LOCATION	, he will find in a single chapter a critical analysis of all the important diplomatic documents bearing on the subject , along with a historical introduc - tion by the author , followed by his own con - clusions regarding the responsibility for the act .

		In a similar manner , all the other impor - tant controversies are examined and judged .

		Recognizing , very properly , that an under - standing of the deep and underlying causes of the war is impossible without a knowledge of the history of the international relations of
Europe	LOCATION	during the years antedating the out - break of the conflict , the author starts out with a review of such important events as the founding of the
Triple Alliance	ORGANIZATION	, the
Triple Entente	ORGANIZATION	, the
Dual Alliance	ORGANIZATION	, the Conference of
Algeciras	LOCATION	, the Agadir and Casablanca inci - cents , and the Turco-Italian and Balkan wars .

		With this survey as a necessary back - ground , he proceeds to examine in succession the diplomatic correspondence relating to the controversy between
Austria	LOCATION	and
Servia	LOCATION	, be - tween
Austria	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, between
Germany	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, between
England	LOCATION	and the powers concerned , that relating to the neutrality of
Belgium	LOCATION	, and so on .

		A large part of the work consists of impor - tant extracts from the diplomatic documents , so arranged and analyzed as to give it the character of a narrative .

		It is not , therefore , a mere compilation or collection of documents .

		There is much comment by the author , and , very properly , he has exercised freely his right to judge the facts in the light of the evidence , and to condemn where , in his opin - ion , condemnation is justifiable .

		On the whole , however , his judgments are fair and dispassionate ; and being based upon a very thorough and detailed examination of the official documents , they must carry great weight .

		It is not difficult for an impartial observer who studies these documents with the aid of Professor
Stowell	PERSON	's analysis and com - ment to make up his mind as to where the responsibility for this war properly belongs .

		We may now summarize some of the au - thor 's more important conclusions .

		Regard - ing the merits of the controversy between
Austria	LOCATION	and
Servia	ORGANIZATION	a controversy which was the occasion if not the cause of the gen - eral conflict Professor
Stowell	PERSON	concludes from his study of the diplomatic documents that Servia '' evinced a most conciliatory spirit , '' and that she went as far toward meet - ing the Austrian demands as was possible for the government of any independent state to go .

		`` If
Austria	LOCATION	, '' he says , `` because of her peculiarly perilous situation , considered it impossible to discuss the question -LSB- of media - 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	tion -RSB- and to examine whether the proposed guarantees would not be adequate , we must conclude her action to be a confession that she was herself unable to live up to her interna - tional obligations . ''


Russia	LOCATION	's conduct as the protector of Servia was not reprehensible .

		She employed `` all her efforts to obtain a pacific issue which would be acceptable to
Austria	LOCATION	and satisfy her amour-propre . ''

		Con - cerning the question as to whether the Ger - man government knew the contents of the Austrian ultimatum before it was dispatched to the Servian government , Professor
Stowell	PERSON	expresses the opinion that while the text of the note may not have been communicated to the German government , it seems likely that it was shown to the German ambassador at
Vienna	LOCATION	, who doubtless informed the German government of its contents .

		In any case , the German government took particular pains to be in a position where it could proclaim its ignorance of the note , in order to be able to say to the other powers that it had kept out of the affair and had exercised no influence upon
Austria	LOCATION	in formulating her demands upon
Servia	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Stowell	PERSON	reviews at length the efforts of Sir
Edward Grey	PERSON	to prevent a gen - eral war , and how they were destined to fail .

		No one can read the mass of correspondence in all these official publications without feeling that Sir
Edward	PERSON	stands out as the most ad - mirable figure among all the diplomats and foreign ministers concerned .

		He worked tire - lessly and almost without ceasing to preserve peace , and he seems never to have despaired until all hope was gone .

		Coming to the much discussed question of the violation of the neutrality of
Belgium	LOCATION	, Professor
Stowell	PERSON	examines , first , the German contention that the neutralization treaty of
1839	DATE	was not binding in
1914	DATE	, and on every point he refutes the German argument com - pletely .

		This treaty , he says , was not only binding on all the signatory parties , but they were under an obligation to cooperate in guaranteeing the neutrality proclaimed by the treaty .

		More than this , `` it was a duty which all the states of the world owe to inter - national law to take every reasonable and practical means to prevent
Germany	LOCATION	from effecting such a gross violation of the rights of a weak state as has resulted from her inva - sion . ''

		This obligation , he asserts , rested upon the
United States	LOCATION	equally with the other powers .

		There is , of course , a difference of opinion as to the merits of this view ; but un - questionably if international law means what it has heretofore been understood to mean , strong argument can be advanced in favor of the position of the author .

		Considering in turn the various German excuses for violating the neutrality of Bel - gium , that
England	LOCATION	intended to land troops there for the purpose of attacking
Germany	LOCATION	, that there existed a convention between Bel - gium and
England	LOCATION	by .

		which they were to make common cause against
Germany	LOCATION	, that there was a similar agreement between Bel - gium and
France	LOCATION	, that documents discovered in
Brussels	LOCATION	showed that
Belgium	LOCATION	had violated her neutral obligations , etc. , Professor Stow - ell finds no evidence to support the German contention on any of these points .

		His thor - ough and critical analysis of the documents , and the evidence which he marshals in sup - port of his conclusions , will go far toward convincing impartial observers of the correct - ness of his findings .


Germany	LOCATION	's conduct is criticized severely .

		The invasion of
Belgium	LOCATION	, he remarks , has been compared to the case of a man who is guilty of a trespass in crossing his neighbor 's premises to escape from a fire ; but it would be fairer to compare it to the case of a man who does not wait to meet his adversary in a fair fight , but tries to reach him by shooting through the walls of an inter - vening house without regard to the lives of the helpless inmates .

		In a final chapter the author sums up his conclusions , and attempts to fix the chief responsibility for the war .

		This responsibil - ity falls mainly on the shoulders of
Germany	LOCATION	. ''


Germany	LOCATION	has clearly violated international law , and , if she does not succeed , even for the moment , in escaping punishment , the lesson will be as salutary as the example of
Bismarck	LOCATION	was delete - rious .

		Meanwhile , the manner in which she has held the rest of
Europe	LOCATION	in check compels the admiration of all beholders ... Should
Germany	LOCATION	be successful in carrying out the theories of her
Government	ORGANIZATION	, and her people , after the war-enthusi - asm is past , continue to support the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, which has put through its projects in disregard of its treaty obligations and of the peaceful existence of the individuals composing another nation , the student of events , seeking with impartial view , will have to admit that we are not yet ready for any great step forward ; that it is too early to recognize the practical existence of the society of humanity as such , including all peoples .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 109 A PRAGMATIC ILLUMINATION OF EDUCATION .

		* Divine philosophy has not always been hap - pily united with pedagogical theory .

		Not infrequently '' educators '' have but a superfi - cial philosophy ; while it must be admitted that there are philosophers who know little of the art of teaching .

		A great shout of wel - come should therefore go up when a profound thinker sets himself the task of a practical exposition of the most practical , as it is the most important , art in life , the art of education .

		Properly enough , a pragmatic philosopher , Professor
John Dewey	PERSON	, now of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, has accomplished this work ; and so for once etymology is justified of her children .

		Professor
Dewey	PERSON	and his daughter , Miss
Evelyn Dewey	PERSON	-LRB- who collected much of the material -RRB- , disclaim intent at a system or a text-book .

		Quoting the preface : '' We have tried to show what actually happens when schools start out to put into practice , each in its own way , some of the theories that have been pointed to as the soundest and best ever since
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, to be then laid politely away as precious portions of our ' intellectual heritage ' ... We have hoped to suggest to the reader the practical meaning of some of the more widely recognized and accepted views of educational reformers by showing what happens when a teacher applies these views . ''

		Notwithstanding the fact that this rather humble statement is an accurate description of the plan of the book , the ripe scholarship , the scrupulous soundness of the logic , and the art shown in presenting and massing the con - crete in a bath of luminous and consistent theory make of '' Schools of To-morrow '' a contribution of great importance .

		Professor
Dewey	PERSON	's thesis is based frankly upon
Rousseau	PERSON	's ''
Emile	PERSON	. ''

		The first chapter , `` Education as Development , '' is but a tren - chant exposition of
Rousseau	PERSON	's epoch-making views . ''

		We know nothing of childhood , and with our mistaken notions of it the further we go in education the more we go astray . ''

		Edu - cation must be '' based upon the native capaci - ties of those to be taught and upon the need of studying children in order to discover what these native powers are . '' ''

		Try to teach a child what is of use to him as a child , and you will find that it takes all his time . ''

		`` The greatest , the most important , the most useful rule of education is : Do not save time , but lose it . ''

		`` A child ill-taught is further from excellence than a child who has learned noth - ing at all . ''

		interest in , when he is interested in it .

		Do not anticipate the needs of adult life .

		Education is the development of power , not the acquisi - tion of information .

		All this has become the commonplace , even the semi-dangerous commonplace , of higher education in colleges and universities , screen - ing oftentimes hazy and slovenly ideas .

		But rightly interpreted , it is of immense impor - tance ; and the welcome news derived from '' Schools of To-morrow '' is that whereas there is in the schools of to-day an absolute line of cleavage between the elementary and higher institutions in this respect , the ele - mentary schools insisting on a fund of adult information while the higher schools bemoan the lack of intellectual power displayed by their product , the `` schools of to-morrow '' are insisting on the same rational basis for elementary instruction .

		Education , instead of following a silly calf trail for sixteen or eighteen years and then attempting to insti - tute radical reform when mental habits are fixed , is on the threshold of a simple and abso - lute reform , the process of starting right , and by natural methods developing the whole life of the child .

		Place of honor among the laboratory cases cited is given to Mrs.
Johnson	PERSON	's school at Fair - hope ,
Alabama	LOCATION	, which seems to follow closely
Rousseau	PERSON	's ideal .

		Professor
Dewey	PERSON	thinks that
Fairhope	LOCATION	`` has demonstrated that it is possible for children to lead the same natural lives in school that they lead in good homes outside of school hours ; to progress bodily , mentally , and morally in school without facti - tious pressure , rewards , examinations , grades or promotions , while they acquire sufficient control of the conventional tools of learning and of study of books reading , writing , and figuring to be able to use them indepen - dently . ''

		Professor
J. L. Meriam	PERSON	, Director of the
Elementary School	ORGANIZATION	in the
University of Missouri	ORGANIZATION	, bases his plan upon the four factors in the child 's life : play , stories , observation , and handiwork .

		As the children grow older their interest is naturally drawn , as they dis - cover their ignorance , to history , geography , and science .

		Grammar and English are not taught as such , but incidentally in connection with all their work .

		Investigation of local topography , industries , and general condi - tions is emphasized here , as in other '' reform '' schools .

		The value of Acting out the stories of mythology and history is another generally recognized principle .

		That the school can fit smoothly into local needs and exercise great influence as a social settlement is shown by the success of Mr.
Valentine	PERSON	's work in School 26 of
Indianapolis	LOCATION	.

		The prac - 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	tical work of this school has put new heart and vigor into a destitute and backward com - munity , and has gone far to solve the race problem .

		Here , and in many other schools cited , the object is immediate ends , not giv - ing the pupils the notion that they are getting ready to live , but actually living .

		This will seem to many , no doubt , a backward step , a tacit acceptance of
Browning	PERSON	's low man who , aiming at a unit , soon hits his hundred , but always fails of the thousand .

		One of the facts cited , that the boys show more interest in the cooking lessons than girls , is a rather bizarre proof of the appeal of immediate ends .

		Yet there can be little doubt that the general movement is wise .

		Education should begin at the feet , we must learn to hit the units .

		That is of the most importance to the most people .

		Indeed , it is of prime importance to all , and will later enable the few to hit the thousand with all the greater accuracy .

		Here and there throughout the book , as in the final chapter on '' Democracy and Educa - tion , '' the author exhibits something of the special pleader , or possibly it is only a too common academic blindness to the reality of grinding poverty in the world . ''

		It is a com - monplace among teachers and workers who come in contact with any number of pupils who leave school at fourteen to go to work , that the reason is not so much financial pres - sure as it is lack of conviction that school is doing them any good . ''

		This is no doubt true in many communities , where the well-to-do class predominates .

		It must be of these that Professor
Dewey	PERSON	is thinking ; for in all proba - bility he knows of the investigations of a former student of his in the Stock Yards dis - trict of
Chicago	LOCATION	, which revealed an altogether different state of affairs .

		* Professor
Dewey	PERSON	's analysis of the much discussed Montessori method should be of value to those whose knowledge depends mainly upon periodical-skimming .

		While ap - proving of the freedom of action which
Madame Montessori	ORGANIZATION	in common with most re - formers allows her pupils , he points out that her insistence on the use of her '' didactic material '' leaves their freedom restricted and of questionable importance . ''

		There is no freedom allowed the child to create .

		He is free to choose which apparatus he will use , but never to choose his own ends , never to bend a material to his own plans .

		There is no doubt that backward children derive profit from the ' didactic material , ' but after all it appears that various American reformers have learned how systemati - cally to educe power , creativeness , in the normal * Dr.
E. L. Talbcrt	PERSON	put the question to 331 boys and girls who had left school at 14 , when the pressure of the law was lifted , and 171 answered that they had to earn money .

		child by permitting him to range freely over his material and adapt it to his own ends . ''

		This word `` freedom '' is the shibboleth of the schools of to-morrow .

		A year or so ago , Mr.
Edmond Holmes	PERSON	, in his little book enti - tled `` The Tragedy of Education , '' wrote much on this subject to very good purpose .

		It is wholly right for a child '' to find the necessity in things , not in the caprices of man . ''

		to feel the curb of conditions , not of authority .

		And Professor
Dewey	PERSON	does well to point out that '' no discipline could be more severe , more apt to develop character and reasonableness , nor less apt to develop disorder and laziness '' than the discipline which is self-taught and self-imposed .

		The only weakness in practi - cal results , a weakness that neither he nor Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	nor Mrs.
Johnson	PERSON	nor Mr.
Wirt	PERSON	nor Mr.
Valentine	PERSON	nor Professor
Meriam nor Rousseau	PERSON	is aware of , is the difficulty of get - ting teachers wise enough to administer free - dom of this sort .

		Here and there is a genius who knows how ; but these geniuses , sadly enough , do not impart their genius .

		An ordi - nary person can learn how to get results by following rules , but it must be an extraor - dinary person who gets results without rules .

		In its philosophy , its literature , its religion , humanity has so far always proceeded by rule and line ; only the geniuses have from time to time made new rules and struck off new lines .

		And after each epochal genius , when the plod - ding student-teacher follows the master , the method becomes again stereotyped .

		Professor
Dewey	PERSON	sees clearly the Scylla of the old and the Charybdis of the new : '' The problem of educational readjustment thus has to steer between the extremes of an inherited bookish education and a narrow , so-called prac - tical , education .

		It is comparatively easy to clamor for a retention of traditional materials and meth - ods on the ground that they alone are liberal and cultural .

		It is comparatively easy to urge the addi - tion of narrow , vocational training for those who , it is assumed , are to be the drawers of water and the hewers of wood in the existing economic regime , leaving intact the present bookish type of education for those fortunate enough not to have to engage in manual labor in the home , shop , or farm .

		But since the real question is one of or - ganization of all education to meet the changed conditions of life scientific , social , political ac - companying the revolution in industry , the experi - ments which have been made with this wider end in view are especially deserving of sympathetic recog - nition and intelligent examination . ''

		Some minor faults of style are to be found in the volume , such as frequently occur when a writer is thinking mainly of his matter .

		`` Apt '' is regularly used in the sense of `` likely '' ; and the rather naive redundancy .


1915	DATE	J THE DIAL in '' to try an experiment , '' occurs so often as to merit rebuke .

		There is also considerable repetition , owing in part to the plan of the book .

		And there is the inevitable resume of former conditions of industry as compared with the present .

		But nevertheless , the vol - ume is admirable in material and arrange - ment ; and the very repetition only serves to add to its unity and drive home its central theme .

PERCIVAL BEYER	PERSON	.

		RECENT AMERICAN ONE-ACT PLAYS .

		* One of the interesting tendencies in recent drama is the rise in popularity of the one-act play .

		The Irish school , perhaps , deserves chief credit for showing the possibilities of the one-act form , especially in tragedy and in whimsical comedy .

		In
America	LOCATION	, Mr.
Percy Mackaye	PERSON	was a pioneer in this field , and he has had many followers .

		The extent to which the one-act piece is now being cultivated sug - gests that it may come to rival even the short story in popular favor .

		Of the twenty-two one-act plays by Amer - ican writers considered in the present review , three have to do with the European war .

		The nineteen others are singularly free from the propagandist taint which infects so large a proportion of recent English and continental plays .

		Probably it may be said that there are three aims among which , or among combina - tions of which , a dramatist must choose .

		He may aim to represent characters in an action with impartial truthfulness , caring to give pleasure only or chiefly through the fidelity of his representation .

		Or he may aim to rep - resent characters so as to give pleasure through , appeals to humor , sentiment , or imagination , caring less for truth and reality .

		Or he may aim to represent characters so as to enforce a doctrine or lesson , subordinating both truth and pleasure to this end .

		A pure type of the first class may be found in

		the third , in the mediaeval moralities and in some of the plays of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	and Brieux .

		The first two objects are the legitimate ideals of drama ; when the third becomes dominant , the writer must expect to be regarded pri - marily as a preacher , not as a dramatist .

		It is encouraging to find so little of this preaching tendency in the recent representative Amer - ican plays .

		Two of the three war plays , '' War Brides '' and `` Across the Border , '' on the whole justify their dramatic form . ''

		War Brides '' is an attack on war from the woman 's point of view .

		It is a vigorous and timely protest against the insult to womanhood implied in the custom to which the title alludes .

		The heroine has been married some months before the war , and her husband is at the front .

		The story deals with her attempt to influence the girls in her vil - lage against war marriages , an attempt which brings her into conflict with the .

		au - thorities .

		Her indignation and horror at the cynical treatment of what she holds most sacred are raised to a tragic pitch by the news of her husband 's death in battle .

		She is preg - nant ; but rather than bear a child who may be sacrificed to '' the good of the Empire , '' she commits suicide .

		She is not a character who interests us greatly ; she is primarily a mouth - piece for individualist and pacifist ideas ; but these ideas are vigorously expressed , and are vitally related to the dramatic situation .

		The play is a good example of the effective use of drama for propagandist purposes .

		`` Across the Border '' bases its protest against war on more broadly human grounds ; partly , perhaps , for this reason it is a much better play .

		It is better , too , because the author is really interested in her hero as a person .

		The play makes skilful use of the now familiar device of a dream .

		Desperately wounded in an attempt to bring rescue to beleaguered comrades , the Junior Lieutenant in his delirious dream crosses - '' the border '' of death .

		What he sees there convinces him of the shameful cruelty and wrong of the whole system and ideal of war , and he begs for leave to return and try to make some of his com - rades understand .

		In the final scene in the improvised hospital he struggles to his gallant and pitiful failure .

		Written plainly , without declamation or sentimentality , the play makes a powerful and genuinely dramatic appeal .

		In Mr.
Hagedorn	PERSON	's '' Makers of v Madness , '' on the other hand , the doctrine completely crowds out the dramatic element .

		The com - position is not a play at all ; it is an attempt to show through dialogue how war might be forced on the
United States	LOCATION	and an empire -LRB- clearly
Germany	LOCATION	-RRB- by the selfish interests of 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	militarists , politicians , and manufacturers of arms .

		There is a scene in the capital of each country , and then an impressionistic glimpse of a battle-field .

		A pamphlet may be more readable if cast in the form of dialogue , but the title-page should not call it a play .

		In his latest volume , Mr.
George Middleton	PERSON	gives us some nearly perfect examples of our first-mentioned class of plays , those which aim above all at impartial truthfulness .

		The action in these little dramas is mostly psycho - logical , or shall we say ?

		spiritual .

		The very impartiality of Mr.
Middleton	PERSON	's attitude toward conventional morality has brought upon him the accusation of writing his plays to prove something ; but the charge is an unfair one .

		He presents no theses ; he tries merely to depict his people and their problems with delicate and intimate accuracy .

		Placed in a given situation , how will each character in a small group conduct himself ?

		A young woman who has married to escape the frigid - ity of a loveless home finds that she can not live in peace with her worthless and unfaith - ful husband .

		So , taking her child , she returns one evening to her father and mother , peo - ple who , without love , have kept up a respecta - ble appearance .

		How will the characters speak and act in this first interview ?

		This is the problem of '' Circles . '' ''

		The Groove '' is simply a bedtime talk between two sisters , of whom the elder has stayed at home to take care of an invalid mother , and the younger has just returned from college .

		Each has a plan to confide to the other , but the plans are hopelessly in conflict .

		How will the situation develop ?

		It is obvious that plays of this sort would require the most finished and intelli - gent acting if they were to have any success on the stage ; and even with this , the success of some of them would be doubtful .

		Mr.
Middleton	PERSON	's characters are drawn admirably , but with an impartiality critical rather than sympathetic .

		His attitude toward them is too much that of an entomologist toward his specimens ; his curiosity is too largely intel - lectual .

		He not only lacks sympathy , but , as might be expected , he lacks humor ; this is especially noticeable in '' The Black Tie , '' and also in '' The Unborn , '' where the perspective is at times curiously distorted .

		By all odds the best of the plays is `` A Good Woman '' ; with this possible exception , Mr.
Middleton	PERSON	, conscientious and skilful artist as he is , leaves us a little cold .

		Much less mature and finished are the plays in Mr.
Percival Wilde	PERSON	's collection .

		Mr.
Wilde	PERSON	seems to be experimenting in various direc - tions .

		As yet he cares too little for truth to life , and he lacks a sure sense for stage effect .

		In `` A House of Cards '' he uses somewhat clumsily the dangerous device of misleading the audience . ''

		Playing with Fire '' is a rather sophomoric study of '' calf love . ''

		`` The Traitor '' is based on an oddly false notion of human nature , the notion that a traitor may infallibly be detected by his zeal in urging mercy for another supposed traitor .

		The other pieces , however , show decided promise ; and the best of them , `` Dawn , '' is a really strong and brilliant little study in heroism .

		Here and there in Mr.
Wilde	PERSON	's work one feels the influence of Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	.

		The four paper-bound plays by Mr.
Ken	PERSON	- neth
Sawyer Goodman	PERSON	show a keen sense of stage values and a considerable range .

		They would probably act better than the plays of either Mr.
Middleton	PERSON	or Mr.
Wilde	PERSON	.

		Some of them , indeed , have been acted , though with what success I do not know .

		They seem especially well adapted to amateur produc - tion ; the settings are simple , the action is rapid , and the parts make no heavy demand upon the actors .

		`` Back of the Yards '' is a strong and realistic little drama of tenement - house life in
Chicago	LOCATION	, dealing with the turn - ing point in a street boy 's career . ''

		The Game of Chess '' is a cleverly constructed and stir - ring melodrama in miniature , presenting a nihilist 's attempt on the life of a Czar .

		`` Ephraim and the Winged Bear '' is a sort of fantastic morality , amusing but a trifle too grotesque for complete success . ''

		Barbara '' is apparently an attempt to burlesque Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, an ambitious and tolerably rash undertaking .

		The fact is that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, having reached the limit of extravagance pos - sible to sanity , can twiddle his fingers at the parodists .

		Mr.
Goodman	PERSON	's terrible young per - son seems scarcely more than a faint copy of a
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	heroine , and his valet deus ex machina a rather wooden imitation of the omniscient Shavian waiter .

		In contrast with Mr.
Goodman	PERSON	's high spir - its and exuberant cleverness is the tone of simple and quiet sincerity of the ``
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Plays . ''

		Miss
Gale	PERSON	's `` The Neighbors '' is a charming little study of life in a small village .

		It is reported that Mis '
Ellsworth	PERSON	, who , with her husband 's scanty pension , has a hard time making ends meet , has had a telegram an - nouncing that her orphaned nephew of seven is coming to live with her .

		All the neighbors join forces to get up a `` shower '' surprise party for her .

		When preparations are nearly completed .

		Mis '
Ellsworth	PERSON	appears at Mis ' Abel 's with another telegram saying that after all the little boy is to be adopted by an uncle .

		In this simple plot are introduced a number of delightful people , admirably char -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 113 acterized .

		Who can forget '' Grandma , '' for instance , with her experienced wisdom and her rebellion against carpet rags ?

		Mr.
Dick	PERSON	- inson 's `` In Hospital '' is a severely realistic sketch of the human aspects of a serious operation .

		Though scarcely dramatic at all in the narrower sense of the word , in the hands of a great actor it would be immensely effective .

		Mr.
Leonard	PERSON	's '' Glory of the Morning '' is pitched on a distinctly lower level .

		The heroine , for whom the play is named , is the Winnebago squaw of a French fur-trader ; the latter turns out to be a noble - man in exile , who wishes to take their chil - dren back with him to
France	LOCATION	.

		For some reason the American Indian makes intracta - ble material for drama .

		I can not recall a single good dramatic presentation of him in his native state .

		In the present case , part of the difficulty is that the story calls for a more poetic and imaginative treatment than the author has given it .

		Altogether , in achievement as well as in promise , this is a notable group of plays .

		Ten years ago it could not have been matched by any selection of one-act pieces written in
America	LOCATION	.

		It looks as if we were going to see in this generation a really American drama .

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		A life of prodigious achievement .

		As bluff
John Hunter	PERSON	, the famous surgeon , anatomist , and physiologist , once said , '' no man that wanted to be a great man ever was a great man . ''

		A fine example of true greatness and entire freedom from any desire for great - ness in the world 's eyes may be found in the late Director of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, who came to that office , with its arduous work of construction and organization , after hav - ing virtually created the
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	Hos - pital in
Baltimore	LOCATION	, the Surgeon-General 's Library and its justly celebrated catalogue in
Washington	LOCATION	, and the laboratory of hygiene for the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	in
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia , not to mention earlier and perhaps more heroic though less widely known achievements elsewhere .

		These various ser - vices to science and to humanity are now care - fully recorded , with much else of a more intimately biographical character , by his friend and co-worker in medicine , Dr.
Fielding H. Garrison	PERSON	, in a substantial octavo volume entitled ``
John Shaw	PERSON	Billings : A Memoir '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Of good
New England	LOCATION	stock , but of Hoosier birth and early training , Billings was forced to work his way through the suc - cessive stages of his academic and medical education , and the fact that he had to fight out one winter of this Spartan experience on
seventy-five cents	MONEY	a week may help to explain , now that we have the details of his life before us , the hitherto unsuspected battles that he was compelled to wage with bodily infirmities during the greater part of his maturity .

		Eight times he underwent surgical operations , chiefly of a critical nature , and always except the last time he kept secret from his family the cause of these `` short vacations , '' as he lightly styled them .

		Therefore the record of his eminent and varied services to his fellow-men , impressive though it had seemed before , gains immeasurably in significance when one learns , from Dr.
Garrison	PERSON	's faithful presentation of Billings 's life-struggle , the various handicaps and disabilities under which those brilliantly distinguished services were rendered .

		The customary equipment of illustrations , bibliography , genealogy , and index is not wanting to this carefully prepared biography , which , let it be added , has been made , as far as possible , autobiographical in character by the frequent insertion of pas - sages from Dr. Billings 's writings , including a fragment of veritable autobiography .

		, , .

		In `` A German - American 's Con - The apologia .

		of a , German - feSSlOU of Faith -LRB-
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- , Professor
Kuno Francke	PERSON	of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	has brought together five articles and three poems already published in various newspapers and periodicals .

		Among the arti - cles is the now famous open letter to Con - gressman Bartholdt on `` Neutrality , '' which brings out clearly the difference between the author 's undiluted Americanism and the rabid Teutonism of Messrs.
Ridder	PERSON	,
Viereck	PERSON	, and their congeners .

		In this connection , it is interesting to note the writer 's statement that the letter was refused publication by the
New York	LOCATION	'' Staats-Zeitung . ''

		For his mod - eration and tolerance , and his observance of the amenities during controversy , Professor
Francke	PERSON	deserves commendation above other German - American apologists , and one is glad to think that he is the spokesman for many silent and thoughtful Americans of Teutonic descent who do not approve of the vocifer - ous propaganda undertaken by their self - appointed leaders .

		Yet Professor

1848	DATE	; Professor
Francke	PERSON	has been bred under the star of Hohenzollern imperial - ism , and like most Germans of the profes - sorial class is destitute of what we somewhat 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	ambiguously call '' political sense . ''

		His ideal of government is a benevolent despotism in which the ills of the people are healed with paternal care .


Germany	LOCATION	's cause , as he sees it , is just , not because her manner of starting the war or her conduct in
Belgium	LOCATION	is justifiable -LRB- these are matters about which the author is significantly silent -RRB- , but because ``
Germany	LOCATION	to-day is the best governed country in the world . ''

		Here `` best '' plainly means `` most efficiently . ''

		That the gap between this sort of political thinking and the ideals of Amer - ican democracy is too wide to be bridged over by a few occasional pamphlets must surely be evident to Professor
Francke	PERSON	's lucid and re - flective mind .

		^ iGr of the '' Mind and Health Series '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of which three numbers have appeared .

		The first is by Dr.
James J. Putnam	PERSON	, and deals with '' Human Motives . ''

		It is a well chosen theme , and is presented with a quiet dignity and earnest purpose that is consoling when not convincing .

		Dr.
Putnam	PERSON	finds two sources of motives , one in the mental and genetic series of impulses to which we are all subject , and the other in the philosophical or religious inculcation , whence comes the support of ideals .

		The two , in his opinion , have an equal authenticity and an equal value .

		The theme , though attractively set forth , tends to merge into vagueness and lose the substantial groundwork that one looks for in a physi - cian 's outlook .

		The residue of good counsel justifies the essay .

		In the second volume of the series , Dr.
Isador H. Coriat	PERSON	writes of '' The Meaning of Dreams , '' finding that mean - ing in the Freudian notion of repressed wishes reconstructed by the dream motives of dis - guise and indirect expression .

		He sets forth the principle of interpretation , and adds a number of instances of dreams thus inter - preted -LRB- largely in relation to sex desires and symbolisms -RRB- from his own records .

		Thus summarized and stated in loose order , they seem utterly unconvincing , and verge upon the strained logical contortions which Baco - nian '' provers '' of their Shakespearean posi - tions have made familiar .

		It scarcely seems probable that the popularization of this move - ment by evidence thus inviting misconception on the part of the lay reader , serves any useful purpose .

		The third volume is by the editor of the series , and bears the title , '' Sleep and Sleeplessness , '' -- though the longest chapter in the book deals with the somewhat irrelevant theme of `` Dreams and the Supernatural . ''

		The volume is distinctly uncritical , and re - peats the exploded ''
Caspar Hauser	PERSON	'' myth as real evidence , while the view of premonitory dreams is hardly standard .

		The practical counsel offered by Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	in regard to sleep and sleeplessness is sound and well put .

		Mr.
Franklin Spencer Edmonds	PERSON	is the author , and his book appro - priately gives considerably more than half of its substance to
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's services in the field from
1861	DATE	to
1865	DATE	.

		Almost innumerable , as the writer admits , are the accounts we already have of the memorable deeds of this great military commander ; but the lesson of his life will bear repeated interpretation with the passage of the years .

		Also , the publication in recent times of memoirs and letters by various friends and contemporaries of
General Grant m &	ORGANIZATION	kes possible to-day a fuller and truer account of the man than ever before .

		Com - paratively recent are , for example , the au - tobiographic and reminiscent writings of
Generals Howard	ORGANIZATION	and
James Harrison Wilson	PERSON	and
Morris Schaff	PERSON	and
Carl Schurz	PERSON	, the pub - lication of
Gideon Welles	PERSON	's diary , and the issue of General
Meade	PERSON	's `` Life and Letters . ''

		In his bibliography of important aids to the study of
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's life , Mr.
Edmonds	PERSON	makes no mention of the Howard autobiography , one of the most valuable and interesting of the military memoirs relating to our great con - flict and its principal commanders ; but he does quote some words of
Howard	ORGANIZATION	's illustra - tive of
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's methods as a soldier .

		Within the modest compass allowed him , the author has produced a handy and readable history of his hero , and one that bears evidences of more than perfunctory preliminary study .

		The frontispiece shows Grant as he looked at

		Problems of unemployment .

		Although Miss
Frances A. Kel	PERSON	- lor makes no claim that her book '' Out of Work '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is other than a revision of her earlier work bearing the same title , the scope and content of the present book show little ` resemblance to those of the former edition .

		Unemploy - ment continues to be our most difficult and perplexing social problem .

		No one can claim to have found a solution for this standing reproach to our modern industrial system .

		Yet it is some satisfaction to know that in
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 115
America	LOCATION	as elsewhere the eleven years which have elapsed since the first edition of Miss Kellor 's book appeared have borne some fruit in thoughtful attention to and hopeful plans for combatting the evil of enforced idleness .

		Such subjects as regular ization of employ - ment , dovetailing of industries , unemploy - ment insurance , and vocational guidance , methods which are now the most urged by reformers for lessening unemployment or re - lieving it from its most serious consequences , were not discussed a decade ago .

		Miss
Kel	PERSON	- lor 's earlier work was devoted entirely to a study of employment agencies and intelli - gence offices .

		Considerable improvement in the work of the public agencies and better regulation of the private offices have taken place since then ; but much remains to be done before these agencies for the distribu - tion of labor are in a condition to render adequate service .

		Miss Kellor believes that the most hopeful development of this side of the work lies in the establishment of munici - pal employment bureaus cooperating with Federal agencies for the distribution of labor .

		She also urges an intensive study of the extent and causes of unemployment in every locality , and of the possibilities of increasing employment .

		The better organization of pri - vate industries with the purpose in view of reducing the long periods of idleness now found in the seasonal trades , and the planning of government work with a view to its per - formance in dull times , more intelligent direc - tion of children in industry , and cautious experiments in the way of insurance against unemployment are the other more important features in the programme for
America	LOCATION	suggested in the closing chapter of the book .

		If proof is wanted that the first autobiography .

		6ssential to success in the world is self-confidence , one need but turn to Sir
Hiram S. Maxim	PERSON	's breezy relation of his own rise from obscurity and poverty to fame and fortune .

		From his first invention , a remarkably efficient mouse-trap , to his latest triumphs in smokeless powder and auto - matic guns , he has shown himself a man of endless resource , in shrewdness and capabil - ity and ingenuity entirely worthy of his Yankee birth and breeding .

		There is some - thing splendid in his well-grounded faith in his own powers .

		Whether it was a wild bull to be subdued with bare hands , or a village bully to be laid low , or some inventive '' stunt '' to perform in mechanics , chemistry , elec - tricity , or the fashioning of lethal weapons , he was always equal to the occasion ; and his manner of recounting these triumphs is as characteristic as his mode of achieving them .

		A certain primitive openness , directness , forcefulness , speaks in his pages .

		He writes exactly as a large and strong man who has done notable things in the world of matter and force ought to write ; and he shows a memory for details , an ability to marshal his facts impressively and sometimes pictur - esquely , that one finds highly enjoyable .

		As an illustration of the versatility of his genius , let it be noted that Sir
Hiram	PERSON	has invented an inhaler for the cure of bronchitis , of which , he says , '' large numbers are now being sold all over the world . ''

		What wonder that , after fashioning so many instruments for the slaughter of his fellow-men , he takes pride in this device for saving their lives ?

		The book , certainly one of the best of its kind , and bear - ing the short but sufficient title , `` My Life '' -LRB- McBride -RRB- , is well illustrated and in other technical details worthy of its theme , the history of a man who has always hated care - less craftsmanship , A handbook on commission government .

		As an argument for commission government , Mr.
Osw	PERSON	r ald
Ryan	PERSON	's `` Municipal Freedom , '' in the series called '' The American Books '' -LRB- Double - day -RRB- , leaves little to be desired .

		As an attempt to weigh commission government carefully and discriminate between its advan - tages and its deficiencies , it is very far from satisfactory .

		All the benefits to be secured by this wiping out of the entire structure of the old city government the centralization of power and responsibility , the weakening of meaningless party lines , the emphasizing of honesty and efficiency are enumerated , with detailed reference to the experience of various cities .

		But the author does not tell us why , as yet , commission government has seldom proved a notable success except in cities of the third or fourth class in population .

		He does not show the justice of the theory that city government is almost purely a business institution , with few legislative functions , or demonstrate how the decisions of a small body of expert executives in questions of policy will satisfy the public as would those of a repre - sentative assembly .

		One extraordinary fea - ture is the chapter upon '' The Coming of the Burgomaster , '' in which the author gives his hearty approval to the scheme for a city manager , apparently without fully realizing that in its essence it is very distinct from the commission form , while even the commis - sion-manager plan is a long step toward the view that municipal administration is an exact science rather than an opportunity for business knack .

		Much may indeed be hoped 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	from the innovations in city government ; but books such as this will scarcely convince us that it is not the infusing spirit , as opposed to the machinery , that counts for most .

		Add that it all befell in '' the days of the Free - lance proper , the
last decade of the eighteenth century	DATE	, '' and that the central scene is laid in the beauteous vale of
Kashmir	LOCATION	.

		Then picture a glorious - visaged , sweet-hearted Afghan prin - cess , in whose company our hero learned that `` the desire for female beauty is at best the desire for a compelling deity in whose service men may strike their best notes . ''

		After that prepare your ear for strange legends of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity in this distant valley , and an echo of the `` hundredth name of God '' and the '' omnific word . ''

		And if you will do all this , you may read a romance that will quicken your blood , and incidentally convey a very living conception of men 's life and farings in a most picturesque land at a most stirring time .

		The story referred to , `` A Freelance in
Kashmir	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , is from the pen of Lieut.-Col .


G. F. MacMunn	PERSON	, and is written in a style that is vigorous and forward-moving rather than scrupulously careful or highly polished .

		A few slips in the proofreading ought not to have been made ; but they will probably be more irritating to conscientious reviewers than to anybody else .

		The unexplored immensity of Beckoning ^ jg universe in which we live , its perennial freshness and won - derfulness , its endless multiplicity in unity , the fascination of its abiding mystery these qualities speak in Mr.
Richard Le Gallienne	PERSON	's `` Vanishing Roads , and Other Essays '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- , a collection of short prose studies and sketches reprinted from various magazines , whose editors the author thanks for their `` discernment '' in giving the pieces `` their first opportunity with the reader . ''

		Discern - ing these editors unquestionably were , and one hopes that many additional readers will profit by the discernment of the publishing house which now issues the essays in book-form .

		Too well known to require notice at this late day are Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	's engaging qualities as a writer of prose , his sympathetic interpreta - tion of nature , his enthusiasm for the best in literature and art , the breadth of his view of things human and divine , the occasional stimu - lating audacities of his thought and style .

		Generous in his praise and unequivocal in his condemnation , he expresses his opinions with no cautious restraint .

		Of a certain gifted actor 's rendering of the final scene in '' Ham - let '' he says : '' I would not exchange any - thing I have ever read or seen for
Forbes	ORGANIZATION	-
Robertson	PERSON	as he sits there so still and starlit upon the throne of
Denmark	LOCATION	. ''

		And of mod - ern magazine editorship he writes with a plentitude of disapprobation that suggests no little experience -LRB- as a contributor -RRB- of that whereof he speaks .

		His picture of the nimble and sprightly old lady of eighty dancing the tango with him is most enjoyable .

		From the first of the book 's twenty-nine chapters , the one that gives its name to the collection , let us quote , in closing , the concluding passage : `` For a while the murmur of the running stream of Time shall be our fellow-wayfarer till , at last , up there against the sky-line , we too turn and wave our hands , and know for ourselves where the road wends as it goes to meet the stars .

		And others will stand as we to-day and watch us reach the top of the ridge and disappear , and wonder how it seemed to us to turn the radiant corner and vanish with the rest along the vanishing road . ''

		A manual of wild bird culture .

		The ever-increasing need of constructive efforts to conserve the remnant of the wild fowl and other native birds grows rapidly apace as agriculture progresses and the forests disap - pear , and especially as drainage , reclamation , and flood-control destroy the feeding and breeding grounds of the water birds .

		The difficulties of taming the wild fowl , though great , are not insuperable ; and losses from disease among domesticated wild fowl , espe - cially quail and grouse , though depleting at times , may be avoided by proper preventive measures .

		These and many other practical matters of interest to the would-be cultivator of quail , grouse , pheasants , wild turkeys , partridges , pigeons , doves , and waterfowl generally are discussed in Mr.
Herbert K. Job	PERSON	's `` Propagation of Wild Birds '' -LRB- Double - day -RRB- , a manual of applied ornithology de - signed to assist the experimenter and the culturist .

		It is a constructive work , based on wide observation of and experience with the birds whose culture is advocated .

		Illustrations show details of equipment and procedure , and
1915	DATE	THE DIAL 117 delineate the success of well-directed effort .

		Attention is also given to the method and equipment useful in encouraging native song birds to make their homes in garden , field , and forest .

		`` Winter feeding , nesting sites , nesting boxes , and water and food supply , are discussed , and methods of protection against and warfare on predatory enemies , not omitting the roaming house cat , are advo - cated .

		The book should do much to encourage the preservation of our native birds .

		That a citizen of
Indiana	LOCATION	, born of a line of
Massachusetts Puritans	LOCATION	, and himself a soldier in the
Union	ORGANIZATION	army , has been able to write , in his later years , a book so evidently disposed to fairness constitutes a basis for optimism as to the progress of historical scholarship in Amer - ica .

		One topic African Slavery is funda - mental to the work .

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	shows that he has control of the original materials , and of the monographic literature of late years .

		His estimate of
John Brown	PERSON	is far different from the traditional Northern view ; and in connec - tion with his narrative of the Dred
Scott deci	PERSON	- sion he has made use of the recently-published `` Writings of
James Buchanan	PERSON	. ''

		But while the topic of slavery is thus well documented and well developed , the emphasis upon this one subject is not in accord with the historical vision of to-day , which in the effort to account for the Civil War now insists upon an exam - ination of other elements , the influence of immigration and the diffusion of European race stocks , the development of the transcon - tinental railroads , and the like .

		Even as to negro slavery , the author has apparently left unexamined the writings of Mr.

		In its revival in the nine - teenth century , both in English and in French , it is `` a poetic trifle , rarely concerned with the solemnities of life . ''

		Miss

		It deals in some detail with the origins of the type from the Provengal balada and the bal - lette , and considers it during the years after the fourteenth century when it was a conven - tional form for expression of more or less barren thoughts on religion , death , the transi - toriness of existence -LRB- the `` Ubi sunt '' poems -RRB- , courtly love , satire , and history .

Van Loon	PERSON	's is of the temporary obscuration of
Holland	LOCATION	by
France	LOCATION	.

		118 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 15	DATE	BRIEFER MENTION .

		A new edition , revised and enlarged , of
George Palmer Putnam	PERSON	's '' The World 's Progress '' has been continued to date under the editorial super - vision of the compiler 's son , Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, and is published under the title , '' Tabular Views of Universal History '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The original scheme has been preserved of presenting , in parallel columns , a record of the most note - worthy events in the world 's history , a scheme which adapts itself admirably to the needs of the student who wishes to memorize dates and events through the assistance of visual association .

		To this new edition is added an index an indis - pensable aid for quick reference to a volume of this kind .

		Two useful handbooks for those who conduct meetings under the rules of parliamentary law have recently been issued .

		The latest revision of `` Robert 's Rules of Order Revised '' -LRB-
Scott	LOCATION	,
Fores	PERSON	- man
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- contains nearly twice as much mate - rial as the last previous edition of this little vol - ume , which has practically been accepted as the standard manual on parliamentary points since its first publication in
1876	DATE	. ''


Shattuck	PERSON	's Parliamen - tary Answers '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	,
Lee & Shepard Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is '' alphabetically arranged for all questions likely to arise in women 's organizations . ''

		It is more informal than ''
Robert	PERSON	's Rules , '' and perhaps on that account may seem better adapted to the needs of the novice .

		In `` American Women in Civic Work '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- ,
Miss Helen Christine Bennett	PERSON	has described the careers of eleven living American women who have attained distinction in some branch of social work or civic service .

		Portions of the sketches were printed originally in some of the popular magazines , and the readable quality which ap - peared in them has been preserved .

		Of the women whose public service is described , the best known , perhaps , are
Jane Addams	PERSON	,
Anna Howard Shaw	PERSON	,
Ella Flagg Young	PERSON	,
Lucretia L. Blankenburg	PERSON	,
Frances A. Kellor	PERSON	, and
Annie Fellows Bacon	ORGANIZATION	.

		The sketches are highly appreciative , even lauda - tory ; yet in no instances do they become extrava - gant .

		There should be inspiration in them for women everywhere .

		Teaching literature through emphasis on its human and personal aspects , through a study of the picturesque features of its background , and through an appeal to the dramatic instinct of the boy or girl of high-school age , has been the aim of Miss
Maude Morrison Frank	PERSON	in the preparation of her little volume of five '' Short Plays about Famous Authors '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		The idea is novel and practical , and much helpful fun is in store for the pupils who decide under
Miss Frank	ORGANIZATION	's guidance to impersonate Goldsmith entertaining
Squire Featherston	PERSON	with school-boy swagger ,
Heine	PERSON	at twenty-one ,
Fanny Burney at Court	ORGANIZATION	, the family of the eleven-year-old
Charles Dickens	PERSON	released from debt on Christmas Eve , or
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, in the fairies ' realm defying Time himself with the aid of Titania and
Puck	LOCATION	.

		The views of Sir Oliver Lodge on '' The War and After '' will be published in book form at an early date . ''

		Towards International Government '' is the title of a new work by Mr.
John A. Hobson	PERSON	, which will be published shortly .

		A new novel by Mr.
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	, author of ''
Carnival	ORGANIZATION	, '' etc. , will be published in
September	DATE	under the title of '' Guy and
Pauline	PERSON	. ''

		Maxim Gorky 's vivid autobiographic memoirs of his childhood and youth , now appearing in '' The English Review , '' will be brought out in book form by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The Mask of Death , '' an autobiographical frag - ment by
Gabriele D'Annunzio	PERSON	, has been translated with an introduction by Arundel del Re , and will be published before long in
London	LOCATION	. ''

		The Admirable Painter : A Study of Leon - ardo da Vinci , '' by Mr.
A. J. Anderson	PERSON	, based on the painter 's notebooks , and illustrated with repro - ductions of his works , is soon to appear .

		Mrs.
John Lane	PERSON	has in the press a companion volume to her sprightly book , `` According to
Maria	LOCATION	, '' entitled '' Maria Again . ''

		It will shortly be published in this country by the
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` An American Garland , '' being a collection of ballads relating to
America	LOCATION	, 1563-1759 , has been compiled and edited by Professor
C. H. Firth	PERSON	, and will be published early in
September	DATE	by Mr.
B. H. Blackwell	PERSON	of Oxford . ''

		Sunset Balconies '' is the title of a new volume of poems by Mr.
Thomas Walsh	PERSON	his first since the appearance five years ago of '' Prison Ships and Other Poems '' which the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		plan to issue next month .

		The new novel of Irish life by
George A. Bir	PERSON	- mingham , which will appear next month under the title of '' Gossamer , '' is brought down to the world crisis in
August	DATE	last , and culminates in the effect on the lives and fortunes of its characters of the declaration of war .

		A coming addition to the books about the
Kaiser	PERSON	will be Mr.
Edward Legge	PERSON	's '' The Public and Private Life of
Wilhelm II.	PERSON	, '' to be published shortly .

		Mr.
Legge	PERSON	is the author of biographies of
King Edward VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		and the
Empress Eugenie	ORGANIZATION	, both of which have won considerable attention .

		A book of personal reminiscences and impres - sions of
Bronson Alcott	PERSON	and his family , by a friend of the famous transcendentalist , is announced in the volume of `` Alcott Memoirs , '' compiled from the papers , journals , and memoranda of the late Dr.
Frederick L. H. Willis	PERSON	.

		In a literary way , the book is likely to prove one of the most interesting of the autumn season .

		A new romance by Mr.
Anthony Hope	PERSON	, entitled , `` A Young Man 's Year '' the first novel to come from the author since the publication four years ago of '' Mrs.
Maxon	PERSON	Protests '' is announced for autumn publication .

		The hero of `` A Young Man 's Year '' is ``
Arthur Lisle	PERSON	, of the Middle
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 119
Temple	ORGANIZATION	,
Esquire	ORGANIZATION	, '' and the story recounts his for - tunes and his doings , professional , speculative , and venturesome .

		Under the title of '' The Superman in Modern Literature '' there will shortly be published the translation of a work by
Leo Berg	PERSON	, tracing the genesis of the superman idea far beyond the days of
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, through a great number of writers , many of them outside
Germany	LOCATION	, including
Carlyle	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Kierkegaard	LOCATION	,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	, and Renan , showing how the superman idea has permeated the work of modern poets and novelists , especially in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Undeterred by the storm of contumely brought down upon him by the publication of his '' Common Sense about the War , '' Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	is planning the early publication of a detailed discus - sion of the settlement that must follow the war . ''

		I am the gravest public danger that confronts
England	LOCATION	, '' announced Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	recently , '' because I have the strange power of turning the nation pas - sionately away from the truth by the simple act of uttering it . ''


Thomas Young Crowell	PERSON	, founder and for many years head of the publishing business now known as the
Thomas Y. Crowell Co.	ORGANIZATION	, died in
Montclair	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	, on
July 29	DATE	.

		Mr.
Crowell	PERSON	was a prominent figure among the older school of American publish - ers .

		In the work of making the classics of literature available at a low price in well-produced form he was almost a pioneer in this country ; and on other accounts , also , his name deserves to be held in honored remembrance in the annals of American publishing .

		Some sidelights on the Franco-Prussian war and the establishment of the
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	are prom - ised in the '' Memoirs of
M. Thiers	PERSON	, '' to be pub - lished shortly .

		The book is compiled from personal papers , notes , memoranda , and other documents left by
Thiers	PERSON	.

		A selection of these , dealing with the years 1870-1872 , was edited by
Thiers	ORGANIZATION	's sister - in-law and his former secretary , and printed in
France	LOCATION	for private circulation .

		The book has now been translated into English by Mr.
F. M. Atkinson	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Richard Whiteing	PERSON	's volume of reminiscences , to be called '' My Harvest , '' will be published in the
early autumn	DATE	.

		It gives an account of Mr.
White	PERSON	- ing 's early life in
London	LOCATION	and of his first journal - istic efforts on the '' Evening Star , '' with
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	as editor , and
William Black	PERSON	and Sir
Edward Russell	PERSON	as his colleagues .

		Mr.
Whiteing	PERSON	was a special correspondent in
Paris	LOCATION	during the closing years of the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	, and his book has something to say about
Taine	PERSON	,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	, the younger
Dumas	PERSON	,
Octave Feuillet	PERSON	, and other French men of letters .

		Our readers will welcome the announcement that Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	has at last finished his `` Life of Swinburne , '' though the book will not be pub - lished until after the war .

		Another book now ready for the press is a collection of
Swinburne	PERSON	's posthumous poems , edited by Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	and Mr.
Thomas J. Wise	PERSON	; while Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	has also in preparation a selection from
Swinburne	LOCATION	's corre - spondence .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	has had at his disposal all the
Houghton	LOCATION	manuscripts , and he has received help from
Lord Morley	PERSON	,
Lord Bryce	PERSON	, and other sur - viving friends of
Swinburne	LOCATION	.

		An original edition is to be published of a thir - teenth-century French religious poem in praise of the
Virgin Mary	PERSON	, ''
Li Romans dou Lis	PERSON	, '' contained in a unique manuscript in the library of Mr.
J. Pierpont Morgan	PERSON	.

		The manuscript formerly be - longed to
Lord Ashburnham	LOCATION	.

		A critical introduc - tion was written by the late Dr.
Frederick C. Ostrander	PERSON	, Adjunct Professor of Romance Lan - guages in the
University of Texas	ORGANIZATION	, as a memorial to whom the present edition is being issued by Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	through the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The poem itself , which is in strophie form , and composed in various metres , numbers over 4200 verses .

		Under the title of '' Makers of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	, in conjunction with an English publishing house , have in preparation a new series of biographies , of which Mr.
Basil Williams	PERSON	, the biographer of
Chatham	LOCATION	, is to be the general editor .

		Most of the books will deal with Englishmen and Americans , but it is also intended to include biographies of men of all countries who have had a definite influence on thought or action in the nineteenth century .

		The first four volumes to appear will be `` John Delane '' by Sir
E. T. Cook	PERSON	, `` Abraham Lincoln '' by Lord Charnwood , ''
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	'' by Mr.
Hugh S. Elliot	PERSON	, and `` Abdul Hamid '' by Sir
Edwin Pears	PERSON	.

		Biographies of
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	,
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, General Lee , and
Lord Shaftesbury	ORGANIZATION	are also in preparation .

		The announcement of a newly collected edition of Mrs.
Aphra Behn	PERSON	's works is followed by news of a study of '' The Life and Romances of Mrs.
Eliza Haywood	PERSON	, '' who was described by
Horace Walpole	PERSON	as the counterpart of Mrs.
Behn	PERSON	, and by Swift as a '' stupid , infamous , scribbling woman . ''

		It was Pope , however , who gave Mrs.
Haywood	PERSON	her most unenviable immortality in some of his coarsest lines in the '' Dunciad '' for following the exam - ple of Mrs.
Manley	PERSON	, and '' such shameless scrib - blers , '' in repeating in her tales the scandalous gossip of her day .

		The forthcoming book on the life and romances of her contemporary , Mrs.
Hay	PERSON	- wood , has been written by Dr.
George F. Whicher	PERSON	, of the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, for the ''
Columbia University Studies	ORGANIZATION	in English and Comparative Literature . ''

		We learn by way of
London	LOCATION	of a forthcoming study of ''
William Wordsworth	PERSON	: His Life , Works , and Influence , '' by Professor
George McLean Har	PERSON	- per , of
Princeton University	ORGANIZATION	, to whom we already owe a critical biography of Sainte-Beuve .

		It is based to a large extent on fresh material , and , in particular , will add to our knowledge of Words - worth 's connection with the French Revolution , and of his visit to
France	LOCATION	in
1791	DATE	, when he became inti - mately acquainted with the republican General
Beaupuis	PERSON	.

		Professor
Harper	PERSON	has also been able to throw fresh light upon other periods of Words - worth 's career , about which scarcely any informa - tion has been available hitherto .

		The book , which 120 THE DIAL promises to be one of considerable importance as a contribution to the study of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's life and thought , will be published in the autumn .

		Taking advantage of the opportunity presented by the elimination of the Tauchnitz Series in
Prance	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	,
Monsieur Louis Conard	PERSON	, the
Paris	LOCATION	publisher , announces for publication in the English language throughout the Continent of
Europe	LOCATION	a series of the latest -LRB- and forthcoming -RRB- copyrighted novels of the leading British and American authors .

		It was at first intended to await the conclusion of the present war before launching this enterprise , but it has been decided to begin publication at once with '' Bealby , '' the new story by Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, and ''
Delia Blanch	PERSON	- flower , '' the latest novel by Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	.

		During the war new books will be issued at the rate of at least one a month .

		Later in the year , it is hoped to put forth books at the rate of one a week .

		The series is to be published at two francs a volume .

		A publication that has enjoyed wide popularity in
England	LOCATION	recently is '' The Book of
France	LOCATION	, '' edited by Miss
Winifred Stephens	PERSON	, and published in aid of the fund organized by the French Parlia - mentary
Committee	ORGANIZATION	for the relief of the invaded Departments .

		Except that it begins with an ad - dress by Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, and closes with a poem by Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	, all the articles are the work of French men of letters .

		But the feature of the book is that , following each article , there appears a translation by some of our most distin - guished English writers .

		Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	is responsible for two extracts a tribute to
Great Britain	LOCATION	by
M. J. H. Rosny	PERSON	, nine , and some reflec - tions on the invasion of
France	LOCATION	by
M. Remy de Gourmont	ORGANIZATION	; as a rule , he keeps close to his original , though he sometimes employs a more expressive word , in one place rendering '' notre sentiment '' by '' our heart 's wound . ''

		Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	's version of '' The Saints of
France	LOCATION	'' by
M. Maurice Barres	PERSON	is quite in the style of Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	; while Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	's translation of his own name deserves to be noticed .

		M. Anatole
France	LOCATION	wrote , in his opening sentence : '' Ils se realisent les reves prophetiques de
H. G. Wells	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	translates this as follows : '' The prophetic night - mares of our scientific f antastics are being lamenta - bly realized . ''

		The author of '' God 's Fool , '' who in
the quarter	DATE	- century of his literary activity wrote almost a score of successful novels all under the pseudonym , ''
Maarten Maartens	PERSON	'' died on the fourth of this month at the age of fifty-seven years lacking eleven days .


Joost Marius Willem Van der Poorten	PERSON	-
Schwartz	PERSON	, as the novelist was known to his relatives and friends , was born at
Amsterdam	LOCATION	, spent much of his boyhood in
England	LOCATION	, was educated at the
Royal Gymnasium	ORGANIZATION	in
Bonn	LOCATION	and the
University of Utrecht	ORGANIZATION	, studied law and afterward lectured on law at the same university , but ultimately chose litera - ture for a profession , achieving his first decided success therein with his novel , '' The Son of
Joost Avelingh	PERSON	. ''

		Then in rapid sequence came `` An Old Maid 's Love , '' `` A Question of Taste , '' `` God 's Fool , '' '' The Greater Glory , '' and the rest of the now familiar stories that have made the writer 's name famous in many lands ; for he has been trans - lated extensively , even , against his will -LRB- as it is said -RRB- , into Dutch .

		Perhaps the unflattering quality of his pen-pictures of the middle-class society of
Holland	LOCATION	may help to explain his choice of a foreign language as his vehicle of expression , and his reluc - tance to have his books translated into his native tongue .

		Though not to be ranked with the immor - tals ,
Maarten Maartens	PERSON	won well-deserved fame as an unsparingly truthful delineator of Dutch char - acter , and his achievement is the more remarkable from his self-imposed handicap of an alien idiom in which to command the attention of the public .

		164 THE BEST SHORT STORIES .

		It would probably be too much to say that the short story is the peculiar literary form of the present day .

		It has displaced the poem and to .

		some extent the play , but still the Jug - gernaut of the novel rolls on even over it .

		And in many a past epoch it has been as exten - sively cultivated , and as highly wrought , as now .

		The Rhapsodists were Greek story - tellers who published their works orally .

		The Arabian story-teller has been a feature of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	life in all ages .

		The Mabinogion were
Welsh	ORGANIZATION	stories told to the children of the chiefs by the winter fireside .

		The Icelandic Sagas answered the same purpose .

		In
Italy	LOCATION	when the
Novelli	PERSON	were in bloom they threat - ened for a time to displace all other literature .

		And the golden age of even the modern short story must perhaps be placed some time back , when the German Romantic writers and
Irving	PERSON	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, and
Poe	PERSON	made new rec - ords in the art .

		The rank of the larger works of literature of the past is pretty well fixed .

		Until re - cently , however , short stories have hardly been given any rank at all ; and though the world knows very well which of them it likes best , there is considerable difference of critical opinion in the matter .

		It may be worth while , therefore , to offer a judgment and argument as to what are the best dozen or so in existence .

		Before we bring our candidates on for judg - ment , we must have some rules for guidance in crowning them .

		In the first place , then , we think the short story should be unitary .

		Character , its development and its opposi - tions , the form hardly has room for .

		It is not so much who acts , as what happened , that is important .

		Theme , incident , and setting are therefore the prime requisites .

		In the second place , the great short story should have a cer - tain universality .

		It should be capable of general acceptation , it should not be stopped at the frontier of any country as alien or hostile .

		In the third place , it ought to have as much originality as anything human can possess .

		It ought to do something for the first time , or it ought to do something better than it ever has been done before .

		It ought to be 134 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 2	DATE	a sort of key , opening a door to new vistas of the mind .

		Antiquity has transmitted to us few , if any , good short stories .

		The materials for them existed in abundance , and doubtless many were written ; but if so , they have perished .

		The Lost Tales of Miletus are a tradition , and only the gist of the
Seven Sleepers of Ephesus	ORGANIZATION	has come down to us .

		Lucian comes nearest of any of the ancients to being a short story writer ; but most of his works are in dialogue , so they do not count for our purpose .

		And when we reach ^
Esop	ORGANIZATION	we get into another form , as we do in the Indian fables of Pil - pay .

		The Scandinavian ,
Irish	LOCATION	, and Welsh legends are magnificent literature ; but from none of them does the short story , as we con - ceive it to-day , emerge .

		It is not until we reach '' The Arabian Nights '' that we find the type fixed for all time , and stories produced which have never been surpassed .

		The book indeed contains the germs , at least , of all possible kinds of short stories , and its influence has been pro- digious .

		Without stretching conscience much , we could almost fill our list of the world 's twelve most famous short stories from this book alone .

		But we must save some honors for the moderns , and besides there are rea - sons which rule many of the Arabian tales out .

		We think , then , that `` Aladdin , '' `` The Sleeper Awakened , '' and `` Ali Baba '' fulfil the three requisites we have named .

		They are closely wrought in incident and scene ; they have been accepted all over the world , and have furnished proverbial words or phrases ; and they have been imitated and reproduced in many forms . ''

		Sindbad the Sailor '' and '' The
Barber	PERSON	and his Six
Broth	PERSON	- ers '' are equally great , but they are groups of tales rather than single pieces .

		`` Prince Camaralzaman and Princess Badoura '' opens magnificently , but it dies away into
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	extravagance .

		The same is true of ''
Cam	PERSON	- buscan and his Horse of Brass . ''

		There are many other pieces in the collection that are immortal .

		One in particular probably gave Poe the basis on which he founded the throne of that detective dynasty which seems to rule modern literature .

		It is difficult to over - estimate the importance of '' The Arabian Nights '' in the history of the short story .

		The next great collection is that of
Boccac	LOCATION	- cio .

		As a monument and the mould of Italian prose it is of course most important .

		And as the work of a single man , it displays great variety and originality .

		Yet many of the pieces are not stories at all , but merely briefly told incidents .

		A good many more are after - dinner yarns , only in this case , told before the ladies have withdrawn . ''

		Theodore and
Honoria	PERSON	, '' `` Cymon and Iphigenia , '' and `` Isa - bella '' are magnificent narratives , but they have rather been wrested from
Boccaccio	LOCATION	by
Dryden	PERSON	and
Keats	PERSON	.

		All in all , we can select only one story `` Federigo and his Falcon '' ; , but in revenge it strikes the highest and purest note of any piece on our list .


Germany	LOCATION	is a perfect jungle of Marchen r or short stories .

		But we are hunting for what may be called world tales , and we confess we can think of but few in German literature .

		Chamisso 's ``
Peter Schlemihl	PERSON	'' is one .

		And we must have `` Undine , '' also , though it is rather too long to come under the genre we are considering ; but it fulfils all our require - ments , and its vogue makes it indispensable .

		The popular legend of '' The Flying Dutch - man '' ought to be on our list too ; but we are acquainted with no prose recension of it except that of
Heine	LOCATION	's , which hardly comes , up to the mark .


Baron Munchausen	PERSON	is a type , but the stories he tells are either too brief or are imitations of older work .

		Altogether , the German contingent brings our accepted mas - terpieces to six .

		The French short story writers have every - thing the Germans lack perfect form , wit , point , charm .

		Yet ranging among them , from
Cyrano de Bergerac	LOCATION	down through Chateau - briand ,
Lamartine	PERSON	, Musset ,
Balzac	LOCATION	,
Gautier	PERSON	,
Merimee	PERSON	,
Maupassant	LOCATION	, it is rather difficult to - find a story which is at once perfect , pro- foundly original , and winged for world-wide circulation .

		Musset 's `` White Blackbird '' is charming and significant ; and
Merimee	PERSON	's - ''
Carmen	PERSON	, '' in one shape or another , has made the voyage of the world .

		But we hardly think that either of them is universal enough .

		Though ''
Paul	PERSON	and
Virginia	LOCATION	, '' like '' Undine , '' transcends the short story form , it is the only tale we can conscientiously include in our list .

		A few years ago Maupassant was considered the last cry in short story genre .

		He ha & great merits , it is true , but his pieces are more like epigrams than stories .

		And we doubt very much whether they have yet sunk , or will ever sink , deeply into the world 's mind .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 135 The prose short story was a long time get - ting itself domiciled and growing to greatness in
England	LOCATION	.

		The essayists ,
Addison	PERSON	,
Steele	PERSON	,
Goldsmith	PERSON	, have hints and adumbrations of it ; but what they produced were sketches of character. , vignettes of adventure .

		Dr.
John	PERSON	- son , in '' Rasselas , '' was perhaps the first who did what comes near to being the real thing .

		That piece , however , is too long , too heavy , and too full of moralizing to answer our pur - pose .

		Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	's `` Wandering Wil - lie 's Tale '' fulfils all our requisites ; though perhaps because it is embedded in a novel , it has not had all the fame it deserves .

		Mrs.
Shelley	PERSON	's '' Frankenstein '' would satisfy us , too , only she did not know how to construct or when to stop .

		She furnished a proverbial figure for the world , but the story itself is hardly readable .

		De Quincey had all the art and accomplishment of a first rate short story writer , and he taught the business to others .

		Nearly all his great successors have felt his influence .

		But for one reason or another , nothing of his own is in the running .

		`` The Spanish Nun '' and `` The Flight of a Tartar Tribe '' have immense verve and inter - est , but they are historical pieces .

		The two papers on '' Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts '' almost form a short story ; but , after all , they are essays .

		Bulwer 's '' The Haunted and the Haunters '' is perhaps the best ghost story ever written , but it is too lack - ing in humanity ever to be seriously consid - ered for our laurelled company .

		Dickens ,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Meredith	PERSON	, has any one of these been more successful in this regard ?

		We doubt it .

		It is not until we come to
Stevenson	PERSON	that we get any real competi - tor for place .

		There are half a score of
Stevenson	PERSON	's stories so equally good that it is difficult to choose between them .

		None of them , however , has quite the universality we should desire ; but we will take `` A Lodging for the Night '' as the nearest to our standard .

		For some reason or other ,
America	LOCATION	has been the modern home of the short story .

		That form has seemed to suit both the talents of our writers and the tether of our public 's patience .

		Irving 's '' Rip Van Winkle '' is as famous as a story can be ; it is known everywhere .

		There are many other of Irving 's pieces which are only a little less excellent ; and we wonder that some publisher does not issue a single - volume collection of a score or so of them .

		Such a collection would be a revelation to modern readers .

		Poe took the crown of the short story from his own head and placed it on
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's ; and the latter has an im - mense , though we believe a rather fading and ineffectual , fame in this art .

		With the best will in the world , we can not yet accept any one of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's short stories for our final few .

		Perfection of execution they have , and a kind of originality .

		But they have been stopped at the frontiers of other countries , and they have not much influenced succeed - ing writers .

		Poe is in himself a rival for all the host of authors of '' The Arabian Nights . ''

		His influence on the short story has been para - mount and overwhelming .

		We should select from him '' The Gold Bug , '' '' The Murders in the Rue Morgue , '' and '' The Fall of the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Usher , '' not because these are the best things in his prose , but because they are his best short stories , and because they have led the whole world to follow and imitate them .

		Instead of the twelve stories we set out to find , we now have a baker 's dozen .

		Yet we must add one more , for
Bret Harte	PERSON	was really the precursor of the best English short story writ - ers of recent times .

		If
Stevenson	PERSON	is to have a place , then the American can not be neglected .

		Any one of a half dozen of
Bret Harte	PERSON	's sto - ries will do , but perhaps in '' The Luck of Roaring Camp '' the new view he opened and his universality are most apparent .

		As we have intimated above , we think that there have been more great American short story writers , and more of a calibre only less than the greatest , than in any other country .

		Away back in the dawn of our literature there is `` The Story of
Peter Rugg	PERSON	, '' a good variant on the `` Flying Dutchman '' theme .

		Fitz -
James O'Brien	PERSON	wrote two or three sto - ries of great merit .

		Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	's `` Monarch of Dreams '' is a superb piece of writing , and
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	's `` Man without a Country '' makes plain sober fact of impossible fiction .


Thomas Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	invented a plot of surprise , and his stories are full of grace and charm .

		No one has ever been more oddly original than
Frank Stock	ORGANIZATION	- ton .

		Recently '' 0 .

		Henry '' wrought out the unexpected with a terseness which the French might envy .

		There are others who have done lasting work ; and we believe , as we have said before , that our achievement in this field sur - passes anything that other nations can show .

		136 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 2	DATE	Of course it must be understood that all the hypercriticism in the foregoing paragraphs is merely an attempt to get at the essential types of the short story .

		Innumerable pieces that we have passed by are good and more than good .

		And of course we do not attempt to sit in judgment on living masters of the art .

		Going over our selections , we find that four among them , `` Aladdin , '' ``
Peter Schlemihl	PERSON	, '' `` Undine , '' and `` Wandering
Willie	PERSON	's Tale , '' deal with the supernatural .

		Two others , `` Ali Baba '' and `` Rip Van Winkle , '' have to do with the marvellous which hardly amounts to the supernatural . ''

		The Sleeper Awakened '' is a tale of pure humor and human nature .

		`` Federigo and his Falcon , '' and ``
Paul	PERSON	and
Virginia	LOCATION	'' are stories of young love and devo - tion . ''

		The Gold Bug '' is the exemplar of all possible treasure stories ; as `` A Lodging for the Night '' is of the nomad and vagabond species . ''

		The Fall of the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Usher '' gives us intellect dominant and in ruin , with nature sympathizing with it . ''

		The Luck of Roaring Camp '' is a good specimen of primi - tive and adventurous life .

		And lastly , '' The Murders in the Rue Morgue '' launched the detective into literature , with all the interest - ing or horrible consequence of that debut .

		We think this fairly covers , and in good propor - tion , the main strands suitable for short story weaving .

		That there will be in the future any wide departure from these themes seems to us unlikely , though of course minor threads of the web of life may be taken up and devel - oped .

		One thing is noticeable about our elect , none of them is extremely short .

		The great masters have refused to turn their sto - ries into Dodonian oracles .

		What is the place of the short story in lit - erature ?

		The very qualities we claimed for it in starting preclude it from the first rank .

		In a form where there is not room enough to swing a cat , there can not be equality with the great dramas , epics , or novels .

		In a form where character is secondary , great action , passion , thought can hardly be developed .

		Design and plot , too , must be curtailed , though perhaps these gain as much as they lose by condensation .

		What is left to the short story is uniqueness .

		It is really a prose poem , and must take its place with the short verse nar - ratives and ballads .

		It can hardly have the literary value of these ; but it can be , and is more popular .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		EDITORIAL INITIATIVE , as opposed to edito - rial subserviency to a real or supposed popu - lar demand for unwholesome reading matter , is conspicuous in comparatively few of our daily and other periodical publications .

		All the more cheering , therefore , is it to find cer - tain strong and wise utterances on the subject by journalists and writers of principle and purpose , in a '' Symposium '' constituting one of the chapters of '' The Coming Newspaper , '' a book noticed more in detail on another page .

		Dr.
Charles M. Sheldon	PERSON	feels con - vinced that `` the daily paper , the magazine , and every other periodical , have just as much of a duty to give the people the thing they need instead of what they want , as the minis - ter has to give his people what they need instead of what they want . ''

		Of course , as it may be worth while to say in passing , what the people '' want '' is really , in the etymologi - cal sense of the word , nothing else than what fhey `` need , '' though they do not know it .

		What they sometimes foolishly wish and clamor for , is another thing .

		But even this unwise longing may be less spontaneous , less unfostered from without , than is commonly assumed .

		Mr.
Oswald Garrison Villard	PERSON	, recog - nizing that '' the newspaper certain news - papers at least is largely responsible for the public 's low taste , '' continues , signifi - cantly : '' It would be well worth your while , if you are not familiar with the journals of

Springfield	LOCATION	` Republican , ' and other news - papers of the time , and study them ; and you will be surprised what fine newspapers they were , what fine standards they had , how intel - ligent was the comment .

		Editorially , they were , of course , superior to the bulk of the newspapers today .

		They were clean ; there were no large headlines .

		They were as effi - cient as we are in the way of giving the news and giving it accurately .

		I do n't think that we can plume ourselves over that generation of editors , for all our modern facilities . ''

		Assuredly there were editorial giants in those days , but there is no reason to believe that the secret of good editorship was buried with them .

		m m m COMMISSION GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY have not yet become minutely famil - iar with each other 's ways .

		Fears are still felt in some quarters lest existing library laws and usage and precedent may fail to chime harmoniously with the new order of procedure introduced into municipal affairs
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 137 by the recent form of city government known as government by commission .

		Thus far no disastrous conflict of interests has come to general notice , but all the possibilities of the situation have doubtless not yet been ex - hausted .

		Meanwhile it is cheering to note in at least one commission-governed city
Bir	ORGANIZATION	- mingham ,
Alabama	LOCATION	a cordial cooperation between commissioners and library officials .

		A late number of '' The
Birmingham Maga	PERSON	- zine , '' a creditable publication such as one may look for in vain in hundreds of larger cities , contains an article of some length on '' Social Service Work of the City Com - mission , '' written by President
George B. Ward	PERSON	, of the
Birmingham Board of Commis	ORGANIZATION	- sioners , and replete with evidence that the schools , the library , the parks , playgrounds , welfare and health departments of various sorts under the city 's control are objects of more than perfunctory attention from the administrative authorities .

		Especially notice - able is the interest taken in the development of the public library , which has a history of only five years to look back upon , but already makes a showing that compares favorably with the well-known useful activity of
Atlan	LOCATION	- ta 's similar institution , though the latter is more than three times as old ; and this record of
Birmingham	LOCATION	's progress in the populariza - tion of good literature synchronizes with the history of commission government in that city , as is pointed out with justifiable pride in the following words : `` When the Com - mission came into office the
Birmingham	LOCATION	Pub - lic Library was an organization kept up by paid subscriptions and reaching but a limited number .

		To-day , as a free public library , it is the epitome of service and efficiency under the splendid management of Mr.
Carl H. Milan	PERSON	. ''

		Difficult would it be to find any municipal chief magistrate under the old order of things expressing himself with such intelligence , zeal , and public spirit of the best sort , on the social welfare work of his city , as one notes in Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's utterance .

		THE MISSION OF MIRTH in literature is no unimportant , no undignified one ; and the role of the proverbial jester who purveys fun and cheerfulness to all the world while his own heart may be breaking is of a heroism and a pathos not always recognized .

		The late
Charles Battell Loomis	PERSON	, writing books of amusement and touring the country as a pro- fessional humorist , was all the time slowly dying of an incurable malady and fully con - scious of the hopelessness of his condition .

		A younger contemporary of his ,
George Fitch	PERSON	, widely known for his syndicated `` Vest - Pocket Essays '' that have long enlivened a host of newspaper readers , went to
California	LOCATION	in quest of health , and his death was an - nounced on the very day his readers were enjoying his jest at the identical disease that prematurely cut him off .


George Heleghon Fitch	PERSON	, not to be confused with Mr.
George Hamlin Fitch	PERSON	of the
San Francisco	LOCATION	''
Chron	PERSON	- icle , '' was born at
Galva	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	,
June 5 , 1877	DATE	; was graduated from
Knox College	ORGANIZATION	in
1897	DATE	; entered upon journalism , and began to win more than local fame about ten years ago with his witty '' Transcripts '' in the
Peoria	LOCATION	'' Transcript , '' of which he had become man - aging editor .

		Four years ago he severed this connection and devoted himself to less ephem - eral literary work .

		In addition to his '' Vest - Pocket Essays , '' of which a collection was published last year under the title , '' Sizing up Uncle
Sam	PERSON	, '' he wrote '' The Big Strike at Siwash , '' `` At Good Old Siwash , '' '' My Demon Motor Boat , '' and '' Homeburg Memories . ''

		He died on the ninth of
August	DATE	.

		On the very same day , or the next -LRB- there are conflicting reports -RRB- , there died another contributor to the sum of human cheerfulness ,
Charles Heber Clark	PERSON	, or ''
Max Adeler	PERSON	, '' as he chose to call himself when writing in lighter vein .

		Known in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	and beyond as a manufacturer and a writer of repute on economics , the tariff , and kindred themes , he also produced books whose purpose was to entertain and amuse . ''

		Out of the Hurly - Burly '' is a collection of stories widely popu - lar and so heartily enjoyed , it is said , by the Emperor of
Austria	LOCATION	that he sent the author a gold medal . ''

		Elbow Room '' is another vol - ume of the same nature . ''

		Captain Bluitt , '' '' In Happy Hollow , '' '' The Quakeress , '' and `` By the Bend of the River '' represent his more sustained efforts in fictitious narrative , but are touched with the same geniality that had early marked him as a very enjoyable humorist .

		He was born at
Berlin	LOCATION	,
Maryland	LOCATION	,
July 11 , 1841	DATE	, and died at
Eaglesmere	LOCATION	,
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania , at the age of seventy-four .


RUSSIA	LOCATION	'S DEARTH OF BOOKS AND LIBRARIES appears so great , to one viewing the vast empire as a whole , that it might not be far from the truth to call
Russia	LOCATION	a bookless na - tion .

		Until the late prohibition of the sale of vodka -LRB- except in the
Caucasus	LOCATION	and central
Asia	LOCATION	, where the government does not control this sale -RRB- the sole distraction from the tedium of a hard existence had been found in drink , with the great mass of the common people .

		But with the discontinuance of that sale , 138 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 2	DATE	which dates from the outbreak of the present war , though the causal connection between the two is much less close than is commonly as - sumed , there has been a natural longing for spare-hour amusement or occupation , a long - ing that will eventually , it is hoped , find a worthier gratification than was formerly fur - nished by the ubiquitous dramshop .

		Money , too , as well as time , is now increasingly at the peasant 's disposal , thanks to the new order of things .

		Mr.
Stephen Graham	PERSON	, who knows the country as few but the Russians themselves know it , writes on '' Prohibition in
Russia	LOCATION	'' in '' The World 's Work , '' and predicts a remark - able growth of culture among the people as soon as peace is restored .

		He says : `` After the war there must flow from the great cities of the West of
Russia	LOCATION	books , papers , dress materials , musical instruments , pictures , guns -LSB- the last-named might be dispensed with -RSB- .

		And more schools must be established , more concert halls , lecture halls .

		There will be more schooling , reading , music , hunting .

		If the policy of the Russian Government with regard to drink remains unchanged for the next ten years , it is safe to predict a most extraordinary contrast between the condition of the country now and the condition as it must be then . ''

		The probability of this con - tinuance is asserted , and to the Czar is ascribed the credit thereof .

		Surely here is virgin soil for the labors of library extension - ists and other promoters of popular culture .

		THE EESTORATION OP FRuiTLANos by
Miss Clara Endicott Sears	ORGANIZATION	, of
Boston	LOCATION	, whose ac - count of the eccentric Fruitlanders and their '' Consociate Family '' is one of the nota - ble books of the season , is cause for congratu - lation .

		Miss
Sears	ORGANIZATION	bought the property two years ago .

		It adjoins her
summer	DATE	place at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- the town , not the university -RRB- , and her intelligent zeal and generous expenditure of money have put the old house back into its condition of sixty-two years ago , when
Alcott	PERSON	and his little band of visionary reformers took up their residence there .

		As far as pos - sible , the original furniture has been rein - stated , and to-day Miss
Sears	ORGANIZATION	feels justified in saying : '' The house is now exactly as it was in
1843	DATE	.

		The foundations of the chim - neys were intact so that I was able to rebuild them as they were .

		The paint had entirely disappeared with time , but under the eaves there remained patches of red , and I was able to give it again the old ochre-red color which it had worn in the early days .

		The old granary has been turned into a home for the care-taker , but the structure was not changed . ''

		She adds that the building was a pathetic object indeed when she took it in hand , dilapidated and empty except for a few old odds and ends in the garret ; but its present refurnishing she asserts to be '' au - thentic in every way , '' with the community bean-pot recovered , and
Joseph Palmer	PERSON	's oxskin money-bag ,
Charles Lane	PERSON	's cowhide trunk , Mrs.
Alcott	PERSON	's Paisley shawl , letters of
Louisa Alcott	PERSON	, and Mr.
Alcott	PERSON	's spectacles , in addition to the furniture of the several rooms .

		Fruitlands is now open to visitors three days in the
week Tuesday	DATE	,
Thursday	DATE	, and Sat - urday during the
summer	DATE	.

		Miss
Sears	ORGANIZATION	de - serves the gratitude of her own generation and of posterity for her rescue of this object of historic and literary interest .

		THE LAST MEMBER OF AN OLD PUBLISHING FIRM ,
John Wesley Harper	PERSON	, died at
Bidde	LOCATION	- ford Pool on the fourteenth of
August	DATE	, at the age of eighty-four .

		Had he lived a year and seven months longer he could have joined in celebrating the centennial of the
House of Harper	ORGANIZATION	, to the second generation of which he belonged , being the son of
John Harper	PERSON	of the original
J. & J. Harper	PERSON	, established in
March , 1817	DATE	.

		Graduated from
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	in
1852	DATE	, at the head of his class , he chose medi - cine as his profession , and went abroad to study and to discover that he had no vocation for the healing art ; so he returned , entered the paternal business house , and became a member of the firm in
1869	DATE	, with
Philip J. A. Harper	PERSON	,
Joseph W. Harper	PERSON	, Jr. ,
Fletcher Harper	PERSON	, Jr. , and
Joseph Abner Harper	PERSON	.

		The style , ''
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, '' had been adopted in
1833	DATE	, and the business increased so rapidly that when the subject of this sketch assumed the presidency of the firm in
1897	DATE	there was said to be no publishing house equal to it in the extent of its dealings .

		With the reorgani - zation that was made necessary by financial embarrassments fifteen years ago , Mr.
Harper	PERSON	retired from business ; and though there still continue to be Harpers in sufficient number at the famous Franklin Square establish - ment , the older stock has lost its last repre - sentative .

		For a full and entertaining his - tory of those earlier publishers the reader is referred to '' The
House of Harper	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
J. Henry Harper	PERSON	, published a few years ago .

		PURGING A LANGUAGE BY FIRE is the process that may be said to have been begun with the German tongue when the fatherland drew its sword against the non-Teutonic world .

		En - glish , French , Russian , and Italian words or derivatives are now an abomination in Ber -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 139 lin , and the resources of the native speech are being strained to supply home-made equiva - lents for these foreign terms .

		A former En - glish Lecturer at the
Karlsruhe Hochschule	ORGANIZATION	writes of '' The Wor and the Werld Langwij '' in '' The Pioneer ov Simplified Speling , '' pre - dicting an increase in the cosmopolitan use of English when peace is restored , and a stricter confinement of German to the land of its origin .

		Transposing the spelling of the arti - cle in question , let us quote a few sentences .

		The writer believes that `` one result of the victory of the Allies is that
Germany	LOCATION	will con - tinue the process of elimination of foreign words which they began on the outbreak of the War .

		During the six weeks I was in
Karlsruhe	LOCATION	after the War began , this move - ment to replace French and English words by native German equivalents had begun .

		The 4 Cafe Piccadilly ' had become ' Gasthaus zum
Vaterland	LOCATION	. '

		A ` beefsteak ' had been chris - tened a ` Rindstiick ' ... The French ` sauce ' has become a ' Tunke . ' ''

		And so on .

		With English already spoken by 130,000,000 per - sons -LRB- the writer 's figures , and they are not excessive -RRB- , and German hopelessly out of the running , while not even French -LRB- `` the patois of
Europe	LOCATION	, '' as
Walter Bagehot	PERSON	called it -RRB- can vie with English in extent of its use , there is surely some reason to expect an increasing employment of our tongue as a world-speech unless the Esperantists carry the day , which is not at present likely , or unless , after all , we non-Teutons should have the speech of General von Bernhardi rammed down our throats with German sabres , which is also not among the probabilities .

		FRANKLIN 'S EPITAPH , written by himself at the age of twenty-two , an age when this sort of literary exercise has a purely academic interest which it loses in later life , has for a dozen years been accessible to the curious in such things , in the valuable autograph collec - tion of the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, for which it was acquired from the government archives , which at an earlier date had secured it from the papers of
William Temple Franklin	ORGANIZATION	.

		But it now appears that this cherished autograph is a revision -LRB- by the author and in his hand - writing , it is true -RRB- of the original inspiration , which has lately been brought to light in the As - pinwall papers and secured , through a
Boston	LOCATION	dealer , by Dr.
A. S. W. Rosenbach	PERSON	of the city in which it was written .

		These papers , once the property of Colonel
Thomas L. Aspinwall	PERSON	, in his time a noted collector of Americana , must contain a multitude of almost priceless items ; but probably few would so excite the desires of the covetous as this bit of scribbling from
Franklin	PERSON	's pen .

		In its unrevised form it runs as follows : '' The body of
B. Franklin	PERSON	, printer , like the cover of an old book , its con - tents torn out and stript of its lettering and gilding , lies here , food for worms .

		But the work shall not be wholly lost , for it will , as he believed , appear once more , in a new and more perfect edition , corrected and amended by the Author . ''

		Then is added the date of birth , with so much of the date of death -LRB- '' 17 '' -RRB- as could at that time be conjectured with rea - sonable certainty .

		Division into lines , with capitalization , has here been disregarded .

		In the revised copy the logical
Franklin	PERSON	, reason - ing that `` perfect '' admits of no degrees of comparison , substituted `` elegant , '' and he also enclosed in parentheses his likening of the lifeless body to the outside of an old book .

		Other minor changes also appear .

		A BYRONIC DISCOVERY , or what the discov - erer believed to be such , forms the subject of the opening article in '' The English Review '' for
August	DATE	.

		The late
Bertram Dobell	PERSON	, some years ago , came into possession of a small pamphlet entitled `` A Farrago Libelli : A \ Poem , Chiefly Imitated from the
First Satire of Juvenal	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It was '' printed for Mr.
Hatch	PERSON	- ard ,
1806	DATE	, '' and , according to a note at the foot of the first page , `` written at
Twicken	PERSON	- ham ,
1805	DATE	. ''

		Mr.
Dobell	PERSON	held his copy to be unique , and believed the piece to have been suppressed by its author immediately upon its appearance .

		The poem itself , running to three hundred and forty lines , and Mr.
Dobell	PERSON	's critical commentary , fill twenty-four pages of the above-named magazine .

		A gen - eral resemblance in style to `` English Bards and Scotch Reviewers '' is manifest in the satire , and many special points of resem - blance the commentator thought he had detected and took pains to place before his readers .

		Not entirely convincing is the able argument , either in general or in detail , though there appears no good reason why Byron , even though but nineteen years old at the time , might not have written the fluent verses -LRB- in the familiar decasyllabic metre of '' English Bards '' -RRB- composing the '' Farrago . ''

		Yet it is not a production of sufficient merit and distinction to bring any access to
Byron	PERSON	's fame , should he finally be accounted the author .

		ART IN THE LIBRARY , in the form of paint - ings , engravings , statuary , rare bindings , fur - niture of tasteful design , and in the entire architecture , external and internal , of the 140 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 2	DATE	library building , takes a place that need be second only to that of literature .

		The ways of popularizing art through the public library are many , and those who would learn some - thing about their number and variety should read Miss
Mary McEaehin Powell	PERSON	's '' Making Art Popular through the Library , '' an ac - count of this kind of work in the
St. Louis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, by the head of the depart - ment .

		In ten chapters or sections , filling a pamphlet of fifty pages , Miss McEaehin de - scribes the development and success of her branch of the library .

		Among other interest - ing details , we read that every month two paintings from the City Art Museum , selected by the Director of the
St. Louis School of Fine Arts	ORGANIZATION	, are displayed in the Children 's Room ; and once a week the Director himself comes and gives a talk on these paintings to children of the fifth and sixth grades , and to those of the higher grades , alternately .

		Forty or fifty young listeners , with several teachers , comprise each of these groups , and an effort is made to secure constant attendance and thus render the course progressive .

		Informality on the lecturer 's part encourages participa - tion on that of the children in the discussions , and it is reported that the audience shows intense interest and carries away vivid and lasting impressions .

		Pupils of the above - named art school have contributed many pleasing and some striking illustrations to Miss
McEachin	PERSON	's pamphlet , which contains a greater variety of readable and instructive matter than can here be indicated .

		THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF SIM - PLIFIED SPELLERS offers food for reflection , whether or not the reflector is able to arrive at any general law governing the outbreak and spread of the peculiar mania to which these persons are victims .

		In the current number of the '' Simplified Speling Bulletin '' is a list of universities and colleges and nor - mal schools , grouped by states , that have given their sanction to simplified spelling ; and the briefest glance at the table shows the middle West to be the stronghold of the cult , with surprisingly few adherents in the
East	LOCATION	and in the far West .

		The South , too , seems either prudently conservative in the matter or apathetic .

		In
New England	LOCATION	only three insti - tutions , including a normal school in Ver - mont , appear on the list ; and outside of
New England	LOCATION	there are but two other
Atlantic	LOCATION	states -LRB-
New York	LOCATION	and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	-RRB- in which opposition to the accepted orthography has developed any strength .

		West of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	basin only
Colorado	LOCATION	and
Oregon	LOCATION	are named , each represented by a single col - lege . ''

		Simplified Speling in the Pres , '' an article in the same journal , presents a similar tabulation in respect to newspaper and peri - odical adoption of the new forms ; and here , too , the zeal of the interior contrasts with the paucity of interest on both coasts , except that
California	LOCATION	-LRB- unrepresented in the former list -RRB- reports one perverted newspaper , and
Wyo	LOCATION	- ming nine , including two student publica - tions .

		Here , then , we have a sort of meeting of extremes East and West agreeing to re - tain the old spelling , and the central region showing more desire for a change .

		Does this geographical arrangement , after an analogy that will occur to the reader , imply that the subverters of the present order have the strategic advantage ?

		AN INCENTIVE TO ITALIAN PATRIOTISM takes the form of a popular paper-covered edition , in the language of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, of that famous American masterpiece of more than half a century ago , '' The Man without a Country . ''

		The compatriots of
Garibaldi	PERSON	are of just the sort to be fired by such a tale from the pen of one whom the translator in his preface calls the greatest American of his time .

		A writer in '' The Christian Register '' relates that he once asked Dr.
Hale	PERSON	whether he himself really felt his wonderful story as deeply as he made the reader feel it .

		So prompt and emphatic was the affirmative an - swer as to leave no further doubt in the questioner 's mind .

		This kind of feeling , with all that it too often implies of international antagonism , is perhaps not in great need of strengthening just at present in any
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean country , however glad we may be to see the fame of Dr.
Hale	PERSON	and his best-known work of literature widen its bounds .

		IN SOMNOLENT NIPPON , according to Mrs.
Yosano	PERSON	, one of the '' new women '' of
Japan	LOCATION	, there is still a sad need of the awakening call of literature to dispel the slumberous vacuity into which the natives , unless actively em - ployed , are ever prone to fall .

		She writes in a late issue of '' Taiyo , '' as quoted -LRB- in English not always quite orthodox -RRB- : '' The Japanese , men and women , are often seen dozing off their ride on public vehicles , to wit the train , the tram , the stage coach , etc. .

		There may be some excuse for this in the afternoons of the long-day season .

		But they do it when days are short , and in the morning at that .

		The Europeans in transit are always reading something and never look tired .

		The dif - ference is striking . ''

		And further : '' The
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 141 Japanese in general are given to sleeping in daytime .

		The students fall asleep in the class room , the
Ministers of State	ORGANIZATION	and Repre - sentatives of people go off dozing in the Diet , preachings and public speeches send the audi - ence to dreamland .

		A majority of Japanese people are always tired they seem to be suf - fering from nervous debility . ''

		Few writers , whether native or foreign , have more severely censured the Japanese for superficiality , imi - tation , easy content with the present and what it offers , than does this representative of that far-eastern nation .

		Her advice , which may not be the easiest possible to follow , is that the Japanese should adopt a more invigorat - ing diet , eat more meat , and thus brace them - selves for a more energetic assault upon life 's problems , both material and spiritual .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		A PLEA FOR ALLEGORY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It may be said without exaggeration that what is known as cultivated taste , that is , the taste of readers who in the main enjoy the educational advantages of wealth or good breeding , turns from Allegory with a feeling akin to nausea .

		So keenly do the editors of our magazines realize the intensity of this aversion that a manuscript carry - ing about it the slightest scent of allegory is rejected immediately .

		With the spirit of a ram - bler who finds a pensive pleasure in the deserted fields of literature , let us look into this matter a little .

		There may be some profit in the task , too ; for no one can visit a prehistoric mound , or even a grassy depression in a pasture once the cellar of a long since vanished cabin -LRB- and is not mind and vacant cellar allegory 's metaphorical kindred by a common fate ? -RRB-

		without some creative stir in the mind .

		That pure allegory was a natural growth in the field of literature is as well established as that the wild plum and the wild rose blossomed everywhere in the primeval forests of our country .

		What then ?

		Well , we know why the wild plum has dis - appeared ; and it is for a like reason that the alle - gory has gone .

		The plum 's life was possible only in the shadows of those mighty woods , with their deep and rarely broken silence .

		But now the pio - neer 's axe rings , the big trees fall , sunlight floods in , and the wild plum dies .

		So with allegory : when the primaeval forests of the mind , so to speak , were cleared off , pure allegory could not stand the sunlight of obviousness and gave up the ghost .

		White , sweet , and modest was the wild plum 's bloom , and it has its analogue in style , for style is the flowering of literature ; sweet and modest was allegory 's bloom , too , and rich and impor - tant was its fruit .

		For who can measure the value of newly awakened and spontaneous ideas in virgin mental soil , or the refining and strengthening and exalting influence of imagination taking flight ?

		But above all and more than all , how many who are now dust , heirs to adversity and sorrow , had their toiling and obscure lives cheered by the sight of the
Delectable Mountains	ORGANIZATION	, and by hearing the harps and trumpets which greeted poor Pilgrim the nearest brother to the average man that pen has ever produced at the end of his long journey !

		May we not , then , visit this ancient mound in the deserted field of literature with profit , loiter around it for a while , and from time to time hear voices out of the past proclaiming what a part allegory played in the lives of thousands whose clay is now blended with the common earth ?

		Surely it does the soul good to be a listener when the past speaks .

		And finally , to pursue the figure another step , let us mount to the top .

		Lo !

		off to the east where literature 's dawn first flushed , what star is that we see amid a glowing constellation of Prophets and Seers ?

		It is
David	PERSON	with his harp , singing pure allegory in the eightieth psalm .

		Nearer in Poetry 's garden and in our own tongue ,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's
Faerie Queene	LOCATION	is singing pure allegory to the rapt enjoy - ment of the lords and ladies of
England	LOCATION	; and along green hedgerows and among the poor and lowly ,
John Bunyan	PERSON	is singing the Pilgrim 's Prog - ress toward the
Celestial City	LOCATION	.

		Was there nausea then ?

		No ; for then the primaeval forests of the mind were still shadowing the elementary and natural feelings of man 's nature ; and warmed by the poet 's high-beating heart , they gathered and bloomed into allegory , just as the wild plum and the wild rose 's elements , feeling the warmth of nature 's heart , burst into bloom .

		And are those elements out of which they
spring	DATE	still in the soil of the mind ?

		Yes , I think there is abundant evidence that they are still there .

		Take
Shelley	PERSON	's ode '' To a Skylark , '' which is certainly not nauseous , at least up to this date in our march toward utter fastidiousness , does it not open with allegory ?

		Or take that first stanza of '' In State '' by
Forcythe Wilson	PERSON	, oversoaring in my judgment all other poems of the Civil War period , not except - ing
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's banner-waving and patriotic rhetoric , with its well-burnished and glistening common - place .

		Here we certainly have allegory , '' O Keeper of the sacred Key , And the
Great Seal of Destiny	ORGANIZATION	, Whose eye is the blue canopy , Look down upon the warring world , and tell us what the end will be . ''

		To sum it all up , go where you will in the fields of living prose and poetry , and you will find it ; not blooming exactly in the old obvious way , but in profound unself consciousness .

		Allegory , then , like every creation of the mind , must bring writer and reader into a state of perfect unselfconsciousness , that state of mind which
Spenser 's	ORGANIZATION	and
Bunyan	PERSON	's readers were in .

		Dreary , machine-made , and wooden in its gait is the most of our current prose .

		If the editors of our magazines would encourage natural expression and natural gait , sooner or later cultivated taste would find itself unself conscious ; and lost in the 142 -LSB-
Sept. 2	DATE	presence of sincerity and beautified truth , the pages of their magazines might be what
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's and
Bunyan	PERSON	's pages were to their readers , glow - ing inspiration .

SCHAFF	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	,
August 24 , 1915	DATE	.

		WILLIAM
VAUGHN	PERSON	MOODY AND
WILLIAM BLAKE	PERSON	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Of
William Vaughn Moody 's Idea of God	ORGANIZATION	, Professor Manly says -LRB- Introduction to '' Poems and Poetic Dramas of
William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	, '' p. XLII . -RRB-

		: `` It was not a formal philosophical con - ception , but a poetical vision incorporating the most diverse elements of culture . ''

		We believe that no one has yet pointed out that the writings of
William Blake	PERSON	were one element of that culture . ''

		God figures ambiguously in
Moody	ORGANIZATION	's poetry , '' continues Mr.
Manly	PERSON	; '' sometimes as the Puritan God , whom he does not love and in whom he does not believe ; sometimes as the no less anthropomor - phic God from whom he can not keep his fellowship and love . ''

		Now
Blake	PERSON	had two Gods also , the '' God of this World , '' corresponding to
Moody 's Puritan God	ORGANIZATION	, and the Supreme God , whose anthropomor - phic nature he set forth in his painting , his lyrics , and his Prophetical Books .

		Moody was no such heretic as
Blake	PERSON	, yet in his '' Masque of Judgment '' he '' spoke out in meet - ing , '' to quote his own words in a letter to Professor
Schevill	PERSON	,
June 8 , 1897	DATE	.

		To Mrs. Toy again -LRB-
Dec. 12 , 1900	DATE	-RRB- he writes that the poem is '' a plea for passion as a means of salvation every - where latent . ''

		The mythological machinery , he says , '' symbolizes the opposed doctrine that of the denial of life .

		As Christianity -LRB- contrary to the wish and meaning of its founder -RRB- has historically linked itself with this doctrine , I included certain aspects of it in this mythological apparatus always with a semi-satirical intention . ''


Moody	ORGANIZATION	's satire and passion here correspond to
Blake	PERSON	's war on historical Christianity , and his exaltation of Imagination .

		Of course they do not include
Blake	PERSON	's
Everlasting Gospel of Jesus	ORGANIZATION	, with its theory of constant and willing forgiveness of all Sin and its identification of Christ and Man with God .


Moody	ORGANIZATION	, on the contrary , accepted good and evil in the world , as
Blake	PERSON	did ; but he did not recom - mend evil-doing as the first law of Salvation .

		He wished good and evil to contend with one another , that good might be exercised , and triumph .

		In Act V. of the '' Masque of Judgment '' Uriel tells
Raphael	PERSON	that God '' loved not life entirely , good and ill '' ; adding , '' when evil dies , as soon good languishes '' ; whereupon
Raphael	PERSON	, the friend of Man , exclaims : '' Would he had spared That dark Antagonist whose enmity Gave Him rejoicing sinews , for of Him , His foe was flesh of flesh and bone of bone , With suicidal hand He smote him down , And now , indeed , His lethal pangs begin . ''

		In '' The Brute , '' again , the evil that lurks in modern machinery and Efficiency is overpowered in the end by good and serves it .

		There is no senti - mental denial of evil here ; nor is there in
Blake	LOCATION	.

		In the course of the disputes which led up to the Peloponnesian war , a conference was called at

Athens	LOCATION	, certain Athenian envoys who chanced to be in
Sparta	LOCATION	on other business addressed the assembly .

		According to
Thucydides	LOCATION	, they made no attempt to answer the charges brought against them by the Megarians and the
Corinthians	LOCATION	.

		Instead , they recited the leading part played by
Athens	LOCATION	in driving back the barbarian -LRB- Persian -RRB- invaders , and told how an empire had come to her as a natural result . ''

		So we have not

		War resulted .

		After it had been in progress for several years , the Athenians decided to annex the little island of Melos , the only one in the .

		ZEgean Sea , except Thera , not already theirs .

		Possibly this action was due in part to fear that this Dorian colony might become the base of Spartan opera - tions , and also to the desire for a '' scientific frontier '' ; possibly they desired more lands for distribution among Athenian citizens .

		But more weighty than the last-named reason , if we may believe Thucydides , was the fear that the indepen - dence of Melos might incite the Athenian subjects to revolt .

		Having landed on the island with a strong force , they sent ambassadors to demand sub - mission .

		When the Melians demurred , the ambas - sadors warned them to '' think of getting what you can ; since you know , and are speaking to those who know , that , in the language of men , what is right is estimated by equality of power to compel ; but what is possible is that which the stronger practice , and to which the weak submit . ''

		The Melians trusted that the gods would favor them , since they were '' standing up in a righteous cause against unjust opponents . ''

		`` As to the gods , '' re - plied the Athenians , '' we hold as a matter of opin - ion , and as to men we know as a certainty , that in obedience to an irresistible instinct they always maintain dominion , wherever they are the stronger .

		And we neither enacted this law , nor were the first to carry it out when enacted ; but having received it when already in force , and being about to leave it after us to be in force forever , we only avail ourselves of it , knowing that both you and others , if raised to the same power , would do the same .

		PUBLICATIONS OF THE
ILLINOIS	LOCATION	STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A thin volume of a hundred and thirty-eight pages , entitled '' Transactions of the
Illinois State Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, for the year
1913	DATE	, '' has recently reached me , in which is printed the secretary 's report , list of officers , and the papers read at the annual meeting of the Society .

		The meeting thus reported was held in
Springfield	LOCATION	,
May 15 and 16 , 1913	DATE	, that is , more than two years ago .

		It would seem reasonable to expect that instead of a delay of over two years , the transactions should have been published within a few months of the meeting , or at least some time within the year in which it occurred .

		If this example is followed , the annual meeting of
May , 1914	DATE	, will not be reported for another year ; and meantime the meeting of
May , 1915	DATE	, has taken place , and must wait in its turn until two years from the present time before its transactions will appear in print .

		It is difficult to understand why these long delays are necessary .

		What oc - curred of importance at the meeting of
May , 1914	DATE	, we shall not know for another year , so far as the '' Transactions '' can inform us , and we must depend upon other sources of information if we should become impatient .

		Fortunately , the Society began in
1908	DATE	the publication of a quarterly which brings to its friends more recent information , and obviates to a certain degree the necessity of rely - ing upon the '' Transactions . ''

		The quarterly , too , publishes many contributions not read as papers at the annual meetings , and carries out the pur - poses of the Society in placing before its readers a large amount of historical information .

		In addi - tion , the Society issues from time to time special volumes covering subjects the treatment of which is too lengthy to be presented as papers in the '' Transactions '' or as contributions to the quar - terly .

		There have been nine such special volumes printed since
1903	DATE	.

		Before the quarterly began publication , the '' Transactions '' became bulky , and the volume for
1904	DATE	attained a thickness of seven hundred pages , so that the series presents a great variety of thick and thin volumes , very dif - ferent in appearance from the publications issued by the other great historical societies , which gen - erally are published in volumes of nearly uniform size .

		The value of these publications , in whatever form they are printed , is very great ; and care in their preparation is evident both in the fulness of the references and the necessary editing .

		Indexing is carried out thoroughly , and research work by students is greatly aided in the consultation of the various works .

		The work of the
Illinois Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	is a monument of painstaking endeavor , which should meet the approval of its friends and justify the interest shown by the legislators in providing for its needs as they have done .

		Returning to the volume of '' Transactions '' for
1913	DATE	, of which mention was made at the beginning of this communication , there is something to be criticized aside from the long delay in its publica - tion .

		Like all the previous volumes of the series , the printing and binding are lacking in the artistic finish we might well look for in publications of this character .

		Comparing the publications of the
Illinois	LOCATION	society with those issued , for example , by the
Mississippi Valley Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	, where every attention is given to printing , quality of paper , etc. , it is seen that there is much room for improvement in the
Illinois	LOCATION	publications .

Sept. 2	DATE	CHRISTIANITY 'S FIERCEST ANTAGONIST .

		* The second and concluding volume of the life of Nietzsche by his sister ,
Frau Forster Nietzsche	PERSON	, fully sustains the agreeable impres - sion made by the earlier book .

		It is clearly and objectively written -LRB- we notice only some muddle on pp. 147 and 153 as to the date of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's return to
Genoa	LOCATION	from
Leipzig	LOCATION	, which actually took place in
November , 1882	DATE	-RRB- ; if a sisterly estimate should sometimes tend toward favorable exaggeration , this is indeed a venial failing .

		In fact , the '' Life '' refrains from any critical estimate of the final place of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's work which , perhaps , is just as well : given these plainly-shown facts , they can be utilized at some later time .

		The English version is more free and lively than that of the first volume .

		To the eternal recurrence of the translation '' false pathos '' for falsches Pathos , which is quite a different thing , one has long since become resigned .

		Making all discount for
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's merely pathologic vein , the charm of this artist , phi - losopher , and scientist , whose life was devoted to brooding on the deepest problems of life , is irresistible and perennial : some very sweet bells are here jangled .

		It is comforting to be able to moderate the popular impression that
Nietzsche	PERSON	was a tortured invalid : even in
1886	DATE	he was `` completely satisfied with his health '' ; and although constrained to live in rather shabby lodgings or boarding-houses , and at times subject to distressing headaches and eye-strain , he was at least unusually for - tunate in being always free to choose the most favorable place for living and working .

		Even
Nietzsche	PERSON	's utter loneliness exercises the fascination which one feels in the man who tenders himself dearly , who painfully rends oldtime friendships rather than return to the beaten path .

		The tragic side lay in his super-keen sense of the immense cost of it all nowhere more than in his feeling for the desolation which Would be wrought in human relations by blotting out Christianity .

		`` It seems so foolish to want to be right at the expense of human love '' ; `` I have no friend , no not one , who has the faintest inkling of my task '' : '' in the deeper sense , I have no com - rades . ''

		This aggressive thinker dropped out of the sight of
Europe	LOCATION	until discovered by
Brandes	PERSON	, who gave a long series of lectures on
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's philosophy at
the University of Copenhagen	ORGANIZATION	in

The Lonely Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Sturgis & Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		His wonderful creative power is measured by the fact that although he was compelled to give over almost all reading , his equipment of knowledge is lavishly shown on every page , often visioning a whole career or epoch in one pregnant allusion as in his compact characterizations of the seventeenth , eight - eenth , and nineteenth centuries in '' The `` Will to Power . '' ''

		Zarathustra '' -LRB- '' Gelobt sei , was hart macht ! '' -RRB-

		was written in a freezing-cold room .

		He was , above all , to be envied for his mastering sense of a mission to humanity .

		As early as
1876	DATE	he feels called `` to restore to mankind that repose without which no culture can arise or endure '' ; `` I have more weighty matters to think of than my health .

		.

		I have no more time to lose . ''

		This vision of his whole future developed rapidly into a relig - ious fervor for the improvement of the type `` Man . ''

		The life-story is taken up from the time of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's spiritual breach with
Richard Wagner	PERSON	in
1876	DATE	.


Bayreuth	LOCATION	, which he had hoped to find '' a universal bath for souls , '' proved merely `` one more form of sport for the leisured rabble . ''

		He considered '' the per - vading atmosphere of hothouse sensuality '' the root of evil in
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's productions .

		He even attributed the ruin of his own health to `` that nerve-shattering music . ''

		Parsifal , a transcription of
Wagner	PERSON	's actual Christian experience , showed him as '' a reviler of life , an asserter of Nay . ''

		Continued illness led
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	, in
1879	DATE	, to resign the professorship at
Basel	LOCATION	, and with this he turns his back on the Greeks as philosophical guides .

		Thereupon began his alien existence in
Italy	LOCATION	or among the high Alps .

		In
1882	DATE	he began the free use of chloral as an antidote to depressing sleepless - ness , a staff which proved anything but a help during the remainder of this unsettled life .

		On the heights of
Rapallo	LOCATION	, near
Genoa	LOCATION	, in
1883	DATE	came `` my beneficent Yea-assertion , '' `` Zarathustra , '' in such phenomenal bursts of creative power that its author spoke of it as a direct revelation which transcended free-will .

		In finishing the third part
a year later	DATE	,
Nietzsche	PERSON	exclaimed : '' Who knows how many generations must pass before the coming of men who can fully realize what I have done ! '

		Its dark sayings are indeed uttered in parable , sometimes in rather revolting imagery , and in a style partly borrowed from the minor Hebrew prophets -RRB- intense as galloping heart - beats , with a tonal art described by its creator as `` the power which enabled him to fly a thousand miles beyond all that has hitherto been called poetry . ''

		This '' Bible '' of young - est
Germany	LOCATION	makes the sharp division of all men into two classes , Commanders and Obey -
1915	DATE	-RSB- 145 ers .

		Men , inexorable as fate , become Fates themselves , and hardness is the supreme nobil - ity .

		Zarathustra , the superman , utters `` the triumphant paean of the fighter and con - queror '' : to carry out one 's own will is the only `` virtue '' ; that which '' penitential - shirted body-haters '' decry as `` lust '' shall prove for free hearts the Paradise of earth , for lion-willed ones the greatest heart - strengthener , the wine of wines ; '' domineer - ing '' shall prove the earthquake shattering all that is rotten and hollow ; '' selfishness '' shall prove holy * and wholesome when directed against slaves who will not protest for them - selves .

		As a corollary , so-called '' virtuous '' folk are those who have never learned to use their , fists , `` soft rabbits , ink-fish , pen-driv - ers '' ; temperance is the mark of mediocrity , abstinence is preached by impotence .

		War must be declared on all '' small modesties and Podunk virtues . '' ''

		my soul , I have taken from thee all servility , all knee-bending , all crying ' Lord , Lord ! ' '

		The '' meek '' are the priests , the exhausted ones , the woman-souled and slave-souled : for these shall come the Day , the transformation , the sword of judg - ment .

		Much more might be .

		quoted from this mor - bid worship of brute-force on the part of an essentially gentle and suffering nature .

		`` Ver - ily my maw is the maw of an eagle , for it loveth , above all else , the flesh of lambs ! ''

		this from a sweet-spirited , finely-grained , pas - torate-begotten scholar , whose consideration for others was often so exaggerated as to amount to an impediment , and who literally scorned delights and lived laborious days .

		The doctrine of the '' Eternal Recurrence , '' which Nietzsche considered the chief concep - tion of '' Zarathustra , '' is so little developed as to be negligible . ''

		Beyond Good and Evil '' -LRB- 1886 -RRB- '' a school for gentlemen and aristocrats , '' a variation of the main theme of '' Zarathustra , '' was contem - porary with a small group of corrosive and cynical poems .

		The chief statement of his philosophy was held by
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	to be con - tained in his `` Will to Power '' -LRB-
1888	DATE	-RRB- , a long collection of fragments in snapped-off
Prus	PERSON	- sian-Major sentences , differing from the ear - lier works mainly in making a direct frontal attack upon Christianity -LRB- perhaps the fiercest assault ever directed against Christian ideals -RRB- , as the most fatally misleading of all systems of falsehood , the chief token of human deca - dence , in that it opens the door of happiness to the poor in spirit , and has branded natural impulses as vices . ''

		I will create a new order of higher men , from whom laboring spirits and consciences may gain counsel ; who live beyond political and religious tenets , and have even overcome morality . ''

		The message consists of variations on the theme , `` Be an egotist . ''

		It would bring again to honor the words of Plato : '' Everyone of us would wish , if possible , to be lord over all men . ''

		The masses suffocate exceptional men , natural lords and masters .

		Let the weaker perish .

		There are no realities back of the old catch - words , Christianity , Revolution ,
Emancipa	LOCATION	- tion , Equal Rights , Philanthropy , Peace Ad - vocacy ,
Justice	ORGANIZATION	, Truth .

		The work glories in militarism , in
Bismarck	LOCATION	and
Bonaparte	PERSON	, as loftiest ideals .

		A great new personality af - fects the masses with suspense , fear , and sus - picion .

		In the organic world deceit is highly developed in the highest types , and lying is one of the chief weapons of superior men .

		The highest joy in life consists in subjugating whatever stands in one 's way : `` all realms bordering on our own must be thought of as enemies '' an ancient sentiment which the
United States	LOCATION	and their Canadian neighbors have overlooked for a century .

		The weak now prevail because of '' sym - pathy '' ; in two or three generations a race easily runs into such riffraff that it develops an instinctive opposition to all Privilege the very note of true nobility .

		No ordinary man should ever presume to pass judgment on what a great man may allow himself and vastly more in this vein , leading up to the ominous prophecy that `` from now on , there will be favorable conditions for the develop - ment of the great predatory virtues . ''

		The
spring of 1888	DATE	found
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	in
Turin	LOCATION	in fairly good health , and delighting in the joy of living in that very attractive city .

		Toward the end of the same year ap - peared `` Ecce Homo '' -LRB- Nietzsche being the '' Man '' held up to view -RRB- , a jumble of saucy deliverances upon all sorts of things .

		He knows neither sin nor remorse ; too petty for his notice are the concepts God , Immortality , Salvation .

		In his reading he returns con - tinually to a small number of older French writers ; he believes only in French civiliza - tion , and considers everything else
Avhich	PERSON	passes under the name of culture in
Europe	LOCATION	as a counterfeit .

		He decides the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	-
Bacon	PERSON	controversy by sheer intellectual grasp of the matter -LRB- `` What care I for the sorry chatter of American muddle-heads and low - brows ? '' -RRB-

		, in favor of
Bacon	LOCATION	.

		He has never cared for honors , women , or money .

		Love in its methods is essentially war ; in its funda - mental nature a deadly hatred between the sexes .

		The last utterance of the book is a bitter gust of hostility against the Crucified One .

		146 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 2	DATE	At the end of
1888	DATE	came a paralytic stroke , and from this time
Nietzsche	PERSON	's writings were but the disconnected utterances of a feverish patient , though perhaps not so noticeably dif - ferent , in form or content , from those which preceded this attack .

		There followed long years of helplessness , at first with intermit - tent periods of sanity .

		In
1897	DATE	the
Weimar	LOCATION	home -LRB- now converted into the beautiful Nietzsche-Archiv -RRB- was purchased , where every kindly ministration was loyally given by the devoted sister .

		After
1899	DATE	the invalid became gradually weaker , and in the follow - ing year the wearied body was laid to rest under the shadow of the little church of his fathers in
Rocken	LOCATION	.

		The sheer fascination which
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	exer - cises upon his readers derives in no small part from his captivating style of writing or , rather , his styles .

		Often a mere trick of rhyme -LRB- Hohlkopfe : Kohlkropfe -RRB- , an inciden - tal simile , a mint-new epithet -LRB- `` moraline - free virtue '' -RRB- , a smart paradox showing the full perversity of epigram : '' Is mankind made better by civilization ?

		A comic ques - tion , since the opposite is self-evident , and is precisely that which is in civilization 's favor '' ; `` Virtue remains the most expensive vice . ''

		He has no dread of repetition , but plays end - lessly upon a very few ideas .

		In his method of approach to vital problems , he shows a more than Rousseauian ignoring of mere facts .

		He never investigates or collects statis - tics , but draws all his sayings from the glow - ing depths of his inner soul alone .

		The pathological conditions of an insuffi - cient organism account for the rambling structure of his works , doubtless as well for his sovereign contempt for the world 's ac - cepted thinkers and scientists , and explain his estimate of himself . ''

		Everyone who has had intimate relations with me has regarded it as an honor and a distinction ; I hold the same view myself '' ; '' with this Zarathustra I have brought the German language to perfection .

		After Luther and Goethe a third step had to be taken '' ; '' up to now there has been no deutsche Kultur '' ; `` before me there never was any psychology '' ; `` I am no man : I am dynamite '' ; `` I have the most varied range of styles that a man has ever employed '' ; `` I am now the leading moral thinker and worker in
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		It is in direct line with such utterances that we constantly meet with a proud sensitiveness about `` being treated as a person of no ac - count . ''

		a voracious demand for appreciation .

		There is a constant apprehension of intrigues and `` influences , '' of treachery , deceit , mean - ness , and spite in short , a whole range of concepts such as one never encounters except by overhearing in public conveyances on
Thursday	DATE	afternoons .

		A is secretly setting B against N ;
Frau Baumgartner	PERSON	has always to warn against the treacherous counsels of
Frau Overbeck	PERSON	.

		Old confidences and friendships are continually undermined , and give way to suspicion and deadliest hatred .

		The real blemish in the biography is that it serves as the grosse Wdsche for a mountainous German accumulation of household linen , accompanied by a lack of reticence which is siinply incredi - ble to the Anglo-Saxon .

		Let us , finally , be thankful to
Nietzsche	PERSON	for his brave formulations : he has given a gallant banner to be displayed , and the battle now joined between his ideals and those of love and tenderness is the real Armageddon , beside which all noisy racial , dynastic , and economic warfares are merely episodes .

		We must reckon squarely with the conception of `` a race that will conquer and dominate or die in the attempt '' ; of the impossibility of culture except on a foundation of slavery .

		We must weigh fairly the doctrine , `` any society that instinctively rejects war and conquest is on the decline , and ready for democracy and a government by shopkeepers . ''

		No confidence is betrayed by the present reviewer when he remarks that the American consciousness stands hopelessly dazed before this philosophy .

		We regard these pinchbeck heroics as of a piece with the cubbish exuberance of half - grown boys ; we wish for this New Gospel a swift and decisive collapse : '' For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it : and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it . ''

		A NEW PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY .

		* `` If history has any value , '' says Mr.
L. Cecil Jane	PERSON	, in his book on '' The Interpreta - tion of History , '' '' it lies in this , that it sup - plies some clue as to what the future will bring forth . ''

		The business of the historian is therefore to `` make known the lessons of the past , and in doing so to reveal as much as he can of the future . ''

		But in order to do this in a really satisfactory manner one must find , first of all , `` some underlying factor , in accordance with which history may be inter - preted and the occurrence of all events ex - plained . ''

		This underlying factor Mr.
Jane	PERSON	has discovered in the interplay of the '' desire to rule and the desire to be ruled . ''

		In some * THE INTERPRETATION OF HISTORY .

		By
L. Cecil Jane	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 147 men the desire to rule , in others the desire to be ruled , is predominant ; in others still these desires alternately obtain the mastery .

		Na - tions , since they are but groups of individuals , are likewise actuated by these two desires .

		In respect to internal affairs the desire to rule tends to produce self-government , whereas the desire to be ruled makes for despotism .

		In respect to external affairs , the desire to rule results in a policy of '' splendid isolation , '' of national independence , of aggression ; the de - sire to be ruled , on the contrary , makes for cosmopolitanism , universalism , a common - wealth of nations .

		Curiously enough , or per - haps naturally , since nations are as inconsis - tent as individuals , '' it is frequently , almost always , the case that a state which is univer - salist in one aspect is individualist in the other .

		An extension of governmental author - ity at home is normally coupled with the adop - tion of an independent foreign policy ; the admission of obligations towards foreign states is normally accompanied by an asser - tion of the rights of the individual citizen as against the community . ''

		It is to be noted that the term universalism is here employed in place of the phrase '' desire to be ruled , '' while the term individualism replaces the phrase '' desire to rule . ''

		And this practice has been followed throughout the book , which thus turns out to be a sketch of European history , mainly in its political aspects , in terms of concepts that are familiar enough but which have never before been denned pre - cisely as Mr.
Jane	PERSON	defines them .

		Those who know something of European history , particularly , perhaps , those who do not know too much of it , will readily under - stand how it is possible , by dint of great ingenuity and the resolute ignoring of multi - plied difficulties , to sketch the history of the western world in accord with these very gen - eral ideas .

		Yet even the friendly critic , one who contemplates a new philosophy of history with entire equanimity and some little inter - est , is disposed to ask how , after all , `` the occurrence of all events '' is '' explained '' in any satisfactory way by such a philosophy as Mr.
Jane	PERSON	offers .

		The marriage of
Henry VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		with
Anne Boleyn	PERSON	was an event , and one of some importance .

		Let us assume I confess it seems to me a tremendous assump - tion , and one which Mr.
Jane	PERSON	does little to establish that the dominant motive in hu - man action is the desire to rule or to be ruled .

		With this assumption in hand , you can of course '' explain ''
Henry	PERSON	's marriage by say - ing that in
Ensrland	LOCATION	, in the year
1533	DATE	, the adjustment of the desire to rule and the desire to be ruled was such that this particular event was the inevitable result ; just as you may '' explain '' it by saying that it was the result of a `` definite combination of heterogeneous changes , both simultaneous and successive , in correspondence with external co-existences and sequences , '' or , more simply , `` the con - tinuous adjustment of internal relations to external relations . ''

		It must be admitted , however , that these '' explanations '' are some - what remote , and I do not see that
Spencer	PERSON	's formula is more remote than Mr.
Jane	PERSON	's .

		On the whole , it seems simpler to say that
Henry	PERSON	was in love with
Anne Boleyn	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Jane	PERSON	would doubtless reply that a gen - eral formula is not intended to explain par - ticular events , such as the marriage of
Henry VIII.	PERSON	, in terms of conscious purpose ; the value of such a formula , he would insist , is in explaining the broader historical movements , in relating them to each other , and in furnish - ing , through such explanation and relation , a '' clue to what the future w r ill bring forth . ''

		Well , one of these broader movements is the growth and consolidation of monarchial abso - lutism in the seventeenth and eighteenth cen - turies .

		In what sense is it an explanation of this movement to say that it was the result of the desire to be ruled ?

		Why , one asks at once , did the desire to be ruled become so strong at this particular time ?

		The answer to this question reduces even Mr.
Jane	PERSON	to the level of the ordinary historian . ''

		The gradual progress of the universalist movement may be attributed in a measure to the belief that despotism had already been established by the
end of the first half	DATE	of the seventeenth cen - tury ; .

		.

		the absence of resistance created the idea that resistance , or at least successful resistance , was impossible . ''

		In other words , despotism , universally caused by the desire to be ruled , was in this particular case caused `` in a measure '' by the belief that resistance was useless .

		Surely , the desire to be ruled is not the same as the fear of being punished !

		The truth is that Mr.
Jane	PERSON	's formula does not explain past events ; what it does is to classify events , arbitrarily enough for the most part , in certain very general categories .

		It is highly necessary for the historian to classify his facts ; but a classification does not explain the origin of events , and is only the pre - liminary step in their interpretation .

		If Mr.
Jane	PERSON	's formula does not enable him to explain the past , neither does it enable him to predict the future ; it enables him to say only that the future will be like the past , a succession of periods of which universalism and individualism will alternately be the pre - dominant characteristic .

		At present , that is to say in the
spring of 1914	DATE	, when the book was 148 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 2	DATE	written , it is '' clear that .

		.

		the desire to be ruled prevails rather the desire to rule . ''

		It follows , therefore , that '' if human nature re - mains constant in its fundamental character - istic , an individualist reaction , both internally and externally , may be anticipated with confi - dence . ''

		At the risk of being set down as a carping critic , one must say that this , as a prediction of the future , is extremely vague ; it reminds one of the phrase about the pendu - lum , which is alleged to swing first in one direction and then in another and opposite direction .

		M.
Jules Cambon	PERSON	, writing from
Berlin	LOCATION	in
1913	DATE	, unaided , I suppose , by any philosophy of history , was a much better prophet than Mr.
Jane	PERSON	himself , writing a year later from
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		No , Mr.
Jane	PERSON	does not predict the future any more than he explains the past ; he merely projects into the future the categories which have been used to classify the facts of the past , in the confident expecta - tion that future events , when they occur , may be pressed , without too much difficulty , into these categories .

		One may ask in conclusion whether the value of history is what Mr.
Jane	PERSON	supposes it to be , whether it consists in furnishing '' some clue as to what the future will bring forth . ''

		This is , I think , a fundamental error , and one which springs from a vicious confu - sion of the physical and the moral world .

		Why , it is asked , since the scientist , by means of classification and experiment , can predict the action of the physical world , shall not the historian do as much for the moral world ?

		The analogy is false at many points ; but the confusion arises chiefly from the as - sumption that the scientist can predict the action of the physical world .

		Certain con - ditions precisely given , the scientist can pre - dict the result ; he can not say when or where in the future those conditions will obtain .

		Desiring to gain control over nature , the scien - tist is little concerned with any actual con - crete situation , whereas the historian , aiming to appropriate the experience of the past for himself and his fellows , is concerned precisely with the concrete human world , not as it might be under certain conditions but as it has actually been .

		The difference is radical .

		It is for this reason that although scientific knowledge , through its formulae , can be prac - tically applied , to the great benefit of all men , knowledge of history can not be thus practically applied , and is therefore worth - less except to those who have made it , in greater or less degree , a personal possession .

		The value of history is , indeed , not scientific but moral : by liberalizing the mind , by deep - ening the sympathies , by fortifying the will , it enables us to control , not society , but our - selves , a much more important thing ; it prepares us to live more humanely in the pres - ent and to meet rather than to foretell the future .

		ESSAYS ix MINIATURE .

		* Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	is a writer who needs no introduction to the readers of this journal .

		For a score of years , his nicely weighed and admirably judicious essays in miniature upon literary topics have been one of our outstanding features ; and even before Mr.
Moore	PERSON	had become one of our regular con - tributors , we directed attention to him as a poet .

		The two sonnets from his '' Book of Day Dreams '' which we then reprinted -LRB-
March 1 , 1893	DATE	-RRB- still seem to us , as they did at that time , to reach the hi gh - water mark of Amer - ican poetical achievement .

		Of Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's DIAL essays , thirty-nine have now been col - .

		lected into a volume entitled `` Incense and Iconoclasm , '' and offer as many examples of the art of saying a great deal within the limits of a narrow space .

		The '' thirty-nine articles '' of this literary confession of faith touch upon most of the major themes of literary criti - cism , and are notable for their broad views , their penetrative sympathy , and their method of direct approach to the very hearts of their respective subjects .

		The qualifications of a good critic of litera - ture are so many that we would not venture to say that Mr.
Moore	PERSON	has them all ; but he un - doubtedly has the one that is fundamental , the one without which good taste and sound judg - ment and an agile intellect will not be found to constitute salvation .

		The trouble with the greater part of what passes for literary criti - cism in this age of superficial ad captandum writing is that its authors do not know enough about literature .

		This defect in their equip - ment may become fatal at any moment ; and even when the pitfalls in the path are skil - fully avoided , maundering is likely to take the place of precision of aim , the clear stream of thought is likely to grow muddied with sub - jective intrusions , and the rational objective pronouncement gives way to the exhibition of the writer 's own mental processes .

		Like the Oxus , which , for lack of sufficient initial vol - ume and impetus , loses itself in '' beds of sand and matted rushy isles , '' this kind of writing misses the final point of criticism , and pro- vides bewilderment instead of guidance .

		Studies in Literature .

Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 149 '' The Canterbury Tales '' does not seem to have anything to do with the function of the reviewer of a modern novel ; but it really exercises a pervasive influence upon the per - formance of his task .

		Those who will not recognize this fact have precisely the type of mind which denies the `` practicality '' of the time-honored intellectual disciplines which have to struggle for their lives in our educa - tional systems .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's volume borrows its title from the first of the essays included ; but the author takes the side of the angels throughout , the only iconoclasm in which he indulges being the smashing of those idols of the literary market - place which draw to their worship the short - sighted and the uninformed .

		He stands for the eternal values in literature rather than for the temporal trivialities , and has a proper scorn for the catchwords of the hour . ''

		In the end the classics emerge , '' he reminds us ; and , '' taking the whole roll of time , it is not difficult to see what are the prime and what are the secondary qualities of art . ''

		In fact , he might have taken for the text of his entire volume Professor
Shorey	PERSON	's address on '' The Unity of the Human Spirit . ''

		in the volume of '' Representative Phi Beta Kappa Orations , '' from which we quoted in our last issue .

		Profusely scattered through Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's pages are passages of excellent pith , of which a few examples may be given .

		Emerson '' is a veritable quicksand of an author , '' and his felicitous phrasings '' are the tiniest and most fragmentary crystals ever produced by a con - siderable poet , but they flash with the white light of the diamond . ''

		Whitman `` has tried to get the whole universe into his brain , and in a manner has succeeded , only it has turned back into chaos . ''

		`` Moliere was the com - posite smile of mankind . '' ''

		In a nation of graceful writers , -LSB- Balzac -RSB- is the dancing bear of prose . ''

		`` Man 's
Eden	ORGANIZATION	without Eve would be a dirty place , full of tobacco smoke . ''

		Mil - ton '' is going to justify the works of God to man but in the end he comes near justify - ing the devil . '' ''

		Music is a language that has only two words joy and grief . ''

		These aphorisms , and many others of like quality , show us that it is possible to be epigrammatic without being inane .

		But Mr.
Moore	PERSON	is not without his examples of sustained thought .

		Probably the best illus - tration of his application of analytical powers to the development of a considerable argu - ment is to be found in the group of four essays which examine '' The Root Ideas of Fiction , '' which are Identity , Hunger , Love , and Death .

		From the last of these essays we must make an extract . ''

		I have no desire to add a page to Drelincourt on Death .

		But impatience consumes one at our modern attitude to the great , serious , and tragic themes of thought and art .

		Especially does our American hedonism , our love of pleasure , our fear of pain or shock , rebel at the best and highest in literature .

		We grasp at the shallow criticism which speaks of the pessimistic , the melancholy , the gloomy , as the minor note .

		Even in music , from which this term is borrowed , it is not true that melancholy themes or notes which excite sad im - pressions are secondary .

		Most of the great sym - phonies , oratorios , requiems , are sad and stormy and terrible .

		And the same conditions are so plain in literature that a critic must apologize for point - ing it out .

		But , our childish readers say , there is enough that is painful and shocking and terrible in life , why reiterate it in literature ?


Wordsworth	PERSON	prayed for frequent sights of what is to be borne .

		We do not acquire fortitude by running away from danger , and a literature of lollipops is not likely to make a strong race .

		The tragic part of literature is the most tonic and most inspiring . ''

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	has no patience with the cult of modernity which calls upon literature to break away from the moorings of the past , and con - demns writers who turn for inspiration to the old forms and models .

		He knows the funda - mental truth that modernity is to be tested by the spirit or the temper , and not by the frame - work , and that the oldest of old-world themes may serve as its vehicle , as , for example , in the cases of Shelley 's '' Prometheus Unbound '' and
Moody	ORGANIZATION	's '' The Fire-Bringer , '' which are intensely modern poems , despite their mytho - logical investiture . ''

		Practically , the great artists of literature who have brooded deepest over life have affected the distant or the past for their creations .

		They were not foolish enough to doubt that human life is always essentially the same ; they did not really believe in any Age of Gold , or Day of the Gods .

		But they knew that to evolve tragedy , romance , poetry , they must get away from the garish light of their own hour . '

		1 And this lesson is thus homiletically enforced : '' Let us deal kindly with tradition , and tradition will be good to us .

		Let us not try to push our grandsires from their thrones .

		Rather , if it is necessary to save them , let us bear them tenderly out as the pious .

		/ Eneas carried old Anchises from the wreck of burning Troy . ''

		The modernist is merely the victim of a huge delusion , and it may be shrewdly sus - pected that his bankruptcy goes back to the old difficulty of not knowing enough about literature .

		Youths of both sexes just out of college write glibly and blithely about prod - ucts of the contemporary imagination , and every paragraph of what they say betrays a naive ignorance of the natural history of the ideas and the literary forms which they are 150 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 2	DATE	with such innocent confidence discussing .

		The thing they never see is the thing which Mr.
Moore	PERSON	states with apposite force in the following words : '' Yet the fact remains that nothing in our recent output is new .

		In spite of the contortions and struggles of our novelists and playwrights and poets to be strong , to be daring , to be extreme , there is nothing that they utter which will compare in these qualities with much of the literature of the past .

		Take the exploitation of sexual passion and vice by which our contemporaries try to shock us .

		* Mrs.
Warren	PERSON	's Profession ' is milk and water beside the strong meat of ' Measure for Measure ' or ' Pericles . ' '

		Three Weeks ' has no standing at all as an aphrodisiac compared with
Aphra Behn	PERSON	or Casanova .

		The soiled heroes and heroines of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's later novels are mere doves compared with the people in Fielding and
Smollett	PERSON	and the Restoration comedy . ''

		And so it goes , as Mr.
Moore	PERSON	continues to illustrate in much detail , with the other themes and inventions hailed as novelties in most of the uninformed chatter that passes for literary criticism in this impatient age .

		We have marked many other passages for quotation , but the limitations of space forbid their reproduction .

		Let us close with the author 's generalized comment on the `` turn downward '' of our recent literature , and with his plea for the utmost freedom for the artist .

		The plaint is thus stated : Literature `` has largely exchanged verse for prose ; it has min - gled with the crowd on the levels , instead of staying with the shining ones on the hill ; it has dealt very exclusively with the passive peculiarities of women , rather than with the active energies of men . ''

		And the plea is thus voiced : '' Readers of sense know very well how to discriminate .

		They are furnished with feelers , antennae , by which they can separate what is prac - tical from the divine make-believe of literature .

		They are not going to commit murder because they can thrill with the spectacle of
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	's guilt .

		They are not going to filch purses because they can enjoy the humour of FalstafP s exploit at Gadshill .

		They are not going to bolt with the first pleasing person of the other sex , because Cleopatra or Camille is dear to them .

		They accept imaginative literature as a vicarious experience , which enlarges their minds , deepens their emotions , makes them contemporaries of all times , citizens of all places .

		They are willing to allow to the artist the utmost li 1 erty of his materials if he can only make some - thing of them '' If the '' turn downward '' of which Mr.
Moore	PERSON	speaks , is to be checked , we must assume a less tolerant attitude toward the vagaries of our younsr radicals , and insist more sternly upon the standards which they affect to despise .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		OUR SOUTH AMERICAN NEIGHBORS .

		* In recent years ,
Latin America	LOCATION	has been re - discovered by interested Anglo-Americans .

		But not all the travellers find the same things .

		As a rule , American accounts of our Latin neighbors to the south are complimentary ; and we have about decided that
Spain	LOCATION	as a colonizer was not so bad , and that her off -
spring	DATE	states in the western w r orld are rapidly and hopefully moving along the highway of modern civilization .

		But Dr.
Edward A. Ross	PERSON	's new book , '' South of
Panama	LOCATION	, '' is , with regard to much of
South America	LOCATION	, quite pessi - mistic .

		The author 's object is , in part , to show how unlike ourselves the Latin Ameri - cans are , and how difficult it is , in several states , for them to make any real progress .

		He describes much that is good and sound in
Argentina	LOCATION	and
Chile	LOCATION	; but in these and other states he finds that modern civilization is hin - dered because of complexities of race , social and economic conditions , climatic influences , and lack of sound political capacity .

		The author began his travels at
Panama	LOCATION	, and went down through the
West Coast	LOCATION	coun - tries , coming back through
Argentina	LOCATION	.

		There are good descriptive chapters on the regions through which he passed , and more valuable studies of the
Native Races	ORGANIZATION	,
Labor Conditions	ORGANIZATION	, Caste and Class , Morals , Character , Religion and the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, Education , Politics and Gov - ernment .

		The descriptions are always vivid and inter - esting .

		For example , in his account of
Cali	LOCATION	, in
Colombia	LOCATION	, Dr.
Ross	PERSON	says : '' The life of the town revolves about the river that comes tumbling down from among the hills .

		Every bright day nearly the whole adult popula - tion bathe in it .

		From a single point one may see hundreds in the various operations .

		Gentlemen with white linen and black coats strip beside the negro muleteer and the swarthy peon .

		The pretty girl disrobes beside the coal-black negress with a cigar between her lips .

		Every tree and bush yields fancied protection .

		Behind their large sheet-towels men and women undress not fifteen yards from one another , while lads and lasses splash about in the same pool .

		The men wear a napkin about the loins , the women a red calico Mother
Hubbard	PERSON	, which when wet , discloses the form with startling fidelity .

		More leveling even than the bathing beach , the river reveals to his fellow citizens , al - most in puribus , the portly judge , the grizzled municipal councilor or the skinny banker .

		But no one stares or is self-conscious , and the proprieties are strictly observed .

		Still , some deplore this Arca - dian daily dip and point out that only two children out of five in
Cali	LOCATION	have been born in wedlock . ''

		And of
Valparaiso	LOCATION	at night , he writes : * SOUTH OF
PANAMA	LOCATION	.

		By
Edward Alsworth Ross	PERSON	, Ph.D. , LL.D .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 151 '' The night view of Valparaiso from the bal - conies of the cliff dwellers is one of the great sights of the world .

		The vast sickle of the shore lit for nearly two hundred thousand people , the scores of ocean vessels lying at anchor , the harbor lights , the glowing avenues below from which rises mellow the roar of nocturnal traffic , the rippling water under the moonlight and the far horizon of the illimitable Pacific produce an effect of enchant - ment . ''

		It is the author 's belief that much of the backwardness of
South America	LOCATION	is due to the inheritance of evil conditions from the Span - ish colonial regime , `` it is the victim of a l3ad start . ''

		But other conditions weigh down upon these societies .

		There are too few whites except in
Argentina	LOCATION	; there is too little educa - tion ; in politics and government the people are '' poor losers '' ; there is a general lack of persistence and an inability to cooperate ; work is too frequently despised ; truthfulness is too rare a virtue ; morals are loose ; distrust is general in business and politics ; the lower classes seem hopelessly without ambition ; sanitation is unheard of ; little value is at - tached to time ; there is in most states no flow of immigration which might stimulate and elevate the present populations ; women have little influence , and society is '' androcentric . ''

		These hindrances to progress are less in evi - dence in the south than in the north ; in par - ticular ,
Argentina	LOCATION	appears to be much freer of them than any other state .

		Life is monotonous nearly everywhere , and is filled with trivialities .

		Gossip , visiting , drinking , revolutions help to pass the time .

		The author suggests that '' the passion of these people for politics is due in part to the un - ventfulness of their lives . ''

		For young Americans and other foreigners the environ - ment is deadening , nothing to do , no whole - some amusements , no one suitable to marry .

		And the same is true of the South American who goes abroad for education . ''

		It is pathetic to see how girls educated in a
Quebec	LOCATION	or
New York	LOCATION	convent return to
Cali	LOCATION	with a resolve not to sink into this listless , indolent way , but to ' start something , ' give a garden party or lawn fete , make a real social life .

		But the system is too strong for the poor things .

		They are steam - rolled by the church and by the established social customs .

		After a while , broken in spirit , they cease to struggle , sink into acquiescence , and become just as narrow in interests and pursuits as the women who have never been out of the valley . ''


Argentina	LOCATION	excepted , the state organization is of , by , and for the small upper class .

		For them are the governmental positions , and for them only is the education necessary to fit one for a position .

		Manual labor is despised , and a long nail on the little finger is evidence of higher respectability than calloused palms .

		With inherited Spanish fondness for town life , those who can do so stay in the larger centres , leaving the country to the lower class laborers and the overseers .

		As a result , '' from the
Rio Grande	LOCATION	down the
West Coast	LOCATION	to
Cape Horn	LOCATION	, free agricultural labor as we know it does not exist . ''

		Government expenditures are made mainly upon the towns and cities .

		Of public life in general , Dr.
Ross	PERSON	says : '' One who looks for good popular government in tropical
South America	LOCATION	would expect to gather grapes from thorns and figs from thistles .

		Take , for example ,
Bolivia	LOCATION	... There are a few men of character , ability and education , who are working together for definite public ends ... But this bit of leaven is too small in relation to the lump to be leavened .

		Men of broad outlook and high firm character are too few .

		They lack following and support .

		With us the moral and intellectual peaks rise from a plateau ; in the Bolivian people they rise from the plain .

		The Indians are exploited , helpless and inert , and practically nothing is being done to elevate them .

		The cholos are bigoted and egotistic , of very little worth either intellectual or moral , and they show few signs of improvement . ''

		The best society suffers from being too '' androcentric . ''

		Here the male dominates all ; girls and women stay at home in seclu - sion , although as a rule they are brighter and more intellectual than the males of their own class , who are exposed to various dissipations .

		The upper class family is clanlike in its close - ness and in its size , but family discipline is lax .

		Generally speaking , manners are very good , but `` altruism scarcely exists . ''

		The mistress of the house takes little interest in the housekeeping , which is left to incompe - tent servants .

		The Church is supported and to an extent controlled by
the State	ORGANIZATION	, a fact that probably prevents wholesome outside forces from working for the elevation of standards among clergy and people .

		The women and lower classes are generally relig - ious after a fashion , but '' few men who wear coats go to confession . ''

		But Dr.
Ross	PERSON	does not paint always with a sooty brush .

		He has much to say of healthy forces here and there , and signs of progress .

		The churches and the schools are improving slowly .

		A middle class is developing in
Chile	LOCATION	.

		White immigration to the highlands of the northern states may result in develop - ment and stability .

		While there is not an intellectual democracy , the enlightened elite is increasing in numbers .

		The best country , the author thinks , is
Argentina	LOCATION	, `` a white man 's country , '' with a more favorable geog - raphy , many immigrants , a better population , and open-minded leaders .


WALTER L. FLEMING	PERSON	.

		152 THE DIAL -LSB- Sept. 2
BELGIUM	LOCATION	'S POET-LAUREATE .

		* Those who hope for the ultimate triumph of the Allies will find encouragement in
Stefan Zweig	PERSON	's study of
Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	.

		The book is in no sense a biography , but an exposition of the intellectual and moral evolu - tion of the poet .

		He appears as one who , in
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's words , '' represents worthily that which is great and heroic in a people . ''

		The epigraph of the essay might be the lines quoted at the head of the third chapter : '' Je suis le fils de cette race Tenace , Qui veut , apres avoir voulu Encore , encore et encore plus . ''

		Verhaeren 's attitude toward life is constantly compared to that of `` Walt Whitman ; but he worked out his philosophy independently , and has apparently succeeded better than the American poet in voicing the ideals of his own people .

		The peasants among whom he spent his early years regard him as one of themselves , and he is as much at home among , them as in the great world where his fame has led him .


Stefan Zweig	PERSON	, an Austrian poet , the dis - ciple and translator of
Verhaeren	LOCATION	, has given a sympathetic and perhaps at times over - laudatory history of his master 's thought , from `` Les Flamandes '' -LRB- 1883 -RRB- to `` Les Bles Mouvants '' -LRB-
1913	DATE	-RRB- .

		His book , admirably translated by Mr.
Bithell	PERSON	, would have made its mark at any time , and has now gained a poignant interest from the European cata - clysm .

		For
Verhaeren	PERSON	is par excellence the singer of our time in all its complexity .

		He has wrung poetry from the most unpromising subjects , and created by sheer force of will a Utopia out of the most prosaic reality .

		His present disillusion can only be the more bitter .

		In the face of the disaster that confronts humanity to-day ,
Zweig	PERSON	's opening hymn to the new age assumes a ghastly irony .

		If `` now in the very air man is building a new road from country to country '' it is with the intent to destroy alike the priceless monuments of the past and the latest achievements of human industry .

		`` Who will still dare to say `` only eternal earth has changed not nor grown older '' ?

		For what of the bestial substratum of human nature which
Kultur	PERSON	has only aggravated , and which is to-day befouling the centre of the world 's civilization by outrages that only primeval savages were deemed capa - ble of imaging ?

		become a mere henchman of the
Kaiser	PERSON	if we accept
Zweig	PERSON	's dictum that '' only that poet can be necessary to our time who feels that everything in this time is necessary , and there - fore beautiful '' ?

		We shall not have long to wait for
Vertiaeren	ORGANIZATION	's poetic judgment of the beauty of the necessity of the rape of his country by
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Beauty there is , even in the terrible events of to-day , but it is the world-old beauty of the heroism and self - sacrifice of individuals and nations for an idea ; in the diabolic modern ingenuity in the creation of strange images of death , there is only hideousness .

		Yet the age on which the iron fist of mili - tarism has set its ghastly seal had its poetry in the overflow of energy , even though for the moment that energy is at the service of the iron fist .

		Verhaeren 's greatness lies in having seized and crystallized that poetry .

		His joy - ous acceptance of life in all its manifestations , which was to lead him at last to a lyric panthe - ism , is shown to be an inheritance from his race ; for the Belgians are pictured as possess - ing to a higher degree than any other people a delight in every exercise of intoxicating activity .

		The most heroic exploit in their his - tory , previous to
1914	DATE	, their revolt from
Spain	LOCATION	, is explained as a struggle against the ascetic Puritanism of Philip II. , who would have curtailed their free dionysiac enjoyment .

		Thus the reader is prepared for the brief but charming sketch of
Verhaeren	ORGANIZATION	's youth in
Flanders	LOCATION	.

		We see him first in the Jesuit col - lege of Sainte-Barbe at
Ghent	LOCATION	, where he met
Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		The fathers w r ould have saved their young pupils from the world by making them priests , and endeavored to inspire in them a profound respect for the past , with a hatred of all innovation .

		Verhaeren carried away a lasting sentiment of the heroism of the monastic life and its poetry ; but his wild nature could not be cramped within cloistral walls .

		Zweig suggests that the chief result of this early training was to turn the poet 's lust of life away from material things toward science and art . ''

		The priest they sought to make of him he has really become , only he has preached everything that they proscribed , and fought against everything that they praised . ''

		After the school at
Sainte-Barbe	ORGANIZATION	,
Verhaeren	PERSON	studied law at
Lou	LOCATION	vain , where , urged by his fiery blood , he threw himself into carousals of which he still tells with glee .

		Admitted to the bar at
Brussels	LOCATION	, he joined a coterie of young artists , and , like
Gautier	PERSON	, he won a name for shocking the bourgeois by fantastic freaks of dress and conduct .

		His unpublished juve - nilia , written at this time in imitation of Lamartine and
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, are nevertheless
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 153 in `` immaculate Alexandrines . ''

		Finally he threw aside the barrister 's gown forever , and turned to poetry as his vocation .

		His first published work , destined to .

		con - found his friends and the critics , was `` Les Flamandes . ''

		Written under the influence of Le
Monnier	PERSON	, the interpreter in
Belgium	LOCATION	of Zola 's naturalism , the book aims at trans - planting naked reality into verse .

		With de - liberate purpose the author discards in these sketches of old Flanders all that is sentimental or romantic , all that is conventionally known as poetry , and gives pictures of primitive bru - tality . ''

		Barbarian , '' shouted the critics ; and
Zweig	PERSON	finds something '' genuinely barbarous , ravage with Teuton strength , '' in
Verhaeren	LOCATION	's nature .

		His inspiration is Rabelaisian : he possesses the fiery blood of Rubens and Jor - daens .

		And yet he still keeps the traditional Alexandrine mould .

		Another side of Belgian life is portrayed in the poet 's next work , `` Les Moines , '' an echo of his early education .

		As in `` Les Flam - andes '' he had sung of the lusty youths and maidens of the kermesses of yesteryear , he now celebrates the peaceful life of the monks in the manner of the older Flemish painters .

		Before writing this book he had spent three weeks at Forges with the fathers , who in their simple piety initiated him into their holy of holies with the hope of winning him for the priesthood .

		But his attitude was rather that of aesthetic admiration than of devout wor - ship .

		He hails the monks as undaunted cham - pions of a lost cause , and the beauty of their sacrifice is intensified for him as being a relic of the past .

		In studied Parnassian sonnets he portrays the various aspects of this calm life , and the contrasting characters more or less subdued by a common discipline .

		Here is the first effort at psychological analysis .

		Verhaeren 's development is always toward the discovery of the inner meaning of the alle - gorical sense of external phenomena .

		Hence his welcome of scientific and mechanical prog - ress as matter for poetry .

		Zweig notes the pictorial character of both the early collections . ''

		Monks , '' says he , '' are for Verhaeren heroic symbols of mighty periods in the past , '' and he adds that the poet '' seemed obliged to exhaust both the his - torical styles before he could reach his own , the modern style . ''

		Yet though both volumes show a distinct harking back to the past in quest of beauty , for which reason
Verhaeren	PERSON	has repudiated them , we must still note the essential realism .

		Before writing `` Les Flamandes '' the poet liad caroused at kermesses which imitated as best they could the ancient festivals ; early education and the visit to Forges inspired '' Les Moines . ''

		It is always a real world that he invokes , even in his effort to escape from actuality .

		After `` Les Moines '' comes a period of storm and stress a nervous breakdown brought on by the supersensitiveness of the poetic temperament .

		Of this experience Ver - haeren has left a record in the trilogy , `` Les Soirs , '' '' Les Debacles , '' and '' Les Flambeaux Noirs . ''

		Here we have the poet playing the role of the naturalistic novelist , with himself as the subject .

		He dissects his diseased mind and emotions as a surgeon a specimen in the operating room .

		Zweig 's phrase is here vigor - ous , if not altogether happy : Verhaeren has '' immortalized in poems the process of the inflammation of his nerves . ''

		Zweig follows him through all the stages of this crisis , first physical , then psychic illness nearly ending in madness .

		A couple of citations may suffice to show the tenor of the whole .

		The poet is in
London	LOCATION	and sees the corpse of his reason float - ing down the Thames .

		A similar phenome - non is noted by
George Brandes	PERSON	among the early German romanticists .

		He calls it '' dis - integration of the ego . ''

		Verhaeren writes : ''
Elle	PERSON	-LSB- ma raison -RSB- est morte de trop savoir , De trop vouloir sculpter la cause . ''

		Or again : '' Je veux marcher vers la folie et ses soleils . ''

		Here is the
Ultima Thule	LOCATION	of decadent romanticists .

		It is the instinct among them which inspired
Joubert	PERSON	's defini - tion , `` chercheurs de delire . ''

		Although the volumes contain spirited verse , many readers will not accept
Zweig	PERSON	's enthusiastic judgment that the poet 's analysis of his crisis possesses monumental value .

		But
Verhaeren	PERSON	was too sturdy to remain long in these mazes of subjectivity .

		Like Goethe , he frees himself from excess of pas - sion by giving it artistic expression in symbols . ''

		The poet has torn his fear , his burning , moan - ing , horrible fear , out of himself , and poured it into his bell-ringer , who is consumed in his blazing belfry .

		He has turned the monotony of his days to music in his poem of the rain ; his mad fight against the elements , which in the end break his strength , he has shaped into the image of the ferryman struggling against the current that shat - ters his oars one after the other . ''

		The pendulum has swung again , and the man who would hold himself apart and see all in the terms of his own personality throws him - self with open arms into the cosmic life to refind himself .

		`` Nothing human is alien to me , '' becomes his motto , and he hails with a renewed joy every manifestation of the energy and aspiration that characterize his genera - tion .

		For him this alone is poetry , this the 154 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 2	DATE	music of the spheres to-day .

		Immense cities , which had formerly been anathema to him , furnish the most striking example of this united energy , and he finds poetry in the very force by which they suck the blood of the country .

		So we have another trilogy , '' Les Campagnes Hallucinees , '' '' Les Villages Illusoires , and `` Les Villes Tentaculaires . ''

		In the assembly of vast multitudes of men all moved by a common instinct , the race for power , whether by the acquisition of money or science ,
Verhaeren	PERSON	would see the breakdown of national barriers and the formation of a cosmic consciousness bent on the concentra - tion of human energy .

		This Utopian ideal he has expressed in his symbolistic drama , `` Les Aubes . ''

		His verse form , too , has changed .

		During his storm and stress he had found the vers libre , stanzas of irregular lines ; and into the later poems the rhythm of all the gigantic industry of modern life has entered .

		Herein lies his appeal to all manner of men .

		His work is filled with what
Zweig	PERSON	calls `` the new '' pathos , '' which at once mirrors and inspires the passion of his hearers .

		In
Verhaeren	PERSON	's latest work another change is to be marked .

		This singer of force , of uni - versal energy working with common interest toward cosmic progress , finds a higher ideal still , the union of humanity by universal love and admiration which joins men in their common purpose and musters individuals and nations into a common cause , the striving for the onward march of life . ''

		II faut aimer pour decouvrir avec genie '' is the note of his mature work .

		We need not wonder if his bit - terness knows no bounds to-day .

		He has chanted the triumph of life , and now the can - * non , mouthpieces of the modern quest of power , are pealing back the triumph of death .

		Aside from his lyric work and yet a part of it a synthesis of it are his dramas , in which prose and verse stand side by side , prose for the groundwork , lyric for ecstasy .

		Of course they are closet dramas , perhaps too crowded with symbolically expressed ideas for complete success on the stage .

		`` Le Cloitre '' recalls the early collection of sonnets , `` Les Moines . ''

		The monks are presented as all striving for the prior 's chair a symbol of the greatest fitness to serve God .

		The one chosen believes himself unworthy because of an early crime which he confesses to his breth - ren , to the people , and to the judicial authori - ties .

		The Catholic doctrine of expiation by confession furnishes here strikingly dramatic crises at least .

		`` Les Aubes '' shows
Oppido	PERSON	- magnum besieged by paupers and outcasts .

		The tribune Herenien secretly admits the enemy into the city , not as the act of a traitor but with the conviction that goodness over - comes strife .

		He falls the first martyr to his ideal , but the cause is won .

		In ''
Philip II.	PERSON	, '' Verhaeren pictures the .

		Spanish monarch as .

		Antichrist , for he has blasphemed against the spirit of life . ''

		Helene de Sparte , '' which more nearly conforms to dramatic require - ments , is the tragedy of a woman afflicted by excessive beauty .

		She is tormented by the desires of men , which she kindles against her will .

		Snatched from one lover to another , the cause of innumerable crimes , a bane to ships and men and cities and most of all to herself ^ she finds refuge only in death . ''

		I have seen the flaring of so many flames that now I love only the hearth 's glow and the lamp , '' is her plaintive cry .

		It is characteristic of Verhaeren that the spirit of a play even about
Helen	PERSON	should be anti-erotic .

		Zweig suggests that one cause of the inadequate appreciation among the great public of his dramas is the absence of insis - tence on amorous passion .

		There is not a sin - gle woman in the caste of `` Le Cloitre . ''

		Ver - haeren is one of the most masculine of lyrie poets : his appeal is rather to action and the exercise of the intelligence and will than to pity .

		Sex-instinct he has never taken as a serious problem .

		Its gratification is a matter of course in the life of vigorous manhood ab - sorbed in intellectual pursuits .

		All his love poems are addressed to a single woman , his wife .

		`` Les Heures Claires , '' `` Les Heures d'Apres-midi , '' '' Les Heures du Soir '' form a striking contrast both in diction and sentiment with the frequently rough and almost brutal tone of the rest of his work .

		Written in maturity , they speak with gentle simplicity of a great and lasting passion . ''

		Je te regarde et tous les jours je te decouvre '' is the key - note . ''

		Oh la tendresse des forts ! ''

		exclaims one critic in wondering admiration .

		We have already said that the translation of
Zweig	PERSON	's book is admirably done .

		One never realizes that it is a translation at all .

		It might have been written as it stands by an English poet , with a mind more given to metaphysics than most of them are .

		That the author is himself a poet no one can doubt .

		Even in its English dress the style is that of poetry ; figures abound on every page , and a poet 's conception of the greatness of his role permeates the book from cover to cover .

		Zweig has cited generously : the passages are well chosen both as illustration and to inspire a desire in the reader for further acquain - tance with
Verhaeren	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		The translator has wisely left these quotations in the original .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 155 The book ends with a bibliography citing edi - tions , criticisms , and English translations of Verhaeren .

		Those who wish for a brief but excellent selection of
Verhaeren	ORGANIZATION	's work in metrical translation will welcome the new edition of Miss
Alma Strettell	PERSON	's '' Poems of
Emile Ver	PERSON	- haeren . ''

		The book contains a reproduction of
Sargent	PERSON	's portrait of the author , a brief bio - graphical notice , and English renderings of a score of poems chosen from '' Les Villages Illusoires , '' `` Les Heures Claires , '' `` Les Ap - parus dans mes Chemins , '' and `` La Multiple Splendeur . ''

		Thus , striking examples of the poet 's middle period -LRB- 1891-1906 -RRB- , with three representative poems of his mature work , are included .

		The translations are executed with no little technical skill ; one can hear , for instance , the dull monotony of the rain almost as well in the English as in the French of '' La Pluie '' : '' Long as unending threads , the long-drawn rain Interminably , with its nails of grey , Athwart the dull grey day , Rakes the green window-pane So infinitely , endlessly , the rain , The long , long rain , The rain . ''

		The variety of the selections is also note - worthy .

		One finds descriptions of nature such as '' The Snow , '' landscapes such as '' The Silence , '' symbolic pieces dramatic in move - ment such as `` The Bell-Ringer '' or `` The Ferryman , '' love poems impassioned in their simplicity , and finally the inspiring vision of Saint
George	PERSON	, of which the courageous note rings out again in one of the last poems in the collection , '' Life '' : '' To march , thus intrepid in confidence , straight On the obstacle , holding the stubborn hope stiU Of conquering , thanks to firm blows of the will , Of intelligence prompt , or of patience to wait ; And to feel growing stronger within us the sense , Day by day , of a power superb and intense .

		THE I : srxER LIFE OF MTJSIC .

		* Although the author of '' The Mysticism of Music '' had given the manuscript his final revision , he did not live to see its issue from the press .

		The subject was one that appealed to him strongly , and he has put into the work some of his best thought and inspiration .

		Music has always been a handmaiden of the * THE MYSTICISM OF Music .

		By
R. Heber Newton	PERSON	,
D.D. New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		Music AND THE HIGHER EDUCATION .

		By
Edward Dickinson	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		Church ancilla domini ; and the leaders in ecclesiastical advance and development have known how to appreciate what this alluring coadjutor in the sacred service has done for them .

		Dr.
Newton	PERSON	's volume is an enlarge - ment of two discourses delivered some years ago ; but the thought of the author has deepened and clarified with the lapse of time , and we have here his mature and thoroughly considered utterance . ''

		Music , as we know it , was born into the world in the age of science .

		It is the art of the age of knowledge .

		We need not , then , be surprised to find that music is not an art merely , that it is a science as well .

		This which is true of all arts , is pre-eminently true of music .

		It is intellectual as well as emotional .

		It deals with thoughts as much as with feelings .

		Its contents are ideas .

		Mu - sicians are measured in the scale of music by their intellectuality .

		Note the intellectual majesty which crowns the heads of the great masters of music .

		Handel and
Mozart	PERSON	and
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	lift above us heads as of the immortals .

		Intellectuality is stamped in every line of their faces . '' ''

		Music is not an imitation of nature .

		Nature provides no ready-made models of melody or har - mony , as she provides perfect types of form and color .

		Hints she gives of music but only hints .

		Man evolves music from within his own nature .

		It is distinctively the human art .

		It comes forth in the awakening self - consciousness of man .

		Music expresses the awakening self - consciousness of man , as he confronts the mystery of the universe , only to find a deeper mystery within himself .

		The marvellous creations of modern music are studies in self - consciousness ; attempts to run the gamut of man 's moods , to fathom the problems of his being , to find a voice for ` An infant crying in the
night	TIME	, An infant crying for the light . ' ''

		The thesis outlined in the above quotations receives extended treatment in the two papers included in this book .

		The first is on the sub - ject of `` Mysticism in Music , '' the second deals with `` Christian Mysticism in Music . ''

		The entire scope of the mystical consciousness is found in the great works of the great musi - cians : the symphonies of Beethoven present - ing a complete and positive exposition , the other musicians an exposition individualistic in every case but sometimes more burdened with a negative element of struggle and im - perfect realization .

		The book is written with eloquence and au - thority ; the writer knows music thoroughly and deeply , and the subject is one upon which he had unquestionable right to speak , being at once a great teacher and an adequate musi - cian .

		The reader is led on from height to height of exposition , until the final outlook gives him a new realization and a new under - standing of the illuminating art of music .

		156 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 2	DATE	In `` Music and the Higher Education , '' Mr.
Edward Dickinson	PERSON	of
Oberlin College	ORGANIZATION	makes a strong plea for the admission of musical study to a regular place in the college cur - riculum .

		Indeed , his argument for his own special art involves the consideration of the larger project for the admission of the study and practice of every art into the courses now offered at our universities .

		At present , with such exception as is furnished by polytechnic courses , art occupies only a place of modified sufferance .

		Thus music in some institutions may be studied under such teachers as Profes - sor Converse at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and Professor
Parker	PERSON	at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	; but even in these favored places music is not given the position and rank which belong to it .

		The question of the educational value of the fine arts remains practically to be settled , and one may well ask why a fully equipped school of music should not be granted a coordinate position with a similarly endow r ed school of botany or mathe - matics or chemistry .

		Sitting in his lecture room at the close of a scholastic year , the writer falls into a revery , and there floats before him the succession of thoughts which have crystallized in this volume : '' Brooding over the problem in the stillness of his deserted lecture room , this devotee of music , grateful for what his art had done for him , and also cordially recognizing the deference due to other minds of different experience from his own , began to formulate his convictions of the true relationship between his own department and the whole mechanism of college life .

		For he felt that his duty required not only that he cultivate the love of music in his pupils , but that he also adjust the results of his teaching to other disciplines , so that out of his effort , in correspondence with the effort of other guides , a unity of intellectual life should proceed .

		He believed that this unity could be achieved , but under what conditions , and by what methods ' ?

		Like the French philosopher , he must be allowed to say , ' I cultivate my garden , ' but at the same time he must look beyond the bounds of the little estate that is given him to till , and find inspiration and direction for his labors in the adaptation of his husbandry to the issues of the greater harvest . ''

		In the development of the purpose which Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	has placed before him , it be - comes indispensable that he should take a survey of the history of music , give an account of its significance and value to general culture , and show how far its high and unquestionable claims have reached their fruition .

		It must be said at once that all this has been very well done ; and as the main body of the work is given over to this achievement , the volume takes its place side by side with Dr.
Newton	PERSON	's book , and justifies the title given to the pres - ent review .

		The author 's point of view is made plain in the following quotation : '' When our spirits are so moved by a stream of noble harmonies that all that is beautiful and holy in life seems for the moment concentrated for our joyful contemplation , are these celestial visitants only a mockery , deceiving us , like the desert mirage , with a semblance of truth , which , when it fades , leaves nothing behind but the memory of a glittering delusion ?

		This can hardly be .

		Music is definite enough when it takes pos - session of language and event , and adds some - thing to them which they required to attain full supremacy over us .

		We see clearly enough what this added element is and the eminent service that music performs .

		And do we not often feel that music gains an even firmer basis of expression when it renounces the aid of a confederate art , and takes its stand in a domain of feeling where it can afford to be exclusive because sufficient unto itself and supreme ?

		The chief support of this conviction lies in the consciousness that , when we hear great music , it is not one part of our nature that is taken captive as when we come in contact with a picture , a tale , a play , which shuts off a part of life and holds us to that but the music is not circumscribed , it is the circuit of our spiritual nature that is traversed , we are no longer in the presence of the phenomenal but the essential ; it is the whole in us that is em - braced , it is the whole in us that rejoices . ''

		The contention that the arts should have a prominent place in college courses is un - doubtedly an important one ; and the claims of music for inclusion in the curriculum are persuasively and logically unfolded in Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	's presentation .

		The experiences of a lifetime have gone to the making of his argument .

		We know of no book which more thoroughly covers its ground ; and the elo - quent exposition will carry conviction to the reader .

		It should render admirable service in the needed reformations and justifications which it propounds .

		NOTES ON NEW NOVELS .

		The seemingly interminable procession of Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's earlier stories reprinted in Amer - ican editions is continued with '' The City of Pleasure '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The first thirteen chapters pile up a mystery reminiscent in certain details of
Stevenson	PERSON	's '' The Wrong Box , '' with a great Lon - don amusement park as the scene .

		There is apparent murder , an attempt at murder both by shooting and poison , a surreptitious love affair , a hateful old woman , a popular musical director and composer , and a millionaire , besides various exotic specimens of humanity to begin with .

		What is more , the mystery baffles ordinary solution until a chapter or two before the close , by which time
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 157 two other love affairs have been introduced .

		The book is absorbing in its fantastic mingling of gayety and mystery .

		Indians , Mormons , outlaws , and the spirit of the western desert and mountains combine to make Mr.
Zane Grey	PERSON	's `` The Rainbow Trail '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- an unusual story .

		A preacher disgraced by his lapsing faith comes into this distant region to rescue , if possible , three persons who have been imprisoned in a canon by an earthquake .

		One of these he conceives of as a beautiful girl , and in imagination he falls in love with her .

		When at last he comes upon the party , the girl has been sealed to a fanatic
Mormon	PERSON	as his plural wife .

		By that time his rescue of a noble
Navajo	ORGANIZATION	's sister has brought him the able assistance he so needs for her salvation , not alone from the Indian but also from a brave Mormon who meets them in the
Grand Canon	ORGANIZATION	of the
Colorado	LOCATION	.

		Of course the book is melodramatic , but not many readers are likely to object to it on that score .

		The impress being made on literature by jour - nalism as the practical university in which the art of writing in these days is most readily acquired shows in the number of journalists who are en - listed as heroes of novels .

		Young
Andrew Dick	PERSON	in Mr.
Keble Howard	PERSON	's '' Merry Andrew '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- is an instance in point .

		Very much in love , he fails to get his degree at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	at a moment when his father 's death leaves him penniless .

		He comes to
London	LOCATION	to conquer , and is nearly overwhelmed in his first attempts to earn a living with his pen .

		Driven to teaching , he finally makes a successful connection by a combination of hard work , deter - mination , and luck .

		The book is well named , for the situations in which the hero is involved bring smiles , if not laughter .

		The real savor of
New England	LOCATION	, especially of that well preserved and salted portion of it lying about
Cape Cod	LOCATION	, pervades Mr.
Joseph C. Lincoln	PERSON	's new story , '' Thankful 's Inheritance '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The title refers to a plot of land and an old house which a woman of sound common sense inherits and utilizes as a boarding-house .

		In and around this home the whole action of the story takes place and the courtship of both the owner and her pretty niece comes to fruition .

		There is even something more than a suspicion of a ghost on the premises ghost enough , at least , to bring the villain of the tale into remorse of conscience and round out the material side of the happy ending .

		It is a story witty enough to make its reading a delight .

		With ''
Penelope	PERSON	's Postscripts '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	ton -RRB- we bid good-bye but not finally , let us hope to the trio of heroines who have smiled through two earlier volumes , shepherded by Mrs.
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	.

		Like its predecessors , this smaller book maintains the idea that '' the most charming knowledge is the sort that comes by unconscious absorption , like the free grace of God . ''

		But the three delightful women are now all married , and it is '' ten years after , '' and
Penelope	PERSON	herself writes that she and her husband are '' growing old with the country that gave us birth -LRB- God bless it ! -RRB-

		and our children growing up with it , as they always should . ''

		It is a book of peace in a sadly troubled world .

		`` Me '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is hardly a novel , though it has many of the aspects of fiction .

		It is rather an autobiography , sincerely written , of a young girl who eventually becomes a successful author and playwright , and of her struggles from the moment of leaving her Canadian home to become the assistant editor of a journal in
Jamaica	LOCATION	until she rids herself of the man with whom she believed herself to be in love , a man greatly her senior and a rather dreadful person in spite of his kind - ness to her .

		Although published anonymously , the author of '' Me '' is believed to be Onoto Watanna -LRB- Mrs.
Winnifred Eaton Babcock	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The book has an introduction by Miss
Jean Webster	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Arnold Mulder	PERSON	opens a new field for Amer - ican fiction in '' Bram of the Five Corners '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , a story of the
Hollanders	ORGANIZATION	in
Michigan	LOCATION	.

		The portrayal of the struggle of conscience in a young candidate for the Christian Reformed min - istry is strongly and plausibly done .

		The disturbing question , moreover , is a highly practical prob - lem in eugenics which confronts him at the moment when his faith in Calvinism seemed most secure .

		Driven from his church ,
Bram	ORGANIZATION	takes up newspaper work as a sort of last chance , and is awakened to its powers of service by his city editor .

		The book is ably written , and excites lively hopes for fur - ther work from its author .

		Mr.
Frank R. Adams	PERSON	is better known as a pur - veyor of libretti for opera bouffe than as a teller of tales , but his `` Five Fridays '' -LRB- Small ,
May	DATE	- nard
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an entertaining combination of the two arts ; it is an amusing story which might easily be made the basis for an amusing farce .

		Several widely varying characters are marooned on an island , with little or no food .

		Rumors of crime bring from the mainland other characters .

		A tenuous love story is introduced , and the situa - tions multiply until the farce almost becomes bur - lesque .

		In Mrs.
Eleanor Hallowell Abbott	PERSON	's `` The In - discreet Letter '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the action , until the climax is reached , takes place on a rushing train .

		The characters are casual , mere chance ac - quaintances thrown together in the journey .

		The two men are externally commonplace , but with the inner
spring	DATE	of human kindliness that seldom fails to flow in proof of the whole world 's kinship .

		The third character is a true heroine of romance , speed - ing on her way to the journey 's end that Shake - speare sang .

		And there is a delicious touch at the end , as gratifying as it is unexpected .

		The theme of Mrs.
Martha Gilbert Dickinson Bianchi	PERSON	's latest novel , '' The Kiss of Apollo '' -LRB- Dufifield -RRB- , is the old one of the woman who seeks to conquer nature , and is conquered by it .

		The heroine is shocked in her early youth by the laxity of metropolitan society .

		She closes her eyes to realities and lives in her own world , scarcely moved when her husband leaves her for another .

		At the end , the love she had earlier spurned she eagerly grasps , in the face of the conventions , her boyhood lover leaving the priesthood to join her .

		158 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 2	DATE	BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		In '' Contemporary Portraits '' and actions 8 -LRB- Kenncrley -RRB- , Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	has written two books where he thinks he has written but one .

		The first of these is what the title implies , an effort to portray men Mr.
Harris	PERSON	has known .

		With the exception of
Fabre	PERSON	, some of whose observa - tions of insects and animals are charmingly retold , the seventeen men Mr.
Harris	PERSON	depicts are of the literary and artistic classes .

		We are made to see them as Mr.
Harris	PERSON	saw them ; and we are grateful for many new glimpses of the giants of a former generation ,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, Renan ,
Whistler	LOCATION	, and
Guy de Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	, as well as for a closer acquaintance with liv - ing or very recent celebrities .

		The portrayal , though sympathetic , is honest .

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	is willing , for example , to record
Browning	PERSON	's outburst of bitterness because
Lowell	PERSON	was lionized socially more than himself , and to express the conviction that
Browning	PERSON	`` was certainly bigger in his writings than he was in intimacy . ''

		In short , this first book , though not of equal value throughout , is praiseworthy for its frankness and for its first-hand evi - dence as to personalities well worth the know - ing .

		Unfortunately it is mixed in inextrica - ble fashion with the other book , which sets forth theories and speculations of Mr.
Har	PERSON	- ris 's own .

		These are usually tiresome , and sometimes irritating in both matter and man - ner .

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	takes himself very seriously as an interpreter of literary values and of modern society and thought .

		He recurs fre - quently to his flighty assumptions about the life and personality of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		He in - dulges in amusing literary comparisons : ``
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	could never have been a great critic , but he might surely have reached .

		somewhat the same level as Swinburne '' had it not been for his `` debasing Puritanism . ''

		He makes bold statements , settles offhand the most baffling questions : the late Sir
Richard Burton	PERSON	was greater both in speech and action than
Raleigh	LOCATION	,
Paul Verlaine	PERSON	`` is the great - est Christian singer since Dante , ''
Carlyle	PERSON	-LRB- though he `` rusted unused , '' to be sure -RRB- was the greatest statesman of the past two centu - ries in
England	LOCATION	, French unreserve of speech on matters sexual is in every way superior to the prudish reticence of Anglo-Saxon peoples , the middle class government of
England	LOCATION	is a thing almost utterly bad , and religion and immortality are done for .

		And what shall we say of the nonsensical grandiloquence of such a passage as this : ''
Swinburne	PERSON	was the poet of youth , and his heritage is as wide as the world , and his lovers -LSB- are -RSB- as numerous as the sands of the sea , for all youths will love him and quote him with hot hearts and passionate tears as long as English is spoken '' ?

		Or , in reading how we are responsible for the un - happy ends of
Whistler	LOCATION	,
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	,
John Davidson	PERSON	, and
Richard Middleton	PERSON	, what shall we make of the sentence : '' I do not hope to persuade Englishmen or Americans of this truth -LSB- the limitless value of such men -RSB- for many a year to come , though I have the high - est warrant for it and am absolutely convinced of the fact '' ?

		To put the matter in a nut - shell , the second book constitutes an eighteenth portrait , that of Mr.
Harris	PERSON	himself , and it is the least interesting and profitable of any in the volume .

		Mr.
James Barnes	PERSON	, a newspaper TWO travellers , correspondent who handles a in
Central Africa	LOCATION	.

		_ - .

		: .

		.

		, - .

		_ .

		, ready pen , and Mr.
Cherry Kearton	PERSON	, famous as an animal photographer and familiar with parts of
Africa	LOCATION	, have col - laborated to produce a most readable and attractive volume in '' Through Central Africa '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The purpose of their expedition , which left
London	LOCATION	in
April , 1913	DATE	, was to secure a film library of moving pictures of animals in their natural surroundings , to be presented to natural history museums for free exhibition .

		The travellers planned to secure a series of pictures which should repre - sent the fauna of
Africa	LOCATION	from coast to coast , from
Mombasa	LOCATION	on the Indian Ocean to the mouth of the
Congo River	LOCATION	.

		Fortunately , they made a detour from this simple traverse of the continent , and spent weeks in the grass-lands back of
Nairobi	LOCATION	and up toward the Abyssinian border .

		This was familiar ground to Mr.
Kearton	PERSON	, and many beautiful and interesting pictures were there secured .

		Later on they took up the traverse , and crossing the great lake , struck through the forest , travelling on foot and by canoe to
Basoko	LOCATION	, where they took steamer down the
Congo	LOCATION	.

		The travellers were surprised and grievously disappointed to find that the forest was not suited to moving - picture work ; and they lost their time , labor , and money so far as their main purpose was concerned , in this , the piece de resistance of their expedition .

		For the pleasure of the picture-loving reader , it is lucky that so much was done in the preliminary journey , because almost no animal pictures were secured in the forest .

		The real interest of the book , however , is found in its account of the continental traverse ; though thousands have passed over these trails during the last thirty years , few good descriptions of the experience have been written .

		The forest itself , though gloomy and depressing , has its charm ; though animal pic -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 159 tures can not be caught in its dim recesses , its human inhabitants can be posed in the sun - light of its little clearings and their pictures taken ; history has been made even here , and everywhere one is oppressed with memories of
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	and `` the rear guard '' and
Emin Pasha	PERSON	's relief .

		Here in the forest of the
Ituri-Aruwimi River	LOCATION	live the purest type of pygmies and little-known tribes of cannibals .

		Mr.
Barnes	PERSON	came into contact with all of these peoples , and gives us some fine pictures of the little folk .

		From his book we do not get much description of life or customs , nor of geogra - phy or country , we get nothing , perhaps , in the way of new scientific facts .

		It is a narra - tive pure and simple , interestingly told , of a journey unusual , if not unique , in character and purpose .

		The writer tells us that they `` are very glad they went , but there are cer - tain portions of the journey that they would not care to do again . ''

		These `` certain por - tions , '' by the way , seem really to be the most important part of their enterprise .

		Books for f tne numerous series the wayfarer 's launched in recent years have justified themselves so immedi - ately and decidedly as does '' The Wayfarer 's Library '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		Bearing the imprint of the English and American publishing houses which have produced '' Everyman 's Library '' in collaboration , we take it that the new series is designed as a sort of adjunct to that benefi - cent enterprise , giving sanctuary , as it were , to those numerous books in recent English literature which , while standing well above the ephemeral mass of publications , have not yet attained the rank of classics .

		But that this idea has not been held to as closely as might be desired is evident from a survey of the two score volumes with which the series is inaugurated .

		On the one hand we have such commonplace stock in trade for the reprinter as
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's essays and
Dickens	PERSON	's Christmas sto - ries ; on the other we find the sort of current iiction indicated by the names of such writers as
Guy Boothby	LOCATION	, L. Cope Cornford , and Mrs.
Belloc Lowndes	PERSON	.

		But between these extremes are many titles which deserve and will evoke the heartiest welcome .

		First place , in our judgment , belongs to
George Gissing	PERSON	's `` Pri - vate Papers of
Henry Ryecroft	PERSON	, '' a book as surely destined to become a classic in its kind as any other English prose work of the
past quarter century	DATE	.

		Scarcely less welcome is the posthumous collection of
Gissing	PERSON	's stories entitled `` The House of Cobwebs , '' a reprint which would be well worth while if only for the biographical sketch of the author which it contains .

		Three of Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	's early adventures in fiction `` An Unsocial Socialist , '' `` Love among the Artists , '' and ''
Cashel Byron	PERSON	's Profession , '' are given a new lease of life .

		We are especially glad , also , to have in such convenient form those two gems of inimitable humor , Mr.
Barry Pain	PERSON	's `` De Omnibus '' and Mr.
F. Anstey	PERSON	's `` Baboo Jabberjee , B. A. '' The essay form is worthily represented by such books as Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	's '' Eighteenth Century Studies , '' Mr.
G. W. E. Russell	PERSON	's '' Selected Essays on Literary Sub - jects , '' Mr.
G. S. Street	PERSON	's `` The Ghosts of Piccadilly , '' and Mr.

A. G. Gardiner	PERSON	's vivid pen portraits of present-day English celebrities , `` Prophets , Priests , and Kings '' ; and Mr.
James Milnes	PERSON	's '' Epistles of
Atkins	PERSON	. ''

		While we have been able to give in the foregoing at least an indication of the range and interest of the literary field covered by '' The Wayfarer 's Library , '' we must leave our readers to discover for themselves the physical attractiveness of the volumes .

		That such excellence of bookmaking is compatible with the modest price at which the volumes are sold is little less than remarkable .

		^ in '' The Record of
Nicholas Freydon	PERSON	: An Auto - biography '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- , by an anonymous au - thor of evident talent , if not even of genius .

		The problem of his identity , too , challenges the acuteness of the reader , and there is room for a good deal of shrewd guessing without hitting the mark unless the casually im - parted information that the writer was ten years and one day old on the second of
May , 1870	DATE	, be strictly true and so a check to any - thing like random conjecture as to the author - ship .

		The story , or history , is of a literary life of painfully earned success , chiefly jour - nalistic , the scene being alternately in
London	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	again , and finally Aus - tralia .

		Orphanage and poverty and a proud and rather defiant disposition constitute the chief part of the hero 's somewhat conven - tional equipment ; but the vicissitudes of his arduous climb to a fair measure of success in his calling are not altogether of the usual sort quite the contrary in some instances .

		The spiritual struggles and agonies , moreover , are of absorbing interest , and serve to give dis - tinction to the book .

		In its general scheme the work is not unlike
George Gissing	PERSON	's '' The Private Papers of
Henry Ryecroft	PERSON	. ''

		As in that remarkable bit of autobiographic remi - 160 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 2	DATE	niscence and reflection , so here we have an ostensible '' editor , '' who prepares for the press , with editorial comment , the posthumous papers of his friend of pathetic memory ; and in both instances the oneness of editor and author is manifest .

		In the later book , far more than in the earlier , verisimilitude is marred by the dramatic intensity of the lights and shades , the startling nature of the acci - dents and coincidences , the completeness and rhetorical finish of the recorded conversations , even those recalled from childhood , and the prevailing atmosphere of romance .

		Without doubt the narrative is a skilful mingling of fact and fiction , a groundwork of actual expe - rience with trimmings of a lesser degree of actuality , all presented with much literary art and calculated to charm the reader who once opens the volume .

		One at least of the writer 's assertions about himself is evidently true : he mentions the scantiness of his schooling and his ignorance of grammar , and this confes - sion prepares one for such lapses as `` this minutiae , '' `` that strata , '' a glaring misuse of `` complaisant '' and `` complaisance '' for `` com - placent '' and `` complacence , '' and the misquo - tation , `` Je suis , je reste '' a misquotation that the '' editor '' reproduces , curiously enough , in his concluding note .

		Taken all in all , '' The Record of
Nicholas Freydon	PERSON	'' is a notable contribution to pseudo-autobiography .

		rt , , r r There are two reasons why an J. ne lierman - , .

		.

		- r-i i i an m-i - m - soldier 's edition in English of The War Book of the German General Staff '' -LRB-
McBride , Nast & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is welcome .

		In the first place , it gives us documentary evi - dence of the most authoritative sort concern - ing the methods that
Germany	LOCATION	intends to employ in any war with which she may be faced .

		In the second place , it yields indirect testimony to support those accusations of ter - rorism and atrocity which many judicious people , in spite of the Bryce report , are still loath to believe .

		The translation is by Dr.
J. H. Morgan	PERSON	, Professor of Constitutional Law in the
University	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	, whose intro - duction is a sort of moralizing commentary on the text that follows .

		The translation is vouched for as literal and integral ; even the foot-notes are rendered ; where the editor has added a. note of his own it is bracketted and initialed .

		What strikes one most in reading the book is the contrast between the moderate and humane general principles of military conduct and the truculent exceptions when need compels .

		In this way the excellent theory of '' civilized '' warfare is rendered nugatory in use .

		International law and Hague conven - tions are academically desirable , but in prac - tice they must yield before military necessity .

		Here is an example in nuce of this logic of militarism : '' No inhabitant of the occupied territory is to be disturbed in the use and free disposition of his property ; on the other hand the necessity of war justifies the most far - reaching disturbance , restriction , and even imperiling of his property . ''

		Perhaps the most offensive pronouncement of all is the assertion that '' indeed international law is in no way opposed to the exploitation of the crimes of third parties -LRB- assassination , incen - diarism , robbery , and the like -RRB- to the preju - dice of the enemy . ''

		When one reflects further that necessity often means simply expe - diency , the German doctrine Not kennt kein Gebot becomes , in the language of the street , '' anything to win . ''

		And that is the final les - son of the War Book of the German General Staff .

		Aspects of contemporary journalism . ''

		The Coming Newspaper '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , a collection of addresses and papers on journalism by experienced newspaper men , is edited by Pro- fessor
Merle Thorpe	PERSON	, of the department of journalism in the
University of Kansas	ORGANIZATION	.

		He names the volume , not in an accurately de - scriptive manner , from his own initial con - tribution to its contents .

		Other contributors are Dr.
Washington Gladden	PERSON	, Mr.
Oswald Garrison Villard	PERSON	, Mr.
Melville E. Stone	PERSON	, Mr.
Norman Hapgood	PERSON	, Dr.
Lyman Abbott	PERSON	, Mr.
Hamilton Holt	PERSON	, and a dozen more of like standing ; and they discourse on such themes as '' Tainted Journalism , '' '' Some Weaknesses of Modern Journalism , '' '' The Clubber in Journalism , '' `` A Modern Type of Country Journalism , '' `` A State License for Newspaper Men , '' `` The English Substitute for the License Plan , '' `` A Code of Ethics for News - paper Men , '' '' Government Regulation for Press Associations , '' ''
Community Service	ORGANIZATION	, '' and '' Giving the Public What It Wants . ''

		As may be recognized by some readers , a number of these chapters were first made public by their respective authors in the course of those memorable exercises that distinguished Kan - sas Newspaper Week -LRB-
May 1014	DATE	-RRB- from the rest of the weeks of the year
1914	DATE	; and the topics treated were selected from a list ob - tained by the issue of a questionnaire to '' one thousand men and women in public and pri - vate life . ''

		Thus a creditable measure of suc - cess has been attained in giving to the various disquisitions a more than academic interest .

		Actual experience and ripe reflection speak in almost every paragraph .

		On the first page of his opening chapter -LRB- `` The Coming News - paper '' -RRB- Professor
Thorpe	PERSON	scores `` the man
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 161 who continually harks back to the grand old days of Greeley '' and '' fails utterly to appre - ciate how impossible it would be for the news - less , violently partisan journal of the fifties to find a footing in our present-day life , uncon - fronted , as it is , by any great moral crisis . ''

		It is true we have no slavery question to vex us now , but other issues involving moral con - siderations of the first importance are not lacking .

		Improvement in our journalism dur - ing the last ten years is detected by the same writer , and on the whole the tone of the entire book is hopeful , constructively critical rather than sourly censorious .

		But of course this was to be expected , as well as desired , from a company of men engaged in journalism of the better sort .

		A Florentine sculptor of the
15th century	DATE	.


Allan Marquand	PERSON	's imposing work on `` Luca della ^ ^ -LRB- p rinceton U niv e rs i t y Press -RRB- , is a most valuable contribution to art history .

		It furnishes a descriptive catalogue of all the works of one of the great artists of the fifteenth century , one who , it has been declared , gave impulse to the Renaissance ; one who was the founder of a '' school '' of sculpture , chiefly among the members of his own family .

		Luca was born in
1399	DATE	or 1400 , and died in
1481	DATE	.

		His work in sculpture dates from
1430	DATE	.

		Sixteen years later , being unable to execute by himself the numerous commis - sions he was receiving from every part of
Italy	LOCATION	, he formed a partnership with his nephew ,
Andrea	PERSON	, and his great-nephew , Gio - vanni ; and also employed as helpers the two Duccio brothers ,
Ottaviano	PERSON	and
Agostino	PERSON	, who are often erroneously regarded as members of the
Robbia	PERSON	family .

		The four were collabo - rators with
Luca	PERSON	in most of his later work .

		To
Luca	PERSON	is accorded the distinction , not of inventing the process of enamel-glazing terra cotta , the '' secret '' of which he is said to have confided to
Andrea	PERSON	, his nephew , but of suc - cessfully applying to sculpture what Palissy a century later applied to pottery .

		It was
Luca	PERSON	's purpose to democratize sculpture so that even village churches might possess works of art which before were reserved - for the pos - session of the great cathedrals and the wealthy metropolitan churches .

		Out of these circum - stances have arisen the problems which the present volume attempts to solve .

		How much of all the exquisite glazed terra cotta in the della Robbia style now extant or known for - merly to have existed was really the work of Luca ?

		How much was the work of
Andrea	LOCATION	, which was often compared and contrasted with that of his uncle ?

		How much was the work of other members of the family or of more or less successful imitators ?

		A solution of these problems has engaged the attention of Professor
Marquand	PERSON	for the past twenty years or more ; and his final collation of all the documentary evidence bearing on the ques - tion , his chronological classification of all the work of
Luca della Robbia	PERSON	, and his examina - tion of the works which have sometimes been attributed to him , may be accepted as the final word on a fascinating subject .

		The pictorial presentation of the volume is sure to be a delight to art lovers .

		From the scanty details of his life that are preserved to us ,
Luca della Robbia	LOCATION	appears to have been a man of irre - proachable character , whose work was done from the most unselfish of motives , and who left thereon the impress of a pure , humble , and affectionate nature .

		The promise that the present volume will be followed before long by others on
Andrea della Robbia	LOCATION	and
Giovanni della Robbia	ORGANIZATION	, and on the
Robbia School	ORGANIZATION	, will be a source of satisfaction in many quarters .

		Laid on the shelf for a year by m e ie a s nean his own .

		ch o ic e , from a prema - ture feeling of superannuation , the author of `` From the Shelf '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , who calls himself `` Paxton Holgar '' on his title-page and `` John '' in the body of his book , narrates his recuperative experiences in a deserted monastery on what we assume to be one of the
Balearic Islands	LOCATION	.

		At any rate , it is a Spanish island , delightfully somnolent and unmodernized , in the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	; and the author 's graphic touches of local color and local character , with morsels of romance and adventure , and an atmosphere of almost convincing reality not prosaic realism over all , make one envy him the twelve months ' rest and communion with nature and his own soul that ended in the happy manner he so well describes in his closing chapters .

		But the reader 's natural desire to believe it all a true story can not blind him , even with the best of will to meet the author half-way , to occasional inconsistencies and artificialities .

		On one page , for instance , the narrator calls himself '' naturally unobservant , '' although in a later passage he gives evidence of acute observation and refers to his `` usually keen , eyes . ''

		Nevertheless , the book is a little mas - terpiece in its way , in its combination of topo - graphic detail that escapes weariness and character-sketching that makes its subjects live and breathe before one 's eyes .

		`` Whatever and wherever may be the geographic equiva - lents of the author 's
San Telmo	LOCATION	and
Torelya	LOCATION	, he knows them well and pictures them charm - ingly .

Winter	DATE	season . -RRB-

		LIST OF NEW BOOKS 243 BOOKS OF THE COMING SEASON .

		In the preface to his latest but we hope not his last book Mr.
Ford Madox Hueffer	PERSON	takes occasion to defend his reminiscent and anec - dotal style by saying : `` But readability , as far as I have observed its effects upon myself , has seemed always to resolve itself into relat - ing anecdotes and drawing morals from those anecdotes . ''

		The prominence given to biog - raphy and reminiscences in the book-lists ap - pended to this as to previous `` announcement '' numbers of THE DIAL finds ample justification in the natural and praiseworthy interest so generally felt by readers in this important branch of literature .

		And though the forth - coming books of this sort are somewhat fewer in number this
autumn	DATE	than a year ago , they include rather more works of unusual attrac - tiveness .

		For instance , what lover of inti - mate biography can read with unquickened pulse the announcement of the '' Life , Letters , and Journals of
John Muir	PERSON	, '' or of Maxim Gorky 's '' My Childhood , '' or of Mr.
Richard Whiteing	PERSON	's `` My Harvest '' ?

		Rather more formal in structure , one expects , but little less appealing , or even more so to certain readers , will be '' The Life and Letters of John Hay '' as edited in two volumes by Mr.
William Ros	PERSON	- coe
Thayer	PERSON	; and the '' Reminiscences '' of Dr.
Lyman Abbott	PERSON	, already known to '' Outlook '' readers ; and , again , Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's `` Memo - ries of a Publisher , '' being the third instal - ment of his notable autobiography . ''

		The Life of
Clara Barton	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Percy H. Epler	PERSON	, will not fail of a cordial reception at this time ; nor will the biography of
Bishop Potter	ORGANIZATION	, by Dr.
Hodges	PERSON	, fall still-born from the press ; and those who of late have read with eager curiosity `` What I Found Out '' and `` Memories of the
Kaiser	PERSON	's Court '' will turn with anticipa - tory relish to `` My Years at the Austrian Court , '' by Miss
Nellie Ryan	PERSON	, while the col - lected chapters of the
Infanta ` Eulalia	ORGANIZATION	's `` Court Life from Within '' will give hours of entertainment to unnumbered readers .

		Among other promising titles in this general class are ''
Emma Darwin	PERSON	: A Century of Family Let - ters ,
1792	DATE	to
1896	DATE	, '' '' The Life and Times of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, '' by the late Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	, 200 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	'' On the Trail of
Stevenson	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Clayton Hamilton	PERSON	, '' The Story of
Yone Noguchi	PERSON	, '' told by himself and illustrated by Mr.
Yoshio Markino	PERSON	, '' The Story of a Pioneer , '' by Dr.
Anna Howard Shaw	PERSON	, `` Vagrant Memories , '' by Mr.
Winter	PERSON	, and , in short , to any reader of broad sympathies , too many others to be in - cluded in so restricted a notice as this .

		Allied to biography , though lacking the pre - dominant personal interest , stands history ; and here the eye is arrested by such richly promising works as Mr.
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	's `` High Lights of the French Revolution , '' Mr.
Nor	PERSON	- wood
Young	PERSON	's `` Napoleon in Exile at
St. Helena	LOCATION	, '' Dr.
Knut Gjerset	PERSON	's '' History of the Norwegian People , '' Mr.
Edward Button	PERSON	's `` Attila and His Huns , '' and the results of Mr.
George Bird Grinnell	PERSON	's researches concerning `` The Fighting Cheyennes : A History of a Great and Typical Indian Tribe . ''

		Also note - worthy is the announcement of an English version of
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's famous historical frag - ment -LRB- voluminous enough to be a complete work -RRB- , '' The History of
Germany	LOCATION	in the
19th Century	DATE	, '' and of a less celebrated writer 's account of `` The Fall of Tsingtau . ''

		Dr. Mor - ris
Jastrow	PERSON	's ' ^ Civilization of
Babylonia	LOCATION	and
Assyria	LOCATION	'' offers the certainty of solid satisfac - tion to scholarly readers .

		Among books of a less strictly historical nature , and offering promise of autobiographic touches , is a collec - tion of '' The Letters of
Washington Irving	LOCATION	to
Henry Brevoort	PERSON	,
1807	DATE	to
1843	DATE	, '' edited by Mr.
George S. Hellman	PERSON	.

		Another enticing volume of like character presents itself in `` Some of the Correspondence of Sir
Arthur Helps	PERSON	, '' and we are told that autobiographic revela - tion abounds in Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	's '' Escape , and Other Essays . ''

		But this brings us to the gateway of another large domain in the realm of letters , conveniently and comprehensively styled , '' General Literature . ''

		Here one notes '' New Essays , '' by
M. Mau	PERSON	- rice
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, '' Incense and Iconoclasm , '' by Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	-LRB- no new name in these pages -RRB- , `` Visions and Beliefs , '' by Lady
Gregory	PERSON	, '' Ideals and Realities in Rus - sian Literature , '' by Prince
Kropotkin	PERSON	, '' Six French Poets , '' by Miss
Amy Lowell	PERSON	, `` The Modern Study of Literature , '' by Professor
Moulton	PERSON	, `` A Quiet Corner in a Library , '' by Mr.
William Henry Hudson	PERSON	, and -LRB- dare one hope it contains something new to print ? -RRB-

		`` Interpretations of English Literature , '' by
Laf	ORGANIZATION	cadio
Hearn	PERSON	. ''

		The
Cambridge	LOCATION	History of English Literature '' reaches its twelfth vol - ume in '' The Romantic Revival , '' the recent achievements in letters of a brave little people are related in Mr.
Jethro Bithell	PERSON	's '' Contem - porary Belgian Literature , '' Dr.
John Ers	PERSON	- kine 's treatise on '' The Moral Obligation to be Intelligent '' ought to be worth reading , Mr.
James Huneker	PERSON	's `` Ivory Apes and Pea - cocks '' arouses curiosity , and Mr.
Forrest S. Lunt	PERSON	will have proved himself a master of pithy brevity if his `` Shakespeare Explained '' -LRB- for only sixty cents -RRB- fulfils the promise of its title .

		In poetry , new and old , there is not exactly an embarrassment of riches .

		A collection of the verses of the
Bronte	PERSON	sisters and their scapegrace brother is put forth with an in - troduction by Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	.


George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	's `` Welsh Ballads and Poems '' is pub - Ushed * - in a limited - edition with preface by Mr.
Ernest Rhys	PERSON	.

		In the `` New Poetry Series '' one notes especially a fresh volume by Mrs.
Marks	PERSON	-LRB-
Josephine Preston Peabody	PERSON	-RRB- , entitled simply , `` New Poems . ''

		Mr.
Chester	PERSON	- ton has a book of '' Poems , '' Lord
Curzon	PERSON	a number of '' War Poems , and Other Transla - tions , '' and a book of `` Belgian Patriotic Poems , '' by
M. Emile Cammaerts	PERSON	, makes its timely appearance in translation .

		Mr.
Mo	PERSON	- sher 's ''
Lyra	ORGANIZATION	Americana '' includes as its first volumes : '' The Rose-Jar , '' by Mr.
Thomas S. Jones , Jr.	PERSON	, `` A Handful of Lavender , '' by Miss
Lizette Woodworth Reese	PERSON	, and '' The Rose from the .

		Ashes / ' by Miss
Edith M. Thomas	PERSON	.

		Printed plays are far more abundant now than formerly , and there are some good things of this sort for the armchair theatre-goer ; for example : '' The Faithful , '' by Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	, '' The Immigrants , '' by Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	, Mr. Ar - thur
Symons	PERSON	's '' Tragedies , '' and Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	's war epic in dramatic form , `` Arma - geddon . ''

		Translations from
M. Brieux	PERSON	and
M. Claudel	PERSON	, with other by no means negligible pieces , enrich the list .

		Moreover , Professor
George P. Baker	PERSON	writes expertly on `` The Technique of the Drama , '' and Mr.
Thomas H. Dickinson	PERSON	on '' The Case of American Drama , '' while Mr.
Vachel Lindsay	PERSON	's book on '' The Art of the Moving Picture '' should prove instructive and timely . ''

		The History of the Harlequinade , '' by Mr.
Maurice Sand	PERSON	, in two volumes with colored illustrations , can hardly fail to be diverting , at least ; and there
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 201 is no lack of other books about things theatri - cal , including guides to the attainment of fame and fortune by the writing of plays .


John Muir	PERSON	's '' Travels in
Alaska	LOCATION	'' will be a favorite among the books of travel and de - scription , and '' Kipling 's
India	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Arley Munson	PERSON	, will attract by its very title . ''

		The Lure of
San Francisco	LOCATION	'' will find many readers among
Panama	LOCATION	Exposition visitors and would-be visitors .

		Mrs.
Hugh Fraser	PERSON	's '' Storied
Italy	LOCATION	'' offers evident attractions , as does Mr.
Norman Douglas	PERSON	's `` Old
Calabria	LOCATION	. ''

		Works of hardly less interest , though of an entirely different sort , meet the eye in glanc - ing down the list of books on public affairs ; they include such products of observation and reflection and personal experience as Mr.
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	's `` Aristocracy and Jus - tice , '' Mr.
Taft	PERSON	's `` Ethics in
Service	ORGANIZATION	, '' and Mr.
John Spargo	PERSON	's `` Marxian Socialism and Religion . ''

		In the departments of religion and theology , of art and architecture and music , of science , pure and applied , there is more offered to-day than was dreamed of in generations by our ancestors .

		Among other serious works , notable is the new group having to do with '' The Great War , '' also the quite dissimilar section devoted to `` Woman and the Home . ''

		.

		If the year 's book-product should be found to fall , for obvious reasons , a little short of the recent average , its variety is likely to exceed that average .

		Finally , and in the place of honor on this programme of the coming literary entertain - ment , a word about the new novels .

		Selec - tion is too much a matter of personal bias to be indulged in without caution by a hasty reviewer of titles ; but confidence willnot be misplaced if reposed in such virtual certain - ties of worth as Judge
Grant	PERSON	's '' The High Priestess , '' Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's `` The Freelands , '' Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	's `` The Money Master , '' and Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's ''
Eltham House	ORGANIZATION	. '' ''

		The Research Magnificent , '' by Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, `` The Fortunes of
Garin	PERSON	, '' by
Miss Johnston	PERSON	, '' The ' Genius , ' '' by Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	, '' The Little Iliad , '' by Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	, and `` A Young Man 's Year , '' by Mr.
Anthony Hope Hawkins	PERSON	, are also safe ventures ; nor does this exhaust the list .

		An `` Ivanhoe `` maynot lurk between the covers of every proffered romance , nor a '' Tom Jones '' in every work of realistic fiction ; but the fashioning of pleasing imaginative narrative is not yet to be numbered among the lost arts .

		JOHN
GALSWORTHY	PERSON	.

		When he just sits -LRB- to parody his own words -RRB- seeing Life and getting the full of it , those are the moments that I think are precious to
John Galsworthy	PERSON	.

		There have been things said about him which implied that he offered no distilled moral -LRB- how clear and beautiful such distillations sometimes are ! -RRB-

		, no message , no regular conclusions concerning life ; and such things are doubt - less true .

		To Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	life is an ad - venture ; he goes about or rather he used to go about `` wondering with a sort of warm half-fearful eagerness what sort of new thread Life was going to twine into his skein . ''

		There might be message , moral , conclusions in his work , but he did not himself deliver the message , draw the conclusions , enforce the moral ; he left it to the public to do whatever of that sort of thing they might wish and be able to do .

		Yet at first his own feelings and thoughts were not much hidden .

		In earlier years he seemed very `` modern , '' for he seemed always to press upon the reader the thought that is significant of our time -LRB- as perhaps of every time -RRB- : the ` difference between the new ideas and the old , between the radical and the con - servative , the lover of liberty and the believer in authority , the free-thinker and the tradi - tionalist , the bohemian and the citizen , the adventurer and the home-lover , between those , in fine , who believe in holding to the good and beautiful things that have come to us from the past and those who want always to stretch out to the new .

		How clear that was in the earlier books !

		The absolute content with received conven - tions and ideas portrayed in '' The Island Pharisees , '' the stupefied self-satisfaction of the upper middle class in '' The Man of Prop - erty , '' the entire enclosure in their own coun - try life of the landed gentry in '' The
Country House	ORGANIZATION	, '' the high-minded consciousness of the aristocracy that they Were the life of the nation in '' The Patrician , '' it covered all the upper ranges of the social world , show - ing it everywhere self-absorbed and self-com - placent ; its eyes blinded with fat , its head stuck in the sand -LRB- to mix figures ridicu - lously -RRB- , its power of action atrophied through the specialization of its powers of self-appre - ciation .

		We read such things painfully .

		It must be so , we think , in
England	LOCATION	; and if it is so there -LRB- as this keen eye sees and records it -RRB- , most probably it is so here .

		Just this much , however , does not make Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	a man specifically of our own time , for to notice and record just these things has been 202 -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	the function of the satirist of all times .

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	did something more .

		He pre - sented not only the immense inertia of the current life of our day , but he presented those who had the newer spirit .

		He showed both sides .

		Into this world of conservatives , home-lovers , patricians , are somehow born radicals , adventurers , wanderers of the spirit , bohemians .

		They strive against their sur - roundings , perhaps , and either are broken and subdued or somehow make their escape .

		At any rate they show us the rift .

		But if Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	differs from the many iconoclasts of the day and of course he does it is chiefly that however much he may see of what is wrong in the present state of things he also feels keenly how much it has that is beautiful .

		And because he does feel so strongly that there is so much that is beauti - ful in this world which is yet not right , his thinking had a peculiar character : it was deeply marked with irony .

		He was not like Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, who would cheerfully undertake the contract of remaking the universe nearer to the heart 's desire .

		He would not , perhaps , even shatter it to bits .

		What would be the good ?

		Hence his radicals , wanderers , bohe - mians were never effective people .

		Ferrand ,
Courtenay	PERSON	,
Miltoun	LOCATION	,
Bosinney	PERSON	do themselves live , but they accomplish little for anybody else .

		Almost the only person whose acts and utterances we instinctively feel are right , though generally unintelligible , is felt by all around him to be crazy .

		Such was the earlier
Galsworthy	PERSON	.

		Nor shall we think that later years will have changed anything so fundamental ; only he need not say over again what he has said before .

		There may also be development ; we may easily imagine that a man who first saw certain antagonisms in the social life of his time , will easily come to feel that such antag - onisms are fundamental in life itself .

		It is a necessity that there should be some such antagonism .

		And hence it is that the later books deal more broadly with the matter , and also more narrowly .

		His later books and his plays have not so much to say of the radical individual and the conservatism of classes .

		They do not even deal with the conservatism of society in gen - eral .

		They show , for example , how people in love come up against the institution of mar - riage .

		But perhaps it is not even this that they show ; they may show merely some deep antinomy in life whereby people in love come up against , not the institution of marriage only , but the limits and possibilities of human nature and human thought as well .

		In '' The Dark Flower , '' for instance , what can we think of the passionate love between the girl of eighteen and the man of fifty ?

		One might easily think that the man had loved several times before , and that the girl would prob - ably love several times afterward .

		And if such be the case , it will hardly be worth while to give up much for the present passion , or even , one might think , to feel it very deeply .

		It can not be helped : life is often like that ; we must , of course , be interested , even absorbed , but we need not be outraged .

		So much -LRB- yet how very little ! -RRB-

		may be said of the novelist ; nor in general , we may believe , would there be a very different im - pression from the works of the dramatist , save that , as he comes later , we shall not find our ironic spectator of the divisions and mal - adjustments of society engaged in viewing exactly the same things .

		Then the drama is more impersonal , more condensed ; we have less or even no comment , or of that descrip - tion that goes for comment .

		Still the impres - sion is not very different : complacency and incongruity and rebellion in many different forms , but never an adjustment .

		And how about the poet and the essayist ?

		Here , perhaps , will he be a bit more personal and tell us what he really thinks ?

		Shall we not find in the poetry and essay something which will resolve the problems of the fiction and the drama ?

		I hardly think so .

		We shall certainly find the personal position definitely put , indeed so obviously that it is no longer any fun looking for it in the novels and the plays .

		It is like an arithmetic with a key , a text with a trot , a book of conundrums with all the answers .

		It is proper to advise the reader to be careful about beginning on the essays and the poems : one should read the novels and plays first to really get the fun out of them .

		Unless , of course , one really wants to know what is actually the case with life .

		It may be that one really wants to know the answer to this question of the day , this problem of mod - ern life , the difficulties of our social adjust - ment .

		It is often not so : one reads and reads with pleasure at seeing difficulties that one realizes in life , but without any real intention of striving after a solution of them .

		Solutions , answers , reconstructions , are diffi - cult things in practice .

		Nor , indeed , has Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	, as we have seen , any intention of looking for solu - tions or suggesting reconstructions .

		More and more , as he has gone on and on , has he been content to see life and get the full of it .

		He writes about current life indeed , but he offers no '' distilled moral , '' no '' true conclusions of premises regularly laid down . ''

		He holds up
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 203 his lantern in the night of convention , or igno - rance , or indifference , or whatever else pre - vents us from seeing life as it is ; and if we see thereby disagreeable things , that is not his fault , for it is not with us that he is concerned .

		Or at least so he says . ''

		To set before the public the phenomena of life and character , selected and combined , but not distorted , '' that is one course for the dramatist to pur - sue ; and it is so nearly like what he does himself that we may believe he speaks of it with approval .

		This method , he goes on , '' requires a certain detachment ; it requires a sympathy with , a love of , and a curiosity as to , things for their own sake , '' and such de - tachment , sympathy , love , curiosity , it is pretty clear that Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	has .

		It is not so clear , however , that he views human life and human suffering dispassion - ately , without prepossession , with equanim - ity , `` simply as manifestations of life . ''

		One should select and combine but not distort , doubtless ; yet some selection and combina - tion is virtual distortion .

		Take Mr.
Gals	PERSON	- worthy 's presentations of love and marriage : according to what principle of selection and combination is it that , in his work , love is usually outside of marriage and marriage without love ?

		There may not be any dis - tilled moral there , or a true conclusion ; but if it be not a distortion of the facts of life , it is clearly such an arrangement of them as is formed by a preconceived ideal .

		That is natural enough , nothing more so ; only the man who views life in that way ceases to be a mere observer , and becomes something of a special pleader .

		Or take the question of the old order and the new : how is it that most of the characters with whom we sympathize , those who seem mostly to the author 's mind , are the adventurers , the lovers of freedom , the unrestrainable , while the representatives of the older order are commonly rigid , nar - row , stupid , and generally rather ridiculous ?

		Certainly we shall hardly imagine it any other way ; but do not let us be cajoled by Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's suppositions that he merely loves and observes life .

		He does observe it and love it , but he has very strong feelings about it ; and if he does not urge opinions about it , it must be because his mind is such as not to form any , or such that be believes them of no use .

		For a philosophy he seems to have , namely -LRB- if one can put such a thing into a sentence -RRB- , that it is by an immense amount of pushing and striving , in all direc - tions and at all kinds of cross-purposes and by all sorts of people mixed up together , that the purpose of God is carried out , God , in fact , being himself the striving and the push - ing , the directions and the cross-purposes , and also the people .

		With such a philosophy it would be very natural to offer no solutions to any problem , because one solution is quite as good as another in the long run .

		And after all , life is a spendid thing .

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	seems to have mellowed a bit with the passing years .

		He was never acrid or bitter , but in the older days he was generally ironic .

		Now he is broader in his sympathy or in his love .

		He has no villains ; he has many who seem inordinately stupid , tedious , dull , narrow , selfish , but they generally have something nice about them for all that .

		They do all kinds of things ; they are hot-tempered , weak , silly , hasty , irrational , brave , loving , but never simply malignant or malevolent .

		It is a long time since we have had one who came so near the great satirist of an earlier day who gave us his view of partial evil and universal good .

		We may gather that in this case , as in that , we have more of a literary than a philosophic view ; but that is a very good thing , for it is literature with which we are dealing .

		It is certainly no philosophic view that Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	means to offer us ; he will be satisfied if he can make us see with him '' The glory , jest , and riddle of the world . ''

		CA8UAL_COMMENT .

		A SURPRISING ABUNDANCE OF `` BEST NOVELS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE '' is revealed by answers of noted living novelists to a question sent out by the
New York	LOCATION	'' Times , '' which has invited these novelists to name the six best novels in our tongue .

		The indecisive results of any such investigation might have been foreseen , and probably were foreseen ; but as a midsummer amusement the under - taking was commendable enough , especially when any wholesome distraction from the dominant horror of the hour is welcome .

		In the expressed preferences of a goodly com - pany of English and American writers of fic - tion , the only approach to unanimity is found in a considerable appreciation of the merits of `` Tom
Jones	PERSON	, '' and in a general , denial of surpassing excellence to American novels , except '' The Scarlet Letter . ''

		One writer shows admiration for Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	-LRB- no longer an American , it is true -RRB- , but laments that after ''
Daisy Miller	PERSON	'' he '' declined into logomachy '' and so incapacitated himself for producing a great novel . ''

		The Rise of
Silas Lapham	PERSON	'' gets an occasional American vote ; 204 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	but it is plain that , except
Hawthorne	PERSON	, we have no novelist comparable , in the estima - tion of living novelists , with
Scott	PERSON	and
Dick	PERSON	- ens and
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		Mr.
E. Phillips Oppen	PERSON	- heim wanders strangely from the question by including in his list
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's ``
Anna Karenina	PERSON	, '' and Canon
Hannay	PERSON	-LRB- `` George
Birmingham	LOCATION	'' -RRB- impairs confidence in his judgment by placing '' The Moonstone '' in the same company with ``
Rob Roy	PERSON	'' and '' Vanity Fair . ''

		He also casts a vote for the innocuous and entertaining '' Barchester Towers , '' while next above it stands '' The Wreckers . ''

		Both the thrill of romance and the moderate titillation of an everyday story seem to be dear to the
Canon of St. Patrick 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		From the lists as a whole it is sufficiently evi - dent that there are in our language many more than six novels acceptable to refined taste and critical judgment .

		ENDOWMENTS THAT AID THE CAUSE OF GOOD LITERATURE by making it more generally accessible can not be too generous or too many .

		One form that they might oftener take than they do is found in those special bequests or gifts to public libraries for the purchase of such works as might otherwise be unprocura - ble .

		The
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, for instance , has trust funds amounting to
$ 154,533	MONEY	, the income from which may be used only for books in special classes of literature to be placed in certain designated departments ; also a fund of
$ 121,750	MONEY	is in its keeping for the purchase of books of `` permanent value '' only .

		Other endowment funds , more than a quarter-million in amount , are unrestricted .


New York	LOCATION	's great free library enjoys similar advantages , on an even larger scale .

		While the city provides the main building and its site , with suitable sites for the
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	branches , and pays running expenses and bills for the books in general circulation , the valuable special collections and the great ref - erence library in the main building are sup - plied from the
Astor	LOCATION	,
Lenox	LOCATION	, and
Tilden	PERSON	foundations and other endowments ; and large additional gifts of this nature are received from time to time .

		Librarian
Brett	PERSON	of the
Cleveland Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, in his current re - port , deplores the lack of any such permanent funds for the prosecution of his work as are enjoyed by
Boston	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, and also by
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
Baltimore	LOCATION	,
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	,
New Haven	LOCATION	, and other favored cities .

		Cleveland furnishes sites for
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	branches , also a main building and the ground on which it stands ; but there the parallel with
New York	LOCATION	ends , since there are no trust funds for those other than popular needs which it is the crowning glory of a public library to be able to meet .

		Wealthy philanthropists might find here a hint as to one method of escaping the disgrace of dying rich .

		A STATESMAN 'S LITERARY RECREATIONS were more wont in former times than now to in - clude rambles in the classics , with perhaps an occasional excursion into authorship on some subject of Greek or Latin literature or archaeology , or a trial of one 's hand at turn - ing into English an ode of
Horace	PERSON	or an idyl of Theocritus .

		Gladstone 's Homeric studies were the refreshment of his spare hours through years of intense Application to the graver concerns of public policy and admin - istration .

		The
Earl of Derby	ORGANIZATION	's verse transla - tion of the '' Iliad , '' published after he had been twice prime minister and when he was soon to hold that high office a third time , marked him as a statesman of distinguished attainments in letters .

		In our own country an instance of able statesmanship united with classical and literary acquirements readily presents itself in the person of
John D. Long	PERSON	, who died on the
28th of August	DATE	.

		His metri - cal version of the '' ^ Eneid '' came out while he was lieutenant-governor of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and just before he entered upon his three years ' governorship of that
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		But he had written and published verse long before that date .

		A booklet , entitled `` At the Fire - side , '' was made up of a selection from these poems .

		He was also author of '' The
New American Navy	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` After-dinner and Other Speeches , '' and a history of the Republican party .

		A few years ago '' The Outlook '' was enlivened by Mr.
Long	PERSON	's reminiscences , in serial form , and he could have produced a voluminous work of that nature , full of inter - est , for he had a remarkable memory and the gift of vivid and telling narrative .

		To his native town ,
Buckfield	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, he gave in
1901	DATE	a free library in memory of his father ,
Zadoc Long	PERSON	, who , like his son after him , was of a literary turn , wrote verses , taught school , and engaged in politics .

		The late ex-Secre - tary of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	was within two months of his seventy-seventh birthday when he died .

		REVIVED INTEREST IN RUSSIAN LITERATURE is noted of late in
England	LOCATION	, where no interna - tional copyright law checks the free intro - duction of Gorky and
Garshin	PERSON	, of
Kuprin	PERSON	and
Korolenko	PERSON	, and of dozens more , to the English reader in the form of unauthorized transla - tions .

		Just as the Crimean War aroused out - side interest in the empire of the Romanoffs and its affairs , with a consequent English version of '' Dead Souls '' and `` Annals of a
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 205 Sportsman '' and other Russian books , so the present war is turning men 's eyes anew upon the country so conspicuous in the struggle and so much less familiar to us than its west - ern neighbors .

		Hence the timeliness of sun - dry translations from the Russian that are now appearing .

		But a deeper reason for Anglo-Saxon welcome of Slavic literature is found by a writer in '' The New Statesman . ''

		Mr.
Julius West	PERSON	detects '' a distinct affinity between English and Russian literature , closer than that between English and French , and perhaps as close as that between English and American . ''

		Certain it is , if booksellers ' reports are to be trusted , that an unusual demand for English novels in the original is now making itself heard in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Other striking illustrations of Russian liking for and understanding of English and also American authors are offered by Mr.
West	PERSON	.

		England 's present relations with
Russia	LOCATION	, it might be added , are so much more cordial than the relations existing at the time of the Crimean War , that a far warmer reception for Russian books may be predicted than that accorded to .

		Gogol and a few of his compatriots sixty years ago .

		In this connection let it be said that now would be an excellent time to arrive at some uniformity of practice in the trans - literating of Russian authors ' names .

		Great
Britain	LOCATION	has at least three `` authorized '' sys - tems : that approved by the
Liverpool School of Russian Studies	ORGANIZATION	, that endorsed by the
Royal Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	, and that used in the British Museum Catalogue .

		Until west - ern
Europe	LOCATION	can limit itself to somewhat fewer than eight different ways of spelling the name of the author of '' Virgin Soil , '' there will con - tinue to be trouble and vexation of spirit .

		LITERARY HINTS TO THE VACANT-MINDED , stimulating prods to the vacuous visitors of public libraries who have but the vaguest and most nebulous desires in the direction of read - ing matter for -LRB- let us say -RRB- the approaching
Sunday	DATE	or holiday , are unobtrusively and effectively administered by means of sundry devices known to library workers .

		An open case of well-selected and externally attractive books sometimes confronts , with its eloquent appeal , the entering visitor .

		Illustrated ad - vertising matter from the publishing houses , with a selection of the most artistic or strik - ing paper jackets that protect and adorn our current publications , may occasionally be seen serving the purpose of lure and sugges - tion to the undecided book-seeker .

		In a cer - tain city library a thousand miles from
Chicago	LOCATION	the librarian has put on permanent exhibition in the delivery room a case con - taining , not `` the hundred best books , '' but `` one hundred books worth reading , '' dupli - cates of which are available , for circulation .

		Here , in bright array , the masterpieces of
George Eliot	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	and
Hawthorne	PERSON	and other novelists , with
Motley	ORGANIZATION	's `` Dutch Republic '' and
Emerson	PERSON	's '' Essays '' and
Francis Fisher Browne	PERSON	's ``
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, '' and scores of other excellent works , silently extend their cordial invitation to each and all ; and it is an invitation that is doubtless gladly accepted more times in a year than can well be counted .

		The psychology of adver - tising has taught the value of this persistent and reiterated appeal exerted by a skilfully arranged and permanent display of some of `` the best that has been known and said in the world . ''

		... WAR 'S DEVASTATION IN THE FIELD OF LET - TERS AND LEARNING has never been so great as in this present conflict , partly because there never before has been so great a war , and still more because no previous war has involved to such an extent the foremost na - tions of the civilized world .

		A single news item from the
Frankfurter Zeitung	LOCATION	is illus - trative : '' Oriental scholarship in
Germany	LOCATION	has suffered a severe loss in the death , on the battlefield , of three of its most prominent exponents , Dr.
Erich Graefe	PERSON	,
Hermann Thor	PERSON	- ning , and
Ewald Liiders	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Graefe	PERSON	, whose brilliant work in Semitic languages , and especially in the dialects current in
Egypt	LOCATION	, had already marked him out for a high posi - tion in the
Hamburg Seminary	LOCATION	, fell in the battle on the
Marne	LOCATION	;
Thorning	PERSON	, whose in - vestigations into the Islamitic brotherhood of the Dervishes cast new light upon the rela - tionship of that order to Western European religious institutions , was killed at
Esternay	LOCATION	; and Liiders , a specialist in Oriental jurispru - dence , was slain at Vitry-le-FranQois . ''

		When the end is reached and the death-lists are all in , there will be a staggering array of talent and genius lost to the world .

		And yet we still hear an occasional voice raised in behalf of the insane delusion that all this slaughter will somehow result in cultural progress !

		THE SIFTING OF LITERATURE presents diffi - culties and dangers comparable in magnitude with those encountered of old by that famous personage with the tongue-trying name , Theophilus the Thistle-sifter .

		Though the thick of the thumb be not imperilled by any such book-winnowing process as is attempted on another page , there is great likelihood of error of judgment , or of prophecy in this instance , since it is the books of the future , 206 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	not of the past , that are here run through the sieve .

		On far surer ground stands such a practitioner of the sifting art as the compiler of '' Best Books of
1914	DATE	, '' a list issued by the
New York State Library	ORGANIZATION	as `` Bibliography Bulletin 56 , '' and containing two hundred and fifty titles in all branches of literature , with brief descriptive annotations .

		Narrow - ing the more comprehensive suggestions offered by the ``
A. L. A. Booklist	PERSON	, '' which annually presents one thousand selected titles , this shorter catalogue compiled by Mr.
Wyer	PERSON	and his associates is the ripened fruit of a somewhat elaborate and wisely cautious proc - ess of tentative selection and well-considered elimination , as explained by Mr.
Wyer	PERSON	in a prefatory note .

		Experts in all fields of learn - ing represented by the books of the year , including experienced heads of juvenile de - partments in our public libraries , are called upon for advice , and the result is a book - purchasing guide especially suited to the needs of libraries unable to buy with the lavish indiscrimination possible only to the wealthiest foundations .

		The
Albany	LOCATION	list is classified , and is followed by an alphabetic index to authors and titles .

		THE BIRTHvPANGS OF A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE are excruciating in the extreme if such agon - ies as the world is now witnessing are neces - sary for the ultimate evolution of a common medium of verbal expression .

		Dr.
Frank H. Vizetelly	PERSON	, whose book on '' Essentials of En - glish Speech and Literature '' is reviewed on another page , and whose editorship of one of our leading dictionaries gives to his utter - ances on language a certain authority , has been interviewed by a
New York	LOCATION	`` Times '' writer on certain aspects of the war in its relation to speech .

		Noting a number of inter - linguistic influences now at work , Dr.
Vize	PERSON	- telly took occasion to say : `` You can not arbitrarily alter the language of nations .

		You can not establish a universal language by force any more than you can establish simpli - fied spelling by force .

		The extraordinary circumstances of the war , causing people to take a wholly unprecedented interest in the actions and speech of the people of other nations , have of necessity led them to use terms from each other 's languages .

		And so we are brought nearer to a universal lan - guage , a sort of interlinguistie conglomerate , than we could ever get as a result of the activities of the advocates of Esperanto ,
Volapuk	LOCATION	, or
Ito	PERSON	. ''

		But there is far less likeli - hood that the civilized world will ever adopt , for international use , any such
Lingua Franca	PERSON	as seems to be meant by this `` inter - linguistic conglomerate '' than that it will unite upon some one existing language , as English .

		Mediaeval use of Latin and later employment of French as a European medium may be regarded as indicative of the nature of future practice in this respect .

		BOOK-BUYING IN TIMES OF STRESS , when money is scarce and prices are high , might be expected to fall off .

		A year of war has passed over
Europe	LOCATION	, but in one at least of the coun - tries involved the book trade is said to be far from languishing .

		A survey of this trade in
England	LOCATION	for the last twelve months is printed in the
London	LOCATION	`` Times , '' and the reading of it is by no means so depressing as one would have feared .

		Certain
London	LOCATION	firms have suf - fered , it is true , and many works of substan - tial value -LRB- and price -RRB- have met with a cooler reception than would have been accorded them in times of peace .

		On the other hand , cheap reprints and current novels , as also books on the war and kindred topics , have gone like hot cakes .

		And if the American market for works ordinarily published simultaneously on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	has been rather weak , the Russian demand for English books , especially inexpensive novels , has been un - usually strong , so strong as to direct attention anew to the desirability of a copyright treaty between the two countries .

		Our own popular novelists , those already in favor with English readers , do not seem to have suffered diminu - tion of that favor because of war conditions .

		A CONTINUATION OF THE TAUCHNITZ SERIES of standard works in the English language is now announced , after a year 's suspension of activity .

		But the general character of the books lately added to the
Tauchnitz	PERSON	list is not exactly of the old order .

		In
July of last year	DATE	the series stopped with number 4506 .

		About twelve months later it was resumed with number 4507 , '' The War and
America	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
Hugo Miinsterberg	PERSON	, whose work is described by the publisher as '' a lucid and convincing description of the present war by the famous American psychologist and Austausch-Professor -LSB- Exchange Professor -RSB- . ''

		Number 4508 is `` The Austrian Officer at Work and at Play , by
Dorothea Gerard	PERSON	.

		A series of lively and clever sketches of the Aus - trian army , by an Englishwoman married to an Austrian officer . ''

		Number 4509 is another book from the ready pen of the `` Austausch - Professor , '' '' The Peace and
America	LOCATION	. ''

		New impressions of earlier issues are now coming out , it is reported .

		Will their authors receive the customary honorarium from
Leipzig	LOCATION	?

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 207 COMMUNICATIONS .

		THE IMPERISHABLE ELEMENTS OF POETRY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		As the quest eternal in the discussion of poetry has once more been touched upon , by Mr.
John L. Hervey	PERSON	in your issue of
August 15	DATE	last , I feel prompted to suggest a few ideas which have helped me in solving the question for myself .

		My refer - ence is to the communication entitled ''
Bryant	PERSON	and ' The New Poetry , ' '' and to the writer 's query as to what are '' the perishable and the imperishable elements of poetry . ''

		Recently I was browsing through the chapter on poetry in
Ernst Grosse	ORGANIZATION	's '' The Beginnings of Art '' -LRB- presumably a translation of a German work -RRB- , and therein I found this definition of the art of song , which seems helpful at the present juncture : `` Poetry is the verbal representation of external or internal phenomena in an aesthetically effective form for an aesthetic purpose . ''

		The latitude and the interpretation of this definition are indicated by the author himself in the following sentences : '' Verbal expression of feeling need only take on an aesthetically effective form it requires only rhythmical repetition for example to be lyrical . '' ''

		No feeling is in and of itself poetic , and there is no feeling which can not be made poetic if it is expressed in an aesthetic form for an aesthetic pur - pose . ''

		Here we have the true critical catholicity or democracy , the tolerance of all forms of poetry , as I look at it .

		Objective -LRB- `` external '' -RRB- and sub - jective -LRB- `` internal '' -RRB- poetry , its form -LRB- `` aestheti - cally effective '' -RRB- , and its aim -LRB- `` aesthetic '' -RRB- , are all included .

		Here is reference to the essence , '' the imperishable element , '' of lyrical poetry , for instance , '' rhythmical repetition , '' in one word rhythm .

		It matters little whether we add other embellishments to that one fundamental or not , whether or not we adorn it with metre , rhyme , fig - ures of speech , alliteration , blank verse or vers libre , because '' no feeling is in and of itself poetic , and there is no feeling which can not be made poetic if it is expressed in an -LSB- any -RSB- aesthetic form for an -LSB- any -RSB- aesthetic purpose '' -LRB- decadence , sym - bolism , the grotesque , the arabesque , romanticism , classicism , or imagism -RRB- .

		It is the fine balance between undue restraint and lawless freedom , per - ceived only by the intuitively noblest minds to whom the gift of song or true criticism hath been granted , that we should doubly underscore here , and not any one '' movement . ''

		I should therefore put the same thought in some such words as these j '' Poetry is the free-restrained substance and pre - sentation of life in written language , capable of vivification by oral delivery . ''

		But the substance of life is quite generally conceded to be rhythm , either within the mind or without ; and the pre - sentation of life is the necessary artistic illusion of greater or lesser degree , commonly styled form .

		When these two coincide in a unity as near as pos - sible to perfection , we have what might be called restrained freedom , the exquisite perception of which is what in the last analysis betrays the true poem to the mind inclined and gifted to realize it .

		This restrained freedom is a relative and variable essence which baffles definition , and which borders on the unknowable .

		It is , and must be , felt to be really known .

		In this large and broad field of pleasures , how puny and dwarf - like appear our '' new poetry '' pipers of one note !

		And the little private gardens they have staked out , in all the wide expanse , where but so many flowers of joy are permitted to vege - tate , are they in accord with the all-inclusive spirit of poetic art ?

		They and their magazines help us poor poetic democrats but little , in spite of all the tempting lure they dangle before us .

		Main emphasis upon a limited and narrow definition of the essential elements of poetry is incompatible with true culture or poetic criticism .

		The ideal lover and critic of Poetry should be susceptible to her charms no matter in what garb she appears among the sons of men .

		The breath of true poetry that passes over the JEolian harp of our hearts is not always of the same volume or intensity .

		I dare say there are many lovers of poetry to whom a con - siderable part of
Bryant	PERSON	, and not merely '' Thana - topsis , '' and '' The Water Fowl '' minus the ending , is of the divine essence , whatever it may be to a taste that can relish nothing except the green olives of poesy .

		And what poet is there who would not have ministered to the pleasures of the many as well as the few or to the many rather than the few ?

		There are many poets who have just such immortality , but whose work has nevertheless an aroma from the Happy Isles , faint and evanescent though it be .

		Or are we grown so callous that our jaded hearts can no longer respond to this lighter touch ?

		Such poets need never worry about the '' living '' qualities of their work , nor need any one else do this service for them .

		As for me , I hope ever to be broad enough in my appreciation of true poetry to recognize the Muse whether she comes in the form of a dandelion or of an orchid .

		It has always seemed to me something of a mys - tery why this poetry which some of our contempo - raries make so much over should be called '' new . ''

		It ca.n surely be so only in the sense of new again .

		I have a faint inkling this moment that somewhere in the student-day past I was wont to grind out specimens of something very like the '' new poetry , '' in my efforts to translate the choruses in the '' Prometheus '' of JEschylus , the '' Philoctetes '' of Sophocles , and the '' Iphigenia '' of Euripides , not to mention the `` Acharnians '' of Aristophanes .

		I refer here only to the form , not to the quality of these venerable ancestral prototypes ; for there is nothing of the ancient grandeur in the '' free verse '' of to-day , as far as I have become familiar with it .

		Then there are the odes of
Horace	LOCATION	, which have some suspicious cadences in them that might have served as links in the chain of development .

		Following this , we come upon the `` Antike '' of Goethe , and the `` freien Rhythmen '' so successfully employed by
Schiller	PERSON	.

		In English literature itself we find the same principle cropping out in the so-called '' irregular lines , '' '' short lines , '' '' imper - fect rhymes , '' and the like , up to the `` Lycidas '' type and the '' Samson '' choruses of our own
Milton	LOCATION	.

		I do not know how others view these phe - nomena in poetic development , but to me they have appeared from the first as milestones along the 208 -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	road leading from the rude chants of the primitive poet to the product of the modern singer of vers libre .

		Of course there is not much to say as yet either for or against the latter , because it is still a ferment , and we have no definite means of knowing what wine of joy it may eventually bring to clarity .

		Some of it I enjoy to the full , but there is much of it which with the most conscientious effort I can - not fathom .

		Still I shall be patient with it , in the hope of some day being able to see the tiny germ of true poetry it harbors .

		The form , and most of the substance , is ancient , even primitive ; but the sub - stance gives , by reason of its insistent mentioning of things of to-day , a promise of a universality somewhat akin to the contemporary allusions of the ancients , which have since become classic to our generation .

		Only some such view as this is com - patible with the democratic spirit of true poetry .

		We ought to be charitable to the '' new , '' or the old-new , if you please , but we ought also to give and ask no quarter in our dealings with those who assail the old .

		The devotee of '' the new poetry '' may require a certain eccentric over-emphasis to make his message felt , but we can not passively per - mit him to disparage and condemn that poetry which even feeds the tender rootlets of imagism and its ilk , which is still a part of our present-day culture , and which is the only kind of poetry that can be appreciated to the full by the least of the lovers of true poetry .

		THE COLLEGE COMMEKCIALIZED .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In his recent essay on '' The Colleges and Mediocrity '' in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine , '' Professor
Canby	PERSON	of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	very ably discusses one of the great problems which have risen in consequence of the rapid influx of wealth into this country , namely , the enormous increase in numbers of those who go to college without knowing why , and the difficulty of handling the crowds and at the same time cloing justice to the exceptional man .

		I wish to set down here some thoughts that have occurred to me as I read the essay .

		With regard to the mere fact that the colleges are now besieged by the unelect , I am disposed to be , on the whole , optimistic .

		It is a phase , we may trust , and in some respects a passing phase , of the upward progress of mankind , and is distinctly more encouraging than would be the case if the masses , though increasing in wealth , remained in - different to all forms of education .

		The poet who said that '' a little learning is a dangerous thing '' himself uttered a dangerous half-truth ; for how much more dangerous is that ignorance with which in the past men have been too easily satisfied , and which the demagogue has found so much more manageable than even half - knowledge !

		Better , then , because safer , the mediocrity to which gen - eral education is bringing us than the ignorance which preceded it .

		I wish , therefore , to protest with all earnestness against that view of some college teachers accord - ing to which a few elect are to be singled out for attention and the rest unsympathetically ignored or frozen out of the class-room .

		The teacher who thinks thus , who does not give his best to all who have a right to expect it , had better quit teaching or else go in for `` graduate work . ''

		To be sure , teaching the sixty - and fifty-per-centers is not fun , any more than teaching the feeble-minded ; yet somebody must be found to do the work .

		But the exceptionally bright man needs , as Mr.
Canby	PERSON	rightly insists , to be in a class by himself , where the dullards will not hamper him and where he can have the highest possible development .

		In this connection we find one of the baneful effects of '' mediocrity '' which Mr.
Canby	PERSON	does not dis - cuss .

		Many of the colleges have fallen under the control of trustees who are not themselves college men or have lost the college point of view , and who , though doubtless acting with the best of motives , have not sufficiently large and enlightened views as to what the college and the university should stand for .

		Large classes are obviously more economical from a pecuniary point of view ; hence a tendency to sniff at graduate work , which entails small classes and a large expense per capita .

		The graduate school , in consequence , is allowed to shift for itself ; sometimes the professor is allowed to give graduate courses only after he has done a full day 's work with the undergraduates ; some - times a professor whose ability lies chiefly in graduate work is released in favor of one who is popular with undergraduates , and who is therefore less expensive .

		The diminishing of the number of good teachers is perhaps another direct result of the conditions which make for '' mediocrity . ''

		The growth of endowment funds has not kept pace with the growth of student bodies ; hence the necessity for boards of trustees to cut down expenses where possible , and to increase salaries only when it be - comes absolutely necessary to do so in order to keep professors from going elsewhere .

		What the result has been , every college teacher knows .

		With the relative decline of the professor 's salary has come at least a corresponding decline of prestige , for the '' mediocre '' mind judges by materialistic standards ; and now the bright graduate goes in for law or medicine or business , with only a con - temptuous smile for the plodder or the visionary who still thinks of teaching as a life work .

		What is the remedy ?

		Panacea there is none .

		More generous endowments will help to increase respect for educational foundations and to make it possible for professors to live a little more comfortably .

		A long step forward will have been taken when college faculties participate in the work of boards of trustees , according to the plan suggested by President
Schurman	PERSON	; provided , of course , that men of tact and real influence are chosen to represent the faculties .

		The formation of small classes , honor sections , and honors courses will do much .

		But none of these will wholly cure the trouble .

		A FRIEND OF PETRARCH 'S .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Some time ago my learned friend ,
M. Henry Cochin	PERSON	, an authority in
France	LOCATION	on Italian history and literature , read before the
Paris Academy of Inscriptions	ORGANIZATION	and Belles Lettres a very interesting paper about a friend of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, which should , perhaps , be made more widely known in
America	LOCATION	where the celebrated Tuscan has so many admirers .

		So J suggested to M. Cocliin that he prepare for THE DIAL a resume of his paper , which he has done with great complacency .

		He was all the more disposed to do so because of his own and his distinguished father 's pleasant relations with the
United States	LOCATION	; for , it will be remembered ,
M. Augustin Cochin	PERSON	was a prominent French aboli - tionist and a friend of Garrison , knew and admired
Longfellow	LOCATION	, and led in the movement which sent to us a national tribute from
France	LOCATION	when
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	was stricken down .

		The son perhaps I should say the two sons , for
M. Denys Cochin	PERSON	, of the French Academy , is the brother of
M. Henry Cochin	ORGANIZATION	has continued the paternal tradition ; and some of his best friends have been and are still to be found among the best Americans .

		Before closing this biographical paragraph , I should add that
M. Henry Cochin	PERSON	, with his brother , who rep - resents a
Paris	LOCATION	district , has sat for the past twenty years in the
Chamber of Deputies	ORGANIZATION	, where , just before the war broke out , he was succeeded by his son , who is now at the front .

		But here is the resume : The dearest and most intimate of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's friends , the one who enjoyed his complete confi - dence in the matter of his love for
Laura	LOCATION	, and to whom he dedicated the collection of his '' Familiar Letters , '' is designated by him under the enigmatic name of '' Socrates . ''

		An eminent Belgian scholar , Dom
U. Berliere	PERSON	, who was director of the
Belgian Archaeological School	ORGANIZATION	at
Eome	ORGANIZATION	, a few years ago discovered at the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	certain documents which enabled him to identify '' Socrates '' with one
Ludo	PERSON	- vicus Sanctus , born in
Beeringhen	LOCATION	, near
Liege	LOCATION	, a musician esteemed in his time ,
Canon	ORGANIZATION	and Cantor of
S. Donation de Bruges	ORGANIZATION	, and musical conductor for
Cardinal Giovanni Colonna	ORGANIZATION	at
Avignon	LOCATION	.

		The discovery of the name of
Ludovicus Sanctus	ORGANIZATION	makes it possible to identify various works of which he was the author .

		One of these is a letter , addressed to the Chapter of
Bruges	LOCATION	, dated
April 18 , 1348	DATE	, and giving an account of the ravages of the
Black Death	ORGANIZATION	at
Avignon	LOCATION	and the pontifical court .

		A quite recent investigation has enabled
M. Henry Cochin	ORGANIZATION	to discover a work on musical theory by
Ludovicus Sanctus	ORGANIZATION	in a manuscript of the latter half of the fourteenth century .

		This manuscript , which he sought in vain in the
Vallicellane Library	ORGANIZATION	, as entered in its catalogue , he finally traced to the
Laurentian Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Florence	LOCATION	, under a bizarre disguise , among the manuscripts which
Libri	ORGANIZATION	had sold in
England	LOCATION	, and which came back to
Italy	LOCATION	in the
Ashburnham	LOCATION	succession .

		The treatise by Sanctus which this manuscript contains is entitled : '' Du Sujet de la Musique Sonore . ''

		It is an ingenious scholastic dissertation upon a controversial point of aesthetics What is the part played by arithmetical relations in the art of tone ?

		The discussion by
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's friend is not without interest .

		It shows that the Car - dinal 's conductor was not only a practical com - poser but also a musical theorist .

		The discovery of one of his works raises the hope that still others may be found .

		How interesting would be the dis - covery of one of his musical compositions !

		M.
Cochin	LOCATION	shows furthermore the part played by music in mediaeval poetry , and particularly in the poetry of
Petrarch	LOCATION	, who always conceived of his poems as clothed with melody .

		Now no musician can have had more influence over him than ''
Socrates	PERSON	, '' whom he knew in youth at the time of his most important poetical productivity .

		In a subsequent conversation with
M. Cochin	PERSON	, he dwelt upon the importance which a knowledge of the musical works of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's Socrates might have on the history of music in general . ''

		One can not exaggerate , '' he remarked , '' the part which Flemish musicians have played in the musical formation of the whole of
Europe	LOCATION	from the ninth and tenth centuries down , but especially begin - ning with the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries ; from the time of the
Flemish Guillaume Du Fay	ORGANIZATION	down to the
Flemish Louis	LOCATION	van
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	.

		Fur - thermore , in the fourteenth century , there were constant relations between
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	, which are especially revealed by the enormous number of ecclesiastical benefices held in the Low Countries by members of the great Roman fam - ilies .

		This explains why it was that
Giacomo Colonna	PERSON	,
Canon	ORGANIZATION	of
Liege	LOCATION	, could draw to him and attach to the choir of his brother this
Fleming	PERSON	,
Ludovicus Sanctus	PERSON	,
Lodewyek Heiliger	PERSON	, by the way , in Flemish . ''

		Two other points touched upon by
M. Cochin	PERSON	in his paper may be mentioned here in closing .

		He gives a rapid sketch of the Campigne region and of the village of
Beeringhen	LOCATION	, where Sanctus was born , '' prosperous and smiling before the recent ravages of the barbarians , '' and reminds his French hearers that it was at Beeringhen that
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	sought a refuge in
1739	DATE	, with Mme. du Chatelet , who pretended to exercise manorial rights over the hamlet .

		On page 157 of your issue for
September 2	DATE	appears the following statement : '' Mr.
Arnold Mulder	PERSON	opens a new field for American fiction in ` Bram of the Five Corners / a story of the Hol - landers in

		As a matter of fact , Mr.
Mulder	PERSON	dealt with this same milieu some two or three years ago in a novel entitled '' The Dominie of
Harlem	LOCATION	. ''

		Of course , to anyone who compares the two novels carefully , there can scarcely be any doubt that ''
Bram	PERSON	of the Five Corners '' ` is decid - edly the better , both in structure and in bigness of conception ; but perhaps it is worth noting , never - theless , that Mr.

Sept. 16	DATE	SENSE AND NONSENSE ABOUT
BERNARD SHAW	PERSON	.

		* There still prevails , in certain circles , ' con - siderable scepticism in regard to the value of the influence exerted upon this generation by the personality and writings of
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.

		But in the opinion of those who are accurately informed in regard to the trend of modern ideas in
Europe	LOCATION	, Great Brit - ain , and the
United States	LOCATION	, there is no longer any doubt , since the full details of his career and development were made public several years ago , that he is one of the most remark - able personalities and thinkers of our era .

		Thinking men and women have ceased to re - gard Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	as a red spectre , an irrepres - sible mountebank , a privileged lunatic , an irresponsible jester .

		The most conspicuous feature of his career is now patent to the gen - eral public , that his voice carries around the world .

		While we may not now be able to com - pute the influence which he exerts , whether for good or ill , certain it is that he is to-day the most widely read international publicist .

		His pronouncements on matters of universal concern civic , political , literary , artistic , social , sociological , philosophical , religious appeal to the masses from leading journals and magazines in all the principal countries of the globe .

		Through the medium of his books and plays , he reaches and influences a considerably smaller , yet more cultivated and distinctly literary , element of the population in these same countries .

		The interest in Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's life , personality , and philosophy , which remained little better than amused curiosity until the last four or five years , has lately expressed itself in sev - eral books of merit and power , from clever extravaganzas such as the '' Paradise Found '' by Mr.
Allen	PERSON	Upward and effective brochures such as Mr.
John Palmer	PERSON	's `` Harlequin or Patriot ? ''

		to more penetrating and serious critical studies such as those by
M. Cestre	PERSON	,
M. Hamon	PERSON	,
Herr Bab	PERSON	, and Mr.
Joseph Mc	PERSON	- Cabe .

Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Man , which may best be described , perhaps , as a commentary on
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	apropos of
Chester	PERSON	- ton .

		A climax , of a sort , is attained in the well-knit , closely reasoned `` interpretation '' by Mr.
Joseph McCabe	PERSON	.

		In works of this type , the biographical paraphernalia are usu - ally employed as hereditary and environ - mental explanations of the development of the subject 's leading ideas and theories .

		In this respect , Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	's work is no excep - tion to the rule .

		The biographical details , virtually without exception and without spe - cific acknowledgment , are conscientiously culled from the authorized biography .

		The result is satisfactory , the needed facts being presented with Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	's customary smoothness and dexterity .

		The remainder of the book which constitutes much the greater portion is an original , first-hand , searching study of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, both in his writings and in his public utterances .

		A few minor matters are provocative of interest .

		For example , Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	remarks -LRB- p. 23 -RRB- : '' Fifteen years ago he -LSB-
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- recommended to me as the first rule of writ - ing : ` Take the utmost care that what you have to say is correct , and then dash it down as frivolously as you can . ' ''

		Is this only another way of putting Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's dictum -LRB- p. 201 of the authorized biography -RRB- : `` My method , you will have noticed , is to take the utmost trouble to find the right thing to say , and then say it with the utmost levity '' ?

		^ Again , in commenting on '' The Philanderer , '' Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	makes the startlingly inaccurate statement -LRB- in view of the very successful and widely heralded production , at Mr.
Winthrop Ames	PERSON	's Little Theatre in
New York City	LOCATION	-RRB- : `` It was merely produced -LSB- by Mr.
Grein	PERSON	in the Independent Theatre ,
London	LOCATION	, series of productions -RSB- in order to secure the _ theatrical rights , and it remains to this day , in spite of an attempt to revive it , almost unknown on the stage . ''

		This is a conspicuous illustration of the mistake of omitting from consideration or examination the
United States	LOCATION	, which is originally and fundamentally responsible for Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's world-wide repute as a dramatist .

		At times the freely flowing journalistic style of Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	is ` marred with infelicities of which the following is an example : `` The play exists , in fact , for the sake of the dia - logue , and characters of a higher intellectual type are introduced than in the preceding play . ''

		With reference to `` Candida , '' Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	remarks : '' Yet the play was rejected in
London	LOCATION	, and not presented there until
1904	DATE	, when American enthusiasm had induced
London	LOCATION	to reconsider the matter '' -LRB- p. 181 -RRB- ; !

		while only a little farther on -LRB- p. 183 -RRB- he
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 211 observes : '' It was only in
1904	DATE	, long after it had been published that
New York	LOCATION	discov - ered its greatness , and
London	LOCATION	grudgingly patronised it . ''

		In this connection , it is worthy of remark that
New York	LOCATION	might have '' discov - ered the greatness '' of '' Candida '' prior to
1904	DATE	had not
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	, nine years before -LRB-
1895	DATE	-RRB- , abandoned its production even after putting it in rehearsal !

		An illustra - tion of Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	's inaccuracy whether the result of carelessness or insularity is found in the statement concerning ''
Caesar	PERSON	and Cleopatra '' : '' The play has not been well received , and it had to wait a number of years for even a moderate appreciation . ''

		As pro- duced by Mr.
Forbes Robertson	PERSON	and Miss Ger - trude
Elliot	PERSON	in this country , the play was a success ; and this episode accentuates the fact , of which Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	seems innocently unaware , that a play 's success in the
United States	LOCATION	, in the large sense , both artistic and financial , is often a much more important event than that play 's success in
England	LOCATION	.

		Proba - bly the most ludicrous remark in the book though apparently Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	does not sus - pect it is the following comment on `` Man and Superman '' : '' It is fairly safe to say that not one in a thousand of the audiences who have enjoyed the play , especially in the
United States	LOCATION	, has the dimmest perception of its moral . ''

		My observation of audiences at performances of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's plays in both countries has convinced me that whereas the English attend productions of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's plays to be amused , remaining constitution - ally oblivious to the '' .

		philosophy , '' American audiences , while welcoming the amusement furnished , are constitutionally curious in re - gard to the underlying purport of the drama - tist .

		Nowhere , not even in
Germany	LOCATION	, has Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	the playwright been so widely stud - ied and so generally analyzed as in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		An amusing illustration of Mr.
Mc	PERSON	- Cabe 's inaccuracy in this case doubtless due to un familiarity with the original text is found in the title which he assigns to Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's burlesque on popular melodrama , pro- duced at
Regent 's Park	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	,
July 14 , 1905	DATE	: `` Passion , Poison , and Putrefaction '' which inevitably leaves the reader in a state of petrifaction .

		I confess , too , that in this , '' die grosse Zeit , '' the era of ravaged Bel - gium , torpedoed `` Lusitania , '' and mined North Sea , I read with almost a start Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	's complacent assertion -LRB- p. 121 -RRB- : '' There is no possibility now of barbarism overthrowing civilization as it formerly did . ''

		In the chapter entitled '' Socialism , '' Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	points out an important departure made by Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	in a series of articles in `` The Labour Leader '' -LRB-
March 31 , 1911	DATE	, and following -RRB- by the editor , Mr.
A. Fenner Brockway	PERSON	.

		Clearly Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	is unaware of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's much more effective enuncia - tion of the same position , published in this country in '' The Metropolitan Magazine '' -LRB-
Dec. , 1913	DATE	-RRB- .

		The position taken by Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	is a model for simplicity of expression , if not of practical execution : Socialism is '' a system of society where all the income of the country is to be divided up in exactly equal propor - tions . ''

		This is not a mere freak of opinion on Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's part : it is his final creed .

		And Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	points out that identically this same doctrine was expounded by Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	in an address at the
City Temple	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, on
October 30 , 1913	DATE	.

		Ideas such as these , fantas - tic , impractical , explain Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's ineffec - tiveness as a practical politician , and his almost total failure to wield any real influ - ence over the hard-headed , sordidly practical , workingman of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	, who is free from the ideas and illusions of the Shavian , has mercilessly ex - posed throughout his book Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's funda - mental error in confusing `` illusions '' and `` ideals , '' the error underlying his `` Quin - tessence of Ibsenism . ''

		Again and again he exposes the fallacies inherent in Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's `` appeal to will '' as opposed to an `` appeal to reason '' ; and makes it abundantly clear that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's theories vanish in a cloud of ineffective mysticism whenever the guidance -LRB- not the control -RRB- of `` reason '' is abandoned .

		Facile and astute in convicting Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	of inconsistency , Mr.
McCabe	PERSON	is guilty of funda - mental inconsistency throughout his entire book , in denying that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	is a philoso - pher yet seriously analyzing that philosophy as the key to , the keystone of , his entire lit - erary and social contribution !

		This is the crowning , if unconscious , jest of a very clever bit of interpretation .

		Not the least of Mc - Cabe 's merits is his ability to expose
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's fundamental positions in pithy quotations which he does not blink on the score of their blasphemy , outspokenness , or mad impracti - cality .

		Typical of these are the following : '' Popular Christianity has for its emblem a gibbet , for its chief sensation a sanguinary execu - tion after torture , and for its central mystery an insane vengeance bought off by a trumpery expia - tion . '' ''

		There is no way at all out of the present sys - tem of condemning the superfluous women to barrenness except by legitimizing the children of women who are not married to the father . '' ''

		Childless marriage -LSB- through artificial steriliza - tion -RSB- became available to male voluptuaries as the cheapest way of keeping a mistress and to female 212 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	ones as the most convenient and respectable way of being kept in idle luxury by a man . '' ''

		The ne , t result -LSB- of our penal codes -RSB- suggested by the police statistics is that we inflict atrocious injuries on the burglars we catch in order to make the rest take effectual precautions against detec - tion ; so that , instead of saving our wives ' dia - monds from burglary , we only greatly decrease our chances of ever getting them back , and increase our chances of being shot by the robber if we are unlucky enough to disturb him at his work . ''

		The brochure by Mr.
John Palmer	PERSON	, heralded as presenting '' an astonishingly new
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, '' is the best brief interpretation of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	ever penned .

		But the ideas , with only a single exception , which it presents as descriptive and indicative of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, are in no sense origi - nal being fully set forth in the authorized biography in
1911	DATE	.

		Displaying considerable ingenuity in his attempt to impart novelty and originality to fully established views of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	is entirely successful in presenting '' an astonishingly old
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		These ideas about Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	are , roughly , as follows : -LRB- 1 -RRB- He is a deep , not a shallow , personality .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- He is exceedingly difficult to interpret .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- He is not an original thinker .

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- He is , fundamentally , modest about the greater contributions of his own art and work .

		-LRB- 5 -RRB- He is , at bottom , profoundly in earnest .

		-LRB- 6 -RRB- He is a man of large heart and deep feeling .

		-LRB- 7 -RRB- He is not an anarchist .

		-LRB- 8 -RRB- He is an expert critic , with a phe - nomenally effective style .

		The exception to be noted is number three , above .

		I have always taken the position that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	is an original thinker , a man who has constructed and erected a definite system of philosophy .

		I challenge Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	to make a respectable analysis of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's plays without appealing to , and exhibiting , either explicitly or implicitly , Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's characteristic and invariable `` philosophy , '' or view of the relations of men and women , toward each other , and toward the universe .

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	has been wise enough to shirk an impossible task .

		Critics who have really stud - ied Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	and his works at first hand have already succeeded in setting forth the funda - mental principles of his philosophy and justly credit him with anticipating or paralleling , in fundamental particulars , professional philoso - phers , conspicuously
Nietzsche	PERSON	and
Bergson	PERSON	.

		The real object of Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	's brochure is to assert that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	committed a funda - mental blunder in printing his celebrated pamphlet , '' Common Sense about the War . ''

		As to this , each one must judge for himself .

		The reasons which he gave me for publishing the pamphlet I regard as thoroughly sound .

		It suffices to make clear that it was perhaps the most courageous and sacrificial act of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's career to play the .

		part of spectator ab extra in regard to a stupendous issue over which the dictates of '' patriotism '' were in - flexible and vindictive .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	once more demonstrated , and in a great crisis , his cour - age to voice common sense and to speak the truth though it would be absurd to deny that no little of his '' common sense '' was non - sense , and no little of his '' truth '' was error .

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	has not made good his '' case '' ; as put by him , it is too futile and feeble to be dignified with the term '' case . ''

		The whole '' case '' of
England	LOCATION	against
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	is clearly put in the statement -LRB- p. 75 -RRB- : ``
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, in writing this pamphlet , has done a clearly unpopular thing .

		Undoubtedly he has angered and estranged many of his admirers . ''

		The little extravaganza embodying Mr.
Upward	PERSON	's dramatized version of
Bellamy	PERSON	's '' Looking Backward , '' with Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	as the
Rip Van Winkle	ORGANIZATION	in a realized Social Democ - racy v of his own invention , is described on the cover as '' The Adventures of
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	in a Shavian World . ''

		Shaw awakes , after a sleep of two hundred years , to find all his own ideas realized in actual practice .

		After a few typical experiences in this Shavian world , he characteristically becomes disgusted with the state of affairs , and impetuously heads a revolt of the anti-Shavians .

		It is ad - mirable fooling , but Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	has already spent a lifetime in this present world heading a revolt against the Shavians .

		By
Scott Nearing	PERSON	, Ph.D. .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


1915	DATE	-RSB- 213 The action was taken soon after the publica - tion of his book on Income .

		No mention of this book as the cause of Dr.
Nearing	PERSON	's dis - missal has come to the notice of the present reviewer , and it undoubtedly was not the sole cause .

		But a member of the
Board of Trus	ORGANIZATION	- tees has given out an interview condemning certain of Dr.
Nearing	PERSON	's teachings , among them one , the injustice of interest , which may be deduced from his latest book .

		Putting aside the distinctions made by the older economists between landlords , capital - ists , and laborers , and the forms of incomes derived from rent , interest , dividends , and labor , Dr.
Nearing	PERSON	divides income into two kinds , property income and service income .

		Naturally , there can be only two classes of income receivers , owners of property and those who render service .

		The former are classed as economic parasites , living upon the proceeds of other men 's efforts .

		Modern so - ciety asks no questions about how they became possessed of their property .

		Ownership as - sures the income .

		The various industries have been examined carefully by Dr.
Nearing	PERSON	to determine how much of their profits go to labor , how much to the property owners .

		The ratio of service income to property income in the American railroad industry is found to be about four to three ; in the telephone industry , two to one ; the telegraph , five to one ; railway terminals -LRB- in
Iowa	LOCATION	only -RRB- , one to ten ; municipal utili - ties , ten to nine ; the
United States Steel Corporation	ORGANIZATION	, three to two ; the Pullman Car Company , five to one .

		-LRB- But this latter com - pany has increased its capital from
$ 18,000	MONEY	, - 000 to
$ 120,000,000	MONEY	by the simple process of stock dividends . -RRB-

		Taking the manufacturing industries as a whole , it seems that about one - half the values added to raw materials by manufacture is paid back as service income .

		On the face of things , an equal share in the profits may not appear altogether bad for labor .

		Yet conditions are far from ideal .

		Taking
$ 750	MONEY	as the sum necessary for a living wage for a family of five , and comparing the wages received , it will be found that many fall below the poverty line .

		In the street railways of
New York	LOCATION	, twenty-five per cent of the geueral office clerks are below the line ; in the .

		iron and steel industry , out of 172,706 employees , sixty per cent .

		In the cotton in - dustry only six per cent in the North and three per cent in the South earn more than
$ 750	MONEY	, while half the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	and four-fifths of the Southern men fall below
$ 500	MONEY	.

		In the woolen , worsted , and cotton mills of Law - rence ,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, half of the men receive less than
$ 500	MONEY	, seven-eighths less than
$ 600	MONEY	.

		In all the textile industries of the
United States	LOCATION	ninety per cent of the men received in 1910-12 less than
$ 750	MONEY	, while sixty per cent received less than
$ 500	MONEY	.

		Substantially the same conditions prevail in the paper and lum - ber industries , and the situation is not much better in the mines and quarries .

		The total wages paid by the American manufacturing industries , the mines and quarries , and the railroads amount to about
$ 6,500,000,000	MONEY	.

		The easily traced property income is about as large , taking no account of property occupied by the owners .

		The greater part of this belongs to a few indi - viduals .

		The property holders have priority of claim on the products of industry , the bondholders first , the stockholders next .

		Our courts have repeatedly held that the owners of property are entitled to `` a fair return , '' usually about six per cent .

		If the Pullman Company were brought into court the deci - sion probably would award '' a fair return '' on
$ 120,000,000	MONEY	, all but
$ 18,000,000	MONEY	of which was paid into the coffers of the company by its patrons , while they were paying `` a fair return '' on the
$ 18,000,000	MONEY	.

		What American court has ever rendered the decision that a laborer was entitled to a fair wage ?

		Even the right to work is only an abstraction , abso - lutely empty until made real by the owners of property .

		Both men and property become old and useless .

		The owners of property are often safeguarded by charges upon society for an amortization fund , which makes capital immortal .

		When the receiver of service in - come grows old and becomes incapable of rendering service , his income stops .

		His only chance for immortality is in the world to come .

		Such , in outline , are the facts set forth by Dr.
Nearing	PERSON	, and the conclusions drawn from these facts .

		They are unpleasant to the up - holders of the old individualistic laissez faire philosophy , such as the men who now domi - nate
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and it is no wonder that it was thought best to dispose of the author of such a work .

		Dr.
Nearing	PERSON	's book gives evidence of care - ful study in preparation , and is fairly well put together .

		But there are some sentences in which the meaning of the author is not perfectly clear .

		A few facts connected with property income , perhaps of negligible impor - tance , are overlooked .

		The income derived from millions of stocks and bonds , which is classified as property income , really belongs in the category of service income .

		Such is the revenue derived from the
$ 12,000,000	MONEY	set aside by the
Steel Corporation	ORGANIZATION	for pensions , which is nothing but a deferred payment of 214 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	wages , or service income .

		A few other com - panies follow a like practice .

		However , if all items of this kind were transferred from property income to service income , the change would not be very great .

		A much larger and more troublesome item is the sum realized from stocks , bonds , and rented property devoted to educational and eleemosynary institutions .

		In one sense all this is property income ; yet practically , all of it is used in payment for services .

		Looked at from this point of view , it is simply an item appearing on both sides of the ledger , and may be retained or stricken out without any material difference .

		Yet there is another point of view .

		The funds used to support the
Rockefeller Foundation	ORGANIZATION	may be regarded as having been collected from the makers and users of '' Standard oil . ''

		So much of it as is collected from the makers is simply that much service income taken from one set of men and given to another set performing an entirely different kind of service .

		Certainly this much , whatever it is , should be stricken from the total of property income , and left on the side of service income .

		In discussing the monopoly principle ap - plied to labor and capital , the author reaches the conclusion that the monopoly power of ownership , and not productivity , determines the share of the values created in industry that shall be allotted to each .

		If this be true , one can not help wondering why it is that in the great industries about one-half the value added by manufacture is paid out as wages , or service income , while less than half in many cases considerably less goes to the stockholders and bondholders as interest and dividends , or property income .

		Certainly the laborers of this country will not admit that their monopoly is more nearly complete than that of the capitalists .

		But however much we may differ from Dr.
Nearing	PERSON	on his views about the position of capital , we must agree with his conclusion that `` service is of preeminent importance , '' and that '' above the rights of property there must be placed the rights of humanity . ''

		It was a great misfortune to a great university to lose so forceful a teacher of such ideas .


DAVID Y. THOMAS	PERSON	.

		EMERSON STUDIED FROM His JOURNALS .

		* `` A new venture into a field from which biography and criticism have drawn repeated and ample harvests may avert the charge of *
RALPH WALDO EMERSON	PERSON	.

		By
O. W. Firkins	PERSON	.

		With por - trait .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		impertinence by pointing to the fresh mate - rials in the ten-volume edition of the Jour - nals , 1909-14 , brought out under the careful and tasteful editorship of
Edward Waldo Emerson	PERSON	and
Waldo Emerson Forbes	PERSON	. ''

		Such is the excuse Professor
Firkins	PERSON	offers for his interesting study of
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		The excuse is valid , but the performance invites criticism .

		A generous use of the Journals has been made , but in some important particulars the `` fresh materials '' have been inadequately treated .

		This is noticeable in the case of
Emerson	LOCATION	's eight-page journal record concern - ing his choice of a profession , and in the copious records of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's interpretation of
Webster	PERSON	's `` Seventh of
March	DATE	Speech '' and the misconstruction of his motives , and in the several records showing
Emerson	PERSON	's lack of appreciation of Lincoln prior to the shock of the assassination .

		On the subject of the Shakespeare-Bacon controversy , our critic is silent ; the Journals cry out against this silence , as we shall show later .

		The book is issued in uniform style with the Journals and the '' Centenary Edition '' of the complete works , and is intended appar - ently as a companion volume or interpretative study of each .

		With respect to the well - known writings , the new study is the most thorough and analytical that has yet come to our notice .

		The first half of the volume is devoted to a sketch of
Emerson	LOCATION	's life ; the last half , to a review and an analysis of his prose and poetry and his philosophy .

		The latter portion is perhaps the most interesting to the general reader ; and the review of the essays , on account of their general interest throughout the world , contains the most valu - able criticism in the book .

		From this stimu - lating study , the reader will naturally turn to the other writings , and then to the chap - ters on
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's technique .

		This will be true especially of those readers who have heretofore known
Emerson	PERSON	only through his essays , and their number is legion .

		In a review of the works , the address on `` War , '' delivered in
Boston	LOCATION	in
1838	DATE	, is not mentioned .

		In view of the timeliness of the subject and also of
Emerson	LOCATION	's later appetite for war , so vividly emphasized by our critic , we must regret the omission .

		It was in this address that
Emerson	PERSON	prophesied : `` War is on its last legs . '' ''

		Trade , '' he said , '' as all men know , is the antagonist of War . ''

		Cer - tainly trade and war have together prospered in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	,
Asia	LOCATION	and
Africa	LOCATION	, since the time of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's prophecy , as they never prospered before ; and
Emerson	PERSON	himself underwent in the next two decades an entirely different attitude from that of turning `` the
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 215 other cheek , as - one engaged , throughout his being , no longer to the service of an indi - vidual , but to the common soul of all men . ''

		Professor
Firkins	PERSON	fails to note this change .

		Emerson as a prose-writer is considered under the following headings : Culture ,
Criti	ORGANIZATION	- cism , Clearness , Coherence , English ,
Diction	ORGANIZATION	,
Unbendings	LOCATION	,
Hyperbole	LOCATION	, Word-Play ,
Meta	PERSON	- phor , Epigram , Condensation ,
Floridity	LOCATION	, Rhythm ,
Polarity	LOCATION	, Style , and Inhibitions .

		In the matter of coherence , for the lack of which
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	has been criticized , Professor
Firkins	PERSON	presents an ingenious analysis in vindication of the writer , but fails to note this significant passage in the Journals -LRB- vol .

		VIII. , page 463 -RRB- : '' If Minerva offered me a gift and an option , I would say give me continuity .

		I am tired of scraps .

		I do not wish to be a literary or intellectual chiffonier .

		Away with this Jew 's ragbag of ends and tufts of brocade , velvet , and cloth-of-gold ; let me spin some yards or miles of helpful twine , a clue to lead to one kingly truth , a cord to bind wholesome and belonging facts . ''

		Emerson 's poetry is considered under five headings , the last of which , '' Star Dust , '' is dealt with under twelve sub-headings .

		In the section on
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's philosophy there are thirty-one headings , among them the fol - lowing : Experience ,
Logic	ORGANIZATION	, Sensibility , Uni - versality , Iconoclasm , Illusion , Possibility , Rhetoric , Idealism ,
Government	ORGANIZATION	, Evil , Moral - ists , Duty , Love , and Insecurities .

		Under the heading of Experience , we are introduced into the secret of
Emerson	LOCATION	's philosophy : '' The secret of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	may be conveyed in one word , the superlative , even the superhuman , value which he found in the unit of expe - rience , the direct , momentary , individual act of consciousness .

		This is the centre from which the man radiates ; it begets all and ex - plains all . ''

		In the concluding chapter , Professor Fir - kins attempts to show that the intellectual and moral development of the world up to
Emerson	LOCATION	's time was crystallized in him .

		`` We wish to suggest that a larger arc of the great hoop which we call the universe found accom - modation in the soul of
Emerson	LOCATION	than in that of almost any other known denizen of the planet . ''

		But our critic says that
Emerson	PERSON	`` is hardly in the strong sense a teacher , hardly in the strong sense an example : he is a revelation of capacity , an adjourned hope , an unassured but momentous foreshadowing . ''

		While the book is a stimulating contribu - tion to Emersonian criticism , it fails to pre - sent the human side that the Journals reveal .

		While
Emerson	PERSON	has suggested that it is all over with a hero when we have come up with his limitations , it is in
Emerson	LOCATION	as a hero - worshipper that we see his fundamental weakness .

		We can appreciate why it was that
Webster	PERSON	in
1850	DATE	and Lincoln in 1861-2 lacked the potentialities of heroes for
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	when we see such men as
Owen Lovejoy	PERSON	and
John Brown	PERSON	evoking his praise .

		Professor
Firkins	PERSON	tells us that the growth of
Emerson	LOCATION	's respect for Lincoln was slow but sure .

		The fact is that in
Lincoln	LOCATION	, as in
Webster	LOCATION	,
Emerson	PERSON	took slight interest , and he was disappointed in both men as public servants .

		Even after the Emancipation Proclamation ,
Emerson	PERSON	records in his Journal -LRB- vol .

		IX. , page 557 -RRB- : `` You can not refine Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's taste , extend his horizon , or clear his judgment ; he will not walk diguifiedly through the traditional part of the President of
America	LOCATION	, but will pop out his head at each railroad station and make a little speech , and get into an argument with
Squire	PERSON	A and Judge B. '' Not until after the assassination does Lincoln appear to
Emerson	LOCATION	as a hero .

		But in the case of
Delia Bacon	PERSON	-LRB- and here the material in the Journals is so prominent that we can not believe the omission in the vol - ume before us was unintentional -RRB- the hero worshipped is not the poor misguided girl that came to
Emerson	LOCATION	for encouragement , but the mysterious courtly author alleged to have written the plays ascribed to the `` jovial ac - tor . ''

		Shakespeare repelled
Emerson	LOCATION	;
Bacon	LOCATION	attracted .

		And it was from his own essay on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, in his `` Representative Men , '' published two years before , that
Delia Bacon	PERSON	received the inspiration for her quixotic theory , with her subsequent pitiful pilgri - mage and investigation .

		Let us mention some citations to the material that do not receive mention in Professor
Firkins	PERSON	's volume .

		On
May 19 , 1852	DATE	,
Emerson	PERSON	records his first meeting with
Delia Bacon	PERSON	.

		An interesting editorial note is appended to this record .

		Emerson gave her a letter of introduction , to
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and also one to
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, then a consul in
England	LOCATION	.

		In his Journals -LRB- vol .

		VIII. , page 314 -RRB-
Emerson	PERSON	copies extracts from a letter from her , which shows that his interest is in her investigation rather than in her .

		Later -LRB- page 367 -RRB- he records that he has been reading '' Troilus and
Cressida	PERSON	, '' and hints a discovery of
Francis Bacon	PERSON	's author - ship of the play as the result of this * reading .

		In
1857	DATE	,
Delia Bacon	PERSON	's book appeared , and
Emerson	PERSON	records extracts from it in his Jour - nal .


Delia Bacon	PERSON	, as the editors inform us , `` literally gave her reason and life to her work , which she pursued in great poverty and absolute isolation in
England	LOCATION	for three or four years . ''

		But
Emerson	PERSON	does not make 216 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	any comment on her sacrifice .

		His interest is in the subject of her investigation .

		Two years later , we read of his disappointment caused by the cold reception of the book in the literary world .

		But again his interest is in the hero of the problem rather than in the girl whom the problem overwhelmed .

		He writes : '' In literary circles they still discuss the question who wrote
Junius	PERSON	, a matter of supreme unimportance .

		But in the whole world no one discusses the question who wrote Hamlet and
Lear	PERSON	and the Sonnets , which con - cerns mankind . ''

		Thereafter , we hear no more of the problem or of
Delia Bacon	PERSON	.

		But it is in the eight-page record in the Journals concerning the choice of a profes - sion -LRB- vol .

		I. , pages 360-67 -RRB- that we come most directly in contact with
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's limita - tions .

		He decides against the law because it '' demands a good deal of personal address , an impregnable confidence in one 's own powers , upon all occasions expected and un - expected , and a logical mode of thinking and speaking which I do not possess , and may not reasonably hope to obtain . ''

		Medicine is rejected for equally valid reasons .

		He de - cides at last in favor of the ministry .

		But he has his doubts , on account of '' want of suffi - cient bottom '' in his nature .

		However , he concludes : '' I judge that if I devote my nights and days in form , to the service of God and the War against Sin , I shall soon be pre - pared to do the same in substance . ''

		The '' bottom '' he seeks is the settled mind from which flows the perfect will .

		And so he regards the ministry as a starting-point , a refuge for self-examination , experiment , and decision .

		Or , to use his own words : `` My trust is that my profession shall be my regen - eration of mind , manners , inward and out - ward estate ; or rather my starting-point , for I have hoped to put on eloquence as a robe , and by goodness and zeal and the awfulness of Virtue to press and prevail over the false judgments , the rebel passions and corrupt habits of men . ''

		In his quotations from the record of this period , Professor
Firkins	PERSON	does not use any of the above material , adopting Mr.
Cabot	PERSON	's abridgment ; and of the remainder of the record he says : '' The pages that follow con - tain much of interest , in particular the char - acteristic lament for the want of what he calls bottom , that is , of constitution or native self - command . ''

		He adds that
Emerson	PERSON	's friends were concerned because of his `` defect of physical rather than moral bottom . ''

		We sub - mit that the physical defect was due to the intellectual and spiritual hunger which he could not satisfy .

		This hunger created a state of doubt , of unsettled mind , that undermined his health .

		And from the quotations we have given , it may be seen that while
Emerson	PERSON	had a clear idea of his limitations and a high sense of honor , no profession appealed to him unre - lieved of doubts .

		We are inclined to believe that the ministry was sub-consciously ac - cepted more as a temporary refuge for the future essayist than as the starting-point of a new religion or philosophy , neither of which he can be said to have established .

		He never did strike bottom in his intellectual and spir - itual life .

		Emerson was a great thinker , but only an experimental one .

		It would be difficult to find another who believed in the intuitions to the extent that he did .

		In stating his atti - tude towards Government , Professor
Firkins	PERSON	aptly styles him '' a peaceful and moral anar - chist . ''

		The anarchist is peaceful because he deals with social life as an abstract phenome - non .

		The human
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	is difficult to find .

		But the human quality crops out in the crises .

		We have cited material which suggests this quality , and which Professor
Firkins	PERSON	has either treated inadequately or ignored alto - gether .

		The Journals are also rich in other material that our critic has not used .

		Ingen - ious and stimulating as is his study of the well-known works , there is still room for a new estimate of the man based upon Emer - son 's self-revelations in the Journals .

		SLAVE-HOLDING IXDIANS ix THE CIVIL WAR .

		* That the Indian had a part in the Civil War most of us know , because we remember that
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	had an Indian on his staff and that
Albert Pike	PERSON	's Indians fought in the battle of
Pea Ridge	LOCATION	.

		This , however , is very nearly the sum of our information .

		But now
Miss Abel	ORGANIZATION	, in her work on the slave-holding Indians , promises to open up an altogether neglected field of Civil War history , and to prove the importance of the civilized Indian natives as a factor in diplomacy and war .

		The projected series of three volumes will deal , we are told , with the `` slave-holding Indians as secessionists , as participants in the Civil War , and as victims under Reconstruc - tion . ''

		The first volume , now published , shows the position of the Indians in 1860-61 as slave-holders and
Southern	ORGANIZATION	sympathizers , as neglected by the North but valued by the * THE AMERICAN INDIAN AS SLAVE HOLDER AND SECESSION - IST .

		An Omitted Chapter in the
Diplomatic History of the Southern Confederacy	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Annie Heloise Abel	PERSON	, Ph.D. .

		Vol - ume I. With portraits .

		Cleveland :
Arthur H. Clark Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 217 South , as secessionists and allies by treaty of the Confederacy .

		Throughout this volume Dr.
Abel	PERSON	emphasizes the economic and mili - tary importance of the Indian country to the
Confederacy	LOCATION	, and shows that much of the Southern diplomatic and military activity centred about the great Indian tribes .

		The political and social conditions existing in the Indian Territory for some years pre - ceding the outbreak of the Civil War are here for the first time adequately portrayed .

		Of special interest is the account of the division of the great Indian tribes -LRB- Cherokees ,
Choc	LOCATION	- taws , Seminoles , and others -RRB- into a ruling class of half breeds , wealthy , educated , slave-holders , and
Southern	ORGANIZATION	sympathizers , r and a larger , poorer , and less influential class of pure bloods who were non-slave-holders and inclined to be abolitionists .

		Other internal dissensions dated in origin back to the evil days of the removal from the eastern South .

		There was intense rivalry between
Northern and Southern	ORGANIZATION	church organizations and church-conducted schools , and there were dif - ferences between the '' Old Settlers '' who came before the forced removal and those who came later .

		Slavery everywhere existed , and the fugitive slave law was in operation .

		Nearly all of the Indian agents were natives of
Arkansas	LOCATION	and
Texas	LOCATION	, and used their influ - ence to keep the Indian Territory in sympathy with
Southern	ORGANIZATION	life and thought .

		The influences which finally caused the Indian leaders to cast their lot with the South were varied and sometimes contradictory .

		The Indians charged the
Washington	LOCATION	govern - ment with responsibility for the removal pol - icy of the 30 's ; they feared the
Douglas	PERSON	policy of opening the western lands to white settle - ment , and the proposed removal of
North	LOCATION	- western Indians to Indian Territory ; the Indian slave-holders were alarmed by the abolition movement , and resented the refusal of the
Washington	LOCATION	government to establish Federal courts and a postal system in the Indian country .

		When the crisis came in
1861	DATE	, the Lincoln administration neglected the Indians , offered them no protection , and even stopped payment on their funds ; while the South , alive to the importance of the Indian Territory as a part of the military frontier , set all its influence to work , and convinced the leaders that their interests lay with the Con - federacy .


Texas	LOCATION	and
Arkansas	LOCATION	were espe - cially interested in the attitude of the Indians , and Miss Abel thinks that the secession of
Arkansas	LOCATION	was conditioned upon the secession of Indian Territory .

		The Confederate gov - ernment , fully appreciating the value of the Indian country with its 75.000 people , very early organized an
Indian Bureau	ORGANIZATION	, with
David Hubbard	PERSON	of
Alabama	LOCATION	as Commissioner and
Albert Pike	PERSON	of
Arkansas	LOCATION	-LRB- formerly of
Massa	LOCATION	- chusetts -RRB- as a sort of diplomatic agent .

		The Indians were also assured of the safety of the interest-bearing trust funds which were held by the
Union	ORGANIZATION	government , but which were in - vested mainly in
Southern	LOCATION	state bonds .

		During
1861	DATE	the activities of Indian Com - missioner
Hubbard	PERSON	were of little importance ; but
Albert Pike	PERSON	negotiated a series of remark - able treaties by which the Indians came under the protection of the Confederate States and received a definite recognition of their rights .

		The `` civilized nations '' the Cherokees , Creeks , Choctaws and Chickasaws , and Semi - noles were treated as protected states with political , civil , and territorial rights , and were offered the prospect of ultimate statehood .

		The less advanced Osages ,
Senecas	LOCATION	,
Shawnees	ORGANIZATION	, and Quapaws secured somewhat less favorable treatment , and the `` wild '' Indians the Wichitas and the Comanches merely agreed to transfer their allegiance from the
United States	LOCATION	to the Confederate States .

		All of the treaties secured the land rights of the Indians and their trust funds , gave to them courts of their own and a status in
Confed	LOCATION	- erate and state courts , and to a great extent granted freedom of trade and travel .

		By these treaties the Indians gained , Miss Abel says , all that they had been contending for during the nineteenth century .

		When the treaties were made , the Confed - eracy was in the ascendant , especially in the
Southwest	LOCATION	, and the Indian opposition to the Confederate alliance was slight .

		For a time , the Cherokees , under the leadership of the venerable
John Ross	PERSON	, wished , like
Kentucky	LOCATION	, to remain neutral , but driven by circum - stances soon came into the
Confederacy	LOCATION	.

		The rivalries of
John Ross	PERSON	and
Stand Watie	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- later a Confederate general -RRB- and of other factional leaders played into the hands of the Confed - erates .

		The author is in sympathy with
John Ross	PERSON	's views , but gives credit to the liberal policy of the Confederacy and the '' fair mind - edness '' of
Pike	LOCATION	.

		The results of the treaties were seen at once .

		Indian troops were enrolled , and the Indian Territory organized into a
Military Department	ORGANIZATION	under
Albert Pike	PERSON	, now a general .

		But causes of dissension existed from the be - ginning :
Pike	PERSON	and most of the Indian leaders wanted the Indian troops kept in the
Terri	LOCATION	- tory for home defense , while Van
Dorn	PERSON	and other Confederate generals wanted them merged into the Confederate army ; further , it was soon found that some of the Confed - erate Indian troops objected to fighting 218 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	against the
Union Indians	ORGANIZATION	.

		But during
1861	DATE	and
1862	DATE	the Confederacy reaped valuable benefits from its well considered Indian pol - icy .

		It is announced that the second volume of the series will be given to a discussion of the part played by the Indians in the war , and to an explanation of the causes which led to the loss of the Indian support to the
Confederacy	LOCATION	.

		The materials which
Miss Abel	ORGANIZATION	has drawn upon for this work are mainly the manuscript sources , hitherto unused , in the
United States Indian Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is carefully anno - tated , but is too heavily documented the work being at the same time a narrative and a source book .

		This fault , however , the stu - dent of history will regard with lenience .

		At times the narrative is unnecessarily discursive , the chapters are too long , and the plan of the work involves too much repetition .

		But these faults are insignificant when one considers the essential value and originality of the un - dertaking .


WALTER L. FLEMING	PERSON	.

		EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CRITICAL , ESSAYS .

		* In the present imbroglio of impressionism , which is threatening the very existence of criticism as a genre , some of us believe that we can find anchorage only by a recovery and reinterpretation of a more humanistic view of life .

		Having recognized with a more clear - eyed tolerance the standards of seventeenth century classicism , against which
Diderot	ORGANIZATION	and
Rousseau	PERSON	so frantically and successfully pro- tested , we need to scrutinize with particular thoroughness the development of eighteenth century criticism , using the word criticism in its broadest sense .

		We are just beginning to realize that beneath the surface of all the ordi - nary generalizations about the eighteenth century in
England	LOCATION	there lies an important body of forgotten material , the significance of which we have missed .

		This we can no longer ignore if we are to understand the movement which began more than a century and a half ago and which colors our whole thought to - day .

		To such study , Dr.
Durham	PERSON	's '' Critical Essays of the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	'' comes as a timely and valuable aid .

		Unfortunately , the editor has been able to give us only the promise of the material from
1725	DATE	on .

		We wish that he might have followed the admira - ble example of Dr.
Spingarn	PERSON	in the three vol - umes of '' Critical Essays of the Seventeenth Century '' and of Mr.
Gregory Smith	PERSON	in the two volumes of '' Elizabethan Critical Essays , '' * CRITICAL ESSAYS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY , 1700-1725 .

		Edited , with Introduction and Notes , by
Willard Higley Dur	PERSON	- ham , Ph.D. .

		New Haven :
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		and given us the century complete .

		As it is , the promised volumes will doubtless include representative essays of the '' original genius '' group , which we believe are of great signifi - cance and which up to the present time are almost entirely unknown .

		Students will be disappointed still further in
Dr. Durham	LOCATION	's scanty Introduction .

		They will wonder that he has failed in this respect , also , to emulate his distinguished predeces - sors .

		It is true that he forestalls objection on this score by modestly disclaiming any attempt to interpret the period with any completeness .

		Instead he contents himself with a few gen - eral remarks about each writer represented , dismissing the need for further enlightenment with the declaration that '' the one thing need - ful is that the student shall actually read what was written . ''

		Apparently , however , Dr.
Spingarn	PERSON	and Mr.
Gregory Smith	PERSON	believe that the student should be given at the same time as complete orientation as possible .

		In a field in which many scholars have gone astray , may we not plead for as much light as may be vouchsafed us ?

		And is it necessary , we almost hesitate to ask , in these days of Com - parative Literature , that we .

		demand some recognition of international influences ?

		For all we can gather from the Introduction , we might suppose English criticism a completely isolated phenomenon ; whereas we need only to glance at Dr.
Spingarn	PERSON	's Introduction to realize anew that it has been singularly deriva - tive .

		In spite of these shortcomings , however , we may credit Dr.
Durham	LOCATION	with correct analyses so far as he goes .

		In a general way his dis - tinctions between the criticism of his period and that of the
Restoration are Valuable	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nevertheless , he says : '' If we are to escape from this position into one from which we may estimate the period more justly , compre - hend it more accurately , we shall not do so by means of new generalizations .

		Some very accurate generalizations about this period have already been made without much ap - parent effect . ''

		Yet Dr.
Durham	LOCATION	implies throughout the Introduction that we are in great need of a revaluation of the period .

		His first two pages show quite correctly that in our view of the `` Augustan Age '' we have been blind , hasty , and subservient to the judgment of the nineteenth century .

		It would seem , therefore , that we do need `` new generaliza - tions '' based , of course , on such documents as the author places before us .

		We should , moreover , like to have at least a foot-note to tell where these `` very accurate generaliza - tions '' may be found . ''

		From even so cursory and superficial an examination , '' he concludes
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 219 that `` none -LSB- of these critics -RSB- can be neatly pigeonholed as a classicist or a romanticist or a rationalist or an ` ist ' of any sort ... To group them is a help to memory , but a hin - drance to accuracy . ''

		We do need to be cau - tious ; but we need not evade the problem , as Dr.
Durham	LOCATION	seems to do here , by refusing , except in the most meagre way , to character - ize at all .

		May we not charge him with a too '' cursory and superficial examination '' ?

		As for the actual selection of essays , we must grant Dr.
Durham	LOCATION	the successful per - formance of a very perplexing task .

		Some will object to devoting one-third of the entire space to
Dennis	PERSON	, but probably we must submit to this as a part of the recent rehabilitation of that irate and unfortunate critic .

		Some , too , will maintain quite logically that if Pope 's Essay on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is omitted because of its accessibility in
Nichol Smith	ORGANIZATION	's collection , there is no need to include
Addison	PERSON	and
Steele	PERSON	, two men who are always with us .

		Only one omis - sion seems noteworthy , and that is Bysshe 's `` Art of Poetry , '' along with some indication , at least , of
Bysshe	ORGANIZATION	's most interesting collec - tion of the best extracts from English poetry .

		Surely if Welstead finds a place , Bysshe should not be ignored .

		At the end of his vol - ume Dr.
Durham	PERSON	has brought together a decidedly valuable bibliography .

		Here again only one omission is inexplicable : we look in vain for the highly significant works of
St. Evremond	ORGANIZATION	published in English in
1700	DATE	and
1705	DATE	.

		The text is reproduced from original edi - tions with scholarly care , and is supplemented by accurate and serviceable notes .

		Thor - oughly attractive in binding and typography , the volume is all in all invaluable to students of eighteenth century literature and of criti - cism in general .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* '' The Freelands , '' by Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	, is , as the name of the author almost inevitably implies , more of a humanitarian plea than a novel , or , at least , it is a novel so charged with a humanitarian message as to obscure its char - acter as mere fiction .

Matthew Arnold	PERSON	called a hankering after his deceased wife 's sister .

		Now the Mallorings are good churchmen , and have decided views upon this subject .

		They notify Tryst that should he persist in his matrimonial inten - tion , he can not continue to be housed upon their estate .

		When he remains stubborn , he is evicted , in consequence whereof he revenges himself by burning his landlord 's hayricks .

		Is crime to be justified under such circumstances , and go unpunished ?

		The au - thor would not say so outright , but what he does urge is that the conditions are intolerable which make such a crime possible .

		In other words , it is the land system which is to blame , the system which gives the landlord this power over the private lives of his tenants .

		We admit that such interference is injudi - cious , and even to be condemned in principle ; but , on the other hand , it is clearly a case of conscience with the landlord , to say nothing of legal rights .

		If such a thing as private ownership in land is admitted , the right of the owner to use it as he pleases is logically implied .

		So that Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	is in reality attacking the right of landed property , and if one believes in that right at all , one can not be much stirred by this indirect assault upon it , which seems to us to be lacking in candor .

		We are in the heartiest sympathy with Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	in his detestation of people who seek to regulate the private affairs of other people , but the mischief that is dorie by such efforts is much more chargeable to irresponsi - ble legislatures and municipal councils and commissions and boards than to the owners of landed or other property .

		While the lat - ter have at least a sound legal justification for their intolerance , the former have only their whims and petty prejudices ; and the 220 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	curtailments of liberty which their actions impose excite our indignation far more deeply than do any restrictions imposed by the own - ers of property upon those with whom they contract to make productive use of it .

		So it seems to us that Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's lesson might have been made much more effective By - the choice of a less dubious basis .

		But it is , of course , effective , even with this handi - cap .

		The author has never made better use of his extraordinary gift of feeling , of his keen rapier of social satire , and of his beauti - ful style .

		His real power is in his style rather than in his logical process , and , for our part , we attach less importance to all his spe - cial pleading and all the calculated ingenuity of his plot than we do to the single page -LRB- 261 -RRB- in which , forgetting his thesis , he unfolds for us the pageant of the seasons in words which almost persuade us to admit that prose may sometimes be poetry .

		Mr.
`` W. Somerset Maugham	PERSON	, a successful playwright , has turned his activities in the direction of fiction-writing , the result being '' Of Human Bondage , '' an immensely lengthy work of the biographical type , setting forth the story of a young man 's life from child - hood to the age of thirty or thereabouts .

		The following extract will show why it takes six hundred and fifty compact pages to accom - plish this setting forth : '' When
Phillip	PERSON	arrived there was some diffi - culty in deciding on which evening he should have his bath .

		It was never easy to get plenty of hot water , since the kitchen boiler did not work , and it was impossible for two persons to have a bath on the same day .

		The only man who had a bath - room in
Blackstable	LOCATION	was Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	, and it was thought ostentatious of him .


Mary Ann	PERSON	had her bath in the kitchen on
Monday	DATE
night	TIME	, because she liked to begin the week clean .

		Uncle
William	PERSON	could not have his on
Saturday	DATE	, because he had a heavy day before him , and he was always a little tired after a bath , so he had it on
Friday	DATE	.

		Mrs.
Carey	PERSON	had hers on
Thursday	DATE	for the same reason .

		It looked as though
Saturday	DATE	were naturally indi - cated for
Phillip	PERSON	, but
Mary Ann	PERSON	said she could n't keep the fire up on
Saturday	DATE
night	TIME	, and with all the cooking on
Sunday	DATE	, having to make pastry and she did n't know what all , she did n't feel up to giving the boy his bath on
Saturday	DATE
night	TIME	: and it was quite clear that he could not bath himself . ''

		The upshot of all this complication was that
Mary Ann	PERSON	relented , and grudgingly agreed to
Saturday	DATE
night	TIME	.

		Even this description leaves
Tuesday	DATE	and
Wednesday	DATE	unaccounted for , which we rather resent , since we would like to be told all about it .

		It is obvious that a writer who works with this method of de - tailed photographic realism can '' go far , '' and the story runs to nearly three hundred thou - sand words .

		We began it in
Chicago	LOCATION	, took it upon an ocean voyage , and it was still with us upon our return .

		Nor did it prove lacking in sustained interest .

		When a novelist thus sets out to chronicle everything about his hero 's life , he can hardly fail to leave us with the feeling of intimate acquaintance .

		But he can easily miss , as Mr.
Maugham	PERSON	does , the broad effects and the large issues of a human characterization .

		The only thing of this sort that we get from '' Of Human Bondage '' is a most depressing impression of the futility of life , an impression similar to that produced by `` The Old Wives ' Tale '' of Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	.

		Our hero 's life is not romantic .

		When he gets out of school , he tries accoun - tancy and fails .

		Then he tries art in the
Paris	LOCATION	schools , and fails again .

		Then he tries medicine , barely scrapes through to a diploma , and is in sight of marriage and a country practice when the book of his life is closed for us .

		Before this consummation , he has en - tanglements with various women , including a long and enslaving infatuation for a girl of repellent vulgarity a waitress in a cheap restaurant who graduates into the life of the streets .

		She , too , is an amazingly real per - son , as are many others whom we encounter in this narrative , which may perhaps best be described as an album of unretouched photo - graphs .

		The book is far from being , in the publishers ' phrase , '' compellingly great , '' but , allowing once for all its inartistic method , it is at least a noteworthy piece of creative composition .

		Publishers ' advertisements of their works are usually to be taken with several grains of salt , but in the case of Mr.
William Hew	PERSON	- lett 's `` A Child at the Window , '' we may allow their statement that it is `` a story vivid and startling in its realism , and absorbing in its human and emotional quality . ''

		These are banal phrases , and often absurdly misapplied , but in the present instance they do the book exact justice .

		It is all of this , holding the attention close , and being presented in a fin - ished style that is grateful in these days of slipshod fiction-writing .

		It is concerned with the emotional career of
Una Field	ORGANIZATION	, the daugh - ter of an English country clergyman , a vain and self-willed girl with a talent for music , who appeals to us by her sheer femininity , and does not lose her hold upon our sympa - thies either through her obvious faults , or through the misstep that wrecks her life al - most beyond recovery .

		Taken in charge by her wealthy godmother , she is sent to a girls ' private school , and then brought to Lon - don for music lessons and society .

		She gets mixed up with a set of men and women who chatter about art and the rights of the soul
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 221 in accordance with the most '' advanced '' ideas , and is so captivated by one of the male rhetoricians of this circle , that she runs away with him , and lives for a time in
Italy	LOCATION	and
Egypt	LOCATION	in defiance of all the conventions .

		When the rupture comes , it is not accom - panied by any conviction of sin on her part , but merely results from the discovery that her lover is an egotistic sensualist , whose nature demands a greater variety of emo - tional life than one woman can offer him .

		Since Una is an idealist even in her errancy , she leaves him , returns to
England	LOCATION	, and has a very hard time trying to support herself .

		Under the guidance of an old school friehd , she experiments with la vie des coulisses , but is repelled by its sordid vulgarity .

		After skating over much very thin ice , she takes refuge in the arms of a curate who has been her dog-like follower since childhood .

		But even in this haven she becomes obsessed by an infatuation for one of her husband 's fellow-clergymen , who cultivates asceticism upon a basis of sensuality , and she all but succumbs to the temptation .

		On the whole , we can not approve of
Una	ORGANIZATION	, although we are charmed by her , and can not deny the fact that there is an element of specious immorality in the author 's portrayal of her character .

		The old-fashioned flavor characteristic of '' The
House of Merrilees	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Archibald Marshall	PERSON	, will not be the least of its com - mendations to the judicious .

		That the story will prove popular by virtue of this quality we are far from sure , for the sophisticated modern taste demands '' smartness , '' and a staccato-like emphasis of `` points , '' and a large field for inference or guesswork , and a realism which knows not reticence .

		These and other popularly desiderated qualities are conspicuously missing from the present ex - ample of the old plodding school of fiction .

		There is a mystery , but it is really cleared up , without leaving any loose ends to puzzle us at the close .

		There are no dallyings with vice , and no attempts to undermine the ethical bases of society .

		And there is a homely sim - plicity about the narrative which offers a welcome relief from the '' cleverness '' and the super-subtle psychologizing of so many of our young writers .

		The material of the story is as old-fashioned as its manner .

		There is an aristocratic recluse , there is the mystery of the disappearance of his body and of the immense treasure he is known to have left at his death , and there is the romance of his reputed heir , and the final identification of the son who at last comes into the inheritance .

		The story is nowhere very exciting , but it is everywhere steadily and increasingly inter - esting , whieh should be enough for any reader who is not hopelessly hypnotized by the spe - cious devices of the modernist .

		NOTES ONJHEW NOVELS .

		Two new historical novels from the pen of Miss
Marjorie Bowen	PERSON	deal with peoples and epochs in abrupt contrast , yet with equal success . ''

		The Carnival of
Florence	LOCATION	'' concerns itself with
Savo	PERSON	- narola and the sons of Lorenzo the Magnificent , and is shot through with a vivid love story or two .

		It is notable in that it gives no unrestrained praise to the fanatic preacher who sought to dominate
Florence	LOCATION	, and even more so in the fine common sense with which it depicts the two chief romantic characters .

		The other story , '' Prince and Heretic , '' has for its protagonist the
William of Orange	ORGANIZATION	who founded the gallant little kingdom of the Nether - lands , and it occupies itself with the religious wars which our own age has lived to see completely superseded by wars of nationality .

		The subordi - nated love story is here again presented in quiet relief to the troublous times , though it remains unrequited at the close .

		Miss
Bowen	PERSON	's methods are thorough , and her assimilation of her material leaves little to be desired .

		-LRB- Button . -RRB-


Cape Cod	LOCATION	, that ancient home of persons whose angles have not been worn smooth by too much contact with their fellows , is the scene of Mrs.
Sarah Ware Bassett	PERSON	's '' The Taming of Zenas Henry '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The protagonist is a queer fish , an old bachelor who succumbs to some comfortable lure in his neighbor ,
Abbie Howlands	PERSON	, but not in the least to her physical attractiveness .

		They marry , and three old salts descend upon their sim - ple menage .

		After much tribulation , these other queer fish succeed in justifying their existence , and in the process the reader surmises that
Zenas	PERSON	and his wife learn to love one another .

		The book is amusing , and at times touching ; but it hardly makes an almost impossible situation plausible .

		A more than ordinarily shrewd study of femi - nine character has been made by Mrs.
David G. Ritchie	PERSON	in `` Two Sinners '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , a novel of a circumscribed section of English life .

		The hero - ine engages herself to a man who in character mingles a certain coarseness with a rather full comprehension of music and art .

		Her pretty sis - ter 's betrothal shortly after to a man more nearly to her liking confuses her ideas , and her own engagement is broken .

		It takes tragedy to open her eyes to the worth of the man she has rejected .

		Incidentally , the book contains a pen portrait of a disagreeable pet dog , which will commend itself to all who have suffered from that variety of beast .

		The sociological interest of Mr.
Howard Vin - cent O'Brien	PERSON	's first novel persists in his second , in the title of which newspaper men , telegraph opera - tors , and printers will recognize a familiar word `` Thirty '' -LRB- Bodd ,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- The subject it deals with is the old one of a daily journal which seeks to tell the truth in its news columns , and fails 222 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	owing to the imperfections of human nature .

		That tragedy should come in the wake of the experiment is made reasonable , though it wrecks the romance of the leading characters .

		The book is sincere , though rather hard on the rich and kind to the poor , and it represents a distinct advance upon its predecessor . ''

		Mickey has the best of three or four boys con - cealed in his lean person '' says Mrs.
Gene Strat	PERSON	- ton-Porter of the titular character in her ''
Michael O'Halloran	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mickey is , in other words , a super-boy .

		The young lady of the tale is likewise a super-young-lady .

		The multimillionairess is a perfectly dreadful person until reformed by the young lady and so on .

		The dialogue of the book is largely in a new lan - guage super-persons must speak super-language , of course .

		Dealing entirely in hyperbole , with the ill-behaved persons rich and the well-behaved poor , the book seems destined to a wide popularity .

		As accurate as a daguerreotype , which it re - sembles in period as in other respects , Mrs.
Amelia E. Barr	PERSON	's '' The Measure of a Man '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- is an interesting survival of Victorian manners and habits of thought and writing , with a dash of preaching against the limitation of the size of families which would make the good people of that era gasp .

		Not half enough is made of the self - sacrifice of the operatives in the British cotton mills during the war between the States , which ought to have been made a lesson to many Amer - icans in the present war for the freedom of nations , as that was for freedom from chattel slavery .

		Dividing his attention between drama and fic - tion , Mr.
St. John G. Ervine	PERSON	seems to acquire skill from his dual activities .

		`` Alice and a Family '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is written with a secure sense of dramatic values , and with a great deal of dialogue rather dramatic than literary in its character .

		It tells of a boy and girl in the humblest walks of English life , and the diplomatic manner in which Alice takes up the bereaved family of the young fellow and knits its tangled ends with those of her mother and herself , until the unhappy fates are completely propitiated .

		The book abounds with the truest humor , often near to tears .

		Mr.
E. Phillips Oppenheim	PERSON	is an expert in melodrama , and his latest story , '' The Way of These Women '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is fully melodramatic .

		It opens with the scene set for the murder of a British marquis , and the heroine is so strongly suspected of the crime that she loses her chance to wed an English gentleman who writes plays in which she acts .

		A well bred woman with the heart of an adventuress manages to marry him instead .

		Well contrived , without pretension , inter - estingly written according to an ascertained formula , and filled with suspense until the end , the book is bound to amuse its readers .

		The redoubtable Fu-Manchu does not appear in Mr.
Sax Rohmer	PERSON	's latest collection of weird ad - ventures , `` The Yellow Claw '' -LRB-
McBride	ORGANIZATION	,
Nast & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , but his racial and spiritual twin , one Dr.
King	PERSON	, seems to be the moving force throughout the book , though he does not once disclose him - self or his identity .

		Opium smoking is the propa - ganda of this mysterious wretch , who bends a curi - ous variety of Orientals and Europeans to his purpose .

		The story abounds in thrills and bizarre complications , but does not attain subtlety either in plot or character .

		So important a part do physicians and trained nurses play in modern life that they deserve the best that can be done for them in the realm of fiction .

		Mrs.
Mary Roberts Rinehart	PERSON	's '' K '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- has physicians for hero and rejected lover , and trained nurses for heroine and adven - turess .

		All these characters are drawn with a patient and scrupulous fidelity to the admirable qualities of two fine and ennobling professions , coupled with demonstration that a common human - ity ^ is still alive in them .

		The narrative is some - what jerky in movement , but it keeps its interest in spite of a foregone conclusion .

		In the
Baroness Orczy	PERSON	's latest story of
Hungary	LOCATION	, `` A Bride of the Plains '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- , a careful and painstaking picture is painted of rural life as a background to a complicated and tragic plot .

		The maiden heroine is affianced to a man not of her own choice , after the supposed death of her lover jiuring military service .

		He returns on the eve of her marriage , and finds the prospective bride - groom much too attentive to a young Jewish girl , who in turn is affianced to one of her own race .

		The story contrives to end happily , though the reader feels that such an ending is not fully justified .

		The lure of the sea takes a young , lad with sailors ' blood in his veins out of an office and sets him before the mast , in '' The Lady Aft '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Richard Matthews Hallet	PERSON	.

		There is a beautiful girl aboard , the captain 's daughter .

		What ensues is the con - ventional thing : the young fellow finds himself among rough men , wins his fight , and finds due favor in the young lady 's eyes at the end .

		But the manner of telling all this is decidedly uncon - ventional .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		t -LRB- -RRB- ^
Boston	LOCATION	Transcript '' during the first nine months of the war are now reprinted in a volume entitled '' Ger - many 's Point of View '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		The au - thor notes that the unrestricted publication of these articles in such a distinctly pro- Allies paper is the best refutation of the charge that the American press is delib - erately unfair to the German cause .

		This generous acknowledgment is characteristic of Dr. von
Mach	ORGANIZATION	's effort to avoid rancor and to practise the gentler arts of persuasion .

		His somewhat detailed and occasionally repe - titious defence of
Germany	LOCATION	is mildness itself compared with the diatribes which one may read -LRB- or skip -RRB- weekly in the columns of '' The Fatherland . ''

		He evidently writes from a
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 223 full heart , and the reader must respect the sincerity of his feelings .

		Unfortunately the logic of his arguments is by no means so con - vincing .

		His specialty seems to be the avoid - ance of the main points of controversy , and a meticulous hairsplitting of non-essentials .

		Typical of his method is his treatment of Sir
Edward Grey	PERSON	, whom he pursues industriously through various chapters of the book , en - deavoring to magnify petty discrepancies be - tween the English Blue Book and the French Yellow Book into something portentous , all the while ignoring the great outstanding fact that Sir
Edward	PERSON	's plan for a conference , which would have virtually assured peace , was thwarted by the brusque refusal of Ger - many and
Austria	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Ellery Stowell	PERSON	has recently affirmed that Sir
Edward Grey	PERSON	deserves the Nobel prize for his unremitting efforts toward peace during that last ' crucial week of
July , 1914	DATE	; yet the Germans con - tinue to pour the vials of their wrath upon his head , presumably because he is the one who put them in the wrong before the eyes of the world .

		Equally unsuccessful is the author 's handling of the Belgian matter , about which , indeed , a well-advised German apologist will say as little as possible .

		It should be added that the letter of Dr.
Cony	PERSON	- beare reprinted on pages 392-400 has been totally repudiated by its writer , who tried in vain to prevent its being published .

		In fair - ness , therefore , it ought not to be printed here or elsewhere .

		M ~ ~ - f first minister to
Persia	LOCATION	, Memories of an artist , author ,
Samuel G. W. Benjamin	PERSON	, who iat - died
last summer	DATE	in his seventy - eighth year , left behind him a rich sheaf of autobiographic memories which have since been published under the title , '' The Life and Adventures of a Free Lance , '' with a preface by Mrs.
Benjamin	PERSON	, who says of her variously gifted husband : `` To paint , to write , or to work solely for fortune or fame , ever stirred him to indignant protest .

		He loved things noble , free and untrammeled . ''

		A fine freedom , a refreshing independence of convention , with an earnest seeking of truth for authority rather than authority for truth , are apparent on almost every page of these varied recol - lections of life in many lands and in sundry callings .

		Born at
Argos	ORGANIZATION	, son of an American foreign missionary who saw service at
Athens	LOCATION	,
Smyrna	LOCATION	,
Trebizond	ORGANIZATION	, and
Constantinople	LOCATION	, be - fore death cut short his activities , the author was sent to this country for the completion of his schooling , and naturally enough it was to
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	, the cradle of American for - eign missions , that the father sent him .

		That was in the good old days of President
Mark Hopkins	PERSON	and `` Prof. Al , '' as his brother was nicknamed by the students , and the author 's glowing memories of Dr.
Hopkins	PERSON	form a noteworthy feature of the book .

		All that he says of him as an educator and as a moral and spiritual force is indisputable ; but , with a vivid recollection of him both at the teacher 's desk and in the pulpit and on the platform , it seems to us excessive praise , or misapplied praise , to call him '' one of the greatest orators of this or any other age . ''

		Mr.
Benjamin	PERSON	began to write for publication early in his college course , and many poems as well as numerous prose articles and books came from his pen as the years passed .

		School-teaching , an assistant librarianship at the
New York State Library	ORGANIZATION	, art studies , and the successful pursuit of painting as a profession , with diplomatic activities in the
East	LOCATION	in later life such were his interests and his labors after leaving college in
1859	DATE	, in addition to his writing and lecturing and extensive trav - elling .

		Forty-five times he crossed the ocean which he learned to paint so well , and he was always a lover of the sea and all that apper - tains thereto .

		His style as a writer is in harmony with the free and adventurous spirit of a born sailor .

		Characteristic , too , one may venture to add , are the very lapses and errors which a critical reader might feel tempted to point out in the book .

		For example , a careful revision of his work would doubtless have re - sulted in the correction of such palpable mis - takes as '' an unusual phenomena , '' '' delib - erate assemblies , '' `` Burrows '' -LRB- as the name of our famous naturalist -RRB- , `` sharp sarcasm and infective , '' and other blemishes that mar the page and distract attention .

		Two por - traits of the author , a list of his books and of his principal paintings , and a few illustra - tions of his style as a poet , are given .

		In later years Mr.
Benjamin	PERSON	made his home at
Burlington	LOCATION	,
Vermont	LOCATION	, and it is there that his last book is published , by the
Free Press Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		The discovery of a new `` Mona Lisa '' fails any longer to be surprising , since it has hap - pened so often .

		This time it occurs at Isle - worth-on-Thames ,
London	LOCATION	, and the picture is introduced as '' the
Isleworth Mona	LOCATION	`
Lisa	PERSON	. ''

		Its owner , Mr.
John R. Eyre	PERSON	, writes an inter - esting monograph on the subject , to prove that
Leonardo da Vinci	PERSON	painted two portraits of the wife of Francisco del Giocondo , that neither is a copy of the other , and that both are still in existence , the newly discovered portrait being on the whole a better picture A recently discovered ''

Louvre	LOCATION	.

		To ex - plain its long obscurity , a history of the can - vas is given .

		The evidence of its genuineness is based on quotations from contemporaneous documents , as follows : Two letters written in
1501	DATE	; a memory sketch made by
Raphael	PERSON	before
1505	DATE	, which resembles the
Isleworth	LOCATION	portrait much more closely than the portrait in the
Louvre	LOCATION	; the drafts of two letters writ - ten by Leonardo himself in
1511	DATE	; and a con - versation between
Leonardo	PERSON	and the
Cardinal of Aragon	ORGANIZATION	in
1517	DATE	, as reported by the Car - dinal 's Secretary .

		By means of full-page pho - tographs , placed side by side in the book , one may notice differences in the pose of the head and in several minor details ; also one sees that the background of the new picture remains unfinished , but is enclosed by two columns , and the size is somewhat larger .

		In the way of connoisseurship , only a little testimony is offered , but that little is quite emphatic .

		Mr.
P. G. Konody	PERSON	is quoted as say - ing : '' It -LSB- the newly discovered portrait -RSB- is of such superb quality that it more than holds its own when compared with the much - restored and repainted
Louvre	LOCATION	masterpiece ... the features are more delicate , and let it be boldly stated , far more pleasing and beautiful than the
Louvre	LOCATION	version . ''

		It is interesting to learn that the
Isleworth	LOCATION	picture is at present in this country , at the
Boston Museum of Fine Arts	ORGANIZATION	, where , in the words of the owner , it is '' in safe keeping , beyond the reach of either cannon-belching culture , the false philosophy of force , or the cardinal vir - tue of aggression . ''

		The author is managing editor of the '' Funk and
Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	of the English Lan - guage , '' and it is not surprising to discover that his book incidentally impresses upon the reader the merits of that dictionary , and that it bears the
Funk	ORGANIZATION	and Wagnalls imprint .

		After a short chapter on the origin of our language , its growth is traced from the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	period to the time of
Milton	LOCATION	; then fol - low chapters on some of the '' mutations of form and sense '' it has undergone , the alien elements it contains , the divisions into which literature falls , the function of the dictionary , the dictionary as a textbook , the function of grammar , the principles of phonetics and pro- nunciation , with remarks on reading , rules to be observed in writing for publication , indi - viduality in writing , and the corruption of speech .

		An alphabetical list of English and American writers is appended , and a twenty - page index closes the book .

		The outline sketch of English literature that fills about a third of the volume is compact and useful , though not exactly a marvel of scholarship .

		Of
Henry Howard	PERSON	,
Earl of Surrey	ORGANIZATION	, the author says that he `` wrote the .

		first sonnets ever written in English , '' and he makes no men - tion of
Wyatt	LOCATION	,
Surrey	ORGANIZATION	's senior by fourteen or fifteen years and acknowledged by him to be his master in poetry , and commonly credited with having taken the lead in importing the sonnet into our literature .

		It was a matter of course that Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	should insist on the desirability of spelling-reform , but his pages do not shock a conservative reader by any radical departures from the accepted or - thography .

		His scholarly defence of the split infinitive is to be commended .

		In a treatise so largely devoted to inculcating and illus - trating correct usage in English , it is a little startling to find the author allowing himself such questionable constructions as '' no less than thirty , '' '' equally as appropriate , '' and '' applied into . ''

		One who essays to teach clearness and conciseness as well as gram - matical correctness should not permit himself to - write such a sentence as this , descrip - tive of Sir
Thomas More	PERSON	's best-known work : '' The book is a keen satire of social and eco - nomic conditions that , judged by his other writings and his practise , show More 's politi - cal philosophy was not that of Utopia . ''

		Of the same book we read on the same page that `` the sanitation of cities is carefully pre - served . ''

		By precept , if not always by exam - ple , Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	's manual will , it is to be hoped , promote the cause of good English , both in speech and in writing .

		The completion of the
Panama	LOCATION	Triumphs of ?

		The extermination of yellow fever at
Havana	LOCATION	resulted from the discovery by Dr.
Reed	PERSON	that a particular kind of female mosquito which had bitten a person in the earlier stages of yellow fever becomes after a lapse of twelve to eighteen days thereafter a source of yellow fever to non-immune persons who are bitten by this carrier of the incubated germs of this dread disease .

		Protection of yellow fever patients from mosquitoes , and mosquito ex - termination campaigns , have rid

		The story of Dr.
Reed	PERSON	's discovery and of its application to health con - trol in
Cuba	LOCATION	and
Panama	LOCATION	is told by the ex - pert who accomplished these remarkable feats in the face of doubt and opposition , and by the agency of slowly moving governmental agencies , in Dr.
W. C. Gorgas	PERSON	's '' Sanitation in
Panama	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The story is not without incidents both humorous and in - tensely dramatic .

		It forms one of the most remarkable documents in the history of scien - tific achievements , and is an incontrovertible argument for , and demonstration of , the true nature of at least two great diseases , yellow fever and malaria .

		It gives a logical basis for the only rational attitude of sensible men towards the ever-increasing social aspects of the prevention of disease by cooperative so - cial and governmental agencies .

		The book is interesting reading by reason of its simplicity , directness , humor , and the inclusion of a bit of the romantic history of
Panama	LOCATION	in days long before

		and III. , lately published , the gen - eral purpose and scope may be recorded with - out extended comment .

		The three volumes now completed , representing one-half of the whole work , comprise
1760	DATE	pages , with
2047	DATE	illustrations .

		The second volume begins with Cabbage , and ends with
Experiment Stations and Extension Teaching	ORGANIZATION	in Horticulture .

		The third volume begins with Faba -LRB- a genus of beans -RRB- , and ends with
Kyllinga	PERSON	-LRB- a genus of sedges -RRB- .

		Each important title is presented and signed by a recognized authority upon the subject .

		To select from the hundreds of titles a few for special mention is impossible , for the important ones are numerous .

		In the two volumes before us , such plant titles as
Carnation	ORGANIZATION	,
Chrysanthemum	LOCATION	, Citrus , Corn ,
Dahlia	ORGANIZATION	, Ferns ,
Grape	LOCATION	, occupy the most space .

		But even more important to many are such general titles as Color in Flowers , Diseases , Drainage , Exhibitions , Experiment Stations ,
Fertilizers	ORGANIZATION	,
Floriculture	LOCATION	, Flower , Forcing ,
Frost	ORGANIZATION	, Fruit-growing , Horticulture -LRB- includ - ing the literature of the subject -RRB- , Irrigation , and Kitchen-garden .

		Under Island
Depen	PERSON	- dencies , a full account is given of the plants under cultivation in
Porto Rico	LOCATION	, the Ha - waiian Islands ,
Guam	LOCATION	,
Tutuila	LOCATION	, and the
Phil	LOCATION	- ippine Islands .

		The completed work will constitute a splendid storehouse of trust - worthy information for all who are interested in plants from any point of view .

		A study of * n `` The Soliloquy in German the soliloquy in Drama '' -LRB-
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	'' '' Press -RRB- , Mr.
Erwin Roessler	PERSON	has painstakingly traced the history of the solilo - quy from the mediaeval church plays to its abandonment in the realistic dramas of
Hauptmann	PERSON	and his followers .

		Although the work shows much careful reading on the part of the author , it is unfortunately written after the conventional pattern of many disserta - tions .

		The striking number of ideas frankly taken over from other writers is often but a confession of the author 's paucity of thought .

		Besides outlining the history of the soliloquy , Mr.
Roessler	PERSON	states in his Introduction that '' the investigation will attempt to throw light on the question whether the recent drama has , or has not , gained in artistic effectiveness by its gradual disuse of the soliloquy . ''

		In pre - senting his body of evidence , however , the au - thor seems to have lost sight of this purpose , which does not reappear until the conclusion .

		As a result , his contention that '' the elimina - tion of the soliloquy of thought and feeling is a loss to the drama and that their restoration will increase its artistic effectiveness , '' comes as a surprise .

		On the basis of the examples adduced , the reader still feels at liberty to believe that the disuse of the soliloquy is not only an important step in the advancement of the drama , but also a boon to the more sophisticated audience of the present day .

		It is unfortunate that the author has not com - mand of an English style that would tend to make his discussion more readable .

		The an - cient use of the soliloquy does not exceed in frequency Mr.
Roessler	PERSON	's use of the rhetorical question .

		In spite of these deficiencies , how - ever , the book may well be recommended to those in search of a summary of the subject .

		Since the first issue of his kero e : ndmX .

		``
Nathan Hale	PERSON	,
1776	DATE	, '' fourteen years ago , Professor
Henry Phelps Johnston	PERSON	has had access to consid - erable new material in the shape of original manuscripts dating back to
Hale	PERSON	's time and throwing fresh light on his heroic character and the fatal act of courage that has made him an object of increasing interest and ad - miration to posterity .

		The
Hale	PERSON	correspon - dence and other papers now number nearly 226 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	seventy separate pieces , of which sixty-four are printed , wholly or in part , in the new edition of Professor
Johnston	PERSON	's book , which is published in handsome form by the
Yale Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity Press .

		These sixty-four pieces are , as he explains , mainly letters ; ten of them , with other papers , being from
Hale	PERSON	's pen , the others from college classmates and later associates .

		Relegation of most of these documents to the appendix has made possible a more connected and smoothly flowing narrative in the body of the book .

		Accompanying the volume is a supplementary leaflet giving the lately dis - covered description of
Hale	PERSON	by his fellow officer , Lieutenant
Elisha Bostwick	PERSON	.


Illustra	ORGANIZATION	- tions show the
Hale	PERSON	homestead and monument at
South Coventry	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, the hero - martyr 's powder-horn and other personal be - longings , examples of his autograph and his father 's , and the site of his execution .

		Bibli - ography and index round out this notable memorial to one whose last words will not soon cease to stir the soul , `` I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country . ''

		- BRIEFER MENTION .

		As the editors hint in their Preface to the
1915	DATE	edition of `` The Statesman 's Year-Book '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , the difficulties confronted in the revision of the work for this present year of upheaval must have been rather staggering .

		Yet they have been bravely met , and the work seems to have suffered little in consequence .

		During the fifty -
two years	DATE	in which it has annually appeared , '' The Statesman 's Year-Book '' has made a place for itself which no other reference book has been able to encroach upon , and to praise either its plan or its execution would now be almost an impertinence .

		Of the always valuable special numbers issued from time to time by '' The International Studio '' -LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the latest two are `` The Year - Book of Decorative Art '' for
1915	DATE	, and a mono - graph on '' Old English Mansions . ''

		The first named is devoted in largest part to a review of recent developments in English domestic architec - ture , particularly small country houses and cot - tages .

		But there are also chapters on `` Architec - ture and Decoration in the
United States	LOCATION	, '' '' Wall-paper Designers and their Work , '' and '' British Decoration . ''

		As usual with the `` Studio '' publications , the illustrations -LRB- including several plates in colors -RRB- are profuse in number and irre - proachable in execution .

		The purpose of '' Old English Mansions '' is to present a collection of sixty excellent full-page reproductions of the architectural drawings of
Joseph Nash	PERSON	,
C. J. Richardson	PERSON	,
J. D. Harding	PERSON	,
Henry Shaw	PERSON	, and other early nineteenth century draughtsmen who have preserved for posterity a graphic record of many of
England	LOCATION	's storied homes .

		To the archi - tect , no less than to the lay reader of antiquarian bent , the volume should make a strong appeal .

		NOTES .

		A picture of
England	LOCATION	as presented in English literature has been completed by Mr.
Edward Thomas	PERSON	, and is soon to be published under the title , `` A Literary Pilgrim in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		Seven of

Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	under the title , '' The German Lieutenant , and Other Stories . ''

		Professor
Joseph Jastrow	PERSON	's work on '' Character and Temperament , '' which was first announced for publication several months ago , is soon to appear in Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	's '' Conduct of the Mind Series . ''

		A forthcoming addition , the first that has been made for a long time , to Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	's '' Literatures of the World '' series , is `` A History of Latin Literature , '' by Professor
Marcus Dims	PERSON	- dale , of
the University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	.

		The late Mr.
F. Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	's last novel , ''
Felix O'Day	PERSON	, '' of which he had completed the final revision of proofs just before his death , will Jbe published by
Messrs. Scribners	ORGANIZATION	on the 18th inst .

		The scenes are laid in
New York City	LOCATION	.

		The `` Memories and Anecdotes '' of Miss
Kate Sanborn	PERSON	, which Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	will publish dur - ing the autumn , will contain personal reminiscences of a host of American celebrities , from
Emerson	LOCATION	to
Mark Twain	PERSON	, and is likely to prove delightful reading .

		The fourth volume of '' Glimpses of the Cos - mos : A Mental Autobiography , '' by
Lester F. Ward	PERSON	, is announced by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		It deals with the period 1885-1893 , between the forty - fourth and fifty-second years of the distinguished author 's life .

		Two interesting interpretations of great writers , evidently the first volumes in a projected series , are announced by the
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	in Pro- fessor
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	's ''
Browning	PERSON	: How to Know Him , '' and Professor Bliss
Perry	PERSON	's '' Carlyle : How to Know Him . ''

		In her volume on '' Six French Poets , '' which the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	is soon to publish ,

Paul Fort	PERSON	.

		Two interesting contributions to the literature of the stage are announced by Messrs.
Lippincott	PERSON	in Mr.
Maurice Sand	PERSON	's '' The History of the
Harle	PERSON	- quinade '' and Mr.
Mark E. Perugini	PERSON	's '' The Art of the Ballet . ''

		The first-named work will contain a number of hand-colored illustrations .

		A single-volume edition of Mr.
Graham	PERSON	Bal - four 's '' Life of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, '' in condensed form but containing some new and inter - esting matter , is in press with Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		A series of topographical illustrations by Mr.

Thomas S. Jones	PERSON	, Jr. ; `` A Handful of Lavender , '' by
Lizette Woodworth Reese	PERSON	; and '' The Rose from the Ashes , '' by Miss
Edith M. Thomas	PERSON	.

		The quality of these three writers is a hopeful augury of the standards evidently to be maintained by the series .

		Mr.
Burton E. Stevenson	PERSON	has compiled and Mr.
Willy Pogany	PERSON	has illustrated '' The
Home Book of Verse for Young People	ORGANIZATION	, '' which endeavors to do for children the same service that Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	did for adult readers in '' The Home Book of Verse . ''

		It will be published this month by Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	.

		An addition to Napoleonic literature in the shape of a volume of '' Letters of Captain
Engelbert Lutyens	PERSON	, Orderly Officer at

Margaret Hav	PERSON	- ington , and a photogravure portrait . ''

		The Popular Science Monthly '' has been bought by the Modern Publishing Company of
New York City	LOCATION	, and consolidated with '' The World 's Advance , '' formerly '' Popular Elec - tricity . ''

		The two magazines will be merged under the title of `` The Popular Science Monthly , '' beginning with the
November	DATE	issue .

		Mr.
Walde	PERSON	- mar
Kaempffert	PERSON	, for a long time editor of the monthly , will continue in that position .

		Three critical studies of the work of famous authors will be published at once by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,

Miss Una Taylor	ORGANIZATION	offers a criticism of
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	as poet , playwright , and philosopher ; Mr.
Forrest Reid	PERSON	, in his volume on Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	, includes a biography , al - though he is more concerned with Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	as a writer than as a man .

		The first edition in English of the great Russian epic , '' The Armament of
Igor	PERSON	, '' is about to be published by the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The editor is Mr.
L. A. Magnus	PERSON	, LL.D. , who has writ - ten a general introduction and gives a revised text , with translation , full notes , genealogical tables , etc. .

		The poem , which describes a disastrous foray by
Igor Svyatoslavic	PERSON	in
1185	DATE	, forms part of the ordi - nary school course in
Russia	LOCATION	, and outside
Russia	LOCATION	is set for university courses in Slavonic ; and the English edition is intended for both the student and the general reader .

		The current quarterly `` News Notes of Califor - nia Libraries , '' a pamphlet of three hundred double-column pages , devotes thirty-nine of those pages to an annotated list of material in the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	on the subject of
California Indians	LOCATION	.

		It also contains a review of recent
California	LOCATION	legisla - tion , notably library and school legislation , and the usual brief reports from all public libraries in the
State	ORGANIZATION	, a `` Directory for Library Supplies and Other Items of General Interest , '' and reports from the
California Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, the
Board of Library Examiners	ORGANIZATION	, and the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	, with classified list of recent accessions to the latter .

		For some years past , the late Professor
Thomas R. Lounsbury	PERSON	had been engaged upon a literary biography of
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		It was not his purpose to cover the entire life of the poet , but only the most interesting part of it , ending with the pub - lication of the '' Idylls of the King . ''

		At the time of his death , Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	had reached the annus mirabilis , when '' In Memoriam '' appeared and
Tennyson	PERSON	was appointed Poet Laureate .

		These chapters , some of which were left incom - plete , have been prepared for the press by Pro- fessor Cross , and will be published in the autumn .

		A collected edition in two volumes of '' The Political Writings of
Jean Jacques Rousseau	PERSON	, '' ed - ited from the original manuscript and authentic editions , with introduction and notes , by Profes - sor
C. E. Vaughan	PERSON	, is in preparation at the Cam - bridge
University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The editor 's aim has been to collect all the political writings of
Rous	PERSON	- seau in one body and present them for the first time in the text which
Rousseau	PERSON	actually wrote , as well as to define his place in the history of political thought .

		At present the printed material is scattered over numerous volumes , various pieces which have come to light during the last sixty years having not yet been included in the collected '' Works . ''

		Some further '' Fragments '' are now added which have hitherto remained buried in the library of Neuchatel .

		These include several slight autobiographical pieces which throw a certain amount of light on the frame of mind in which the '' Confessions '' were written .

		The treatise on
Corsica	LOCATION	has hitherto been known only in a faulty text .

		The committee in charge of the Dramatic Mu - seum of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	is issuing in limited editions several series of documents dealing with the theory and the practice of the art of the theatre , reprints of inaccessible essays and ad - dresses , translations from foreign tongues , and original papers .

		These documents are furnished with introductions , and they are annotated ade - quately , but succinctly .

		The second series -LRB- to be ready for distribution in
October	DATE	-RRB- , will consist of the following four papers on acting : '' The Illusion of the
First Time in Acting	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
William Gillette	PERSON	, with an introduction by Mr.
George Arliss	PERSON	; `` Art and the Actor , '' by Constant Coquelin ; translated by
Abby Langdon Alger	PERSON	, with an introduction by Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	; '' Mrs.
Siddons	PERSON	as Lady Macbeth and
Queen Katherine	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
H. C. Fleeming Jenkin	PERSON	, with an introduc - tion by Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	; '' Reflex - ions on Acting , '' by
Talma	PERSON	, with an introduction by Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	and a review by Mr.
H. C. Fleeming Jenkin	PERSON	.

		Like the previous set of four volumes on play-making , this new series will be issued in an edition limited to 300 copies available to the public .

		228 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS .

		The classified list of books announced for autumn and winter publication , herewith pre - sented in accordance with a long-time annual custom of this journal , is as nearly complete as the exigencies of the publishing business and the necessary cooperation of the pub - lishers in supplying the needed data have permitted us to make it .

		As usual , consid - erations of space have made necessary the carrying over to our next issue of the two departments , '' School and College Text - Books '' and '' Books for the Young . ''

		Inclu - sive of these categories , the list comprises this year approximately sixteen hundred titles , representing the output of some sixty pub - lishers , surely a surprisingly good showing in view of the abnormal conditions brought about by the war .

		In the leading editorial in this issue of THE DIAL , some of the more notable and interesting features of the present announcement list are commented upon .

		288 THE GREAT VOCATION .

		Insistence on the practical in education is one of the no new things under the sun .

		`` When went there by an age , since the great flood , '' without its wiseacres of the cross-roads and the market unable to see the good in this or that study , without its self-made men to.point with pride to their own manufacture as a satisfac - tory proof that book-learning was futile , with - out its half-educated prophets to encourage the unenlightened discontent of pupil and parent ?

		Fortunately for both the intellectual and practical affairs of the world , however , educa - tional matters have never been for any length of time wholly in the control of either the wiseacres or the self-made man or the educa - tional demagogue .

		At really crucial moments , these personages have usually been inspired with the good sense , if not to leave educational policy to intellectual experts , at least them - selves to act under expert guidance .

		Society on the whole has submitted itself , in intellec - tual matters , to intellectual leadership .

		With the advance of democracy , there has been in this respect a tendency to change .

		The emphasis upon the people 's right to be edu - cated , and upon government 's duty and privi - lege to educate them , has had effects both bad and good .

		Among the good , especially in the
United States	LOCATION	, have been the dissemination of educational opportunity and the elevation of the popular level of intelligence .

		Among the bad has been the tendency toward popular control of educational ideals and educational policy .

		Government has been of the people , by the people , and for the people ; and educa - tion , too , the gift and the instrument of gov - ernment , has tended to be of the people , by the people , and for the people .

		The dissemina - tion of popular educational opportunity and the elevation of the level of popular intelli - gence have been accompanied by a restriction of expert opportunity and a lowering of the level of expert intelligence .

		Great numbers of the people are ambitious to acquire the knowl - edge so easily accessible , but only because knowledge is a useful instrument in practical affairs .

		Comparatively .

		few conceive of it as a source of growth into full stature rather than 254 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 30	DATE	an instrument .

		Fewer still are born again , into the Kingdom of the Intellectual , to realize the significance of the higher life of the mind both to the individual and to society .

		The majority principle is prevailing in educational sentiment as well as at the polls , and the great numbers are having their way .

		Among the manifestations of this popular control of ideals and policy , none is more noticeable than the recent and growing de - mand for vocational training .

		This , too , is no new thing under the sun .

		There has always been a demand for vocational training a just and necessary demand ; and the demand has usually met with some manner of response .

		Expert professional men and craftsmen pro- mote the general welfare , and it is the interest as well as the duty of society to encourage expertness in some substantial way .

		In major degree , the response is to be seen in the elabo - rate European systems of technical schools .

		In minor degree , it is to be seen in the much less extensive and effective provision of
America	LOCATION	.

		There is , nevertheless , something new in regard to vocational training .

		It is to be observed especially in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		This new thing is , not the establishment of voca - tional courses or schools , but the establishment of them at the expense of the general intellec - tual ideal .

		If the European countries are allowing the '' vocationalizing '' of gymnasium , lycee , or college , it is at most in very slight degree .


Europe	LOCATION	has met the demand for tech - nical instruction by reaching down into its pocket and equipping real technical schools , separate and efficient , preserving intact the institutions that have so long stood for the higher intellectual life .

		The
United States	LOCATION	, realizing the need , but lacking the Old `` World 's courage and enlightenment , is robbing her high schools and colleges to satisfy the popular demand for the vocational , with the result that not only is vocational training provided only in form , but that higher education is preserved only in form .

		The college of liberal arts in the university is already in great part profession - alized , and the high school is fast becoming vocationalized , in spirit if not in actual fact .

		Liberal education in the college , except as it is accidental to professional preparation , is threatened with extinction ; and liberal educa - tion in the
State	ORGANIZATION	institutions in general , both secondary and higher , is in so serious a condi - tion of discouragement that its friends are already looking for salvation to the rise of institutions unprejudiced by popular control .

		To be more concrete : we have heard a great deal of late about the high school as the '' people 's college , '' and of its duty to prepare the people 's sons and daughters for `` life . ''

		Those who are of this mind are thinking of '' life '' in vocational terms , as the earning of a livelihood in some trade , business , or profes - sion .

		If a girl wishes to be a stenographer or bookkeeper , if a boy intends to follow a clerical or mechanical calling , the public school , ac - cording to the vocational enthusiast , should prepare them to make an easy and more or less direct transition from the school room to their chosen occupations .

		Literature , music , lan - guage , algebra , history , and all studies and parts of studies which do not contribute di - rectly and immediately to this purpose , are not '' vital , '' and are to be regarded as mere accom - plishments , if not as a pure waste of the pupil 's time and the people 's money .

		This is easy logic , as is all logic based on imperfect understanding .

		The friends of lib - eral education , or general culture , or pure learning , or whatever we choose to call the education that is accused of not preparing for '' life , '' are able to see the vocational argument , but their vision does not find there the limit of its range .

		In the first place , vocational training worthy of the name in the high school is practically impossible .

		Actual count would demonstrate that the number of vocational subjects in which courses could be devised is so great that provision for school instruction in even a frac - tion of them would require an outlay in build - ings , apparatus , and teachers far greater than that more or less grudgingly furnished for the present comparatively simple programme .

		Further , with the most generous provision , some vocations considered important by many a pupil and parent would still remain unrepre - sented .

		Why the privilege of free instruction in carpentering and accounting , and not in barbering and shoemaking , plumbing and manicuring ?

		Logically and practically , com - plete satisfaction would be impossible .

		Until , therefore , the
State	ORGANIZATION	shall have secured the moral and financial support necessary to the institution of large numbers of technical courses and schools , it will have to limit its instruction to such vocations as come the near - est to being common to all the pupils and to the
State	ORGANIZATION	itself .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 255 Of the absolutely universal vocation , there is one example , and only one .

		This is the GREAT VOCATION the Vocation Of ENLIGHT - ENED CITIZENSHIP .

		The phrase may not be in common use , and the idea may not be clearly formulated in the citizen mind , but the educational policy of
the State	ORGANIZATION	has nevertheless always been based on the principle .

		Nine-tenths of what is taught in both grades and high school is not really necessary to the earning of a livelihood .

		The great mass of instruction in the college of liberal arts has always been of the same sort .

		When
the State	ORGANIZATION	has felt itself able , it has estab - lished technical and professional schools for training in such vocations as it regarded most important to itself the highly specialized instruments of the general welfare : law , medi - cine , teaching , agriculture , engineering .

		Yet it has never until recently substituted the narrowly vocational for the broad and funda - mental .

		It has only added it .

		It has recog - nized that the non-vocational is the great foundation that the best lawyers , the best physicians , the best teachers , the best agricul - turists , the best engineers , are those whose first vocation is enlightened citizenship .

		It would have done the same by religion , but for the conviction that other means were better .

		The training that leads to enlightened citi - zenship is not vocational in the narrow sense .

		What the vocational enthusiast is mainly and frankly thinking of , the preparation of the pupil for the earning of a living , is more or less narrow , selfish , and uncivic .

		It is in spirit an insistence upon the rights of the individual at the expense of
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The training for the vocation of enlightened citizenship , on the contrary , is in spirit an insistence on the rights of
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Under ideal conditions , too , the pleasure of the individual , despite the time cost of liberal education , coincides with the pleasure of the
State	ORGANIZATION	; though under actual conditions no small number of pupils , anxious for quick and showy returns and a speedy entrance upon `` life , '' regard themselves as victims to a perverse educational requirement if they are compelled to study anything which in their judgment is not `` vital . ''

		The immediate design of liberal education is not skill of hand or knowledge of technical detail , but the cultivation of mental power , the broadening of vision , the deepening of per - ception , the refinement of intellectual and spiritual temper .

		Its ultimate end is the pro- duction of the ideal citizen and of the ideal State .

		Compared with the vocation of enlightened citizenship , all other vocations are special .

		They are not separate from it , however .

		Un - less founded upon it , they are comparatively unprofitable , whether to the individual or the community , and may indeed easily become a source of harm .

		Enlightened citizenship is the broad and firm foundation , the special vocation is the superstructure .

		Narrow and infirm foundations will not support strong and useful buildings .

		We have too many type - writers and printers and proof-readers who can not be trusted with spelling , punctuation , and composition , to say nothing of other mat - ters involving ordinary intellectual expert - ness .

		We have too many reporters , editors , magazine contributors , and authors of books , who write ignorant and slipshod English , and think as loosely and unprofitably as they write .

		The press goes a long way toward undoing the work of the school .

		We have too many teach - ers of thin and narrow quality ; too many preachers whose intellectual deficiencies are such as to neutralize the effect of earnest and self-sacrificing character ; too many lawyers who took the short cut to a professional career , and are uncultivated and slovenly in thought , speech , and intellectual habit ; too many phy - sicians whose growth is stunted because their intellectual roots were not set deep enough .

		In all these and other professions , the fulness of power that marks the master-personality has not been attainable because of deficiency in general cultivation .

		The immediate object of the individual has been realized , but at the expense of the potential total ; the good enough has been the enemy of the best .

		The same is true of less professional walks of life .

		There are too many culture club peo - ple and platform lecturers with superficial and catchy accomplishments instead of real depth ; too many playwrights , actors , managers , and theatre-goers who are not only untouched by the great dramatic ideals of past and present , but are barbarians , and worse than barbarians , in taste .

		There are too many of the rich who neither possess nor know the value ` of intel - lectual and spiritual wealth , and are unable even to recognize it when it is placed before them .

		There are too many of the leisured who are unacquainted with the most gratifying and profitable means of pleasure , as well as the most inoffensive and noble .

		We have too many 256 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 30	DATE	voters who know only how to mark a ballot , who can not estimate the worth of men and measures , who can not think without the giant head-line and the screaming editorial .

		We have too many social and political reformers whose chief qualification is a `` heart in the right place , '' who read loosely , think loosely , write loosely , and legislate as if the making of law were an invention of the day before yesterday .

		In every one of these cases , and in all other cases where , through ignorance , haste , or false ideas of economy , the vocation of enlightened citizenship has been left out of account , the individual suffers much , but the
State	ORGANIZATION	suffers more .

		Whether the citizen does the best of which he is capable , or the second best , is a matter of concern not only to himself , but to the community and the nation .

		Whether from the individual point of view or the social , enlightened citizenship is the first and the greatest vocation .

		The vocation of enlightened citizenship does not look to the holding of a position as the prime object ; it looks rather to excellence in the holding of it .

		The ideal of the great voca - tion is not immediate success in the earning of a living , but the capacity to earn it with the greatest intelligence and the greatest measure of success .

		It looks forward to the profes - sional man or the mechanic developed to the full capacity of his powers .

		Its aim is not the exploitation .

		of talent , but the development of personal excellence and total usefulness .

		It looks ahead , not four years , but forty years .

		It looks to a substantial and enduring edifice , not a temporary and make-shift shelter .

		It does not ask , '' How much are you going to earn ? ''

		or even '' How much are you going to know ? ''

		but `` Are you going to make of your - self all that is possible ? ''

		and `` Are you go - ing to be a leader ? ''

		Its ambition is not the production of the average , but of leadership .

		Progress is only secondarily a matter of the crowd .

		The religious or civic ideals of an age or a community are not determined by the common man .

		It is the exceptional man , the reformer , the enthusiast , the personality in which the age or the community , so to speak , flowers out , that determines the ideal .

		The supreme concern of the army is its general , of the church its prophet , of the world of knowl - edge the scholar , of mechanics the inventor .

		Progress is a matter of dynamics .

		Without leadership without men who think enough more , feel enough more , see enough farther than the ordinary to give them authority there are no dynamics , and there will be no progress .

		Vocational training in the ordinary sense is , within limits , desirable and necessary ; but its place is in the technical school , not in the school of liberal arts .

		The high school is the people 's college , but not the people 's business college .

		If it is a business college at all , it is the business college of the
State	ORGANIZATION	at large , not that of the comparatively few sons and daugh - ters of the people whose first ambition is a livelihood .

		The prime business of
State	ORGANIZATION	educa - tion is a universal business , and
Big Business	ORGANIZATION	is the business of enlightened citizenship .

		Every displacement of a liberal study by a vocational study is prejudicial to the ideal interests of the commonwealth .

		Livelihoods can be trusted to take care of themselves , if we must choose ; but enlightened citizenship can not .

		GRANT SHOWERMAN .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE SIMULTANEOUS NUTRITION OF MIND AND BODY is something that is both possible and in no wise undesirable .

		Solitary feasting for feasting 's sake has ever been held in abhor - rence except by gluttons ; and even the silent and solemn intake of nutriment at the family table , three times a day , is not exactly an inspiring spectacle .

		Hence the cultivation of table-talk and the less usual but almost equally pleasant practice of having someone read aloud while the rest eat and listen an agreeable monastic custom , except that in monasteries the reading usually lacks liveli - ness and variety .

		Table-rea ` ding , as an aid and incentive to table-talk , is surely an excel - lent thing .

		Dr.
Bostwick	PERSON	, in his admirable book on `` The Making of an American 's Library , '' noticed in detail on another page , reprehends the union of eating and reading .

		He says : '' I have seen men reading books at lunch when they were actually masticating their food .

		I am sure they both read and ate badly . ''

		Not necessarily .

		If only for hygienic reasons , it is well for the eater not to occupy his mind with the act of eating , an act that needs scarcely more conscious attention than does breathing or walking .

		Why all this sol - emn formality of successive courses with their corresponding array of table implements ?

		A novel and an apple in a hammock , or a book of verses underneath the bough , with loaf of bread ancl jug of wine -LRB- or water -RRB-
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 257 some such combination approaches the ideal .

		Shelley used to read voraciously while he munched his daily bread in his study at Ox - ford , leaving a circle of crumbs around his chair .

		He was also famous for his simulta - neous walking and reading -LRB- a practice sanc - tioned by Dr.
Bostwick	PERSON	-RRB- , and for his walking and eating , often darting into a bakeshop to renew his supply of bread in the course of his walk ; and if , as is likely enough , he some - times combined the three exercises , he thereby got thrice as much out of a given portion of time as most of his fellows .

		Why should the renewal of the bodily tissues be made the occasion of a periodic solemnity of which one must stand in some awe ?

		Nature knows no such stupid artificialities .

		Shelley munching his bread while he talks with
Hogg	PERSON	or reads to himself , and
FitzGerald	PERSON	nibbling his apple while he paces the room and entertains with high discourse his guests at the table , please us more than does the scrupulous observer of the tiresome formalities of the banquet-board .

		If reading is not to be allowed with eating , why should not talking also be forbidden ?

		Articulation and mastication go not well together , but silent reading is no hindrance to deglutition .

		And so we can not side with this condemnation of simultaneous eating and reading , except where such a practice would be impolite .

		FRENCH LITERARY GENIUS AS FOOD FOR CAN - NON forms the subject of more than one lament from the land of
Racine	LOCATION	and
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	.

		M.
Paul Chavannes	PERSON	in a letter to '' The New Statesman '' runs over the names and achieve - ments of a goodly company of romancers and poets who within the last twelvemonth have given their lives for their country .

		He enu - merates , for example ,
Charles Peguy	PERSON	,
Louis Pergaud	PERSON	,
Ernest Psichari	PERSON	, Alain-Fournier ,
Pierre Gilbert	PERSON	,
Leon Bonneff	PERSON	,
Francois Lau	PERSON	- rentie .

		Robert d'Humieres , Art
Roe	PERSON	,
Emile Despax	PERSON	, du Fresnois , `` and many others '' names less familiar to us than to the French reading public , but each standing for good and promising work cut short in the morning of the worker 's life .

		Of the heroic fate of
Psichari	LOCATION	, for instance , author of the stirring ``
Appel	PERSON	des Armes , '' we read : '' He died nobly the death he asked for , at
Virton	LOCATION	, in
Belgium	LOCATION	, at the beginning of the great re - treat .

		His battery had been ordered to keep the enemy in check whilst the army was fall - ing back .

		They were expected to hold their ground for a few hours , and they did so for a whole day ; and when the last shell had been spent officer and gunners were killed on the guns they had rendered unusable . ''

		Another passage tells us that '' the ' Revue Critique des Livres et des Idees , ' which has of late years been one of the strongest of the influences which have shaped the intellectual youth , had on the outbreak of war thirty members of its editorial staff called to the colors ; of these , according to the ' Humanite , ' eleven have been killed and eight wounded , whilst two are missing in all , twenty-one out of thirty and this was before the last fights in
Artois	PERSON	and the Argonne ! ''

		Rather expensive
Kanonen	PERSON	futter , in very truth !

		UNPOPULAR PERIODICALS , those that make necessarily a restricted appeal and are forced to content themselves w r ith the consciousness of good work done in a worthy cause , are more numerous than is commonly suspected .

		There must be in this country alone several hundreds of struggling periodical publica - tions , including the proceedings and trans - actions of learned societies and the journals issued in behalf of various worthy causes of a philanthropic or charitable nature , that never really make both ends meet , in a busi - ness sense , and can never hope to do so .

		Even such a widely and favorably known magazine as `` The Popular Science Monthly , '' founded in
1872	DATE	by the
Appleton	LOCATION	publishing house and the
Youmans	PERSON	brothers -LRB-
Edward L.	ORGANIZATION	and `` Will - iam J. -RRB- , was losing
ten thousand dollars	MONEY	a year when , in
1900	DATE	, it was finally abandoned in despair by the Appletons and reorganized on a different basis by other managers .

		And now , after fifteen years of highly creditable activity under this management , but appar - ently with no corresponding pecuniary re - turns , there is to be a new shuffling of the cards .

		A bid for greater popularity is to be made in the form of an illustrated magazine less adapted to the tastes of readers of educa - tion and a love for science than to the de - mands of a larger and necessarily a less highly educated public .

		In the words of Dr.
Cattell	PERSON	, present editor of the publication that has helped so notably to keep American read - ers informed with regard to the latest achieve - ments of science : `` A group of men desiring a journal to which the name ' The Popular Science Monthly ' will exactly apply , this publication has been transferred to them , while , beginning in
October	DATE	, a journal on the present lines of ` The Popular Science Monthly ' will be conducted under the more fitting name of ' The Scientific Monthly . '

		This differentia - tion of ` The Popular Science Monthly ' into two journals is in the natural course of evolu - tion , each journal being able to adapt itself to its environment more advantageously than is 258 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 30	DATE	possible for a single journal .

		Each can per - form an important service for the diffusion and advancement of science . ''

		Notable is Dr. CattelPs inclination to regard with disfavor any permanent endowment of the class of publications here considered ; rather would he look for their support to increased subscrip - tions from public libraries and from indi - viduals in sympathy with the purposes of these publications .

		SOUTH AFRICA 'S FAVORITE AUTHOR , though geographically separated from us by a third of the earth 's circumference , is very near us in the things that know naught of space or time .

		According to a writer in the
London	LOCATION	'' Outlook , '' Mr.
Horace Rose	PERSON	is enjoying a popularity that , measured by the sales of his latest book -LRB- `` On the Edge of the East '' -RRB- in his native land , must be highly gratifying to him .

		Though a successful novelist , he has won fame chiefly by his humorously satirical works , such as `` A Caper on the Continent '' and the book named above .

		A passage of his describing his visit to the Coliseum -LRB- which he chooses to spell `` Colosseum '' -RRB- is notable for a manifest resemblance in its style to that of an earlier humorist of the western world .

		After inspecting the Roman ruin aforemen - tioned the author returns to his hotel in a self-congratulatory frame of mind for living in the Christian era rather than in pagan times .

		But picking up a newspaper , he chances upon an account of a certain lynch - ing episode in one of our southern states , which moves him in a manner thus described : '' When I had finished reading I went back to the
Colosseum	LOCATION	and apologized to Nero .

		I felt that I owed it to him .

		He had never had the benefits of a Christian teaching , of a class at Sunday-school , of an enlightened Press , of a world-wide civilization with its broad views and high traditions .

		But every man and woman in that twentieth-century crowd had had these blessings , and thus abused them .

		I would have been less ashamed to be seen walking down Broadway ,
New York	LOCATION	, arm-in - arm with
Nero	PERSON	, at the head of a procession of Christian corpses , than shaking hands with any of these people . ''

		Mr.
Rose	PERSON	's fame seems in a fair way to spread beyond the bounds of his native
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		A NEW USE FOR THE CARD CATALOGUE , but a use to which it is unfortunate that it should have to be applied , is described by an Asso - ciated Press correspondent at
Berlin	LOCATION	. ''

		The exact registration of the huge horde of over a million prisoners of war in
Germany	LOCATION	, so that rank , service division , and place of con - finement of each man can be instantly deter - mined , has been perfected to an astonishing degree by
Count Schwerin	LOCATION	, a sixty-year-old captain of cavalry .

		To-day the relatives of any French , Russian , English , Canadian , Italian , Servian , Montenegrin , Belgian , or Japanese prisoner in
Germany	LOCATION	can ascertain within twenty-four hours where that soldier is and what his condition is . ''

		The plan adopted is the one so familiar to library work - ers , and doubtless the only scheme at once practicable and economical .

		Eighty assis - tants are engaged in the maintenance of this immense card catalogue , and the superinten - dent of the system , Count
Schwerin	LOCATION	himself , who is referred to not quite accurately as its `` inventor , '' gives twelve hours a day to his task .

		About eight hundred letters of inquiry come to his `` Kartothek , '' or card-repository , every day , and it is his boast and pride to have them all answered within twenty-four or , at the utmost , forty-eight hours .

		As the letters are in many languages and of varying de - grees of illegibility , this promptitude is highly creditable .

		A smaller catalogue contains a list of the dead , so far as names and facts are ascertainable , which is not very far .

		And all this indexing activity , set in operation by a lamentable necessity , might in happier times have served to provide with card catalogues a score or more of public libraries in as many smiling villages of the fatherland .

		READING IN BED has charms that have been painted by many an able hand .

		Few have more keenly appreciated those charms than the writer of a recent letter to '' The Southern Notes , '' the monthly publication of the
Utica Normal and Industrial Institute	ORGANIZATION	, at
Utica	LOCATION	,
Mississippi	LOCATION	.

		The letter is addressed to the Principal , Mr.
William H. Holtzclaw	PERSON	, by one of his pupils ,
Miss Ethel Sanders	PERSON	.

		`` It is certainly a great pleasure to write to you , '' she says . ''

		I am very glad to tell you that I am almost in good health .

		I must tell you how my aunt and the doctor treated me while I was sick .

		They did all they could to keep me from my books , but they did not succeed , and I kept them hid in the bed .

		They had friends to watch me , but I read them under cover .

		There was a hole in the quilt that gave me some light .

		So , although they watched me every day and night , I succeeded in reading a few lines in my books anyway , and I fretted for them all the time . ''

		Then she describes how she used violence on the children that came into her room and interrupted her read - ing .

		Was ever anyone so fired with the furor legendi in lecto , the reading-in-bed mania , as this colored girl of
Mississippi	LOCATION	?

		Not inferior
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 259 to her in determination of a like sort was a certain pupil -LRB- now a writer of distinction -RRB- at the
Perkins Institute for the Blind	ORGANIZATION	, nearly thirty years ago .

		Mr.
Clarence Hawkes	PERSON	re - lates in his autobiography , which is more fully noticed on another page , that in the editorship and publication of the school paper , '' The Echo , '' he found himself obliged to do much of the work at night in bed , where he deftly manipulated a small typewriter under the bedclothes . ''

		Several times , '' he says , '' Captain
Wright	PERSON	, the vigilance man , came into my room and walked over to my bed , to discover where that strange clicking came from , but I was always sleeping soundly when he appeared and the typewriter was hidden beneath the bedclothes , so my secret was never discovered . ''

		Evidently there are possibilities in the way of literary activity even for the hours spent in bed .

		THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WHEREFORE OF THE WOMAN LIBRARIAN has apparently but just dawned upon the French mind .

		A distin - guished savant of
France	LOCATION	has set forth in the `` Revue Internationale de 1 ` Enseignement '' some of the qualifications , already well known to us in
America	LOCATION	, which the woman librarian possesses in a larger measure than the man .

		From extracts quoted by '' The Library Jour - nal '' a few passages may here be of interest . ''

		Let us be frank , '' says the writer . ''

		It is work which suits a woman much better than a man .

		In reality , men are not at home in the duties of the librarian ... This subordi - nate role does not suit the natural pride of men .

		And one need not be much of a psy - chologist to divine the inevitable frictions that would culminate in grotesque disputes if the fear of ridicule did not forbid carrying things to the extreme ... It is probable that with a feminine staff all this friction would disap - pear , because the psychological reasons al - ready indicated would not exist .

		Women would not feel humiliated by serving , by playing in the library the part they play in the home .

		Naturally more flexible , more teachable , more affable than men , they would accomplish with pleasure and smilingly , with - out tiring , the modest duties which do not belong to the other sex . ''

		All indisputably true so far as the daily service of the library - using public and the daily personal contact with that public are concerned .

		Hence the great preponderance of young women as library assistants over young men .

		But the burdens of large administrative responsibility are still thought to be better borne by men , and so our great public and university libra - ries are , as a rule , under male control .

		Can we imagine any woman as accomplishing what Dr. Billings accomplished in building up and directing the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, or as carrying on the work of Librarian Putnam at
Washington	LOCATION	or Librarian Lane at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	?

		HERR
LISSAUER	PERSON	'S LITERARY LAPSE , to style it by no harsher name , in giving to the world his hysterical `` Hymn of Hate , '' has been apologized for by him in 1 fine and manly fashion .

		It was in reply to some adverse com - ment on the poem in the '' Berliner Tage - blatt '' that its author explained how the lines were `` written as the result of a passionate impulse in the first weeks of the war , when the impression created by
England	LOCATION	's declara - tion of war was fresh . ''

		Moreover , he assures us , the hymn was not intended for the young , and he has always been opposed to its inclu - sion in schoolbooks .

		He continues : `` The ' Song of Hate ' is a political poem directed not against individual Englishmen , but against
England	LOCATION	as a political force , and collectively against the English will to destruc - tion which threatens
Germany	LOCATION	.

		In the excite - ment of those days my feelings were deeply stirred by this .

		Whether these feelings can continue with the cool consideration of prac - tical politics is another question . ''

		Excellent , every reader outside of
Germany	LOCATION	, if not also within that empire , must say .

		Whether now the
august	DATE	hand that decorated the poet 's breast for those choleric verses will proceed to add another decoration for this handsome acknowledgment of a possible excess of acer - bity , remains to be seen ; but the probabilities are considerably more than a billion to one against any such imperial admission of error .

		THE AGONIES OF '' MOVING DAY '' IN A LARGE LIBRARY are seldom limited to twenty-four hours in time .

		The
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	library began three months ago to take possession of the new and palatial Widener building , and the battalions of books have been on the march , in rather leisurely fashion , ever since .

		But a college or university library has the advan - tage of a long vacation for its change of quar - ters , when such change is necessary .

		More in the nature of a forced march is that which the books of a constantly busy public library must make in a similar case .

		Comparison has been made between the moving of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	's 900,000 volumes and stacks of pamphlets and the transfer of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	's collection from Boylston Street to
Copley Square	LOCATION	twenty years ago the only library - moving in that part of the country compara - 260 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 30	DATE	ble in magnitude with the present operation at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		But the
Boston	LOCATION	task was prac - tically completed between
Dec. 14 , 1894	DATE	, and
Jan. 28 , 1895	DATE	; and there have been other big movings of this nature , notably the recent one at
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, that have made a far better record for celerity .

		Moving is , at best , a trying if not agonizing experience ; but it is a part of the price that libraries and the rest of us have to pay for larger quarters and more stately .

		mansions .

		THE REAL THINGS OF LIFE are not exactly the same for any two persons .

		One may kin - dle with enthusiasm at the mention of Indian arrow-heads , or totem-poles , or cuneiform in - scriptions , or postage stamps ; another may go into ecstasies over Turkish rugs , or
Japan	LOCATION	- ese fans ; and a third will perhaps be stirred by martial exploits and tales of heroism .

		There recently died at
Great Barrington	LOCATION	a man whose grandfather was keeper of the
White Horse Inn	ORGANIZATION	made famous by
Blackmore	PERSON	in ``
Lorna Doone	PERSON	. ''

		and who himself was so fortunate as to be born in that celebrated hostelry , but who seems to have been fired with no zeal for first editions of the famous novelist 's works , nor to have felt any especial love for those works or for the scenes they depicted .


Richard H. Maunder	PERSON	-LRB- for that was his name -RRB- gave his affections to the products , not of the romancer 's brain , but of the pot - ter 's \ vheel and the potter 's shaping thumb , t In other words , it was the old china of Staf - ' fordshire that presented itself to him as the !

		one object preeminently worth while , and of ' that china the dark and the blue varieties | were to him supremely desirable , so that he became one of the greatest living authorities in and collectors of that branch of antique pottery .

		It was an inherited taste , his grand - father , of the White Horse Inn , having been possessed with the same frenzy .

		The recent famous novels of the `` Five Towns '' series ought to have been the younger Mr.
Maun	PERSON	- ders favorite reading ; but perhaps there was not enough of
Staffordshire	LOCATION	pottery even in them to satisfy the enthusiast .


WARSAW	LOCATION	'S LITERARY TREASURE , now in the conqueror 's hands , will not , like the
Louvain	LOCATION	library , go up in smoke , though it may not remain intact in its present home .


Warsaw	LOCATION	-
University	ORGANIZATION	has a library of six hundred thou - sand volumes , and a considerable collection of manuscripts and maps , the
Krasinski Library	ORGANIZATION	numbers more than one hundred thousand volumes , the public library of the city one hundred and sixty thousand , and the
Warsaw Polytechnic Institute	ORGANIZATION	has about thirty-five thousand volumes .

		Of these collections , that belonging to the university is by far the most valuable .

		It acquired from some of the mon - asteries suppressed in
1819	DATE	many rare works from the Aldine ,
Elzevir	LOCATION	,
Plantin	PERSON	,
Stephanus	PERSON	, and other early presses of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The Elze - virs alone , several hundred in number , form a collection that is considered one of the finest of its kind .

		It w r ill be a century ago next year that the
University of Warsaw	ORGANIZATION	was founded .

		The loss of its library , if it is to lose it , or the best part of it , will be a sad centennial event for
Warsaw	LOCATION	, though for the rest of the world far less sad than a wanton destruction of so much irreplaceable literary treasure .

		THE FAVORITE READING OF CLERGYMEN is by no means always and invariably theology .

		It is an old story that when ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	'' came out , sixty-eight years ago .

		Dr.
Mark Hopkins	PERSON	, President of
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	and one of the most noted pulpit orators of his day , was repeatedly discovered by members of his fam - ily immersed in the enthralling novel when he was supposed to be writing sermons or reading the early Christian Fathers in his study .

		A half - embarrassed , half - petulant '' Pshaw ! ''

		and a hasty thrusting of the book aside would follow as soon as he found him - self caught in his unclerical occupation ; but repeated relapses ensued until the story was finished .

		It is reported by the General Theo - logical Library of
Boston	LOCATION	, which circulates no fiction but does provide reading matter of other kinds for the clergy of
New England	LOCATION	, that theological works are less in demand than biographies and books on sociology and , in general , '' inspirational '' literature .

		The stimulus of the story-book has to be sought elsewhere .

		The good work of this library , which has already been commended in these columns , is limited to no sect or creed .

		Any minister of the gospel in
New England	LOCATION	may draw upon its resources to the extent of two books a month , postage both ways being paid by the library ; and this generous privilege is now enjoyed by more than eighteen hun - dred book-borrowers .

		LITERARY ARTISTS IN THE TRENCHES are placing the outside world in their debt for occasional vivid descriptions of soldier-life that get past the censor and inform those at home how things are going in some undesig - nated spot on the long battle-line .

		Many of these writers are amateurs , and their per - formance has a singular freshness and charm , while others are reporters by profession and
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 261 show themselves a little more conscious of their art . ''

		The Institute Journal , '' of Lon - don , official periodical publication of the In - stitute of Journalists , has lately printed a list of nearly twelve hundred journalist soldiers who either now are serving their country at the front or have been doing so .

		Among the most distinguished of these war writers are Mr.
Ashmead Bartlett	PERSON	, Mr.
Stanley Wash	PERSON	- burn , Mr.
Bernhard Paris	PERSON	, Mr.
Philip Gibbs	PERSON	, and Mr.
G. H. Perris	PERSON	.

		The raw material for campaign books and articles that is now being accumulated must exceed anything of the sort ever known in the history of this w T ar-scarred planet .

		INSTRUCTION IN LIBRARY ECONOMY IN HOL - LAND appears to be now recognized as a legiti - mate part of the university 's teaching activi - ties .

		In '' The Library Journal '' for this month it is announced that both
Amsterdam	LOCATION	and Utrecht universities '' have added to their faculties of literature a chair for library economy and bibliography .

		Dr.
H. E. Greve	PERSON	of the
Royal Library	ORGANIZATION	at
The Hague	ORGANIZATION	has begun a series of lectures at the first-named university on the subject of national and international catalog rules .

		Dr.
A. Hulsof	PERSON	has taken up the subject of general and historical bibli - ography for his lectures at the
University of Utrecht	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Many there are still living who can recall the derisive smile with which , as a rule , the university or college man under the old dispensation would refer to `` library science '' and those who professed to teach its mysteries .

		A FRENCH TRANSLATION OF '' THE EGOIST . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		While in
Paris	LOCATION
last summer	DATE	I picked up a French translation of Meredith 's masterpiece .

		The book interested me because it was the first work of one of my favorite English authors that I had seen in French .

		Also , to tell the truth , I disbursed more cheerfully the few francs necessary for its pur - chase -LRB- money was scarce in
Paris	LOCATION	just then -RRB- as I hoped that the proverbial clarity of French might help me over some knotty passages in the original . ''

		What is not clear is not French , '' as we all know .

		Well then , '' L'Egoiste , traduit de 1 ' Anglais par
Maurice Strauss	PERSON	,
Paris	LOCATION	:
Charles Carrington	PERSON	,
1904	DATE	, '' is not French .

		Perhaps
Meredith	PERSON	can not be made French .

		It is , however , noteworthy that neither the name of the translator nor of the publisher is quite Gallic .

		We have , then , a difficult English author translated by a semi-Teuton and published by an Anglo-Saxon .

		We may admire their cour - age , if not the result .

		I may state at once that in reading the transla - tion I was constantly obliged to consult the original to get , at least approximately , the meaning .

		The Prelude is only a rough paraphrase of
Meredith	LOCATION	; parts of it , as indeed of the whole novel , are omit - ted , one might wish that more were ; parts are more easily intelligible in the French ; but all the sparkle has vanished .

		Assuming that the English is familiar to your readers , I will cite merely the opening paragraph of the translation : '' Quand on joue la comedie , e ` est dans un salon .

		Tout se passe entre civilises ; a 1 ` abri des poussieres du dehors , des variations de 1 ' atmosphere ; en toute correction .

		Pour faire apparaitre le relief de 1 ` evi - dence , notre logique n'use point de ees loupes neces - saires au travail de 1 ` horloger .

		Le sens comique conc.oit une situation determinee pour quantite de types , et rejette tous lea accessoires qui pourraient faire longueur .

		La vision et 1 ` enthousiasme , c'est tout ce qu'il faut .

		Eegardez et ne vous occupez que de voir .

		Le reste viendra tout seul . ''

		In all this I am painfully reminded of a previous impression upon opening a French version of '' Macbeth , '' in which the witches ' greeting appeared as '' Bon jour , Macbeth ! ''

		But the loss of sparkle is not all .

		That was to be expected , for it would probably require a life-time adequately to render Meredith into any foreign language .

		But there are curious neo - logisms , representing sporadic efforts at word-for - word translation .

		Thus in the first three pages , '' digestibly '' appears as digestivement ; '' lumi - nous rings eruptive of the infinitesimal '' becomes anneaux lumineux eruptes de I ' Infinitesimal .


Nei	ORGANIZATION	- ther digestivement nor erupter is cited by standard dictionaries ; and besides , the second phrase misses the point .

		Perhaps worse , from an English point of view , are the gross mistranslations , which can only come from a failure to consult the dictionary .

		Thus , still in the first three pages , we find '' branfulness '' = sonorite ; '' malady of sameness '' = maladie de I ` ego'isme ; '' headlong trains '' des longs trains .

		Other translations give the idea , perhaps , but the reason for not following the original faithfully is not apparent .

		For instance : '' the land of fog - horns '' from which we seek some escape , is ren - dered , pays brumeux des coquecigrues .

		Of '' our o'er hoary ancestry them in the oriental pos - ture , to which our visit to science introduced us , '' it is written : `` La science nous presenta a nos primitifs ancetres chenus ils nous rec.urent en posture orientale , '' when of course the meaning is : '' ceux qui affectionnent la posture orientale . ''

		It would be as unprofitable as tiresome to push too far such an examination .

		But lest I be accused of taking examples only from the most difficult chapter of the book , I may cite at haphazard some curious misrenderings .

		Every page which I have compared with the original is bristling with blun - ders .

		On the first page of Chapter I v ,
Meredith	PERSON	says of
Simon Patterne	PERSON	that he was marvellously endowed with the power of saying no . ''

		He said it with the resonant emphasis of death to younger sons . ''

		This significant phrase is translated : '' Et 1 'em phase de sa volonte glagait de terreur jusqu ' a ses fils . ''

		In the next paragraph , speaking of Lieutenant Crossjay 's act of valor which brought him to the notice of
Patterne Hall	PERSON	,
Meredith	PERSON	says : 262 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 30	DATE	'' The officer 's youth was assumed on the strength of his rank , perhaps likewise from the tale of his modesty . ''

		This subtle touch is thus smothered : '' L'age tendre du heros fut mis en relief par sa bravoure , et sa modestie brocha sur le tout . ''

		At times the translator seems to have copied the first meaning found in his dictionary , leaving the sense to look out for itself .

		Sir
Willoughby	PERSON	is relating to Clara the early career of
Vernon Whit	PERSON	- ford -LRB- page 83 of Scribner 's `` Pocket Edition '' -RRB- . '' '

		Leaves the Hall ! '

		exclaimed
Willoughby	PERSON	. '

		I have not heard a word of it .

		He made a bad start at the beginning ... had to throw over his Fel - lowship . ''

		On page 133 of the translation , we find : '' Quitter le chateau !

		s ` exclama
Willoughby	PERSON	.

		C'est le premier mot que j' en entends .

		II fit un faux depart au debut ... il eut d jeter par dessus sa camaraderie . ''

		One more example I can not resist .

		Sir
Wil	PERSON	- loughby , trying to persuade
Vernon	PERSON	to remain at
Patterne	LOCATION	, says : '' Take a run abroad , if you are restless . ''

		This becomes : '' Si vous etes fatigue du repos , tirez une bordee . ''

		Possibly '' a run abroad '' signifies tirer une bordee to a certain class of wealthy young hot-bloods ; but from Sir
Wil	PERSON	- loughby Patterne of
Patterne Hall	PERSON	to the dignified scholar ,
Vernon Whitf	PERSON	ord , this bit of sailor 's slang is grotesque in the extreme .

		The effort to bring
Meredith	PERSON	within the reach of French readers is certainly a creditable one ; but it is a task to which angels , or those who speak with the tongue of angels , alone may aspire .

		Such a version as that perpetrated by the present trans - lator should not be allowed to pass unchallenged .

		THE GERMAN WAR BOOK .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Owing to the hypnotic influence exerted upon Americans by the prospect of earning English gold , I have tried to reconcile myself to all the American misrepresentation and vilification of Ger - many and
Germany	LOCATION	's cause .

		But the review of Professor
Morgan	PERSON	's translation of '' The War Book of the German General Staff , '' in your issue of
Sept. 2	DATE	, is so vilely and so outrageously unfair , so thoroughly British in its viewpoint , that my gorge rises at it and I must protest .

		The writer of that review seeks to bring the German method of warfare into contempt by point - ing out that , according to the Germans , military necessity takes precedence over international law , and he quotes the following as an example of this logic of militarism : '' No inhabitant of the occupied territory is to be disturbed in the use and free disposition of his prop - erty ; on the other hand the necessity of war justifies the most far-reaching disturbance , restriction , and imperiling of his property . ''

		For the benefit of your reviewer and of your read - ers , permit me to quote Article 3 of the American Naval War Code : '' Military necessity permits measures that are in - dispensable for securing the end of the war , and that are in accordance with modern law and usage of war .

		... Non-combatants are to be spared in person and property during hostilities as much as the neces - sities of war and the conduct of such non-combatants will permit . ''

		And may I reall to the memory of Americans the conduct of our own troops in the Civil War and of
England	LOCATION	's troops in the Revolution , in
South Africa	LOCATION	, and in
India	LOCATION	?

		Your reviewer also speaks of '' the German doc - trine ' Not kennt kein Gebot ' '' -LRB- which , of course , he does not translate -RRB- .

		But , pray , since when is the doctrine that necessity knows no law a German doctrine ?

		Is it not rather a universal law founded in the instinct of self-preservation ?

		Is it not time that all this lying about
Germany	LOCATION	stopped ?

		Are Americans really so stupid , so bigoted , so narrow-minded , that they can not bear the truth ?

		Or is all this vilification merely petty and picayune revenge for the Britons ' incompe - tence in the present crisis in their history ?

		Your reviewer states it as the final lesson of the War Book that
Germany	LOCATION	's conduct is guided by the principle , '' anything to win . ''

		Let anyone read our own War Book or that of any other nation before whom
England	LOCATION	is now crooking the pregnant hinges of the knee , and he will find that all warring mankind makes this its guiding prin - ciple .

		We Americans , worshipping the ideal '' suc - cess , success at any cost '' -LRB- short of being found out -RRB- , whether it be in business or in politics , should be the last ones to throw stones at
Germany	LOCATION	for that .

		Finally permit me to express my astonishment that THE DIAL , a literary journal for people above the average intelligence , should have given room for a '' review '' so calculated to stir up prejudice and hatred in the hearts of its readers .

		ELEMENTS OF THE SHORT STORY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I wonder if a layman may voice his disagreement with the very interesting opinion of an expert con - cerning short stories and their place in literature -LRB- see Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	's article in your issue of
September 2	DATE	-RRB- ?

		Is not the importance of quantity largely over-emphasized in Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's appraisal ?

		The qualitative character of the story may depend more upon the writer than the limita - tions in length .

		Whoever has read the short stories of Tourguenieff ,
Chekhoff	PERSON	, and
Gorki	PERSON	-LRB- all available in English translations -RRB- will scarcely agree with the statements that '' character , its development and its oppositions , the form hardly has room for '' and '' great action , passion , thought can hardly be developed . ''

		Chekhoff 's short stories , except for his earliest period , are all character and very little action .

		The same is true of
Gorki	LOCATION	; while in Tour - guenieff 's tales there is no dearth of passion .

		The American short story , especially the popular type , is largely anecdote ; but that seems to be a fault rather of our national psychology than of the inevitable limitations of the literary form .

		A CENTURY 'S RECORDS OF Two FAMOUS FAMILIES .

		* It was a happy thought to put together for publication the Wedgwood-Darwin-Allen let - ters of a century .

		Centring around the per - sonality of
Emma Wedgwood	PERSON	, wife of
Charles Darwin	PERSON	, the story reveals not only that noble character , but also the intimate life of all those nearest to her .

		We see the non-scientific side of
Charles Darwin	PERSON	, his happiness and troubles , his hopes and fears , and how com - pletely these were shared by her of whom he characteristically said : '' I marvel at my good fortune , that she , so infinitely my superior in every single moral quality , consented to be my wife . ''

		More than this , we make the acquain - tance of a group of persons belonging to three closely connected families , almost all of them with a certain flavor of genius , a distinction of character which commands our admiration and respect , as it did that of their contempo - raries .

		Those who achieved eminence seem less exceptional when seen on the background of their family life , which was itself main - tained at so high a level .

		In
1792	DATE
Josiah Wedgwood of Maer Hall	ORGANIZATION	married
Elizabeth Allen	PERSON	of Cresselly ; and
Emma	PERSON	, born in
1808	DATE	, was their ninth and last child .

		The letters of this early period intro - duce us to the older generation , the parents , aunts , and uncles of
Emma	PERSON	, who not only made the environment of her early life , but some of them lived to see its fruition in rela - tively modern times .

		Nearly all through the book , always very much alive and with a great deal to say for herself , appears the figure of
Fanny Allen	PERSON	, who died in
1875	DATE	at the age of 94 .

		No less interesting is
Jessie Allen	PERSON	, who married the historian
J. C. de Sismondi	PERSON	, and died in
1853	DATE	.

		Another aunt ,
Catherine	PERSON	, or
Kitty	PERSON	, was the wife of Sir
James Mackintosh	PERSON	, who was prominent in the politics and society of the early part of the century .

		The Aliens and
Wedgwoods	PERSON	were in the midst of what - ever was going on , and there are many anec - dotes of famous men and women .

		Madame de Stael appears a number of times , and it is interesting to-day to read that at a party in
1813	DATE	she '' harangued for half-an-hour against peace , '' but `` this was so entirely against the sentiments of every one present that
Lord Holland	LOCATION	.

		gravely declared his opinions were entirely contrary to hers on that subject . ''

New York	LOCATION	:
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The diary of
Emma Caldwell	PERSON	, written in
1819	DATE	, gives a vivid account of the manner in which the Wedgwoods of Maer brought up their children : '' The part of the intellectual character most im - proved by the Wedgwood education is good sense , which , is indeed their preeminent quality .

		It is one of the most important , and in the end will pro- mote more of their own and others happiness than any other quality .

		The moral quality most pro- moted by their education is benevolence , which combined with good sense , gives all that education can give .

		The two little girls -LSB- one of those re - ferred to being
Emma	PERSON	-RSB- are happy , gay , amiable , sensible , and though not particularly energetic in learning , yet will acquire all that is necessary by their steady perseverance .

		They have freedom in their actions in this house as well as in their princi - ples .

		Doors and windows stand open , you are no - where in confinement ; you may do as you like ; you are surrounded by books that all look most tempting to read ; you will always find some pleas - ant topic of conversation , or may start one , as all things are talked of in the general family .

		All this sounds and is delightful . ''

		A few years later , the question of slavery was to the front , and we find the
Maer	PERSON	family ardent abolitionists .

		In
1824	DATE	,
Fanny Allen	ORGANIZATION	gives a remarkable account of an anti-slavery speech by Lord
Brougham	PERSON	which she heard in the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Commons : ''
Brougham	PERSON	's speech was delightful .

		He spoke for an hour and 10 or 20 minutes , and it was the most incomparable thing I ever heard .

		I could have screamed or jumped with delight .

		He han - dled
Scarlett	PERSON	and Canning to my soul 's con - tent tossed them about like a cat a couple of mice from one paw to another , teased them and threw them into the air , with equal grace and strength . ''

		In
1831	DATE	we find
Elizabeth Wedgwood	PERSON	,
Emma	PERSON	's oldest sister , writing thus : '' The thing I am most anxious to hear is the debate on
Tuesday	DATE	on slavery .

		Macaulay 's speech on the reform bill almost made me cry with admiration , and I expect his speech on so much more interest - ing a subject to be the finest thing that ever was heard . ''


Charles Darwin	PERSON	scarcely enters the narra - tive until his return from his voyage around the world , when we find him the centre of interest , much wondered at and admired .

		Emma writes to her sister-in-law : `` We en - joyed
Charles	PERSON	's visit uncommonly ... Charles talked away most pleasantly all the time ; we plied him with questions without any mercy . ''

		The second volume opens with the engage - ment of
Charles Darwin	PERSON	and
Emma Wedg	PERSON	- wood , an event which gave unqualified delight , not only to the principals , but to all the rela - tives .

		Nothing could be more charming than the letters of this period ; we will only quote 264 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 30	DATE	Emma 's opinion of
Charles	LOCATION	, as expressed in a letter to her Aunt
Jessie Sismondi	PERSON	: '' I must now tell you what I think of him , first premising that Eliz .

		thinks pretty nearly the same , as my opinion may not go for much with you .

		He is the most open , transparent man I ever saw , and every word expresses his real thoughts .

		He is par - ticularly affectionate and very nice to his father and sisters , and perfectly sweet tempered , and pos - sesses some minor qualities that add particularly to one 's happiness , such as not being fastidious , and being humane to animals . ''

		A friend writes to Emma : '' You two will be quite too happy together , and I hope you will have a chimney that smokes , or something of that sort to prevent your being quite intoxi - cated . ''

		They were married on
January 29 , 1839	DATE	; the rest of the story has to do with their life together , and the lives of their children .

		`` We have long known the main facts of Dar - win 's life , how he struggled against ever - recurring illness , and in spite of all managed to do a prodigious amount of work .

		We have understood that his wife was an essential fac - tor in all this ; but now for the first time we are enabled to appreciate the beauty and strength of her character , and to see that she was very much more than a mere background for her illustrious husband .

		He also appears in a somewhat new light ; and if anyone still has the illusion that the patron saint of naturalists lacked normal human qualities , this should be dispelled .

		Nothing could be more erroneous than the idea that
Darwin	PERSON	's emotions and sympathies were dried up by his scientific pursuits .

		After
Charles Darwin	PERSON	's death , his son
Francis	PERSON	undertook to write his Life .

		Mrs.
Darwin	PERSON	felt a shrinking dread of the publicity , but when she saw the book she was completely satisfied .

		`` I have been _ reading Frank 's notes ... I am quite delighted with them .

		The picture is so mi - nute and exact that it is like a written photograph , and so full of tender observation on
Frank	ORGANIZATION	's part .

		The whole picture makes me feel astonished at myself that I can make out a cheerful life after losing him .

		He filled so much space with his inter - est , sympathy and graciousness , besides his love underlying and pervading all .

		I think Frank has done so wisely in writing down every thing .

		I wrote a little note to him , as I knew I should break down in telling him what I felt . ''

		At the end of the book , as a postscript , is a brief account of the life of
Erasmus Darwin	PERSON	, grandson of
Charles	PERSON	and
Emma Darwin	PERSON	, who was killed in action in the vicinity of
Ypres	LOCATION	,
April 17 , 1915	DATE	.

		`` There never was , that I ever met , a man so strong and yet so gentle , '' writes a dear friend , who was killed in action only a fortnight later .

		We rise from the book with a strong feeling that the story is not yet all told ; that the Wedgwood-Darwin blood has yet much to do in the world , and it may well be that the record of the twentieth century will be read by posterity with as much interest and pleas - ure as we have found in following the history of the century past .

		THE
RUSSIA	LOCATION	.

		* An interesting development of the past quarter-century has been the change of atti - tude on the part of western
Europe	LOCATION	toward
Russia	LOCATION	and things Russian .

		A generation ago
Russia	LOCATION	, save within very restricted circles , was regarded as a vast , undeveloped , conglomerate empire , whose government was hopelessly au - tocratic and corrupt , and whose people were ignorant , intolerant , unproductive , barbarous , non-European , and largely incapable of prog - ress .

		To-day the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	is considered one of the great and promising states of
Europe	LOCATION	, its government virile and in some degree enlightened , its people industrious , ambitious , serious , and possessed of large actual and latent culture .

		The change of view has come in part be - cause the realities of Russian life and char - acter have been made known as never before by travellers and writers , and by the transla - tion and diffusion of Russian literature .

		It is attributable in no small measure , also , to the fact that Russian government and economic and social organization have undergone a con - siderable transformation under the eyes of the present-day world .

		Heroic , if not always successful , attempts at reform have caught the attention , and have commanded the sym - pathy , of western peoples .

		Just now the currents of opinion regarding
Russia	LOCATION	are flowing strong and they are unusu - ally interesting , even though not very convinc - ing .

		Amid the stress of the war , sentiment upon this as upon every other political and social matter tends to be deepened and warped to accord with the exigencies of the * AN INTERPRETATION OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 265 situation .

		From German sources we are hear - ing again that the Russian is an unregenerate barbarian , whose influence , were it to be further extended , would be the bane of
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean civilization .

		From English and French sources we are being assured that the Russian is an altogether good sort of fellow , that he is on the high-road of political and social better - ment , and that from his larger participation in European and world affairs civilization has nothing to fear .

		Unsuspected frailties are matched by unsuspected virtues , until the impression is inevitably forced that there has been a deal of exaggeration on both sides .

		From the mass of books relating to
Russia	LOCATION	which have poured from the presses since the war began , one easily selects as most worth while `` An Interpretation of the Russian Peo - ple , '' written by Professor
Leo Wiener	PERSON	of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Wiener	PERSON	is Russian born and reared , and the subject of his prolonged researches and teaching has been the Slavic languages and literatures , especially the Russian .

		His attachment to his native country is close , yet at times he has been its unsparing critic .

		No man in Amer - ica , perhaps no man anywhere , is better fitted to interpret
Russia	LOCATION	, more particularly Russian culture , to the western world .

		The volume in hand undertakes such an interpretation .

		The object is stated to be `` the ascertainment of those spiritual princi - ples which alone can help the reader to com - prehend and properly weigh the curious and frequently unique phenomena in the social and artistic life of
Russia	LOCATION	. ''

		There is no at - tempt at a formal or continuous history of Russian thought , literature , or art ; so that to be read most effectively by one not reason - ably acquainted with that history , the book should be preceded by such treatises as Mr.
Maurice Baring	PERSON	's '' The Russian People '' and his recent '' Outline of Russian Literature '' in the `` Home University Library . ''

		After two introductory chapters in which are depicted clearly some of the fundamentals of the Rus - sian character and of the historical develop - ment of Russian life , Professor
Wiener	PERSON	writes principally of the national ideals as expressed in Russian literature , of `` art for art 's sake '' in
Russia	LOCATION	, of Russian music as an expression of the popular mind , of the Russian religion , of the '' intellectuals '' and the masses , of the peasants , and of the position and influence of Russian women .

		Perhaps the most original and illuminating of Professor
Wiener	PERSON	's observations is that re - lating to the Russian 's propensity to show to the world the worst that is in him , combined with his habit of self-abnegation .

		There is little or no effort in
Russia	LOCATION	, we are told , to keep the seamy side of life , whether individ - ual or social , from view .

		In matters of morals the Russian is not notably worse than other men ; he is merely less cautious , less hypo - critical . ''

		The criminal instincts are more obvious , not more serious , in
Russia	LOCATION	than else - where . ''

		Furthermore , the Russian delights in self-castigation .

		The brilliant Irish writer , Mr.
E. J. Dillon	PERSON	, whose `` Russian Character - istics '' -LRB- published in
1892	DATE	-RRB- contains one of the most scathing denunciations of all things Russian ever written , lives in
Petrograd	LOCATION	, a highly honored man , and his book is actually popular .

		The Russians take a curious sort of satisfaction in recitals of their shortcomings .

		They make their foibles and sins `` visible , '' while other peoples seek to conceal their weak - nesses under a cloak of sanctimonious proprie - ties .

		The point may be over-emphasized , but it carries enough weight to justify the author in warning his readers against books upon
Russia	LOCATION	written by hasty observers who , misled by the unreserved frankness of the Slav , assume that where there is so much open cor - ruption there must be at least as much as in other countries that is hidden from view .

		Another interpretation of
Russia	LOCATION	by a Russian dwelling in a foreign land is Vino - gradoff s '' The Russian Problem . ''

		This little book contains only a popular lecture entitled ''
Russia	LOCATION	after the War , '' and a reprinted let - ter to the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' on the psychology of the Russian nation .

		The standing of the author , however , gives it importance .

		After serving as professor of history in the Uni - versity of
Moscow	LOCATION	, and after suffering banish - ment for his liberal views ,
Vinogradoff	PERSON	was appointed some years ago to a professorship of jurisprudence in the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, and he has taken first rank as a scholar in the field of mediaeval English agrarian history .

		The volume in hand is too brief to go far in the way of interpretation .

		It is rather a defence , its contents being prompted largely by recent German slurs upon Russian civiliza - tion , and it is intended to reassure the English that they are not fighting hand in glove with sheer barbarians .

		The author concurs with Dr.
Wiener	PERSON	in a dislike for autocracy , in re - gret for the slipping back of
Russia	LOCATION	in consti - tutional matters since
1906	DATE	, and in the belief that the salvation of the country lies in the extension of public education and in the solu - tion of the land question .

		He believes , how - ever , that
Russia	LOCATION	has need of strong monarchy , just as
France	LOCATION	had need of strong monarchy in the thirteenth century and
England	LOCATION	in the fifteenth ; and he contends that it would be a fatal mistake to indulge in anti-monarchical , 266 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 30	DATE	anti-dynastic agitation .

		It is his hope that the Imperial Government `` shall be able to per - ceive that the uncontested leadership of the nation through this war imposes the moral obligation of generous and far-sighted ac - tion . ''

		He is more sanguine , if not concerning the final outcome , at least concerning the more immediate effects of the war upon Russian government and social conditions , than is Professor
Wiener	PERSON	.

		A volume of similar purport by an English - man is Mr.
J. W. Mackail	PERSON	's ''
Russia	LOCATION	's Gift to the World . ''

		The author starts with the pre - mise that the cultural achievements of
Russia	LOCATION	are largely unknown to the English , as to other western peoples .

		These achievements , he maintains , are many and varied , even though
Russia	LOCATION	is the last of the great states of
Europe	LOCATION	to undergo a modernizing regenera - tion .

		The subjects considered , in all cases very briefly , are literature , music , art , the drama , natural science , and the social sciences .

		The brochure has value as a popular hand - book .

		More than that it does not pretend to be .

		It is commendable for its moderation of statement and for its general accuracy .

		The principal value of Mr.
Stephen Gra	PERSON	- ham 's earlier writings on
Russia	LOCATION	arises from the splendid portrayal of the Russian peasant character contained in them .

		Mr.
Graham	PERSON	, who is himself something of a mystic , has been strongly attracted by the simple , honest , uncommercial , mystical peasant temperament , and by
Russia	LOCATION	as the '' sanctuary from West - ernism . ''

		He has travelled extensively among the peasants , lived with them , journeyed with them as a pilgrim to
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, and written about them charmingly in `` Undiscovered
Russia	LOCATION	'' and other books .

		In his most recent volume , ''
Russia	LOCATION	and the World , '' which con - sists chiefly of articles published originally in English and American magazines , he records some of the impressions gathered on a long and arduous tramp across
Russian Central Asia	LOCATION	to the frontier of
China	LOCATION	, mainly through the great region of southern
Siberia	LOCATION	where Russian emigration and colonization can best be studied at close range .

		But in the main he writes of
Russia	LOCATION	in relation to the presenj ; war and as a factor in world politics .

		Upon this subject he is interesting , yet he has no great contribution to make .


Russia	LOCATION	, he says , is fighting fundamentally to preserve her national life and religion , `` that she may go on being herself . ''

		To Mr.
Graham	PERSON	's mind , the worst thing that can happen to the Em - pire is to be Westernized and made like other countries .

		The nation 's present cause is just and sacred , for , as he views the matter , it involves the right of a great , albeit primitive , civilization to exist and grow .

		Of the future of
Russia	LOCATION	as the dominant land-empire of the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	world the author entertains never a doubt .

		Mr.
Denis Garstin	PERSON	's `` Friendly
Russia	LOCATION	, '' made up of journalistic matter supplied by the author to various
London	LOCATION	periodicals , is yet another volume written with the manifest purpose of commending
Russia	LOCATION	to her English allies .

		In his opening chapter the author con - fesses that the word ''
Russia	LOCATION	'' has always sent a little tremor of excitement down his back , `` pregnant with wolves , passion , and savag - ery , '' and he admits that although he should live in the country for the rest of his life it always would continue to do so .

		The burden of his book , however , is the distinction be - tween the two Russias the ogre-land of wolves , knouts , serfdom , and cruelty , and the
Russia	LOCATION	actually to be seen by the twentieth century traveller and observer .

		And we have the word of Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, in an Introduc - tion from his pen which the volume carries , that the distinction is `` very neatly '' drawn .

		Twenty sketchy chapters of impressions , anec - dotes , and reminiscences are devoted to Rus - sia in peace ; five more to
Russia	LOCATION	in war .

		The book 's only merit lies in its somewhat inti - mate , even if wholly unsystematic , view of everyday Russian life .

		An unpretentious body of reminiscences of Russian travel is contained in Mr.
John Hub	PERSON	- back 's `` Russian Realities . ''

		Here again one finds only lightly recorded impressions , yet the average reader coming to the subject with - out previous knowledge could very likely learn more about
Russia	LOCATION	from this book than from any other one mentioned in the subjoined list .

		The physical aspect of the country is well described .

		But of history , psychology , and economics there is little , and that of no distinguished quality .

		`` Abused
Russia	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
C. C. Young	PERSON	, is a volume written specifically to demonstrate that in times past grave injustice has been done
Russia	LOCATION	by those western peoples who have presumed to judge her policies and measures .

		The author makes no attempt to gloss over those aspects of Russian politics and morals which give ground for honest criticism .

		But he urges that the existence of certain grave defects be not permitted to give color to the whole of western opinion concerning the coun - try .

		The passport system and the treatment of the Jews he condemns .

		But he contends that a candid study of the history of these matters will reveal extenuating circumstances .

		If not at all points convincing , the argument is of some weight .

		The book is copiously sup - plied with excellent illustrations .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 267 On the whole , one comes off from an inspec - tion of a group of volumes like the foregoing with two queries first L where the publishers can hope to find profitable markets for wares of this description , and , second , what will be the effect of the outpouring of this ephemeral `` war '' literature upon the public 's taste for the older and solider books upon European politics and world affairs .

		A VIENNESE PLAYWRIGHT IN ENGLISH .

		* The deep-seated American or is it an Anglo-Saxon ?

		habit of judging all art , and especially literary art , by its conformity to conventional morality is almost certain to prevent for a long time the complete recog - nition here of one of the subtlest of modern European dramatists and poets ,
Arthur Schnitzler	PERSON	.

		Over all his work , or at least over all of it that has been translated into English , there hangs what our popular critics are sure to interpret as the poisonous miasma from a very morbid kind of life , it is so difficult for most of us to see in an artist 's preoccupation with erotic psychology , and with other forms of nevrosity , anything but an unhealthy dwelling upon unpleasant subjects .

		In fact , this general impatience with attempts to ex - press fine shades of temperament , this blind - ness in respect to artistic experiment and exploration in hazy borderlands of expe - rience , may easily cause
Schnitzler	PERSON	's books to be anathematized , unless they are cast aside as merely dull and unnatural , by those who fail to penetrate their allusive delicacy and their witty indirectness .

		And yet
Schnitzler	PERSON	is becoming fairly well known this side the water .

		demanding no purpose , no responsibility , no continuity , and no finality in love and life , is a figure that reappears again and again in
Schnitzler	PERSON	's work .

		Under the name of
Fritz	PERSON	, in '' Playing at Love , '' he loses his superficial resemblance to an Oscar Wilde hero , and becomes at once more recognizable and more hateful , for this tragedy shows with the ut - most poignancy the horror that may result from light loving when on one side there is serious passion and on the other merely a wish for diversion .

		Prince Egon , another version of the same type , who saunters not very gracefully through the play entitled ''
Countess Mizzie	PERSON	, '' has better luck than his fellows ; but this is entirely because he is thrown into relations with a wpman of strong nature , and not because he is self-controlled .

		The background of all these plays , as of most of
Schnitzler	PERSON	's novels and dramas , is the complex and highly sophisticated Viennese society in which he has lived .

		It is a world less fixed than ours , a world of loose ends , of shifting , dizzily shifting , values , where people are to each other like chameleons col - ored by passing situations , and where ideas have no reality and no meaning except as they rise mist-like from sensations delicious or painful but always teasing .

		Our own familiars , business , politics , social reform , appear only as flickering shadows on a wall , cast up from a window giving on a crowded street or court without .

		Of these shadows the most recurrent seems to bear a vague rela - tion to political events ; and in these times of Austrian struggle , it looms up in large and sinister outline .

		National disunion , class hatred and distrust are evident enough ; a corrupt and hypocritical bureaucracy , self - interested reformers and a stupid public , may help to explain the present crookedness of events .

		Not that any of them are stressed at all ; indeed , only in `` Professor Bernardi '' does a political intrigue really condition a plot , and even here it is held well in sub - ordination to the play 's chief interest , the character of the doctor-professor .

		In the five brief acts of `` Professor Ber - nardi , ''
Schnitzler	PERSON	comes as close as so de - tached an observer could ever come to working out a distinct thesis , possibly because some of his own or his father 's experiences as a physician have entered directly into the situ - ation dramatized .

		The protagonist , a Jewish surgeon of distinction , is driven from his posi - tion at the head of a large charity hospital , hounded out of professional life , and finally sent to prison because he refuses to allow a Christian priest to make miserable with ques - tions and threats a dying `` sinner 's '' last 268 THE DIAL -LSB- Sept , 30 hours .

		Dr.
Bernard !	PERSON

		accepts all the tragic consequences of his act as inevitable in such a society , and insists that they are absolutely without effect upon his real self .

		So inde - pendent and so profoundly clear-sighted is he , so sure of the Tightness of his judgments and the value of his work , and equally of the impossibility of its being understood , that he passes untouched through what to a weaker man would have been the depths of humilia - tion .

		He says at the end of the play , in explanation of his attitude and in answer to the plea of his friends that he demand a revision of his case : '' ` All my plans have vanished ... When I started to write that -LSB- a book presenting his views -RSB- my wrath melted .

		From the accusations against
Flint	LOCATION	and his consorts , I drifted into Austrian politics ; then into philosophy and ethical respon - sibility , revelation and freedom of the will . ' '' '

		That is always the case / says
Winkler	PERSON	, ' if you go to the root of the thing .

		It is better to put on the brakes sooner , for some fine day you begin to understand to pardon everything and then where is the charm of life , if you can not love or hate any more ? ' ''

		* Oh , one goes on loving and bating ... I did not want to solve a problem .

		I only did what I considered right in a special case . ' ''

		This conclusion , which to the practical person might seem the ultimate destruction of all values , is actually the most positive kind of assertion of the modern individualist 's creed .

		The self-sufficiency which results from wide comprehension , the independence born of a realization both of the individual 's creative power and of the limits to that power , these are the central themes focussing
Schnitzler	PERSON	's as well as many another modern 's work .

		It is lack of strength , and so of self-suffi - ciency , that brings about
Christine	PERSON	's tragedy in `` Playing with Love '' -LRB- `` Liebelei '' -RRB- , and
Robert	PERSON	's tragedy in '' The Mate '' ; both go on living lies more .

		or less consciously for want of independence and the force to make their lives sincere .

		`` Be something , have so much in yourself that when you are deprived of position , of love , of every tie , yet there will always remain sufficient within yourself , '' -
Hermann Bahr	PERSON	's comment on '' Liebelei '' might be extended in its application to sev - eral of
Schnitzler	ORGANIZATION	's pieces .

		The positive and triumphant aspect of the creed is illustrated in '' Dr.
Bernardi	PERSON	, '' its tragedy in '' The Lonely Way , '' most powerful of the later plays .

		Ibsen never painted a tenser succession of scenes than the sequence of quiet conversa - tions which in '' The Lonely Way '' reveal through skilful characterization the story of a long-dead passion and its fruits , and which lead finally to a double suicide and to the still more terrible destruction of cherished hopes and illusions .

		Anatol , aged and dis - satisfied , reappears here as
Julian	PERSON	, a bitterly satiric portrait of the artistic dilettante who was drawn so much more tolerantly in the earlier dialogues .

		His actual unhappy loneli - ness is , however , no greater than that of any other person in the group ; mutual incompre - hension and consequent isolation are the rule of life , and the working-out to this realization by all the characters makes the tragedy of their situation .

		Again strength is lacking , not simply strength to stand upright with stiff muscles under the blows of fate , that is too grim and humorless an attitude to suit any artist with so much of non-Teutonic blood in his veins as this Viennese , but sufficient creative force to analyze and to enrich with interpretation every moment of life , no mat - ter how painful .

		Want of this superabun - dant vitality makes defeat a certainty to some unfortunates , as its mere possession enables others to triumph .

		Some minor studies of differing tempera - ments are exquisitely set in lower keys in the `` Viennese Idylls , '' a very inappropriately titled collection of six unusually moving and various short stories .

		The influence of
Freud	PERSON	and his school of psycho-analists is apparent in more than one passage of subtly presented mood , with its complex of emotion and of com - paratively unmarked external action .

		In each of these stories , as in the plays , the drama is primarily internal ; the tension is of the terrifying kind that holds during a nightmare ; the characters are , many of them , endowed with the almost magical intuition which gives certain quiet and unimpressive persons the power to draw from commonplace events a very real aesthetic satisfaction , through their power to lose themselves in the effort of analysis and appreciation .

		For this satisfaction there can be no rule and no pre - cise preparation , though incidentally there must be no prejudices , there can only be power of the sort
Schnitzler	PERSON	himself seems to possess to an unusual degree .

		Extraordinary receptiveness and sensitiveness , sympathies of the widest range , unusual intellect and cul - tivation , and a will determined to follow 7 the intricate windings of the human spirit into shadowy corners of hitherto stubborn reti - cences , with a patience -LRB- not always emulated by his translators -RRB- in expressing his themes through a transparently suitable style , a style vigorously direct and natural , picturesque , suggestive or allusive as the case demands , these are the marked characteristics of
Schnitzler	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		Its whole effect is of a
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 269 richness , a disinterested sincerity , and a sub - tlety which many of our thinner and cruder and more clamorous young writers could do no better than to study .

		THE BUILDING OF
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	.

		* A history of the city of
Washington	LOCATION	tran - scends the ordinary local history in scope , and acquires a national interest .

		The subject is one to which the
Columbia Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	has for many years devoted its attention ; the `` History of the National Capital '' by Mr.
W. B. Bryan	PERSON	, one of its prominent mem - bers , may be looked 011 as a resultant or con - clusion of its researches to the time of writing .

		This must not be said without a corresponding - emphasis on the personal factor , for ' Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	's work is not a second-hand summary of the monographs of others , but the product of extended individual researches in the ar - chives of the government and in contemporary documents generally .

		The first volume to appear covers the decisive period from the beginnings of the city to the British destruc - tions of
1814	DATE	.

		The planning of the city itself , the design and building of the Capitol and the President 's house , the share in these matters of
Washington	LOCATION	and
Jefferson	PERSON	, and of the archi - tects and engineers , are subjects which have more than a local importance .

		The struggle over the location of the seat of government , antecedent to the Residence Act of
1790	DATE	, is one which has been often de - scribed ; so that it is properly treated , in the work in hand , by a relatively brief but intel - ligible resume .

		The subsequent proceedings under the act are much less known ; and they form the object of a large and original section of the book .

		The part of President Washing - ton in the establishment of the city , always predominant in the popular mind , has already been brought out in detail by Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	's earlier publication of
Washington	LOCATION	's letters bearing on the matter .


Washington	LOCATION	's was the wise judgment and conciliatory spirit which secured the cooperation of the land owners , allayed sectional jealousy , and insisted on a stable policy in the execution of plans .

		Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	now has opportunity to do justice to other actors in the enterprise , and he does not fail to give them their due share .

		The part of
Jefferson	LOCATION	, especially , which has been obscured by that of his superior in office , Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	clearly recognizes .

		He emphasizes a point which any student of
Jefferson	LOCATION	's artistic inter - * A HISTORY OF THE NATIONAL CAPITAL .

		ests and architectural abilities would suspect , that in all which concerned the form of the city and the character of its buildings
Jeffer	PERSON	- son was the ' prime mover .

		The relative posi - tion of the public buildings , the rectangular groundwork of streets , the competition for architectural designs , were all his ideas .

		The estimate of L'Enfant , the French engi - neer who delineated the city plan , and was responsible for the radial avenues and for the detail of the design , has been the subject of more controversy than any other personal matter concerned in the founding of the city .

		The recent idealizers of L'Enfant have repre - sented him as a much injured man , whose ser - vices were neither appreciated nor rewarded .

		Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	, who brings to bear fresh material concerning other phases of L'Enfant 's career , takes a more judicial view .

		L'Enfant , who everywhere enacted the same role of brilliant -RCB- accomplishment , headstrong indiscretion , and disdainful rejection of compensations in - tended to be liberal , was temperamentally unfitted for the execution of the schemes he so finely conceived .

		In the discussion of the genesis of the de - signs of the Capitol and the President 's
House	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	is less successful , because he here ; draws largely on previous monographic works which really do not conform to his own stand - ards of historical criticism .

		Mr.
Glenn Brown	PERSON	's '' History of the United States Capitol , '' and other writings , have adduced a mass of impor - tant drawings and a selection of interesting documents , but careful study in the same field should have shown that many of his conclu - sions are in need of drastic revision .

		Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	does correct them in a few points , but repeats uncritically some of Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's assertions , such as that the original draw - ings of
Hoban	PERSON	for the President 's
House	ORGANIZATION	are not in existence , and that they contemplated a building with wings .

		He also makes bold to say that , as far as known , no other designs than those of
Hoban	PERSON	,
Hallet	PERSON	, and
Collins	PERSON	were submitted in the competition for the President 's
House	ORGANIZATION	.

		As a matter of fact the
Maryland Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, the collections of which should be familiar to a student of the subject , preserves the designs of four other competitors , together with one of
Hoban	PERSON	's original drawings ; and the
Coolidge	PERSON	collection in
Boston	LOCATION	has another of JJoban 's plans .

		By a very serious misquotation of one of
Washington	LOCATION	's letters -LRB- p. 203 -RRB- , Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	is led to give the name of
Hallet	PERSON	as the one essentially responsible for the revised plan of the Capitol adopted in
1793	DATE	, whereas Wash - ington 's meaning was that the plan might on the whole be considered as
Thornton	PERSON	's .

Sept. 30	DATE	These errors , although unfortunately im - portant , are not characteristic of the book , which in many cases says a final word on matters within its scope .

		AN AUTHORITATIVE HISTORY OF THE JAPANESE PEOPLE .

		* Notwithstanding the prominent place as - sumed and held by
Japan	LOCATION	in the developments of the past generation , it has not been easy for the western reader to find a scholarly and convenient history of that interesting land .

		Travel books and descriptive accounts with - out end were available , and few of them were worth the time spent in their perusal .

		His - tories there were , but so little had been done in exploring the great wealth of Japanese records that western students were ill pre - pared to present well reasoned narratives .

		The two massive volumes of
Murdoch	LOCATION	, and the papers of the
Asiatic Society	ORGANIZATION	of
Japan	LOCATION	, were the best sources of information available in English .

		It is therefore with a keen sense of appreciation that everyone interested in
Japan	LOCATION	and the Japanese must welcome a work which assuredly `` fills a long-felt want . ''

Earliest Times	ORGANIZATION	to the End of the Meiji Era '' is the final work of the late Captain

		Although written in col - laboration with
Baron Kikuchi	PERSON	, former Presi - dent of the

		minded observer , and the master of a clear and graceful style .

		The time was ripe for this exceptionally well informed foreigner , who was `` almost Japanese in his understanding of , and sym - pathy with , the Japanese people , '' to prepare this much needed brief history .

		In his own words : '' During the past three decades Japanese stu - dents have devoted much intelligent labour to collecting and collating the somewhat disjointed fragments of their country 's history .

		The task would have been impossible for foreign historiog - raphers alone , but now that the materials have been brought to light there is no insuperable diffi - culty in making them available for purposes of joint interpretation . ''

		One hundred and forty-three of these Japa - nese accounts are cited in the bibliography , and it is in the use of them that the supreme value of the present volume consists .

Brinkley	PERSON	's book there is now available , for the general reader as well as for the student , a volume of 731 pages , printed on
India	LOCATION	paper and therefore of con - venient size , which gives a well balanced his - tory of the Japanese people in the light of the investigations of both Japanese and foreign scholars .

		It is not too much to assert that in spite of minor shortcomings it is distinctly the most useful work of its kind in existence .

		It is hardly necessary to dwell upon the many valuable features of this comprehen - sive work .

		In every period considerable attention is paid to the culture , the social order , the economic conditions .

		The illustra - tions , 150 in number , are well chosen , but in some cases have been carelessly placed so as to represent a chronological period different from the text .

		Readers unfamiliar with Japanese will find the frequent use of proper names tedious , and yet Captain
Brinkley	PERSON	has avoided inconsequential details as much as possible .

		A single sentence , such as `` the political complications that followed the death of the Taiko are extremely difficult to un - ravel , and the result is not commensurate with the trouble , '' covers a period on which a considerable controversial literature exists in Japanese .

		The frequent realignment of parties during the years of feudal anarchy is most difficult to follow , notwithstanding the author 's effort to hold fast to the main lines of historical development .

		An endeavor to condense 1450 years of his - tory , and an uncertain epoch of mythology , into a single volume calls for rare talent in the art of omission .

		Frequently involved events must be described in summary phrases , and too often the dry bones of history lie
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 271 exposed without the covering of descriptive matter .

		And yet Captain
Brinkley	PERSON	has been able to enliven his text with many incidents , extremely well chosen , which portray the genius of the people and their leaders .

		An illustration , which has several points of inter - est , is the following : '' During the lifetime of leyasu , one of the most noted scholars was
Fujiwara Seigwa	ORGANIZATION	.

		By the invi - tation of the Tokugawa chief he lectured on the classics in
Kyoto	LOCATION	, and it is recorded that leyasu , who had just -LRB- 1600 -RRB- arrived in that city , attended one of these lectures , wearing his ordinary gar - ments .

		Seigwa is related to have fixed his eyes on leyasu and addressed him as follows : ' The great - est work of Confucius teaches that to order one - self is the most essential of achievements .

		How shall a man who does not order himself be able to order his country ?

		I am lecturing on ethics to one who behaves in a disorderly and discourteous manner .

		I believe that I preach in vain . '

		leyasu immediately changed his costume , and the event contributed materially to the reputation alike of the intrepid teacher and of the magnanimous stu - dent , as well as to the popularity of
Seigwa	ORGANIZATION	's doctrines . ''

		It must not be forgotten that Captain
Brinkley	PERSON	was evidently writing for the gen - eral public rather than for the special stu - dent , and therefore the absence of citations of the Japanese sources and the lack of in - cisive criticism in controversial matters are doubtless intentional .

		Notwithstanding the great number of unusual names , the text is remarkably clear of typographical errors , and misstatements of fact are rare .

		But that some should occur is scarcely surprising .

		In regard to the
Shimonoseki	LOCATION	complication -LRB- p. 674 -RRB- , the date should be
June 24	DATE	or 25 ; and the firing on the American ship did not take place until
June 26	DATE	, instead of prior to
May 11	DATE	.

		And exception must be taken to the statement on p. 675 which credits Sir
Harry Parkes	PERSON	with conceiving the idea of securing the
Mikado	LOCATION	's ratification of the foreign trea - ties by means of a naval demonstration at
Hyogo	LOCATION	; this proposal was first made by Mr.
Pruyn	PERSON	, the American Minister , almost two years before Sir
Harry	PERSON	arrived in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		It is to be hoped that this history of the Japanese people may have the wide circula - tion which it merits , and that it may con - tribute to a better understanding of a most interesting people with whom we are bound to come into increasingly closer relations .

		PAYSON J. TREAT .

		Although Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	has completed his '' Life of
Swinburne	PERSON	, '' we understand that the book will not be published until after the war ; when , presumably , we shall also be given
Swinburne	PERSON	's correspondence and his posthumous poems .

		RECENT POETRY .

		* The decay of the hopes which were excited by the early work of Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	is one of the tragedies of contemporary poetry .

		And his latest volume does nothing to miti - gate this tragedy .

		It consists largely of mat - ter such as one would expect to find published after the author 's death by those persons who ransack the effects of deceased poets for new material wherewith to make `` complete edi - tions , '' manuscripts , that is to say , which the writer himself knew better than to make public .

		Yet Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	has not died .

		The banality and immelodiousness of many of these poems are almost incredible .

		Once their author was supposed to be the herald of a new narrative blank verse of no little power and beauty ; he can now make such lines as the following the climax of the love-story of an English soldier and a wandering Moslem maiden : '' ' Hath ever , ' said he , ' such a feat of love Been known in this dull world as this of thine ?

		Was ever so much risked or so much dared ?

		Now to my mother will I make you known . ' ''

		The title poem , addressed to this country , is in heroic couplets of a second-rate eighteenth - century quality .

		In particular , there is a distinct echo of the gentlemanly Augustan who once described the grasshopper as `` the crawling scourge that smites the leafy plain '' in Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	's account of the yellow-fever mosquito as '' the fatal fly with baleful breath That bears on gaudy wings the buzzing death . ''

		As illustration for this poem , the frontispiece reproduces one of Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	's etch - ings of the Gatun locks .

		It is well worth having , and furnishes the only reason I can think of why any one should possess the book .

		Or , if this be ungenerous , another reason may be found in the single poem called `` Jesus and
Joan	PERSON	, '' based on a fine bit of religious imagination : '' When Jesus greeted
Joan	PERSON	in the After-twilight , When the Crucified kissed the Burned , *

		272 THE DIAL -LSB- Sept , 30 Then softly they spoke together , solemnly , sweetly , They two so branded with life .

		But they spoke not at all of cross , or of up-piled flaming , Or the going from them of God ; But he was tender over the soul of the Roman Who yielded him up to the priest ; And she was whist with pity for him that lighted The faggot in
Rouen	LOCATION	town . ''

		Of whatever is written by Mr.
James Ste	PERSON	- phens , whether in prose or in verse , one may be sure that it will reveal a whimsical , Iris-like personality , darting unexpectedly from boy - like farce to the most matured sentiment , and always a distinguished sense of style .

		His '' Songs from the Clay '' are the utterance of this familiar personality , conscious now of its imprisonment in sordid clay , and again only of the stars that shine down upon the bog .

		I have drawn this figure from one of the poems themselves , which is addressed to '' The Nodding Stars '' : '' Brothers ! '

		what is it ye mean ?

		What is it ye try to say ?

		That so earnestly ye lean From the spirit to the clay . ''

		There are weary gulfs between Here and sunny Paradise ;
Brothers !	ORGANIZATION

		what is it ye mean That ye search with burning eyes `` Down for me whose fire is clogged , Clamped in sullen earthly mould , Battened down and fogged and bogged Where the clay is seven-fold ? ''

		Close by it is this other , dealing with the same theme in the other mood : '' While walking through the trams and cars I chanced to look up at the sky And saw that it was full of stars , '' So starry-sown that you could not , With any care , have stuck a pin Through any single vacant spot . ''

		And some were shining furiously , And some were big and some were small , But all were beautiful to see . ''

		Blue stars and gold , a sky of grey , The air between a velvet pall ; I could not take my eyes away .

		I '' And there I sang this little psalm Most awkwardly , because I was Standing between a car and tram . ''

		The `` New Poetry Series '' devotes one of its issues , of less than forty pages , to poems on the present war , by Mr.
Laurence Binyon	PERSON	.

		They are sturdy , dignified utterances , full of feeling , but of such restrained feeling as an Englishman will show ; sometimes rising to really noble levels , sometimes tending to be merely oratorical , as is almost inevitable in the extended treatment of such a subject .

		At its best , no doubt because most truly lyrical , the verse takes up a dirge '' For the Fallen , '' whose partly irregular rhythm moves with a kind of sobbing pathos which is yet kept under stern control : '' They went with songs to the battle , they were young , Straight of limb , true of eye , steady and aglow .

		They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted , They fell with their faces to the foe . ''

		They shall grow not old , as we that are left grow old : Age shall not weary them , nor the years condemn .

		At the going down of the sun and in the morning We will remember them . ''

		They mingle not with their laughing comrades again ; They sit no more at familiar tables of home ; They have no lot in our labour of the day-time ; They sleep beyond
England	LOCATION	's foam . ''

		But where our desires are and our hopes profound , Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight , To the innermost heart of their own land they are known .

		As the stars are known to the
Night	TIME	. ''

		The Poetry Bookshop of
London	LOCATION	has issued a new group of poetical `` chapbooks , '' whose rather garish paper covers , adorned with woodcuts of somewhat affected crudity , en - close widely varying contents .

		The only one of them which has appealed to me as of dis - tinctive interest is Miss Cornford 's '' Spring Morning . ''

		This little collection , unpreten - tious and naive in tone , represents a real indi - viduality and a gift for rapid , concentrated effectiveness of expression ^ Take , for exam - ple , this sketch of a child 's point of view : '' My father 's friend came once to tea .

		He laughed and talked .

		He spoke to me .

		But in another week they said That friendly pink-faced man was dead . ''

		` How sad , ' they said ; ` the best of men ' So I said too , ' How sad ' ; but then Deep in my heart I thought with pride : ' I know a person who has died . ' ''

		Or this , of `` Autumn Morning at
Cambridge	LOCATION	'' : '' Down in the town , off the bridges and the grass They are sweeping up the leaves to let the people pass ; Sweeping up the old leaves , golden-reds and browns , While the men go to lecture with the wind in their gowns . ''

		Greater
England	LOCATION	is represented by a vol - ume from an Australian poet , Miss
Dorothea Mackellar	PERSON	, whose verse , it appears , has be - come known before this in her own continent .

		The larger world should make her acquain - tance , for not only does she present some vivid glimpses of her own unfamiliar land , but her art shows a fluent sense of both color and melody , that catches the attention apart from the incidental interest of the back -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 273 ground .

		Color most of all ; one poem cele - brates the joy of it in a veritable hymn of praise for `` saffron sunset clouds , and lark - spur mountains , '' for '' nights of blue and pearl , '' for '' beaches yellow as sunburnt wheat , '' and the `` wide purple sea . ''

		In others the pageant of Australian landscapes is made to pass by : '' The tragic ring-barked forests Stark white beneath the moon , The sapphire-misted mountains , The hot gold hush of noon .

		Green tangle of the brushes Where lithe lianas coil , And orchids deck the tree-tops And ferns the crimson soil . ''

		Or thanks are given '' For the pine-tree like a church-spire , that grows upon the ridge , For the lizard at its foot , ... '' And the luminous red leaves of the sapling gums in
spring	DATE	, And the fen-lake 's reed-grown marge . ''

		Space must also be found for some lines from a charmingly facile and intimate lyric called '' The Explorer '' : ' Had I been Adam in Eden-glade I should have climbed the wall Or ever the Woman found the fruit , Crimson and ripe to fall ... '' I 'd think of naught save the wall , but gain Over the other side A fair mixed world of evil and good , Chancy and wild and wide ... '' Had I been
Adam	PERSON	in Par-adise I should ha ' climbed the wall ; T want not only the sweet of life But all all all ! ''

		Turn we now to our own country .

		A sec - ond book of verse by
Fannie Stearns Davis	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Mrs.
Gifford	PERSON	-RRB- will find readers to welcome it who have known a number of the poems in familiar periodicals , as well as those who enjoyed the writer 's earlier volume .

		The title-poem of '' Crack o ' Dawn '' is wrought about the same theme as
William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	's ''
Gloucester Moors	PERSON	, '' and all through the book runs the like interweaving of joy in nature with a sense of world-sorrow because of the sins and inadequacies of society . ''

		How dare I drink heaven-dew While those I love drink death ? ''

		This is the poignant query of so many voices of our generation .

		Mrs.
Gifford	PERSON	seems just a little too insistent on the sorrow that under - lies all human experience .

		I have always resented the type of cradle-song which con - cludes by intimating to the infant that '' sor - row is coming by-and-by , '' or that `` soon comes the sleep that has no waking , '' or other such undeniably true generalization .

		For , since the lyric deals with momentary feeling , not with the exposition of the whole subject , it is right that at times it should confine itself to the absolutely simple joy , if we are still capable of having simple joys .

		In one of the most pleasant of her poems Mrs.
Gifford	PERSON	takes precisely this point of view : '' The hills are green and simple folk ; The wind is quick with comrade-calls ; White wayside apple-trees , and smoke Of woodfires , and bright waterfalls , '' They never bid me understand .

		They never say , ' You too must die . '

		I will go take the wind 's cold hand .

		God knows , I can not always cry ! ''

		And we are grateful for this .

		The only trou - ble is , the thing is evidently done with an effort , the poet doth protest too much ; if she were really convinced that she need not always cry , she would have said nothing about it .

		But it would be unjust to imply that this mood of half-tones or mixed tones dominates the whole collection .

		Sometimes , as in '' Wild Weather , '' there is real freedom from the doubts of both philosopher and sociologist : '' My lips with salt were wild to taste .

		I leapt : I shouted and made haste : Along the cliffs , above the sea , With mad red mantle waving free , And hair that whipped the eyes of me . ''

		And there was no one else but he , That great grim wind who called to me .

		Oh , we ran far !

		Oh , we ran free ! ''

		Nor could anything be more simply and vera - ciously happy than the `` Fire Fantasy '' of the child who lies dreaming '' on the fox-skin , white As silver under the leaping light , White and furry and kind and warm , -LSB- While -RSB- out by the window scurries the storm . ''

		Mrs.
Gifford	PERSON	's technique is noticeably sure and sound .

		Though touched by the Welt - schmerz , she has not been convicted of the sin - fulness of true rhythm or melodious rhyme , and one may follow her through many lyrical movements with security and pleasure .

		The limitations of her lyrical art are summed up in saying that it is wholly feminine ; perhaps not one of her poems fails to show the lam - bent , flame-like feeling that we know to be characteristic of the poetic in woman .

		A more symmetrical or completer art demands , , of course , the sense that the masculine'is pres - ent in it too .

		Mr.
Brian Hooker	PERSON	has collected his poems for the first time , and one may assume that he includes work going back to comparatively youthful years .

		There is , at any rate , an air of youthfulness about the volume , not in 274 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 30	DATE	the way of immaturity , much less of sauei - ness , but from the sense that here is abundant experimentation interesting as promise rather than as accomplishment .

		There are ballades and sonnets , melodious and well wrought ; there are couplets and blank verse ; there are songs which show the none too common sense of that which in words is really akin to music ; and there are pleasing experiments in a new form , akin to the triolet , which the inventor names the '' Turn . ''

		Of this last an example may be given at once : '' Love came back to look once more On the home he long had known : Found a vine across the door , Found the fountain foul and dry , Found the garden overgrown ; Heard at last a tired sigh .

		Love came back to look once more . ''

		But in all this one is not sure that one knows where the poet himself is to be found what it is , after preparation and prelude , that he wishes to say .

		The most extensive composi - tion in the volume is '' The `` White Cat , '' a symbolic fairy-poem on the theme `` That every quest is but a coming home '' ; the nar - rative is lucid and facile , but memorable less for itself than for some fine passages of ornate Tennysonian blank verse .

		Since for the pres - ent reviewer this term '' Tennysonian '' is not the malignant reproach which it becomes on the lips of many of our contemporaries , let me quote from one or two of these passages , in evidence of the good hope we may have for Mr.
Hooker	PERSON	's further work in the field of epic or romance : '' Clambering a rocky slope interminable , He reached the height , and paused , and standing there Fronted a firm wind , and the mist fell , blown Asunder , and the stars shone .

		All around , Vast mountains bulked against an ebony sky League beyond league , crested with snow , and floored With sea-green pines ; as though the almighty deep , Heaving his foamy legions to the war Of the four winds , hung suddenly motionless A storm in stone . '' ''

		Slowly as one that from the house of death Bitterly escaping , swims through fires of pain And storms of fever , and black floods of sleep , Till at the last his soul , returning , clears Faint eyes , and with a dim wonder he sees The strange walls of his own remembered room , Where the gray day , through curtains closely drawn , Sickens the lamplight , and the house is still . ''

		If that sort of thing seems old-fashioned , it does not follow that its charm should ever be obsolete .

		Leaving behind , however , as our generation is tending to do , the more conventional and ornate poetic modes , we find ourselves realiz - ing a problem of great concern in current poetry the new development of a verse style which shall seem to be very nearly that of common speech .

		The problem is not new , of course ;
Wordsworth	PERSON	set it forth clearly , but his methods and results in seeking to solve it were not quite so clear .

		Coventry
Patmore	PERSON	made interesting experiments in the same direction , anticipating -LRB- in '' The Angel in the
House	ORGANIZATION	'' and in other poems -RRB- a number of effects , both metrical and stylistic , which we are likely to think of as peculiar to the twen - tieth century .


Browning	PERSON	, again , showed what could be done with every-day diction by his method , and
Walt Whitman	PERSON	by his .

		But the present generation has gone to work with new seriousness to see how it can get both the full effect of poetry in prose , and the full effect of common speech in verse .

		So far as I know , the late
John Synge	PERSON	is the only writer of English who has accomplished the first of these things , and that because of his discov - ery -LRB- or invention -RRB- of an extraordinary dia - lect ; but that is not the question here .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	, in the second matter , was perhaps the first to do to perfection what
Wordsworth	PERSON	saw from afar ; and he is having a number of followers , showing varying degrees of inde - pendent power .

		A fresh line of experimenta - tion in the new diction appears in Mr.
Robert Frost	PERSON	's '' North of
Boston	LOCATION	, '' which has already been noticed in these columns , but which I am glad to have occasion to mention again because , having first appeared and won atten - tion in
England	LOCATION	, the book is now reissued with an American imprint .

		There are few better examples of success in this direction than two or three of the poems in Mr.
Mack	PERSON	- aye 's new volume , '' The Present Hour , '' especially the one called '' Fight , '' which opens the collection , and that called '' School , '' writ - ten as a tribute to an old
New England	LOCATION	acad - emy .

		Note passages like these : '' Jock rammed his cap And rubbed a numb ear with the furry flap , Then bolted like a faun , Bounding through shin-deep sleigh-ruts in his shaggy brawn , Blowing white frost-wreaths from red mouth agap Till , in a gabled porch beyond the store , He burst the door . '' ''

		He dropped his hoe , but sudden stooped again And raised it where it fell .

		Nothing he spoke , But bent his knee and crack !

		the handle broke Splintering .

		With glare of pain , He flung the pieces down , and stamped upon them ; then Like one who leaps out naked from his cloak Ran . '

		Here , come back !

		Where are ye bound you fool ? '

		He cried ' To school ! ' ''

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 275 The whole of both poems should be consid - ered by any who have been led to believe that , in order to secure the effect of freedom , veracity , and directness , it is necessary to abandon the limitations of a fixed rhythmical form or the reasonable restraints and digni - ties of a sound style .

		I do not here undertake to speak of Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	's volume as a whole , for it is already not of `` the present hour , '' but of that year
1914	DATE	which occurred so very long ago ; and its chief contents have become more or less familiar in periodicals .

		Like most of the author 's work , it is notable for a wholesome combination of sincerity and dig - nity .

		It is consoling to contrast the simple but high feeling and expression of the two poems that deal with the
Panama Canal	ORGANIZATION	, with the meretricious tawdriness of Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	's composition on the same subject .

		From that made in honor of Colonel Goethals I quote the opening stanzas : '' A man went down to
Panama Where	LOCATION	many a man had died To slit the sliding mountains And lift the eternal tide : A man stood up in
Panama	LOCATION	, And the mountains stood aside . ''

		The Power that wrought the tide and peak Wrought mightier the seer ; And the One who made the isthmus He made the engineer , And the good God he made Goethals To cleave the hemisphere . ''

		Perhaps the only thing one is tempted to wish for , in these poems of Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	's , is something more of the elan vital , the flaming lyrical glow and warmth , which characterize the last volume of our present list ; and , by the same token , one might covet for Mr.
Wit	PERSON	- ter Bynner a bit of Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	's restraint and sense of form .

		Even without it , '' The New World '' is a notable , a really golden book .

		This I say in the face of prejudices of which the reader of this journal has already become aware , and which force me to add that a modicum of metrical firmness and soberness , just by way of alternation let us say with the unhemmed , flood-like flowing and splashing of his fine eloquences , would cer - tainly better the work .

		Better it , that is , for those who do not find essential satisfaction in the form of lines like these : ''
Celia	PERSON	, hold out your hand , Or anyone in any field or street , hold out your hand And I can see it pulse the massive climb And dip Of this
America	LOCATION	, My ship ! ''

		Whitman , by the explicit announcement of the poet , is in part his inspiration ; but I do not find either in the occasional sprawling Whitmanesque versification , or in the unrea - soned Whitman-like outpourings of a kind of chaotic , mystical patriotism , the new values of `` The New World . ''

		There is a warm , lovable sociology here ; and there is a relig - ious philosophy , seemingly somewhat Hindu in character , though the writer distinguishes it from
Hinduism	LOCATION	; but as I know only just enough of either sociology or philosophy to be suspicious of the soundness of Mr.
Byn	PERSON	- ner 's doctrines , as such , I can not value the book by them .

		But that does not matter .


Wordsworth	PERSON	said of his `` Intimations '' ode that he had made use of certain notions , '' as a poet , '' without bothering as to whether or not they were demonstrably true ; and that is certainly what most of us do in reading his great poem .

		So here ; those of us who can not follow Mr.
Bynner	PERSON	's transcendental socialism and pantheism -LRB- I use neither word with technical accuracy -RRB- may rejoice in the clouds of glory which they trail as they come , and I do not mean mere beauty of figure and word , but nobility and loveliness of thought and feeling .

		There is a great woman portrayed in this poem ; and the reader is led , with a passionate skill which he is likely not to realize or understand , to follow the revelation of her spirit , and at the end to feel , as the poet represents himself as feeling , that he has made , and lost , and yet not lost , a friend .

		At times Mr.
Bynner	PERSON	's style gives us new examples of that search for directness and veracity which we have been remarking in others : '' Be my reply Challenge to poets who , with tinkling tricks , Meet life and pass it by . '

		Beauty / they ask , ' in politics ? ' '

		If you put it there , ' say I. '' At other times it rises and soars yet with - out altogether losing its directness on flights which to seek to follow is a rich new experience .

		I know of nothing in recent verse finer than this strophe , in a meditation on the nature of everlastingness : '' Therefore , O spirit , as a runner strips Upon a windy afternoon , Be unencumbered of what troubles you Arise with grace And greatly go !

		the wind upon your face !

		Grieve not for the invisible transported brow On which like leaves the dark hair grew , Nor for those lips of laughter that are now Laughing in sun and dew , Nor for those limbs that , fallen low And seeming faint and slow , Shall alter and renew Their shape and hue Like birches white before the moon Or the wild cherry-bough In
spring	DATE	, or the round sea , 276 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 30	DATE	And shall pursue More ways of swiftness than the swallow dips Among , and find more winds than ever blew The straining sails of unimpeded ships !

		Mourn not !

		Yield only happy tears To deeper beauty than appears ! ''

		That two such volumes as Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	's and Mr.
Bynner	PERSON	's should appear within a six months ' period is of itself an augury of confidence for American poetry .


RAYMOND M. ALDEN	PERSON	.

		NOTES ON NEW NOVELS .

		Is there to be a revival of the sword-and-cloak romance ?

		And is
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	's `` Hal o ' the Ironsides '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- one of its symptoms ?

		Here is a tale more readable than stories of its kind seem to have been for several years past ; and the point of view of the world , which has seen such abrupt transitions since
Europe	LOCATION	went mad
last year	DATE	, may now be favorable toward any attempt to interpret history , if only that we may gain from the past some clue to the tragedy that has just befallen mankind .

		`` A Story of the Days of Cromwell '' is the sub-title of the work .

		Read with modern eyes , one learns that the Ironsides were , in contemporary language , the product of an effi - ciency expert .

		Except for an oriental lapse into the improbable , which all the author 's skill does not quite carry over , the book shows that judicious blending of love and war which gives to tales of this kind their popularity .

		Following his '' Children of the Dead End , '' Mr.
Patrick MacGill	PERSON	shows the seriousness with which he takes his calling by a more ambitious work in the same genre , `` The Rat-Pit '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Like its predecessor , it is a sombre tale of humble life , taking its name from a
Glasgow	LOCATION	lodging-house for women , where no questions are asked and where life is to be seen in its most sordid aspects .

		An Irish peasant girl ,
Norah Ryan	PERSON	, gifted with un - usual beauties of soul and body , is made to yield herself to a middle-class scoundrel , after what most would adjudge an insufficient temptation , remem - bering the high moral standard of the Irish peas - ant .

		An outcast thereafter , she finds a single friend in an older woman whose experience had been the same as her own .

		It is a tragically realis - tic novel , evidencing marked literary skill .

		One acquits Mrs.
Bell Elliott Palmer	PERSON	of intend - ing to write a suggestive book in '' The Single Code Girl '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- , just as one exonerates her from intending to use slang when she puts it in the mouths of her most cultured and dignified char - acters at critical moments in their careers .

		But the fact remains that the element of suspense in her book is built upon the expected confession of a man 's immorality , and it is in the hope that he will disclose some Cazanova-like escapade that most readers will follow the story .

		Surely enough , the expected disclosure comes near the end of the book and it is n't half as bad as it might have been , after all .

		And , the man not being so very bad , the girl marries him just the same .

		What the moral is , one can not tell ; yet there is no doubt about the author 's intention to have one .


California	LOCATION	clutches the hearts of those who give themselves up to her charm , and Mrs.
Mary Hal	PERSON	- lock
Foote	ORGANIZATION	proves herself a thoroughgoing Cali - fornian in '' The Valley Road '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		She even goes to the lengths of contrasting the best
New England	LOCATION	has to offer with the best of the
Western Coast	ORGANIZATION	to the disparagement of neither , be it quickly said .

		The life of an engineer and of his son , an engineer after him , constitute the back - bone of the narrative , into which is woven more than one wholesome love story .

		The leading char - acters are Americans , but there is a background of immigrant life , of which we are dimly conscious , just as we are of this element in our national life .

		As one expects from a writer of Mrs.

Duffield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is in the Arctic that the problem works itself out , the girl and her two suitors there finding themselves confronted with starvation .

		The girl 's favorite of the two men had been opposed by her family ; the family 's favorite proves lacking in that elemental thing known in civilization as honor .

		The point of the story the old difference between man 's intelligence and woman 's intuition is only reached on the last page .

		The story is a good one , vividly told .

		In ''

		It is the lightest of froth , on the surface , where froth is usually found ; and what
Maria	LOCATION	has to say is largely drivel .

		But the froth indicates the vapidity beneath , and the drivel is a sincere expression of what that sort of woman thinks and says .

		The book is really a poignant satire , and those who believe that something is the matter with
England	LOCATION	at the present crisis can make good use of Mrs.

		With large powers of imagination , he is never satisfied with allowing the conventional to control the actions of his characters , and the jaded reader may find many a surprise awaiting him in consequence .

		Again and again , where a less skilful writer would have been satisfied to allow the narrative to pursue its customary course , temperament overrules and the story takes another and unexpected slant .

		Dealing with the Canadian habitant , the result justifies the method ; one feels that one has met real persons , and not the mere types of more ordinary novels .

		A young and popular novelist hears it said that all his success was due to his first book , of which his others are merely variants .

		BRIEFS ON -RSB-
STB	ORGANIZATION	\ v BOOKS . ''

		Manifestations of Economic welfare work in Liberalism '' would have been a modern industry .

		- in better title for the last book of the much regretted
Charles R. Henderson	PERSON	than the rather cryptic one that it bears - '' Citizens in Industry '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The central purpose of the volume is to present a picture of the welfare work done by capital - istic establishments for their employees the world over .

		It touches descriptively also upon those general social movements for the betterment of the laboring masses which such establishments are assisting , but which they do not control .

		The justification of the title lies in Professor
Henderson	PERSON	's doctrine that all economic movements for the betterment of the worker , mentally , physically , and morally , must be founded on a conception of the democratic solidarity of modern society .

		In their programmes for the socialization of in - dustry , organizers and reformers must realize that a feudal , patriarchal , patronizing atti - tude on the part of capital is unacceptable ; that our workmen demand of their employers and the
State	ORGANIZATION	recognition of their legal and political equality , and of their rights to the cultural fruits of social organization .

		Em - ployers and employed are common `` citizens in industry . ''

		The book is a compilation which draws on all the principal American and European sources of information , and which combines wide knowledge with an excel - lent organization .

		There are chapters on hygiene and safety in the factory and shop ; j on the improvement of the home life of em - ployees , from special homes for working boys and girls to wide civic housing schemes ; on the moral and religious influence of churches ,
Christian Associations	ORGANIZATION	, and libraries ; and on the training and work of welfare secretaries in large establishments .

		Happily , no fear of unduly advertising large American and European business houses has prevented the author from filling these chapters with con - crete illustrations .

		Two larger subjects , '' Education and Culture '' and '' Experiments in Industrial Democracy , '' are naturally treated with less thoroughness .

		In connection with the first , Professor
Henderson	PERSON	says an elo - quent and much-needed word against the plan for vocational education which would place industry alone in control of this part of the public school system , and thus give us a dual school organization , creating fixed classes of the liberally and the technically trained .

		But he makes only slight allusion to certain move - ments in modern education that promise a far-reaching effect on industry .

		In connection with the second subject , Professor
Henderson	PERSON	has to say something upon the representation of the worker in shop management , upon his voluntary participation in welfare plans , upon profit-sharing , upon recent theories of economic wages , and upon plans for arbitra - tion and conciliation .

		It is little disparage - ment to state that his attempt to cover salient recent developments in these fields is unsatis - factory .

		He should have neutralized his limitations of space by a more frank recourse to generalization , especially as his illustra - tions omit much that will disappoint the careful reader , any mention under con - ciliation , for example , of the protocol in the garment trades of
New York	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and
Boston	LOCATION	.

		But the book as a whole is such a conspectus of a complex field as we have long needed .

		It is filled , moreover , with an optimism , a faith in meliorism under the present trend of the economic system , that must impress those who were acquainted with Professor
Henderson	PERSON	's farsightedness .

		French faith Two little books recently trans - lated bring confirmation of he great war .

		French earnestness and devo - tion in the present struggle .

		The first is a letter by
M. Paul Sabatier	PERSON	, a distinguished writer on religious themes .

		It is entitled `` The Ideals of
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	:
T. Fisher Unwin	PERSON	-RRB- , and was written in response to a peace resolution passed by the
International Society for Franciscan Studies	ORGANIZATION	at
Assisi	LOCATION	.

		The Allies , he says , are fighting for an ideal .

		To think of peace before the goal is reached would be an abdication ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's , gran rifiuto .

		Hence , though grateful to w r ould-be peace-makers for the excellence of their in - tentions , '' we are somewhat embarrassed by the thought that they are more careful of our physical than of our moral life . ''

		Not '' peace at any price '' but that '' righteous - ness and peace '' preached by Saint
Francis	PERSON	278 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 30	DATE	is the goal , and
France	LOCATION	is determined to strug - gle to the end against a '' Kultur which is naught save worship of the sword and of the golden calf . ''

		The second book ,
Mme. M. Eydoux-Demians	PERSON	's `` In a French Hospital '' -LRB-
Duffield	PERSON	-RRB- , gives ample evidence that this ideal is backed by the heroism necessary for its accomplishment .

		These notes of a nurse in the hospital of Saint
Dominic	PERSON	illustrate the willing offer by the soldiers of suffering and of life in the great cause , as well as the devo - tion of their families and nurses .

		The book is filled with anecdotes revealing the entire forgetfulness of self for the path of duty .

		Touching is the affection of the soldiers for each other and for their officers , and the offi - cers ' praise of their men .

		All are conscious that they are doing their part for
France	LOCATION	, and that is the only thing that matters .

		This testament of a single line , found by a father on his son 's body , is characteristic of them all : '' If we are victorious , I beg my parents not to put on mourning for me . ''

		Nor is humor lacking , it never is in
France	LOCATION	, even in the midst of so much ghastliness . ''

		The joy of the spirit gives the measure of its strength , '' wrote
Ninon	PERSON	with a profound in - sight into French character .

		Written by a devout Catholic in a hospital under the man - agement of the Sisters of Saint
Vincent de Paul	PERSON	, it is natural that the author should give full expression to her religious feeling .

		One hesitates to criticize , surely any ideal con - solation that the troubled hearts of
France	LOCATION	can find to-day is worthy ; and yet one feels that this insistent sentimental reaction is a bit intrusive .

		The translator 's work is not all that could be desired .

		The reader is fre - quently and unpleasantly reminded that the work is a translation , too hastily done .

		, Mr.
Clarence Hawkes	PERSON	tells with memories of a blind poet f rankness and modesty the story and naturalist .

		Qf hig her -LRB- -RRB- ic jj fe j n ft gmall VQ -LSB- _ ume entitled '' Hitting the Dark Trail '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		`` Starshine through Thirty Years of Night '' is the poetic sub-title .

		Blanco White 's famous sonnet may have suggested this secondary title and also prompted the utterance : '' The sun at noontide showed me the world and all its wonders , but the
night	TIME	has shown me the universe , the countless stars and illimitable space , the vastness and the wonder of all life .

		The perfect day showed me man 's world , but the night showed me God 's universe . ''

		In telling the pathetic story of his blindness the author does not note the striking similarity of his case to that of
Henry Fawcett	PERSON	.

		A hunting excursion with a sport - loving father , a shotgun in the careless hands of that father , and the damage was done , leaving in each instance a flickering remnant of eyesight and a faint hope of ultimate re - covery , a hope destined in both cases to final disappointment after surgical skill had done its utmost .

		But while we know that
Faw	ORGANIZATION	- cett 's father made agonized endeavors to atone for his carelessness , we learn nothing of the elder
Hawkes	PERSON	's conduct or frame of mind after that fatal day .

		The mother , how - ever , did all that a mother could do for a stricken child .

		Tragic also , though in a less degree , is the account of the writer 's earlier loss of a leg .

		If ever a high-spirited youth entered on the struggle of life under serious handicaps , that youth was
Clarence Hawkes	PERSON	, and the story of the struggle is to be reckoned a memorable piece of autobiography .

		Ex - pressing his disability in mathematical terms , Mr.
Hawkes	PERSON	says : '' I am confident that blindness is a twenty-five per cent handicap in the work of life , no matter what profession you adopt .

		The blind person , in order to suc - ceed equally with the seeing , must put in one hundred and
twenty-five per cent	MONEY	of energy before he can stand abreast of his seeing com - petitor . ''

		More than that ; for if he begins with only three-quarters of the normal equip - ment , the extra expenditure of energy to bring the total up to that normal will ob - viously be one third , not one quarter .

		The author 's style is so good that one can not but wish he had more carefully observed the nice - ties of `` shall '' and `` should , '' which , it is true , hardly anyone does now observe , the more 's the pity .

		Excellent illustrations by Mr.
Charles Copeland	PERSON	and from photographs accompany the reading matter .

		Mr.

		melled book-maker in the world to-day . ''

		Boon : The Mind of the Eace , The Wild Asses of the Devil and The Last Trump , by
Reginald Bliss	PERSON	, author of ' Whales in Cap - tivity / with an ambiguous introduction by
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, '' all sounds engaging enough ; but the book itself repays even more than the title promises .

		Although copyrighted in the name of
Reginald Bliss	PERSON	, it is altogether im - probable that the author wished or hoped to evade publicity , even though he might be willing to escape some of the responsibility .

		The style , the ideas , even the description of the dumpy figure of Boon so like Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's description elsewhere of himself , all hint plainly that he had really no intention of concealing himself .

		But being what it is , the book is more engaging than if it were what it pretends to be .

		The publishers -LRB-
George H.	PERSON
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 279
Doran Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- speak of it as `` a joyous holiday in book-making . ''

		As far as plan is concerned , this description is accurate ; for it seems at first that the author is deliberately turning away from the gloom and strain of war to let his fancy cavort at will for the pleasure of an anxious and over-taxed reading public , to `` gyre and gimble in the wabe . ''

		If so , he soon forgets his purpose ; or , what is more probable , he was not really throwing out a tale of a tub any more than Swift was when by pretending to turn away from politics and the Church he focussed attention on them .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has things to say about the present times , vague , inchoate , ambiguous things in part ; and being the literary craftsman that he is , he invents a delightful , indirect , effec - tive way of saying them .

		Of course he pokes fun at
America	LOCATION	-LRB- under the pseudonym of `` Aunt Dove '' -RRB- , the ''
Encyclopaedia Britan	PERSON	- nica , ''
Aristotle	PERSON	, `` The Nation , '' Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, and all manner of lesser things and men .

		But this is only rhetorical padding .

		Boon ; the putative author Bliss ;
Dodd	PERSON	the Rationalist who was obsessed with the fear that some one might smuggle God back into the universe under some other name ;
Hal	PERSON	- lery , the hero of Boon 's projected book ; and
Wilkins	PERSON	, the literary opponent of Boon , and the little author of
Folkstone	LOCATION	, all these are merely so many phases of the mind of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	.

		He is using
Carlyle	PERSON	's classical fiction of employing straw men to foist his doubtful , unsettled , or inconclusive theories upon .

		What he wants to say , and does say with much poetic power and engaging naivete , is this : The race of men is inevitably though slowly developing a unit consciousness , a col - lective wisdom ; but meanwhile the Wild Asses of the Devil , who get into all manner of high places and can not be detected and distinguished from real men , are paying their Master by cutting up the most asinine tricks , getting the world into the present war for instance , and creating the effect of utter riot and decay ; and last most pathetic thing , even when the Last Trump inadvertently sounds a truncated note of warning and God becomes actual and visible , men will not per - mit themselves to believe that it is really God , though they may wish and pray half-heart - edly for the very sign they are at the moment receiving .

		Decorating and Evei T intelligent devotee of furnishing the home-making is glad to avail ment - himself of helpful books or pic - tures on this subject .

		And as a very large proportion of homes are now made in apart - ments , instead of in separate houses , such a book as Mr.
B. Russell Herts	PERSON	's '' The
Decora	ORGANIZATION	- tion and Furnishing of Apartments '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- is especially welcome .

		In it , the author calls attention to the fact that all the vast changes in methods of living , the bringing together of continents by means of fast steam - ers , cables , airships , and the telegraph ; the advancement of the sciences ; the growing ease of manufacture , all these have not re - sulted in a new style of architecture or decora - tion .

		American art , like American thought , being conservative , the antique has been cop - ied with avidity ; but that `` period '' rooms , however good , or an eternal copying of former styles , are the best of which we to-day are capable , can not be granted .

		The outlook is distinctly encouraging , as we may see by look - ing back some forty years , when taste in
America	LOCATION	was at its lowest .

		The vagaries of the
1875	DATE	designers had nothing to do with any new art ; whereas in the art movements of to-day , whether we approve of them or not , we recognize the mature and concerted action of talented artists .

		Their messages converge to one essential point , the necessity of free - dom and simplicity .

		To establish certain canons of this nature , to urge that apartments shall be furnished in a manner at once effec - tive , satisfying , and sincere , is the purpose of Part I. of Mr.
Herts	PERSON	's book , occupying about one-fourth of the total space .

		Part II .

		is devoted to the practical details , which are discussed in an intimate and informal fash - ion .

		Separate chapters are given to each type of apartment , from the smallest , consisting of only two rooms , with `` kitchenette '' and bath , to the sumptuous spaces of the '' duplex . ''

		In dealing with large apartments , the author faces the danger of over-sumptuousness , and the difficulties too often experienced by Amer - icans of `` becoming extravagant gracefully . ''

		The very important considerations of `` Win - dows and their Curtaining , '' '' Control of Arti - ficial Light , '' '' Bric-a-Brac and Pictures '' are not only described in detail , but illustrated by beautiful colored plates accompanied by descriptive notes .

		These plates alone form a liberal education for the amateur .

		Although in a field where personal taste counts for so much the reader may discover many points for his own dissent , he can hardly fail to find the book suggestive as well as entertaining .

		Our national F r th ?

		S6 wh wish tO knOW ^ ^ government and the
United States	LOCATION	government is doing , as well as what it is , Mr.
James T. Young	PERSON	's '' The New American Gov - ernment and its Work '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will be found of decided value .

		The work of the government , the regulation of business , the 280 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 30	DATE	development of social legislation , the impor - tant activities of the judiciary , all receive fresh and illuminating treatment .

		It is mainly , however , because of the point of view of the author with respect to the executive organs of national and state government that the work merits special notice .

		Mr.
Young	PERSON	believes in executive leadership , its fitness in a scheme of democracy , its capacity for ser - vice , and its responsiveness to sound public opinion .

		He accepts executive leadership in American government as a distinct advance rather than as a dangerous usurpation .

		In doing so , and in effectively presenting this view , the author has made a real contribution to the cause of good government in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The chief regret of the student after a perusal of the book is that some adequate attention could not have been given to local government , especially city government , as a part of the American system .

		Local govern - ment in the
United States	LOCATION	has suffered not a little from the fact that its relative impor - tance in the American system has not been sufficiently noticed in the existing books deal - ing with American government .

		In no other department of this subject has the devel - opment of executive leadership been more conspicuous than in municipal government .

		This omission , however , will not prevent Mr.
Young	PERSON	's volume from serving a useful pur - pose .

		Its merits will be generally recognized and appreciated .

		Its frankly modern view - point will attract and interest the student .

		There will be a difference of opinion as to whether the amount of constitutional mate - rial introduced in the form of judicial opin - ions and interpretations does not exceed the assimilative capacity of the average college and university student of first and second year standing .

		Power of clear and forceful statement are present , however , to aid in the presentation of this material .

		Besides , the average student needs a little strong meat in his intellectual diet .

		A resume of the Chinese Revolution .

		Now that the days of the Re - public of
China	LOCATION	seem limited , and the monarchy is about to be re-established , it would be difficult to find a more satisfactory review of the Revolution which gave rise to the Republic and of the significant events of the Revolution that ren - der the impending reversion apparently fore - ordained and inevitable , than one finds in `` The Remaking of
China	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		Mr.
Adolf F. Waley	PERSON	, the author , modestly dis - claims competition with recent major works dealing with the same subject , but he gives evidence of `` very close study .

		.

		bestowed upon the problems .

		.

		which the recent changes in that country have brought into prominence . ''

		So close has been this study and so true the author 's discernment that the daily press is now bringing us news of the fulfilment of prognostications contained in this brief treat - ise .

		Beginning with the period of the minor - ity of the Emperor Kwang-hsu in the middle of the
last century	DATE	, a time of stagnation and decay in
China	LOCATION	, the author narrates concisely but in considerable detail events leading to the establishment of the Republic , the plant - ing of seeds of new thought in the mind of the young Emperor by
Kang Yu Wei	PERSON	, the sudden and extreme reform edicts of the con - verted monarch , the resumption of authority by the
Empress Dowager	ORGANIZATION	and the crushing of the reform party , the brief terror of the
Boxer	PERSON	uprising and the ensuing conversion of the
Empress Dowager	ORGANIZATION	to a programme of reform , the death of the Emperor and the Empress Dowager , the futile reactionary pol - icy of the Regent , and the outbreaking and swift success of the Revolution .

		Events of the Revolution which were significant of future tendencies are carefully narrated and discussed .

		The character of
Yuan Shi Kai	PERSON	is criticized with impartial appreciation and condemnation of its good and its bad traits .

		Suggestions are offered as to the probable developments of the near future .

		These sug - gestions are in part being realized at the present time .

		The little volume is therefore not only an excellent handbook of the
Revolu	PERSON	- tion , but also a guide to the observer of pres - ent movements in
China	LOCATION	.

		The home Dr - ^ J h i ur E '' B O S t W i C k 's library 's larger thoughtful essays on library matters , originally contributed to '' The Bookman , '' are now gathered into a book under the title , '' The Making of an American 's Library '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		As indicated by their headings , the five chap - ters treat successively of books as room-mates , the art of browsing , the library as a literary laboratory , the boy and the book , and re - cuperative bibliophily .

		Primarily it is from the book-buyer 's standpoint that the public library is considered in these chapters .

		He who would form a collection of his own is counselled not to buy on the recommendation of others , but to ascertain and develop his tastes by a copious yet discriminating use of the public library .

		Far from superfluous is th `` e caution against buying sets and complete works .

		Not even the greatest authors should be exempt from the weeding-out process : and still more are many of the arbitrarily formed series or '' libraries . ''

		sold often through glib -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 281 tongued agents , to be viewed with suspicion .

		Amazing is it to observe , even now , how largely the libraries of the uninformed , the careless buyers , are made up of this sort of lumber , which hardly anyone ever pretends to read .

		Wooden dummies would be far cheaper and could be painted to look just as showy .

		In one passage the author laments the failure of public libraries to secure from book-dealers '' special consideration in the way of discount . ''

		But surely the consideration they do receive is not ungenerous ; it is much more , as a rule , than the dealer is justified in granting .

		With all the risks and uncertain - ties it has to face , the book-trade is not likely to make many millionaires .

		Excellent and rather novel in its form is Dr.
Bostwick	PERSON	's paragraph on the individuality and charm of the printed word , a charm which , as he notes with regret , the spelling-reformer is trying to impair .

		His concluding chapter considers the unrealized possibilities of usefulness in the cooperation of public and private libra - ries .

		Though called '' The Making of an American 's Library , '' the book should have meaning and value to readers and library - formers of any nationality .

		An enemy 's When thfi citiz611 f estimate of the ent country attempts to set down the national psychology of an enemy the result is almost sure to be unjustifiable disparagement .

		Mr.
Thomas F. A. Smith	PERSON	, an Englishman who lived for twelve years in
Germany	LOCATION	and claims to know the country and its people thoroughly , vents himself in the following vein in his book called `` The Soul of
Germany	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- : '' In summing up , Germans are characterized by unbounded vanity , love of secrecy , morbid sensitiveness , envy , absence of consideration for others , a strong tendency to revert to ' the ape and tiger ' ; Germans lack true sentiment and affection , but have a remarkable inclina - tion to reckless , brutal self-assertion . ''

		The only virtues which the author thinks may be unreservedly ascribed to them are obedience and thrift .

		One wonders if , for example , the honesty of the German lower and middle classes counts for nothing , or if the wide - spread love of music and poetry does not indi - cate certain finer susceptibilities .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	seems to place the blame for the deterioration of the German character on militarism and Social Democracy , although it must be evi - dent that these two forces counteract each other in certain important respects .

		One point in his invective may be granted : envy seems to be the most characteristic vice of the Germans , we have the authority of two chancellors of the German Empire ,
Bismarck	PERSON	and
Biilow	PERSON	, for this generalization .

		The re - viewer , who has spent several years in Ger - many , can also endorse the author 's statement that inveterate hatred of
England	LOCATION	was to be encountered among all classes long before the war , mixed with the hope that the day would come when
England	LOCATION	should be broken and humiliated .

		Perhaps envy and hatred stand here in the relation of cause and effect .

		An appendix gives some interesting statistics to show that crimes of violence and lust are much more frequent in `` law-abiding '' Ger - many than in
England	LOCATION	.

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		The Alligator and Its Allies '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is the title of a somewhat elaborate scientific work by Professor
A. M. Reese	PERSON	, who has hunted this giant reptile in the swamps of
Florida	LOCATION	and
Georgia	LOCATION	for the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Institution at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		The work gives an account of distribution , habits , and commercial uses of the American alligator and crocodile , and a brief statement of the characteris - tics and distribution of the old-world relatives of these giant reptiles .

		Much of the book is devoted to a technical account of the anatomy and develop - ment of the alligator , which will be useful in the anatomical and embryological laboratories in which advanced instruction is given .

		There are abun - dant illustrations , an extensive bibliography , and a good index .

		Mr.
Axel Moth	PERSON	, of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, turns to account his long experience as cataloguer in a useful handbook on '' Technical Terms Used in Bibliographies and by the Book and Printing Trades , '' which he further designates as a supplement to Mr.
Frank K. Walter	PERSON	's earlier similar work .

		Terms found in Mr.
Walter	PERSON	's book are , with a few exceptions , omitted by Mr.
Moth	PERSON	.

		The arrangement is alphabetical , in nine lists rep - resenting as many languages , English , Danish , Dutch , French , German , Italian , Latin -LRB- compiled by Mr.
Walter	PERSON	-RRB- , Spanish , and Swedish .

		A few puzzling omissions and irregularities , not attribu - table to the supplementary nature of the book , invite remark .

		While the English list gives equivalent terms in the other modern languages named , these equivalents are sometimes lacking , without apparent reason , in one or more of the foreign lists .

		Rather conspicuous , too , is the acci - dental omission of '' German '' in the second entry of the table of contents .

		Among the few defini - tions in the English list occurs an explanation of '' signature '' which fails to note the derived and more customary meaning of the term as a folded sheet , not merely the mark at the foot of its first page .

		A larger measure of comprehensiveness in its not very extensive field , with no attempt to make the book supplementary to an earlier one , would have rendered Mr.
Moth	PERSON	's scholarly manual more thoroughly useful and satisfactory .

		It is published by the
Boston Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		336 A WORD ON `` THE GENTEEL CRITIC . ''

		If of late years the critic has ever been weak enough to fancy that his homely slighted trade might be looking up a bit , that its processes might be a little less an object of suspicion and its product a little less an object of con - tempt , he has always been brought to his senses quickly enough .

		The ancient assump - tion that all critics are knaves or fools or both is , to be sure , no longer universally held .

		Some readers , some writers even , are now pre - pared to admit that Aristotle , however mis - taken , had his excuse for being ; that
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	occasionally talked a kind of fussy sense ; that Sainte-Beuve and
Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	-LRB- ah , let us never forget that tag about souls and masterpieces ! -RRB-

		were probably honest and possibly useful men .

		So , among persons of liberal mind , a place in the sun is granted to the plumber , the dentist , the undertaker .

		The critic is a rarer bird : and , for one thing , more easily dispensed with .

		One or two in a gen - eration quite satisfy the public demand .

		As for the rank and file , the Toms ,
Dicks	PERSON	, and Harrys of criticism , to name them in the same breath with the
Toms	ORGANIZATION	,
Dicks	PERSON	, and Harrys of authorship is merely absurd !

		On the con - trary -LRB- says tradition -RRB- , these fellows are , in the very act of criticism , self-confessed failures and parasites , doing their paltry lines for their miserable pennies , shooting their idle squibs , stuffing their men of straw , wielding their ugly and thugly bludgeons for gross -LRB- if minute -RRB- rewards and to no other purpose .

		Reviewers ?

		Bless us !

		There is no such thing as criticism of the contemporary , anyhow .

		A fellow just talks !

		These painful considerations have been brought home to me afresh by certain lively utterances of that genuine , story-teller and honest hater of shams , Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	.

		In his recent `` Atlantic Monthly '' paper on '' Quack Novels and Democracy , '' he hangs , draws , and quarters the fiction of the populace , , of '' our American hordes , who have learned to read without profit to themselves but with such huge profit to quack-novelists and publishers . ''

		You observe he assumes a firmly critical stance at the outset .

		A plain blunt man with no 304
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
Oct. 14	DATE	aesthetic theory might perhaps maintain that the profit our American hordes derive from their quack novels , and plays , and '' movies , '' and boluses , and religions , is certainly exis - tent , though not the kind of profit scored up by `` highbrows . ''

		But of course no responsible critic could listen to him : he would be mak - ing nothing , or next to nothing , of the differ - ence between true art and sham art ; and this is exactly the point about which critics , Mr.
Wister	PERSON	among them , have to be touchy .

		What Mr.
Wister	PERSON	deplores is a muddled popular taste for which pretty much everybody ` but the populace itself is responsible .

		There is democracy , to begin with , which forces a little learning upon its hordes , and turns them loose with that dangerous instrument in their hands .

		And there are the novelists and pub - lishers who deliberately play upon the weak - ness of these hordes .

		Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's awful example of quack fiction is the work of Mr.
Harold Bell Wright	PERSON	.

		Not being among the five million readers of that author , I can not judge the fairness of Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's strictures , but am perfectly willing to take his word for it .

		I have read a dozen well-selling novels within a year as bad as , on the basis of Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's amusing exhibits , Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's appear to be .

		What particularly interests me is Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's resentment of Mr.
Wright	PERSON	, and the odd turn that resentment takes ' .

		It is a critical , an aesthetic resentment turned , boomerang-fashion , against those who profess criticism .

		What he can not bear is that so great a number of his fellow-citizens should be permitted to read the works of nov - elists like Mr.
Harold Bell Wright	PERSON	as litera - ture .

		The plain blunt man `` knows what he likes . ''

		That is all very well ; but he ought not to be encouraged to think that what he likes is really , on that account , worth liking .

		Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's complaint is that somebody is responsible for Mr.
Wright	PERSON	and his millions and their muddled condition of mind and taste .

		There is Mr.
Wright	PERSON	himself to begin with : he probably knows the commodity offered is a sham ; there is the publisher , who certainly knows it , but means to have the pub - lic think quite otherwise ; there are the news - papers which act as his tools ; finally , there is the '' genteel critic . ''

		It is upon this last-named culprit that Mr.
Wister	PERSON	unexpectedly and , as it were , inad - vertently centres his fire .

		The truth is , as readers of his prefaces may recall , he has a chronic scunner against reviewers ; put one in his way , and he drops everything for the fun of having a crack at the rascal .

		What he honestly intends to be interested in here is the Wright-reading public .

		`` It is the read - ers , not the novels , I .

		am looking at , '' he declares .

		`` My quotations are purely to help us get at the readers ; and I leave criticism to our native critics who find Mr.
Wright	PERSON	like
Dickens	PERSON	and Shakespeare . ''

		So far this is comfortable enough reading for critics who are incapable of `` finding '' anything of the sort .

		Alas , they are the last persons whose comfort Mr.
Wister	PERSON	has in mind ; he is almost laughably in a hurry to make that clear .

		`` Lest certain genteel critics who think they practice more discrimination than this , feel slighted , it may be well to explain here why they have so little influence ... They do , tepidly , discriminate ; they do , after the fact , perceive and praise merit .

		They all the
New York Times	ORGANIZATION	, the
New York	LOCATION	Sun , the
Boston Evening Transcript	ORGANIZATION	, the
New York Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- very typical , this last one -RRB- , with others of less note , stand ready ever to be the first to hail a perfectly well established artist . ''

		Now this is specific ; this puts us where we belong , and pins us quivering there .

		The italics are Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's ; and here is , as it were , the lethal shaft : '' Until the subsidized press is broken to pieces , and the genteel critic gathers heart , not only to brand the bad but to report and celebrate the good , I doubt if there will exist any word too contemptuous for American criticism . ''

		As for Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's first clause , there is no room for disagreement : down with the venal puffery of a subsidized press !

		And down with the American publishers who strive to stultify the public taste by manipulation of '' reading notices '' and the like , as well as -LRB- this is the red rag to me personally -RRB- by their working assumption that one critic is as good as another or rather that the best critic is the one who shuts his eyes and slavers the proffered bone .

		Whatever the publisher may think of genteel critics , one can not doubt his private opinion of the press driveller .

		Yet it is the publisher who , poring over his press notices with jealous eye , chooses for adver - tising purposes the lurid and fulsome phrase the comparison of Messrs.
Wright	PERSON	and
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 305 Shakespeare , for example , without a mo - ment 's consideration of its source .

		Here , gen - teel critics must admit , is evidence that their influence upon the general public may be sadly small .

		Mr.
Wister	PERSON	at least takes them seriously enough to demand that they shall mean something or other .

		He plainly sug - gests that the bathos of our criticism is largely responsible for the bathos of our popular lit - erature ; and that if the critics were really worth their salt , they might be able to do something for our American hordes .

		Alas , the publishers are too clearly in the right of it : Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's public has never heard of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, though it has heard of Mr.
Hearst	PERSON	.

		Moreover , it thinks one fellow 's opin - ion as good as another 's : hence the efficacy for quotation of the soft-soapy lather stirred by some care-free underling on '' The
Spoon River Phenix	LOCATION	. ''

		For the audience Mr.
Wister	PERSON	is conning through his little window , the gen - teel critic does not exist .

		The genteel critic is probably just as sorry for that as Mr.
Wister	PERSON	can be , and yet may not quite see that he ought on that ground to be counted out as a hypocrite or a poltroon .

		He may well wonder where Mr.
Wister	PERSON	gets the impression that the best of our criticism of new fiction the best of our newspaper reviewing , let us say is either cowardly or backward in praise .

		I should think the best of our reviewers almost painfully ready to welcome signs of promise in a new writer to take chances , if need be , on the side of optimism .

		Not that it is part of the critic 's business to '' encourage '' authors ; nothing is more irritating to an honest reviewer than to be thanked for praise .

		But it is certainly the highest and pleasantest part of his business to find good work and to advertise its good - ness .

		Why should he be timid or reluctant about it ?

		As for the condition of things at present , it is hard to make out what Mr.
Wister	PERSON	asks of us .

		He himself sadly pro- nounces that there are no new writers of high merit : '' When an English novelist , who was lately in this country , asked four of us sitting at lunch , ' Who were the young ones ? '

		we had to be silent . ''

		Does n't the honest critic also have to be silent on that question ?

		Or is he expected to produce writers of genius , as part of his job , like rabbits out of a hat ?

		Hardly less just , surely , is the obverse of this complaint ; namely , that the best of our reviewers are content to lie down in the shade of known merit .

		I find them often , in default of other opportunity , taking up the work of '' perfectly established artists , '' not to the end of solemnly ratifying a popular verdict , but to the end of verifying it if possible and , if not , of showing why it is false ; or of tracing the development or decadence of such an artist 's work and registering its condition `` to date '' ; or , it may be , of suggesting a right direction for future effort .

		The last - named possibility is , some one murmurs , fantastic , rather like teaching one 's grand - mother to suck eggs .

		But there have been instances , even in
America	LOCATION	.

		Only the other day it happened that the fiction-critic of one of the publications on Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's black-list of gentility was writing a little appreciation of a very popular story-teller , who happens to be on Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's brief honor-roll of living American novelists who may be thought of without shame .

		The critic meant to make it a pretty careful study in small compass .

		He had a fairly clear impression of the kind of thing the novelist did and was capable of doing , and had read perhaps half his novels ; but he wanted to confirm that impression , and therefore , as part of the day 's work , read or reread a dozen volumes and found himself , in the process , surprisingly and enthrallingly converted to an altogether different view .

		It appeared , on the evidence of his work as a whole , that the novelist had all along been of two minds .

		His taste admired and pursued , let us say , realism , but his genius could not be diverted from romance : it was clear that he was in danger of choosing the wrong road in the end .

		Well , the critic had that little jump of pleasure which comes even to the galled jade when he finds a bit of succulence by the wayside .

		He put down his conclusions about the famous novelist without misgiving , being tolerably sure of his grounds . ''

		It was his duty , and he did , '' but with the expecta - tion , if he thought of it , that his office would be taken as an ungracious if not impertinent one .

		Fancy a mere critic telling a successful Artist that he is wasting his time squinting the wrong way !

		Yet this artist promptly wrote a long letter thanking his critic , not for having been agreeable , but for having hit upon the truth , .

		`` As to your conclusions , '' he said , '' I believe you are just ; and your arti - cle reached me at an important moment . ''

		306 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 14	DATE	Sweet and consoling hour for the homely slighted one !

		hour in which he once more assures himself , greatly daring -LRB- as the lady novelists say -RRB- that he may be not that figure of fun , the '' genteel critic , '' but a man doing a man 's work , not altogether in vain .

		As for the state of American fiction , of American art as a whole , does n't it need to be looked upon with faith and with cheerful - ness ?

		Must we -LRB- as Mr.
Wister	PERSON	really appears to do -RRB- encourage ourselves to share that '' certain condescension '' with which the Mr.
Edward Garnetts	PERSON	excusably -LRB- in view of their insularity -RRB- view us ?

		Few questions have ever been determined by a monocular stare , or a contemptuous wave of the hand .

		We have our limitations , Heaven knows ; but we are not altogether a peculiar paille in that respect .

		Certainly we shall not escape them by flying into a rage , or even by nagging each other .

		In the current number of the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' another novelist - critic goes , smilingly , far deeper into the mat - ter than Mr.
Wister	PERSON	-LRB- to whose outburst Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	alludes with good-humored depre - cation -RRB- has done .

		For the weaknesses of our fiction he blames not the public or publisher or reviewer , or outsider of any sort , but the novelists themselves .

		`` When our writers cease their futile experimenting , '' he says , `` and wake up to the possibilities of Amer - ican material , we shall have fewer complaints of the impotence of the American novel . ''

		Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	does not feel that we are alto - gether contemptible , in the meantime , and is sure that we are not to be helped by ill-humor or contempt . ''

		The bright angels of letters , '' he concludes , `` never appear in answer to prayer ; they come out of nowhere and knock at unwatched gates .

		But the wailing of jeremiads before the high altar is not calcu - lated to soften the hearts of the gods who hand down genius from the skies . ''

		It is said .

BOYNTON	LOCATION	.

		THE LITERARY STAGNATION IN
ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		If there be any truth and , personally , I doubt it in the theory that great wars pro- duce great literature , I incline to think that the explanation must be that wars are so supremely boring that the spirit of man , on emerging from them , leaps and dances in the sheer joy of escape .

		The tedium of the trenches has been recorded in the Marseillaise de nos jours : '' Nobody knows how bored we are , Bored we are , bored we are , Nobody knows how bored we are , And nobody seems to care . ''

		But the tedium at home still awaits its song - ster .

		In a physical way , of course ,
England	LOCATION	is active enough .

		She is pouring out men and munitions ; she means to win the war .

		But in the intellectual way she is completely stag - nant .

		It is impossible to think consecutively about Life , Art , Beauty , Truth , or any other such capital-lettered affair , with this vast pall hanging over one .

		Even when the war is not actually in one 's mind , it is in the background .

		And if , with an effort , an artist throws off his torpor and tries to write about the war itself , he finds that he has nothing to say .

		If I speak , for the moment , purely from a literary point of view we could believe
England	LOCATION	's war to be an unjust one , things would be more cheerful !

		The satirical genius at least would be busy : some of our writers during the South African War had the time of their lives .

		But fouling one 's own nest the normal occupation of the satirist can - not be thought of when we are all agreed about presenting a '' united front '' to the foe .

		The '' romance of war '' is badly blown upon , and there is nothing more dull than abusing distant foreigners .

		About a just war there is in an age which has outgrown war al - though it has not discovered a substitute for it nothing to be said at all that can not be said perfectly in a leading article .

		From the artistically creative point of view , therefore , the first twelve months of the war have been almost completely barren .

		All the better kind of writers who were in a posi - tion to join the forces have done so .

		Of the others , some have lapsed into complete silence ; some have attempted to write fine literature about the war and failed abysmally ; and others have , so to speak , gone into political journalism .

		Of these last , Mr.
Arnold Ben	PERSON	- nett and Mr.
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	have made the greatest successes .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	has been writing articles weekly in the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily News '' on all sorts of topical subjects , from Conscription to the
Position of Trade Unions	ORGANIZATION	and from War Pensions to the Selection of Staff Officers ; and he has been doing it with invariable and characteristic efficiency .

		As for Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	, he had the good fortune to be about the only intelligent man in
England	LOCATION	who had taken an interest in warfare during times of peace .

		The result was that the war found him ready equipped with the tactical ,
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 307 mechanical , and geographical jargon which his colleagues had to acquire in feverish haste after hostilities had begun .

		His pen was engaged early by an ancient but , at that time , not very flourishing weekly , '' Land and Water '' ; he contributes an enormous bale of comment , freely sprinkled with engaging dia - grams , to every issue ; and his success has been such that wherever one goes one finds the name '' Bellow '' or '' Beeloc '' on the lips of fat old gentlemen who , a year ago , had never so much as heard of the author of ``
Emmanuel Burden	PERSON	, '' `` The Path to
Rome	LOCATION	, '' and `` Cau - tionary Tales . ''

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, besides his '' Com - mon Sense , '' has written a certain number of war articles : but no new play from him appears likely .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, who , after his illness , is `` fitter '' than he has been for years , appears to be confining himself to the war ; Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is writing about the war everywhere ; and such of the novelists as have recently published new books wrote them , in most cases , before
M. Princip	PERSON	let off his re - volver at Serajevo .

		The poets Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	, Mr. Bridges , Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	, Mr.
Sturge Moore	PERSON	, Mr. de la Mare , Mr.
W. H. Davies	PERSON	, and others have almost all been completely or nearly silent .

		Several of them have had one `` go '' at a war poem , but the '' go '' was usually '' no go . ''

		Mr.
Bridges	PERSON	's '' England stands for Honour , God defend the Right , '' struck the typical note ; and Mr.
William Watson	PERSON	and Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	, each of whom has been flooding the press with pom - pous metrical banalities , can do this sort of thing better than their superiors .

		The frag - ments of real literature produced by the war may be counted on the fingers of one hand .

		Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	wrote a moving little poem about soldiers marching off and a critical doubter watching them ; `` A. E. '' has written several good poems about the criminality of war , which , one imagines , the '' Times '' only printed because it did not understand them ; and
Rupert Brooke	PERSON	, before he went to his death in the Dardanelles , produced a group of sonnets which , if they did not equal the best of his previous work , were nevertheless full of fine feeling , and admirable in their crafts - manship .

		But good poetry or prose not about the war has been still rarer since the war began .

		Scarcely any has been published ; and , as far as one can gather from one 's re - searches amongst one 's own friends , none is being written .

		How , as I say , can one expect it , in an intellectual atmosphere blended of ennui , anxiety , and disgust ?

		A few nights ago I was standing in a
London	LOCATION	street .

		High over my head not immediately over it , I am happy to say was what the newspapers , with perfect accuracy but rather tiresome iteration , describe as a cigar-shaped object .

		Faintly luminous , and with a row of small lights underneath it , the
Zeppelin	LOCATION	moved slowly across the moonless sky .

		Guns were roaring ; the little white stars of shell-bursts sprinkled the air ; and from time to time there was the crash of a bomb which meant the end of somebody 's home .

		It was not a very terrible or exciting spectacle .

		The curios - ity of the population was a little heightened by the slight nip of danger , and it flocked to its doors in nightdresses and pyjamas , staring up quietly and , in the end , with a certain dis - appointment at this strange intruder which was providing so very inadequate a display of fireworks .

		On the practical mind , the event no doubt impressed more firmly than ever the need for '' seeing the thing through . ''

		To the contemplative mind , the sight of this gas-bag , with its thirty men , shivering , possibly , with fear , dropping explosives upon a few harmless civilians in this immense city , was pitiful and a little comic .

		But whichever aspect of it struck the onlooker most , he cer - tainly did not feel inclined to go home and compose a song about Roses , or an essay on the
March	DATE	of the Seasons or the Heart of a Child .

		We are not visited by Zeppelins daily , but the distraction is only a matter of degree .

		A few miles away across the Channel that long-drawn-out tragedy is going on .

		We can think of nothing else ; and , if we could , we should feel sheepish about admitting it .

		How long this paralysis of the imagination will continue one can not say .

		It might be argued that if the war goes on much longer those who have to stay at home will begin to get , in a manner , acclimatized to it , and one by one pick up the thread of their old inter - ests .

		But , under modern conditions , that scarcely seems possible .

		During the
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leonic Wars , when communications were few and slow , and our comparatively small armies consisted of regular troops and foreign mer - cenaries , it was not difficult for an English - man to retire , say , to the
Lake District	LOCATION	, study nature , and not hear about the war from one month 's end to another .

		To-day every family has men in the trenches , every morning 's paper may tell us that they were going through hell a few hours ago : we are con - tinually seeing men off and continually shocked by the loss of friends .

		The lapse of time may possibly mean a little more free - dom for the controversialist and the satirist .

		The self-imposed gags which almost all writers of those kinds have put into their own mouths 308 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 14	DATE	may become wearisome and be removed .

		But the man whose business it is to produce imagi - native literature , and who , for that purpose , has to live , in a manner , detached from the every-day existence of his fellows , is going to be hobbled as long as the war lasts .

		At a time like this , the Human Being and the English - man come first and the Man of Letters is no - where .

		It may be that a few artists with an unusual strength of mind or an unusual frigidity of temperament will be able to pro- duce something .

		But , generally speaking , one will be well advised in expecting very little really important or impressive or beautiful work until the guns have ceased to thunder and the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of has begun its labors , j. c. SQUIRE .


London	LOCATION	,
Sept. 25 , 1915	DATE	.

		CASUAL_CO_MMENT .

		READING BY THE CLOCK is a practice that commends itself to a certain order of minds .

		Those who regard method as all-important like to map out their day 's doings on the clock-dial .

		A teacher of our acquaintance was fond of extolling the advantages of this mode of procedure , letting the stroke of the clock rather than one 's unprompted inclina - tion determine what to read or study , when to do it , and when to leave off .

		But to most hearty and healthy natures this is a quench - ing of the spirit , a fostering of pedantry , and a sure road to the dry-as-dust desolation of utter barrenness and disgust .

		Nevertheless worthy things have been achieved by men notoriously addicted to these methodical hab - its in their reading and , indeed , in all their occupations .

		Franklin and
Jefferson	PERSON	come readily to mind as famous for their self - scrutiny and their love of self-imposed order and method , with little or no margin left for that glad spontaneity which is the very breath of existence to those who regard life rather as an art than as a science .

		A writer in `` The Canadian Magazine '' throws some interesting light on a somewhat celebrated Nova Scotian of the nineteenth century ,
Joseph Howe	PERSON	, '' a leader in the fight for responsible government and an active partici - pant in public affairs till after Confedera - tion . ''

		He was founder of '' The
Nova Sco	ORGANIZATION	- tian '' -LRB- newspaper -RRB- and published , at a heavy loss , ''
Haliburton	PERSON	's History of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	. ''

		A man of no little achievement in the face of obstacles , he seems to have made that achieve - ment possible , in part at least , by his strict economy of time and his adherence to a pre - established schedule .

		Rising at five o'clock in the
summer	DATE	and at seven in the
winter	DATE	,
Joseph Howe	PERSON	ordered his day by certain rules , of which the following is a specimen : '' Studies Read books from 5 to 8 , or 7 to 9 , science and history chiefly , then breakfast and walk , business and newspapers till 3 , exercise and rumination till six , tea and chat till seven , write two hours , read till twelve . ''

		Another note for self-guidance was this : '' Intellec - tual occupation Review arithmetic , French , and grammar , read poetry more , speeches more .

		Scripture 2 hours on
Sunday	DATE	. ''

		Another passage , equally characteristic , runs as fol - lows : `` Company avoid none that is not bad , be polite and cheerful to all .

		Try to learn something from and communicate some - thing to everyone you meet , but make con - stant companions only of those from whom information can be gathered and the intellect strengthened . ''

		By publishing , with a com - mentary , these and other extracts from '' The
Howe Papers	ORGANIZATION	'' in the above-mentioned maga - zine , Mr.
Francis A. Carman	PERSON	has made his readers acquainted with a strong and attrac - tive , albeit somewhat precise and pedantic , personality .

		THE AUTHOR 'S THIRST FOR APPLAUSE , the insatiate craving for recognition , is probably the chief motive that prompts to literary ex - pression , as indeed to all artistic utterance .

		To get the full enjoyment of a beautiful thought or noble conception , or even of a comical con - ceit or whimsical fancy , one must feel that the enjoyment is shared by at least one other person ; and so the thirst for applause is not wholly an ignoble passion for self-aggrandize - ment .

		But those successful and widely-known writers who pay the penalty for their success and fame by being made the recipients of innumerable unsolicited confidences and man - uscripts from would-be authors are often led to believe that the hope and expectation be - hind all these artless demonstrations can be little else than that they will elicit prompt and unqualified sympathy and approval .

		An interesting word in this connection occurs in Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	's chapter on authorship in his latest volume of essays -LRB- reviewed on another page -RRB- .

		He says : `` The social and gregarious instinct is really very dominant in all art ; and all writers who have a public at all must become aware of this fact , by the number of manuscripts which are submitted to them by would-be authors , who .

		ask for advice and criticism and introductions to pub - lishers .

		It would be quite easy for me , if I complied fully with all such requests , to spend the greater part of my time in the labor of commenting on these manuscripts ...
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 309 I suppose that painters and sculptors do not suffer so much in this way , because it is not easy to send about canvasses or statues by parcels post .

		But nothing is easier than to slip a manuscript into an envelope and to require an opinion from an author .

		I will confess that I very seldom refuse these re - quests .

		At the moment at which I write I have three printed novels and a printed book of travel , a poem , and two volumes of essays in manuscript upon my table , and I shall make shift to say something in reply , though , except for the satisfaction of the authors in question , I believe ' that my pains will be thrown away , for the simple reason that it is a very lengthy business to teach anyone how to write , and also partly because what these authors desire is not criticism but sympathy and admiration . ''

		Astonishing and , to a con - siderate person , fairly inconceivable is the unrestraint with which these demands are made upon a busy author 's time and strength .

		A NOTABLE CHAPTER IN
AMERICAN LIBRARY HISTORY	ORGANIZATION	has to do with the founding and sub - sequent history of what finally became the free public library of
Trenton	LOCATION	, N. J. Dr.
Thomas Cadwalader	PERSON	, one of
Franklin	PERSON	's asso - ciates in establishing the Library Company of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	in
1731	DATE	, was for seven years a resident and a part of that time mayor of
Trenton	LOCATION	.

		Before returning to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	to live , in
1750	DATE	, he gave 500 for a public library for
Trenton	LOCATION	, of similar character to that in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		In
1776	DATE	this library was almost destroyed by the British , but some of the books were saved and did service in subsequent collections for general use .

		The great-grandson of this early benefactor of
Trenton	LOCATION	,
John Lambert Cadwalader	PERSON	, hand - somely supplemented his ancestor 's gift by supplying a much-needed addition to the present library building of the city .

		A re - port of the dedicatory exercises has been pub - lished by the library , and it contains a sketch of Mr.
Cadwalader	PERSON	by Mr.
Henry W. Taft	PERSON	, one of the speakers .

		Active as a trustee of the great
New York	LOCATION	library which he helped Dr. Billings to build up and put into running order , Mr.
Cadwalader	PERSON	was naturally also interested in the library of his native Tren - ton an interest that culminated recently in the manner indicated above .

		Eeaders of the Billings biography do not need to be told of his close and friendly relations with Dr.
Bill	PERSON	- ings , Dr.
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	, who was his -LRB- Cad - walader 's -RRB- brother-in-law , Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	,
Frank Millet	PERSON	, and innumerable other promi - nent men of his time .

		He had a genius for friendship , as well as a genius for unobtru - sive generosity and service . ''

		He had great vivacity in conversation , '' says Mr.
Taft	PERSON	, his law partner and intimate friend , '' and his pointed comment and witty repartee con - stantly enlivened the circle of his friends . ''

		He was also devoted to the rod and gun , and `` had difficulty in seeing how there was any salvation for a man whose soul was dead to the fascination of such sports . ''

		The promi - nence of the Cadwalader family in the Revo - lution , in the establishment of our national government , and in the public affairs of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	and
New Jersey	LOCATION	, adds interest to the history of this w r orthy scion of the stock , whose useful life ended last year .

		THE UNWRITTEN AMERICAN NOVEL , the na - tive masterpiece for which we and the rest of the world have long been waiting , need not remain unwritten for lack of subject matter .

		Our supply of the raw material for fiction is abundant and varied and of the best quality , as Mr.
Meredith Nicholson	PERSON	reminds us in his current ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' article on '' The Open Season for American Novelists . '' ''

		The songs have not all been written , nor the tales told , '' he reassures his comrades of the pen , calling their attention to the neglected opportunities before them and urging upon them above all the courage to be natural , to refrain from Anglicizing or Gallicizing or Russianizing their work .

		He bemoans '' the ill luck that has carried so many American fiction-writers to foreign shores , '' and adds : `` If Haw - thorne had never seen
Italy	LOCATION	, but had clung to Salem , I am disposed to think American lit - erature would be the richer .

		If fate had not carried Mr.
Howells	PERSON	to
Venice	LOCATION	, but had posted him on the
Ohio	LOCATION	during the mighty struggle of the ' 60 's ; and if Mr.
James	PERSON	had been sta - tioned at
Chicago	LOCATION	, close to the deep currents of national feeling , what a monumental li - brary of vital fiction they might have given us !

		If Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's splendid gifts had been consecrated to the service of
Pittsburg	LOCATION	rather than
New York	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	, how much greater might be our debt to her ! ''

		Without confining our hopes for the future of Amer - ican fiction to the possibilities represented by the turmoil and smoke of
Pittsburg	LOCATION	and Cin - cinnati and
Chicago	LOCATION	possibilities perhaps unduly emphasized by Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	we may reasonably look forward to interesting if not remarkable developments in our x imagina - tive literature as the swift seasons roll .

		In these days when our country is becoming the world 's creditor in commerce and finance , it would be gratifying if we could at the same time open a credit account of a less math - ematically calculable kind , and if spiritual 310 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 14	DATE	and intellectual values could more often find their best expression in a currency minted within our borders .

		A WINDMILL CONVERTED INTO A LIBRARY will not be discovered even by the most observant traveller more than once in a lifetime , if as often as that .

		A church thus transformed is no unheard-of thing , barns have been pressed into service for the shelter of books , and somewhere there is said to be a gas-tank re - modelled and fitted up for library purposes ; but where shall we find a public library in the form that aroused
Don Quixote	PERSON	to one of his first exploits in knight-errantry ?

		Mr.
Ed	PERSON	-
mund L. Pearson	PERSON	tells his readers , in the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript , '' that this strange sight greets the visitor to
Wainscott	LOCATION	,
Long Island	LOCATION	, He says further : '' The mill was first erected in another town .

		A date carved on the floor indicates that it is at least a century old .

		There are a few similar mills in some other
Long Island	LOCATION	towns not far away .

		This one was moved to `` Wainscott a number of years ago , and used for its original purpose of grinding corn until recent days .

		The machin - ery , millstones , and some of the grain are still there .

		Some of the latter occasionally sifts down on the books from the floor above a fact which amuses but does not bother the energetic librarian .

		She opens the library on several afternoons each week , and dispenses books to all who come . ''

		The collection , of books , he adds , is smaller than that of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, for instance , but the ventilation is better than in the nobly vaulted
Bates Hall	PERSON	of that great library , and there is no superfluity of red tape in the rules and regulations .

		It is a wonderful story that he tells us ; but seeing is believing , and so he publishes a photograph of this truly unique public library , with its four windmill sails still spread to the winds .

		ABORTIVE EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS are wit - nessed at this time of year in all our colleges and universities .

		Young men and women by the thousand start , voluntarily or under pres - sure , and more or less hopefully , on an acad - emic course leading to innumerable delightful possibilities in the way of honors and distinc - tions and ultimate fame and fortune in the great world beyond ; but how many there are that drop out of the race even before it is well begun !

		Any college graduate will easily re - call dim memories of perhaps a dozen or more classmates of that intensely vivid period of his adolescence , the first term of freshman year , who speedily and rather unaccountably faded from his view with the falling of the autumn leaves or the coming of the
Christ	LOCATION	- mas holidays .

		This lamentable lack of stay - ing power must have been in the minds of those \ vho shape the curriculum at
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	when they announced this year a new freshman course in '' orientation . ''

		In - struction in the purpose and meaning of col - lege study and college life will be given to all members of the entering class , and it may be that an earnest and sympathetic word at the outset will help to kindle the young collegian 's zeal and stiffen his backbone so that he will be in less danger of educational shipwreck .

		President
Faunce	PERSON	ventures the as - sertion that '' nearly fifty per cent of the stu - dents who enter some American colleges drop out before graduation .

		About twenty-five per cent drop out from our best colleges -LRB- except in a few small , compact institutions , where the per cent is smaller -RRB- . ''

		He asks : `` How shall we grapple with this waste and wreck - age of hope and intention ?

		Harvard says by freshmen dormitories ,
Princeton	ORGANIZATION	says by pre - ceptors ,
Brown	PERSON	relies on small numbers in classes permitting much more personal con - tact than in the large universities ; the fresh - man advisers ; the new course in aims and values of the college course . ''

		But , after all , does not at least a partial explanation of the difficulty lie in the fact that so many sons of rich men are to-day sent to college , whereas in the past it was the poor boys who went ?

		A HAMLETLESS '' HAMLET '' is so difficult to conceive that it has furnished the world with a universally familiar phrase applicable to all attempts to achieve a desired result with - out recourse to the chief factor contributory thereto .

		And yet there is a vague tradition that this '' Hamlet '' with the part of Hamlet left out was once actually presented on the .

		stage by a company of strolling players who , at a certain one-night stand somewhere , found themselves suddenly bereft , by illness , of the services of their leading performer .

		But the piece had been advertised for that night , and there seemed no way to save the situation except by acting the play with its title role omitted .

		The success of this ardu - ous undertaking is left to the imagination .

		In a very readable contribution to the Octo - ber `` Yale Review '' Professor
Brander	PERSON	Mat - thews begins with a brief rehearsal of the foregoing legend , but is constrained to add : `` Despite diligent endeavor , I have not been able to discover where or when this fabled performance was believed to have taken place .

		Still less successful have I been in my search for one of the spectators at this unique rep - resentation of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's masterpiece . ''

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 311 Then he proceeds to name a number of suc - cessful plays that actually omit , by design , each its leading or at any rate a prominent character .

		That is , the character is presented in the third person only , never appearing on the stage .

		In this peculiar species of drama Professor
Matthews	PERSON	places Mr.
George Mid	PERSON	- dleton 's play , `` Their Wife , ''
Sardou	ORGANIZATION	's `` La Famille Benoiton , '' and , in a modified sense , '' The Second Mrs.
Tanqueray	PERSON	, '' ''
Rosmers	PERSON	- holm , '' and one or two other modern plays .

		The entire article -LRB- '' ` Hamlet ' with Hamlet Left Out '' -RRB- is a curious study of a difficult device employed with subtlety and success by a few playwrights and wisely avoided by the great majority .

		BOOK-BORROWERS ' RESPONSIBILITIES are often taken very lightly .

		Hence the thousands of books borrowed and never returned .

		An individual lender can not well proclaim and enforce a system of fines and other coercive measures to ensure the return of his precious volumes ; but a library can and commonly does employ such a system .

		Its necessity is demonstrated in the statistical section of almost any library report .

		Let us take a few typical public libraries , large and small , and see to what extent delinquent borrowers have to be punished in the course of a year .

		The
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	collected , in
1914	DATE	, in fines on overdue books and in payments for lost books ,
$ 36,129.79	MONEY	.

		The
Boston	LOCATION	library , in the same year , received
$ 6,502.44	MONEY	in fines , and
$ 426.36	MONEY	for lost books .

		Cleveland reports receipts of
$ 9,283.70	MONEY	in fines .


St. Louis	LOCATION	shows
$ 2,682.64	MONEY	as the annual amount of fines col - lected , and
$ 249.15	MONEY	received for `` books sold , lost and paid for . ''

		Brooklyn denies us any clear light on this question by lumping to - gether '' fines and sale of publications '' at
$ 24,034.32	MONEY	.

		Grand Rapids collected
$ 1,139.70	MONEY	in '' book fines , '' and reports a total collection , in the forty-four years of its existence , of `` nearly
$ 20,000	MONEY	. ''


Galesburg	LOCATION	's yearly fine receipts were
$ 358.93	MONEY	.

		At Lincoln -LRB-
Nebraska	LOCATION	-RRB- the '' fines and penalties '' amounted to
$ 1,052.45	MONEY	, and `` books lost '' -LRB- and paid for -RRB- ,
$ 55.57	MONEY	.

		Wilmington -LRB-
Delaware	LOCATION	-RRB- reports `` library desk receipts '' as
$ 836.53	MONEY	.

		Many libraries refuse to aid us in this research , either making no mention of the yearly fines or including them in `` other receipts . ''

		But enough evidence has been adduced in the fore - going figures to prove the necessity , lamenta - ble though it be , of imposing legal penalties on those who abuse their public-library privi - leges .

		NOT THE LEAST OF LINCOLN 'S MANY BIOG - RAPHERS , and certainly not the last , was drowned near
Foxboro	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	,
Sept. 29	DATE	, while bathing in
Beaumont Pond	LOCATION	.

		Alonzo
Roth	PERSON	- schild will be best remembered as the author of '' Lincoln , Master of Men , '' a study of that quality of authority over his associates and contemporaries which , however lost sight of amid his other conspicuous attributes , was undoubtedly possessed by this one of our national heroes in common with all who before or since have taken the lead in great causes or arduous enterprises .

		But it was
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's way to gain his ends with no need - less display of imperiousness , and that was a part of the secret of his success , however much he was misunderstood and under-estimated by many of his contemporaries .

		The essential with him was to get the thing done .

		Mr.
Rothschild	PERSON	felt the appeal of this side of Lin - coln 's character , and was moved to enter upon the study that resulted in the above-named book .

		He was born in
New York	LOCATION	, in
1862	DATE	, the son of poor parents , or parents so situated that he felt it his duty to cut short his school - ing and become an office boy at
four dollars	MONEY	a week in order to contribute his share toward the family purse .

		But he rapidly rose to higher things .

		Besides journalism and au - thorship he took an active part in the work of the
Society for Ethical Culture	ORGANIZATION	.

		His attributes of mind and heart , as they show themselves in the retrospect , were of a sort to beget deep regret at his loss .

		EMBROIDERED HISTORY presents to most eyes an appearance so much more attractive than plain history that the historian 's temptation to supply the embroidery is all but irresisti - ble .

		To spoil a good story in the telling , by sticking to literal fact , is something that most of us look upon with some contempt ; to re - fuse to soar in the upper realms of romance is the mark of a grovelling spirit .

		Hence the popular acclaim given to such fascinating creations as
Abbott	PERSON	's '' History of
Napoleon Bonaparte	PERSON	'' and
Froude	PERSON	's not too painfully accurate pictures of the past .

		This inex - haustible theme of historical inaccuracy has given us a library of more or less lively read - ing , a fresh addition to which will be found in Professor
Hart	PERSON	's `` American Historical Liars '' in the current ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		Captain
John Smith	PERSON	and
Parson Weems	PERSON	and the late
Augustus C. Buell	PERSON	, with a number of others , are pitilessly pilloried by the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	historian for their refusal to remain content with the unadorned truth ; and they and all their tribe are at the end dismissed in this 312 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 14	DATE	biting fashion : '' Throughout this catalogue of gifted writers who transferred to history and biography talents that belong in the field of the serial novels , only one general com - ment may be applied : Whether they are forg - ing documents , capturing the choice pages of previous writers , or simply letting their fancy play upon a historical problem , they are all subject to
Joe Gargery	PERSON	's remark : ` Lies is lies .

		Howsoever they come , they did n't ought to come , and they come from the father of lies , and work round to the same . ' ''

		POETIC VISION AND GRIM REALITY are brought into startling contrast by certain recent occur - rences not far from
St. Paul 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		To more than one student of current history there has doubtless come / to mind in these days Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	's beautiful piece of verse pic - turing a walk down Fleet Street when Lon - don glowed under a foggy sunset `` like one huge cobwebbed flagon of old wine , '' and the soft sky '' Flowed through the roaring thoroughfares , transfused Their hard , sharp outlines , blurred the throngs of black On either pavement , blurred the rolling stream Of red and yellow buses , till the town Turned to a golden suburb of the clouds , And , round that mighty bubble of St.
Paul	PERSON	's , Over the upturned faces of the street , An air-ship slowly sailed , with whirring fans , A voyager in the new-found realms of gold , A shadowy silken chrysalis whence should break What radiant wings in centuries to be . ''

		From the '' shadowy silken chrysalis '' of actual fact , a few weeks ago , there certainly broke things radiant and astonishing , but also terrifying and death-dealing .

		The poet 's vision was at fault only in stopping con - siderably short of the vivid reality , and in postponing its fulfilment to '' centuries to be . ''

		A CURIOUS SPECIMEN OF LEARNED HUMOR is brought to public notice by bibliographers interested in the matchless collection of Elze - virs and other rare books in the
Warsaw University Library	ORGANIZATION	, to which recent events have directed the attention of book-lovers .

		The example of rather ponderous playfulness here referred to is in mediaeval Latin , and is thus entitled : ''
Dissertationum Ludicrarum	PERSON	et Amoenitatum Scriptores Varii . ''

		As this title indicates , the volume is made up of sundry facetious essays from various pens .

		Among these amusing trifles , the recreations of their erudite authors ' leisure hours , are to be noted a disquisition in praise of the gout , by
Bir	ORGANIZATION	- baldus Pirkheimer ; one by
Girolamo Cardano	PERSON	on the same sprightly theme ; one in praise of mud , by
Majorragio	PERSON	; one in praise of the goose , by the elder Scaliger ; and other pan - egyrics in like vein on the ant , the flea , the louse , the elephant , and the swan ; also an anonymous piece on the death of a magpie , a `` nuptial allocution , '' an essay on the art of swimming , one on `` the reign of the fly , '' etc. , all , including titles , in the language used universally by medieval scholars .

		The compilation , which may perhaps have served as a sort of ``
Joe Miller	PERSON	's Jest Book '' among the learned of its day , was originally pub - lished at
Leyden	LOCATION	about
1625	DATE	; but the War - saw copy is of the
1644	DATE	edition , which is considered the best .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		THE COMING - WOBLD-LANGUAGE , AND SOME OTHER MATTERS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In view of your comment upon my remarks , in your issue of
Sept. 16	DATE	-LRB- page 206 -RRB- , may I be per - mitted to explain what I meant when I said to the interviewer from '' The New York Times '' that we were being '' brought nearer to a univer - sal language , a sort of interlingnistic conglom - erate '' by the war ?

		This was no more than that English was becoming the lingua franca for uni - versal use .

		I based this belief that English is becoming more of a world-language than any other language upon statistics of usage nothing else .

		The English language is now spoken by more than one hundred and fifty millions of peo - ple ; German by more than one hundred and twenty millions ; Russian by ninety millions ; French by sixty millions ; Spanish by fifty-five millions ; Italian by forty millions ; and
Portu	PERSON	- guese by forty millions .

		Just how many persons have been using
Esper	PERSON	- anto during the twenty-eight years that have passed since its invention by Dr.
Zamenhof	PERSON	in
1887	DATE	, I do not know .

		But this I do know , that from an examination of approximately 20,000 words from the '' New Standard Dictionary , '' En - glish may be correctly described as an interlin - guistic conglomerate , for the following are the sources from which the words examined were derived : Anglo-Saxon and English 3,681 Low German 126 Dutch 207 Scandinavian 693 German 333 Low German through French 54 Dutch or

		A In the same issue of THE DIAL referred to above , your generous reviewer of my '' Essentials of English Speech '' takes me to task for saying that
Henry Howard	PERSON	,
Earl	PERSON	of
Surrey	LOCATION	, '' wrote the first sonnets ever written in English , '' and chides me for making '' no mention of
Wyatt	LOCATION	,
Surrey	ORGANIZATION	's senior by fourteen or fifteen years , and acknowl - edged by him to be his master in poetry , and commonly credited with having taken the lead in importing the sonnet into our literature . ''

		Will you permit me to say in reply that some things that have been '' commonly credited '' investigation and time have proved to have been incorrectly credited ?

		As examples , I need only to cite the well-known
Chatterton	PERSON	and
Macpherson	PERSON	imposi - tions .


Samuel Johnson	PERSON	's exposure of the latter brought the famous lexicographer a challenge from
Macpherson	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	is commonly credited with having purchased a stout oak cudgel and with having answered in a well-known letter that he would repel violence , and was not to be deterred from detecting what he thought to be a cheat from any fear of the menaces of a ruffian .

		But to return to the English sonnet .

		On page 304 of his `` Amenities of English Literature , '' pub - lished in
1841	DATE	,
Isaac D'Israeli	PERSON	says , '' The
Earl of Surrey	ORGANIZATION	composed the first sonnets in the English language . ''

		In the ''
Encyclopaedia Britannica	ORGANIZATION	, '' volume xxvi , eleventh edition , p. 139 , I find ''
Surrey	LOCATION	, indeed , expressly acknowledges
Wyatt	PERSON	as his master in poetry .

		As their poems appeared in one volume , long after the death of both , their names will always be closely associated , '' but in the original form of this article , which appears in the ninth edition of the '' Britannica '' -LRB- vol .

		xxii , p. 731 -RRB- , the statement is `` Seeing , however , that their poems were first published in the same vol - ume , many years after the death of both , their names can never be dissociated and it must always be hard to say which was the leader in the various new and beautiful forms of verse .

		.

		introduced into English poetry . ''

		The copyright date of this edition of the '' Britannica '' is
1875	DATE	.

		Dr.
William F. Collier	PERSON	, in his '' History of English Literature , '' new edition , dated
1894	DATE	, wrote -LRB- p. 92 -RRB- : '' Surrey is said to have written also the first English son - nets . ''

		In the '' Dictionary of National Biog - raphy , '' edited by
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	and
Sidney Lee	PERSON	, and published in
1891	DATE	, I find the following , under the title ''
Howard	PERSON	, '' in volume xxviii , p. 28 : ''
Surrey	PERSON	, who although the disciple of
Wyatt	PERSON	was at all points his master 's superior , was the earliest Englishman to imitate with any success Italian poetry in English verse ... Surrey 's taste in the choice of his masters and his endeavours to adapt new metres to English poetry are his most inter - esting characteristics .

		The sonnet and the ' ottava rima ' were first employed by him and
Wyatt	PERSON	. ''

		This was written by Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	.

		And now as to the other peccadilloes charged against me , I may point out that , in English , the correctness of a form or of a construction is not impaired because nothing analogous to it exists in the language , any more than that the correct - ness of a word is to be challenged because there is no other in the language resembling it in sound or spelling .

		Your gentle reviewer does not like `` equally as . ''

		Nor did
Coleridge	PERSON	, yet Sir
James Murray	PERSON	recognizes it , and cites
Francis William Newman	PERSON	as authority for its use .

		The expression '' no less than thirty '' is char - acterized as a '' questionable construction , '' yet is one that dates from the Old English Chronicles -LRB- 1121 -RRB- .

		It was used by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- `` Taming of the Shrew , '' act ii , sc .

		1 -RRB- , by
Steele	PERSON	-LRB- '' Tatler , '' No. 46 , p. 12 -RRB- , and by
Macaulay	PERSON	in his Essay on
Warren Hastings	PERSON	`` No less than twenty Arti - cles of impeachment . ''

		Again , the reviewer writes '' of the same book we read on the same page that ' the sanitation of cities is carefully preserved . ' ''

		Is not this the reductio ad absurdum of criticism ?

		What I wrote is '' Utopia .

		.

		is an ideal common - wealth in which vice does not flourish ... Agri - culture is the chief industry and everybody works .

		The sanitation of cities is carefully preserved . ''

		The reference here is clearly to
Utopia	LOCATION	, the com - monwealth , not to '' Utopia , '' the book .

		If the use of the word '' preserved '' is what '' jars , '' then let us consult the dictionary and learn that in such a connection the word means `` maintained intact or unimpaired , '' and is correctly used .

		As for `` applied into , '' this I can not find ; wherever it occurs the text perhaps should read '' applied unto , '' and I shall be greatly obliged if you will favor me with the page on which it may be found .

		FRANK H. VIZETELLY .


New York City	LOCATION	,
Sept. 30 , 1915	DATE	.

		-LSB- Regarding the latter part of Dr.
Vize	PERSON	- telly 's communication , the truth sterns to be that Surrey remodelled and refined the son - net after
Wyatt	PERSON	had introduced it ; but to assert without qualification that he `` wrote the first sonnets ever written in English '' is to invite contradiction .

		Authorities might be 314 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 14	DATE	cited in great number , but it must here suf - fice to quote from
Garnett	PERSON	and
Gosse	PERSON	's '' English Literature '' the statement in re - gard to
Wyatt	PERSON	that '' the feature of his work which gives him his chief importance in the history of English poetical literature .

		.

		is his introduction of the sonnet into ` English poetry . '' ''

		Equally as appropriate '' offends by its manifest redundancy . ''

		Less than thirty '' has good authority , but '' fewer than thirty '' stands unchallenged , and the ques - tion remains whether it is wise , in trying to promote the cause of good English , to use a construction avoided by many careful writers .

		It may be , if it is felt that a principle is in - volved .

		Of course the reviewer 's comment on '' sanitation '' as being '' carefully preserved '' referred only to the choice of verb , which still seems not the happiest possible .

		It should be noted that the italics in the quota - tions from the review are not the reviewer 's .

		`` Applied into , '' unless the reviewer 's notes are at fault , will be found on page 308 , one - third of the way down .

		THE KEVIEWER . -RSB- ''

		BRYANT AND THE NEW POETRY . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		As I have been making a pilgrimage to the two
Panama	LOCATION	expositions , my attention has been called only recently to the communication from Mr.
John L. Hervey	PERSON	in your issue of
August 15	DATE	, enti - tled ''
Bryant	PERSON	and the New Poetry . ''

		You and he will pardon me , therefore , if my answer seems somewhat tardy .

		What did I say at that Whitman dinner , now four months in the past ?

		Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	admits that he '' can not recall more than the drift , the pur - port , '' of a part of it , and I can not pretend to remember with complete exactness .

		I can state , however , that my subject was not '' The New Poetry , '' but '' The New Movement in Poetry , '' and that I did not ascribe this movement to
America	LOCATION	alone , since English poets have done their full share in it , or say that it '' had originated in the sanctum of her -LSB- my -RSB- magazinelet , ' Poetry . ' ''

		I may have said that '' Poetry '' was the first maga - zine to give a large group of young poets a chance to be heard , or that , as the
New York	LOCATION	'' Sun '' said editorially in its issue of
Sept. 12	DATE	, '' ` Poetry ' right - fully stands at the head of the new movement . ''

		If I was so foolish as to make any '' statement of doctrine , '' or put forth any '' promulgation of law '' on a subject so delicate , so fluid , so irreduci - ble to any definition or theory , as the art of poetry , I shall be obliged to Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	if he will add chapter and book to his offhand accusation .

		Also he will perhaps show how I '' asserted , at least by inference , '' that Whitman is '' the patron saint of the movement . ''

		Whitman was a great revolutionist , and no doubt he is one of many cos - mopolitan influences which have tended of late to broaden the boundaries of poetic art in the En - glish language .

		But Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	resents most seriously '' the drift , the purport '' of certain ill-remembered remarks of mine about
Bryant	PERSON	.

		As I have made a definite charge against Bry - ant , and as neither Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	nor I can pretend to remember exactly in what form I stated it at the Whitman dinner , perhaps you will permit me to refer to an editorial in '' Poetry '' for
July	DATE	, which does not lack precision .

		In that editorial I told of a publisher 's statement that
Bryant	PERSON	, toward the end of his long life , used to sell his name , along with his venerable portrait , as the author of books which he neither wrote nor edited , such as ''
Bryant	PERSON	's History of the
United States	LOCATION	'' and ''
Bryant	PERSON	's Collection of Poetry and Song , '' to such an extent that he was known among
New York	LOCATION	publishers as '' the great national tone - imparter . ''

		The article then continues : '' This story always comes back to me when I make a detour from Fifth Avenue to see the beautiful rear facade of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here a throned figure of the venerable poet faces the park named in his honor , and offers us his life as a high inspiration to American youth .

		To whose memory was the statue erected the poet of the Thanatopsis or the ' great national tone-imparter ' ?

		If the former , are we not honoring too much the man who did his best work at nineteen ?

		and if the latter , are we not honoring too much the man who sold out ! ''

		To have done one 's best work in youth is proof that one has lived downward rather than upward .

		Long is the roll of artists who , beginning with more genius than character , shuffle off their glory like a rich gar - ment and sink down in rags or broadcloth to a sordid feast .

		Indeed , so often does the world watch this spectacle that the early death of the inspired one seems the only sure consecration . ''

		There is only one code of honor for an artist to be true to his vision .

		Bryant preferred to lead a com - fortable life , and be a good journalist rather than a poet , and so he descended from the serene nobility of the Thanatopsis , to the puerile pieties of the Hymn to tlie Sea , The Future Life , The Crowded Street and many other truly orthodox utterances .

		Even The Forest Hymn , perhaps the best of these , says merely the proper and expected thing , offering bland counsels of moderation : But let me often to these solitudes Retire , and in Thy presence reassure My feeble virtue .

		Here its enemies .

		The passions , at Thy plainer footsteps shrink And tremble , and are still . ''

		If the passions were indeed the enemies of this poet 's ' feeble virtue , ' they never got the upper hand .

		At least they do not appear in his poetry .

		It is said that Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	pronounces To a Waterfowl the finest American poem a preference which marks the limitation of his reading or taste ; but this , which is no doubt
Bryant	PERSON	's best lyric , is also marred by the ever-present and expedient moral .

		The famous ' Truth crushed to earth ' quatrain from The Battlefield is the only bit of his poetry , after the Thanatopsis , in which his religiosity rises for a moment to higher ground and assumes something of prophetic dignity . ''

		Bryant was , in short , a man born to be a poet who sacrificed the muse , not to those violent enemies , the flesh and the devil , but to that more insidious one .

		the world or , in other words , comfort and respecta - bility .

		Now and then a brief flash of inspiration dis - turbed his placidity , but gradually the light went out , until , in his tone-imparting old age , he could not even see that he was sitting in darkness . ''

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 315 Probably even Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	would admit that the greater part of
Bryant	PERSON	's poetry was over-rated during and after his life , and that modern criti - cism can hardly be expected to take him and most of his contemporaries at their nineteenth-century face value .

		If Whitman admired him , it was part of the generosity of his nature that he admired almost everybody .

		If he lived to-day , no doubt he would praise Mr.
Sandburg	PERSON	, and even say a good word for the magazine which had the honor of introducing him and many others as well , both radical and conservative !

		Whether any of our contemporaries , so intro - duced , '' will live , '' it is quite beyond my power , or even Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	's , to predict ; for I have never presumed to '' speak in behalf of Time , '' but have always proclaimed , early and late , over and over again , that contemporary criticism can not be final . ''

		Poetry '' is an exhibition place for current poetry , corresponding to our Art Institute exhibi - tions of current painting and sculpture .

		It would be rank injustice to deny to our artists and poets such places to be seen and heard , and no doubt it is right that critics and the public should praise or damn this or that in any exhibition , and that professional juries should even award prizes .

		But Time , which really means the accumulated opin - ions of experts , selects the masterpieces .

		In conclusion , permit me to take exception to Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	's statement that '' the verse printed in ' Poetry ' '' does not '' convey a sense of the open air . ''

		If there is no open-air feeling in poems we have printed by
Edith Wyatt	PERSON	,
Ernest Rhys	PERSON	,
Padraic Colum	PERSON	,
James Stephens	PERSON	,
Fannie Stearns Davis	PERSON	,
Joyce Kilmer	PERSON	,
Constance Skinner	PERSON	,
John Gould Fletcher	PERSON	, and many others , I do not know where to find it in modern poetry .


HARRIET MONROE	PERSON	,
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Oct. 2 , 1915	DATE	.

		Editor of '' Poetry . ''

		`` THE FEEELANDS '' AND `` UNCLE TOM 'S CABIN . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		With your permission , I should like to present the following paraphrase of a portion of your review of Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's '' The Freelands '' -LRB- see THE DIAL for
Sept. 16	DATE	, page 219 -RRB- as repre - senting what would undoubtedly have been your reviewer 's method of dealing with '' Uncle Tom 's Cabin , '' had he been exercising his critical function when that book was published .

		Except for the substitution of Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's name for Mr.
Gals	PERSON	- worthy 's , and the feminine for the masculine pro- noun , the only changes in phraseology which I have made in your review are indicated by the italicization of new words substituted for those used by your reviewer . ''

		The pathos of it all , the appeal to pity , the suffer - ings of Uncle Tom , the despair which fills his soul these things are worked to their utmost in arousing our deepest sympathies for the victim .

		But what would Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	have ?

		She urges that the condi - tions are intolerable which make such situations possi - ble .

		In other words , it is the slave system which is to blame , the system which gives the slave-holder this power over the private lives of his slaves .

		We admit that such interference is injudicious , and even to be condemned in principle ; but , on the other hand , it is clearly a case of conscience with the slave-holder , to say nothing of legal rights .

		If such a thing as private ownership in slaves is admitted , the right of the owner to use them as he pleases is logically implied .

		So that Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	is in reality attacking the right of slave-holding , and if one believes in that right at all , one can not be much stirred by this indirect assault upon it , which seems to us to be lacking in candor .

		We are in the heartiest sympathy with Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	in her detestation of people who seek to regulate the pri - vate affairs of other people , but the mischief that is done by such efforts is much more chargeable to Northern newspapers , abolition societies , etc. , than to the owners of slaves or other property .

		While the lat - ter have at least a sound legal justification for their intolerance , the former have only their whims and petty prejudices ; and the curtailments of liberty which they would impose excite our indignation far more deeply than do any restrictions imposed by the owners of slaves upon those whom they purchase to make productive use of their land .

		So it seems to us that Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's lesson might have l > een made much more effective by the choice of a less dubious basis .

		Her real power is in her style rather than in her logi - cal process , and , for our part , we attach less impor - tance to all her special pleading and all the calculated ingenuity of her plot than we do to the single page in which , forgetting her thesis , she unfolds for us , '' etc. , etc. .

		Of course it is not my purpose to indicate or imply any analogy between '' The Freelands '' and '' Uncle Tom 's Cabin , '' although it might not be very difficult to trace such an analogy in certain important respects .

		But I wish merely to empha - size the fixed and frozen nature of the `` stand pat '' psychology , and to illustrate how applicable is its stereotyped verbiage to any questionings , wherever and whenever advanced , of the doctrine that Property is more sacred than Human Life .

		INDIANS IN THE CIVIL WAR .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your issue of
September 16	DATE	, I note that your reviewer of Miss Abel 's '' Slave-Holding Indians in the Civil War '' states that our remembrance of
Albert Pike	PERSON	's Indians having fought at
Pea Ridge	LOCATION	and of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	having had an Indian on his staff is very nearly the sum of our information regarding the Indian in the Civil War .

		Pardon me , therefore , if I call your attention to the fact that a company of full-blooded
Ottawa	LOCATION	and
Chippewa Indians	LOCATION	from this section of North - ern
Michigan	LOCATION	, known as '' Company K ,
First Michigan Sharpshooters	ORGANIZATION	, '' were in the service from
January 12 , 1863	DATE	, until the close of the Civil War , and fought gallantly in many engagements in that bloody conflict .

		In view of their heroic sendee to the government , even after losing their lands , I regret exceedingly that history has not x been more liberal toward them .

		I have just published a little book regarding the manners and legends of these people .

		On page 88 is a mention of the Indian company , and I possess its complete roster .

		316 THE DIAL
Oct. 14	DATE	THE ROMANTICISM OF FLAUBERT .

		* No historical period is so interesting as an age of transition .

		Renaissance or Revolu - tion there , in the conflict of opposing ten - dencies , the student finds his task and his reward .

		So , too , with literary types : no pure species , definite and definable , attracts like the transitional author , compelled by the accident of birth to serve a double ideal .

		Some writers reflect for us the spiritual struggles of an age .

		Such a type is
Gustave Flaubert	PERSON	.

		Born in
1821	DATE	, at the very dawn of French Roman - ticism , he too is composing tragedies in the year that saw the thrice-memorable premiere of ''
Hernani	PERSON	/ ' At nine , he is already both author and actor , with his father 's billiard - table for a stage !

		Five years later we find him sleeping with a poniard under his pil - low , a schoolboy
Faust	PERSON	, talking of suicide in his letters and reconciled to life only by a historical romance which he is writing .

		Pure boyish bravado this , of course , but one does not smile at the Romantic despair which fills his correspondence and his first subjective novel : they tell too plainly the story of a malady grown real .

		Yet this youthful
Byron	PERSON	lived to found the school of Realism , to create at one stroke its model and its chef d'muvre , ''
Madame Bovary	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The case is unique in literature .

		At first sight , one might wonder at the Romanticism of an author who only made his debut in
1857	DATE	, long after `` Pere Goriot '' and Musset 's deri - sive '' Lettres de
Dupuis	PERSON	et Cotonet . ''

		But we forget the twenty-year apprenticeship that went to the making of `` Madame Bovary . ''

		By
1842	DATE	, when he attained his majority ,
Flau	PERSON	- bert had already written enough to fill two fat octavos : he had been writing for eight years , since his first school days at
Rouen	LOCATION	.

		Outside of
Paris	LOCATION	, the tide of literary theory has a slower ebb ; so we may see why his Juvenilia reflect nearly every phase of French Romanticism .

		Five years ago these '' Oeuvres de Jeu - nesse '' were at last published in toto by
Co	ORGANIZATION	- nard .

		With them , too , appeared the collected correspondence , and it became possible to study the development of Flaubert from origi - nal sources .

		Here were letters dating from his ninth year , intimate letters filled with the enthusiasm of one who opened his heart *

Baltimore	LOCATION	:
The Johns Hopkins Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		only to lovers of literature like himself .

		Hence the three scholarly monographs , from
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, which invite us to consider the evolution and the literary meth - ods of this '' Beethoven of French prose . ''

		The first of these studies takes up Flau - bert 's ` prentice novels from his seventeenth to his twenty-fourth years .

		Up to seventeen his Juvenilia are almost entirely Romantic : the first volume of the '' Oeuvres de Jeunesse '' is ample evidence of his admiration for the his - torical novel , the historical drama , the sym - bolism of '' Faust '' and the violently macabre note of
Gautier	PERSON	's early verse .

		But with all this , it contains a personal novel , `` Les Memoires d'un Fou , '' inspired by
Rousseau	PERSON	's '' Confessions '' and eloquent of the vital influ - ence of
Rene	PERSON	's pessimism even in the late thir - ties .

		And Mr.
Coleman	PERSON	's monograph gives us the parallels , notes the echoes of
Byron	PERSON	, `` Werther , '' Montaigne ,
Gautier	PERSON	, and others .

		None the less , the novel did
spring	DATE	from a real experience : here , in ten pages , we have the story of
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's first passion , a hope - less boy-love for the lady who inspired his only sympathetic heroine ,
Madame Arnoux	PERSON	. ''

		Les Memoires d'un Fou '' date probably from
1838	DATE	.

		Some
four years later	DATE	,
Flaubert	PERSON	wrote another story in the '' Confession '' form .

		Like its predecessor , '' Novembre '' be - gins with a fugue of lyrical self-analysis ; but the Rene-note soon merges into a floridly re - alistic episode of carnal love chez une file .

		Externally the work would resemble Musset 's `` Rolla , '' did not the courtesan wax remi - niscent in turn , and prove herself like her lover a disappointed seeker after an ideal .

		All this , of course , is familiar to the Romantic formula , which may also be traced in the death of the hero after his disillusionment .

		Space forbids dwelling on the literary influ - ences , so carefully noted by Mr.
Coleman	PERSON	.

		After Chateaubriand , it is `` Mademoiselle de Maupin '' which furnishes most of the parallel passages .

		The resemblance to `` Rolla , '' re - marked by
M. Descharmes	PERSON	in his earlier study , is proved inconclusive :
Marie	PERSON	is seen to be a composite portrait of
Gautier	PERSON	's ambiguous heroine and
Rosette	ORGANIZATION	, while
Flaubert	PERSON	's hero finds an elder brother in
d' Albert	LOCATION	.

		Both of these works are therefore typically Romantic .

		But in
1845	DATE	Flaubert completed another personal novel , begun two years be - fore , the first version of the '' Education Sen - timentale . ''

		Now for the first time he studies the influence of love upon character : two friends , Romanticists both , pass through a '' sentimental education '' which shatters their illusions and turns them to objectivity .

		The history of
Jules	PERSON	is not unlike that of Wilhelm
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 317 Meister ; but as
Jules	PERSON	is Flaubert himself , one need only note the general inspiration .

		Traces of specific influence , moreover , become rarer ; at twenty-two
Flaubert	PERSON	has found with experience larger powers of creation .

		Proof of this may be seen in the story of
Jules	PERSON	's friend : for if we do find traces of Balzac and Musset , they are too slight to count .

		Flaubert is certainly working towards objectivity ; his letters at .

		the time show him turning back to the great classics ; and his hero
Jules	PERSON	, re-read - ing `` Rene '' and `` Werther '' and analyzing his admiration , finds in it `` personal sym - pathy '' and not '' the disinterested contempla - tion of the true artist . ''

		Here , then , is the first statement of
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's later creed .

		The evolution of the Realist is begun .

		At twenty-three
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	is already reacting from Romanticism .

		Does he owe this to Honore de Balzac ?

		Mr.
Coleman	PERSON	gives us many interesting parallels , but in the end ascribes the formulation of this new stand - point '' to Flaubert himself , to his meditations , and perhaps to the lessons he drew from read - ing Shakespeare and La Bruyere . ''

		Thus he differs from
M. Descharmes	PERSON	, who not having access to the unpublished '' Education Senti - mentale , '' sets the reaction later and makes it largely the result of
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's first attack of epilepsy .

		One would like to speak of the chapters which sum up the two sides of our author .

		But the monographs on '' Salammbo '' claim our attention , and we must sketch briefly the labors of the twelve years which intervene .

		For if Flaubert early foresaw and stated the Realistic theory , he could not subdue the lyrist that was in him . ''

		Ce qui m ` est naturel a moi , c'est le non-naturel pour les autres , 1 ` extraor - dinaire , le fantastique , la hurlade metaphy - sique , mythologique . ''

		And it is this lyrism which , through the next four years , flames up in the first version of his great philosophic allegory , '' La Tentation de Saint
Antoine	PERSON	. ''

		Things marvellous and mystical had always attracted him .

		When he first read `` Faust , '' he told his niece , he '' ceased to feel the earth beneath him . ''

		So at sixteen he wrote a long prose poem , `` Reve d'Enfer , '' and two years later a still longer mystery-play , '' Smarh , '' with Satan recast in a prominent role .

		In these precursors , rather than in
Breughel	LOCATION	's painting seen at
Genoa	LOCATION	, we find the begin - nings of the ''
Tentation	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		After two years of labor on a contemporary theme ,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	longed to escape from the Occident to the
Orient	LOCATION	, from the present to the exotic past .

		Might he not , perhaps , write a French `` Faust '' ?

		`` Ahasverus , '' to be sure , had proved a magnificent failure ,
Quinet	PERSON	's alle - gory being coldly received even in the cor - rected version of
1843	DATE	.

		Yet the example was sufficient ; and
Flaubert	PERSON	, who loved to repeat
Michelet	PERSON	's motto , `` Nothing tempting but the Impossible , '' began the masterpiece of dream - literature on which he was to labor through twenty years .

		In his hands , the well-known legend becomes a monstrous vision , all modes of life and thought pass before him , a satur - nalia of philosophic systems , a mad proces - sional whose only lesson is the vanity of all things beneath the sun .

		How he read this stupendous phantasy to his friends
Bouilhet	PERSON	and Ducamp , and how they told the indignant author to throw it into the fire and take a theme like ''
Cousine Bette	PERSON	, '' is told by Du - camp in his '' Souvenirs litteraires '' ; and by his testimony it was Bouilhet who , the next day , recalled to Flaubert the local incident which
eight years later	DATE	became `` Madame Bovary . ''

		So
Gustave Flaubert	PERSON	turned Realist .

		Out of the obscure physician 's wife he created a world-type .


Emma Bovary	PERSON	is not merely re - alistic ; she is more real than reality .

		She is not a woman , she is `` Woman ; and her tragedy is the eternal tragedy of incapacity .

		All our modern life , with its blind democratic Titan - ism , is symbolized by that pathetic figure ; she reflects her century , typifies an age which lit - erature had spoiled for living .

		Like ``
Don Quixote	PERSON	'' in the
seventeenth century	DATE	, she is a martyr to the Ideal , a victim of The Book , a martyr to all the poets who have added to the world 's panoply of dreams .

		Too weak to fight Reality in that golden armor , she faints beneath the weight and fails , crushed down into the mire because the armor of her defence is not her own .

		`` Madame Bovary '' is the indictment of life against universal education .

		It is the indictment of Art against the theory of democracy .

		That characteristic of Roman - ticism , seen in its hatred of the bourgeois , was so essentially a reaction of
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's cult of `` Art for Art '' that it is the obverse of his life-philosophy .

		But this aspect of ''
Madame Bovary	ORGANIZATION	'' is lost in the larger significance of the novel , the miracle of its creation .

		What giant 's will forged for us this cold analysis of human illusion , so typical that it has given the name to a philosophy ?

		* A lyrist in a lyrical generation , foredoomed apparently to all the consequences of his Romantic , heritage ,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	rose through pure will above him - self , and carved his past sufferings into the masterpiece of modern realism .

		Like Cer - vantes , he `` struck the death-blow to a false *

Paris	LOCATION	: Mercure de 318 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 14	DATE	ideal .

		But that ideal burned on like a banked fire in
Gustave Flaubert	PERSON	, bursting out in the exoticism of '' Salammbo , '' still smoulder - ing beneath the self-satire of `` I/Education Sentimentale '' and the bitter parody of `` Bouvard et Pecuchet . ''

		Thus Romanticism is directly or indirectly the basis of all his work ; like Zola later ,
Flaubert	PERSON	had `` drunk too deeply of the Romantic brew . ''

		So after `` Madame Bovary '' came `` Sa - lammbo . '' ''

		I am going to write a novel whose action takes place three centuries before Christ , '' he writes in a letter of
1856	DATE	. ''

		I feel the need of getting out of this modern world , in which my pen has dipped too long , and which , moreover , tires me as much to repro - duce as it disgusts me to behold . ''

		So he turned back to the dreams of the past which had urged him on to the first prize in history at school .

		Then it was Hugo 's Middle Ages or
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	's Renaissance that fired his ambi - tion ; now , with that vein worked dry by a myriad of imitators ,
Gautier	PERSON	, and after him Flaubert , reverted to more distant and more exotic times .

		Not history , but archaeology now pointed the way , and
Gautier	PERSON	had been quick to follow with his splendidly plastic classical and Egyptian tales .

		Why not , then , a Carthaginian romance ?

		The task was certainly hard enough to be tempting even to
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	.

		He had , to be sure , the story of the mercenary war con - tained in the last few chapters of the
First Book of Polybius	ORGANIZATION	.

		This he could follow , as indeed he did , for the characters and inci - dents of his military drama ; he had only to add the love-interest by creating the figure of Salammbo .

		So he follows Polybius rather closely , as one may see in Mr.
Fay	PERSON	's mono - graph ; a bit careless of chronology because he is writing his novel scene by scene ; but using everything and only occasionally sharp - ening the outlines of his model by greater precision of numerical detail .

		Still Polybius gave him scarcely more than an outline : to make his story real , to clothe his skeleton with flesh and muscle , he literally digested a classi - cal library .

		In two weeks , for instance , he `` swallowed '' to use his own expression the eighteen volumes of
Cahen	PERSON	's translation of the
Bible	LOCATION	, with the notes , finding in them not a few precious details for costumes , musical instruments , architecture , and habits of life , which are brought together in Mr.
Coleman	PERSON	's briefer study .

		But the mass of the material used is classical .

		Xenophon , JElian ,
Pausanias	PERSON	,
Pliny	LOCATION	,
Silius Italicus	PERSON	,
Strabo	PERSON	, Theophrastus ,
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	, Appian ,
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	, and the dusty ant-hill of modern archaeology must be ransacked ; one must be '' stuffed with his subject up to the ears '' to paint the '' local color '' which comes without effort and makes a book `` exude reality . ''

		And Mr.
Blossom	PERSON	sets forth , from
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's correspondence , the Herculean labors which preceded and ac - companied the still more Herculean task of composition .

		The whole work was to take more than five years of constant toil , broken only by a trip to
Africa	LOCATION	required for further '' documentation . ''

		This indefatigable patience , this pursuit of a truth no less scientific than artistic , reveal the realist in
Flaubert	LOCATION	.

		How a poet 's dream , romantique s ` il en fut jamais , was built into a plastic evocation of antiquity all the giant effort of materialization is shown in Mr.
Blossom	PERSON	's pages .

		And if the finished '' Sa - lammbo '' leaves us cold , the story of its com - position reads like the work-filled letters of
Balzac	LOCATION	.

		Indeed , quite as strong a case might be made for
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's Realism as for his innate Romanticism .

		Most critics have devel - oped one side or the other .

		After all , in these days of subjective criticism , the danger of the transitional type is the danger of the crystal maze '
LEWIS PIAGET SHANKS	PERSON	.

		ELBA ,
WATERLOO	LOCATION	,
ST. HELEXA	ORGANIZATION	.

		* One consequence of '' the Great War '' seems certain , and that is a lessened interest in the figure of
Napoleon	PERSON	and in his military achieve - ments .

		The epoch of modern warfare in which he was the unapproached master is now closed .

		The scale of action , the masses of men , the material resources , the means of destruction , the methods of transportation , everything sharply differentiates the present art of fighting from that of even the

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL ture of these phases of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's career .

		Mr.
Young	PERSON	's three volumes seem to be the most satisfactory and complete account of the two exiles .

		Captain
Becke	PERSON	's volumes on the
Waterloo	LOCATION	campaign will appeal especially to readers interested in the problems of strategy and the management of armies in battle .

		The first volume , which carries the campaign up to
June 18	DATE	, contains more conclusions open to controversy than the second , which deals with the battle of
Waterloo	LOCATION	and the operations of Grouchy on
June 18	DATE	and the days following .

		Captain Becke thinks that
Napoleon	PERSON	`` was no longer the
Napoleon of Austerlitz	ORGANIZATION	; the sun still shone , but his power was waning visibly . ''

		One illustration of this loss of grasp was the manner of meeting the Prussian flank move - ment early on the afternoon of
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		Captain
Becke	PERSON	holds that it was a mistake to detach Count Lobau at that time to check Count Billow 's advance .

		He argues that had
Napoleon	PERSON	succeeded in breaking
Wellington	LOCATION	's line , the Prussians would have remained spec - tators .

		As it was , the Billow attack was not pressed for several hours after his corps was first sighted .

		Meanwhile Lobau was needed to support and complete D'Erlon 's assault on
Wellington	LOCATION	's left .

		The gravest fault of
Napoleon	PERSON	was , however , the day before , in the morning hours , when
Wellington	LOCATION	's army at
Quatre Bras	ORGANIZATION	seemed to be at the mercy of the French had they brought into action troops not used the day before either at
Quatre Bras	ORGANIZATION	or at Ligny .

		On the whole ,
Captain Becke	LOCATION	is inclined to lay the principal blame for final failure upon
Ney and Grouchy	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is especially true of the operations about Quatre Bras .

		His argu - ment that Ney should have been able to occupy Quatre Bras before noon on
July 16	DATE	is not convincing .

		In the first place , Ney had no business to seize those cross-roads before he received specific orders , since a premature occupation of the British-Prussian line of inter-communication would probably , as Cap - tain Becke argues , have led Bliicher to fall back instead of fighting .

		The order to occupy Quatre Bras arrived at eleven .

		Secondly , it was materially impossible for Ney to get his wing of the army together before noon .

		Ac - cording to the careful calculations of the late Mr.
Ropes	PERSON	, D'Erlon could reach the neighborhood of Quatre Bras only about three o'clock in the
afternoon	TIME	.

		Moreover ,
Keille	PERSON	, who was in command of the second corps , did not set out from
Gosselies	ORGANIZATION	until a quarter before twelve , contrary to his under - standing with Ney .

		Captain Becke also fails to give Ney the benefit of the excuse that his orderlies had been collected hastily since his arrival at headquarters the day before and were not competent to put him in touch with various sections of his army .

		A fair reading of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's orders to Ney and to
Grouchy	ORGANIZATION	shows that the unlucky marshals were not alone in failing to apprehend the true state of affairs .

		Captain
Becke	PERSON	's discussion of
Wellington	LOCATION	's conduct is more judicial .

		He brings out the fact , hitherto not sufficiently emphasized , that
Wellington	LOCATION	would have been warned earlier of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's first moves had not the informa - tion sent to him on
June 15	DATE	by Colonel Col - quhoun Grant , his trusted intelligence officer , stationed far in advance of the British out - posts , failed to reach him until the very morn - ing of
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		But Captain Becke points out that
Wellington	LOCATION	more than made up for his faults of strategy by splendid defensive fighting both at
Quatre Bras	ORGANIZATION	and at
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Norwood Young	PERSON	's books distinguish themselves from those of some of his predeces - sors on the same theme by an entire absence of false sentiment , polemics , and rhetoric .

		The unadorned tale , carefully documented , requires no adventitious aids to stimulate in - terest .

		The author is not unappreciative of the painful situation of
Napoleon	LOCATION	, which may excuse much of the ill-temper which the ex - Emperor displayed , but this does not lead him into unjust criticisms of the men whose dis - agreeable task it was to see that
Napoleon	PERSON	remained secure on the island of
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Young	PERSON	believes that as
Napoleon	PERSON	had succeeded in hoodwinking
Neil Campbell	PERSON	, the British commissioner at
Elba	ORGANIZATION	, he was espe - cially chagrined to find that neither
Cockburn	PERSON	nor
Lowe	PERSON	could be duped .

		Napoleon seems actually to have become obsessed by the idea that
Lowe	PERSON	had been sent to
St. Helena	LOCATION	to make way with him .

		The fundamental difficulty , however , was that the British pursued a mid - dle course with
Napoleon	PERSON	, treating him as a guest under restraint and expecting him to accept the part with equanimity .

		It seems silly to have refused him the title of Emperor , although , as Mr.
Young	PERSON	remarks , the English had never formally recognized his sovereignty .

		They had , nevertheless , attempted to negotiate peace with him in
1807	DATE	, which was a virtual recognition of his rule .

		In
1814	DATE	they had also , as allies of the signatories of the Treaty of
Fontainebleau	LOCATION	, agreed that he should re - tain the imperial title .

		Their main , concern was not his assumption of an imperial status , but the security of his person .

		The conditions which they imposed went far toward render - ing
Lowe	PERSON	's task impossible .

		There are lighter sides to the Elba sojourn , and even the exile at
St. Helena	LOCATION	was not all 320 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 14	DATE	sombre .

		Napoleon 's companions were a strange lot .

		Mr.
Young	PERSON	carefully delineates each of them .

		Occasionally a single sentence gives an amusing glimpse of a personage .

		For example , of Piontkowski the author re - marks : '' To be associated with the Emperor , and to be free from pecuniary anxieties , was for him a wonderful fortune . ''

		In other cases an anecdote accomplishes the same pur - pose .

		It appears that
Montchenu	PERSON	, the French commissioner , was in the habit of accepting invitations and offering no return , which earned him the name of the `` Marquis de Montez-chez-nous . ''

		In the chapter on '' Finance '' at
Elba	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Young	PERSON	gives figures to demonstrate that , although the French government did not pay the two million francs stipulated ,
Napoleon	PERSON	had money enough to maintain his establish - ment not only through
1815	DATE	but also through
1816	DATE	and
1817	DATE	.

		If this was the case , the rapid shrinkage of his financial resources was not , as has been supposed , one cause of his return to
France	LOCATION	.

		The descriptions of both
Elba	LOCATION	and
St. Helena	LOCATION	are based upon the author 's careful examination of every feature of the islands .

		The interest of the narrative is much en - hanced by the many illustrations drawn from the rich collections of Mr.
A. M. Broadley	PERSON	.


HENRY E. BOURNE	PERSON	.

		FRAGMENTA SHAKESPEAREANA .

		* Of the thirty periodical essays on Shake - spearean subjects by Mrs.
C. C. Stopes	PERSON	, now reprinted in book form , a few are well worth preservation between the covers of an easily accessible volume ; the others might as well or better have been left buried in the period - icals where they first saw the light .

		Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	's book , which would much more appro - priately have been entitled '' Elizabethan and Shakespearean Fragments , '' adds very little if anything of value to our stock of dry facts concerning
Shakespeare	PERSON	and his family .

		The chapter dealing with Asbies ,
Mary Ar	PERSON	- den 's inheritance , does not clear up the mys - tery surrounding that estate ; but it enables Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	to bring out a new detail in
John Shakespeare	PERSON	's life , namely , that about 1580 he was fined forty pounds because of two law - suits in which he was involved .

		Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	fails to see the relevance of this '' fact '' to the question of
John	PERSON	's fortunes .

		Like all the biographers of the greatest of Elizabethan poets , she too accepts the theory that
John	PERSON	* SHAKESPEARE 'S ENVIRONMENT .

		By Mrs.
C. C. Stopes	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		had become poor and indigent about the time of the Asbies mortgage ; although a careful examination of all the facts now known to us leaves no doubt that
John	PERSON	's misfortunes have been enormously and grotesquely exaggerated .

		A broken bankrupt would not have been ac - cepted , as
John	PERSON	was , as surety in the
Queen 's Court	ORGANIZATION	at Westminster and elsewhere .

		That the Shakespeares ever suffered from poverty is a fable .

		Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	has to her credit the discovery of the facts that in
1595	DATE	a `` Mr.
Shaxpere	PERSON	'' of
Stratford	LOCATION	, perhaps it was
John	PERSON	, was in - debted to one '' Jone Perat '' for '' one book '' ; and that at some time or other a `` Maria Shaxpere , '' who may have been the poet 's mother , was in some way connected with a law - suit .

		The statement that
John	PERSON	lost his money '' through some folly '' is no more absurd or better founded than the conjecture that Will - iam `` learnt some of his knowledge of law terms from the experience of his mother '' in the suit referred to .

		Equally questionable is the value of the discovery that the much - tortured word '' honorificabilitudinitatibus , '' which occurs in '' Love 's Labour 's Lost '' and in the mysterious
Northumberland MS.	LOCATION	, is also to be found scribbled in a mid-sixteenth cen - tury hand in the registers of
Pillerton Hersy	ORGANIZATION	, a town in
Warwickshire	LOCATION	, `` a locality where the book and the writer were quite accessible to Shakspeare . ''

		Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	also claims credit for the discovery that , contrary to the general opinion ,
Queen Bess	PERSON	had in her service pro- fessional Fools and even women Fools .

		Much more value attaches to her discovery that in
Ingleby	LOCATION	's photographic facsimile of the Diary of
Thomas Greene	PERSON	, one page had been placed out of its order , and that conse - quently Ingleby drew a wrong inference in the matter of the
Welcombe Enclosures	ORGANIZATION	.

		Many Shakespeareans will appreciate the reproduc - tion of some of the correspondence of those concerned in the restoration of the Shake - speare Bust in
1748	DATE	.

		The chapter on Bur - bage 's '' Theatre '' is of interest only because it was expanded into a volume called `` Bur - bage and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Stage , '' and because of a postscript in which Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	attempts , more malevolently than successfully , to claim for herself the discovery of many of the docu - ments pertaining to the '' Theatre , '' thus denying Professor
Wallace	PERSON	's claim to priority in this matter .

		Her chapter on '' The Friends in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	's Sonnets '' is one of the worst essays on those unfortunate poems we have ever read .

		Any critic who interprets , as Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	does , the word '' passion '' in the locu - tion , '' The master-mistress of my passion , '' as meaning `` sonnet , '' or who is satisfied to accept
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 321 Mrs.
Jacquinetta Field	PERSON	, the wife of Shake - speare 's friend , as the Dark Lady for no bet - ter reason than that '' she was a Frenchwoman and therefore likely to have dark eyes , a sallow complexion , and that indefinable charm so much alluded to , '' is fit for treasons , strata - gems , and spoils , and is not to be trusted as a guide to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is the kind of stuff on which Baconians feed fat .

		When it comes to making all sorts of rambling , im - probable. , and improvable assertions concern - ing Shakespeare , Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	knows no limit .

		If there is any one thing that mars all her work , that takes all worth from her right copious industry , it is her want of the scien - tific temper , the desire for the truth for the truth 's sake .

		She makes up her mind to what she wants to prove , and then twists all the facts around to her theory - , and when facts fail her she resorts to conjecture and guess - work .

		When Shakespeare commentators reach this stage of mental astigmatism , there is no arguing with them .

		They use such phrases as '' it is clear , '' '' it is probable , '' '' there is no doubt , '' etc. , without the slightest warrant , and with apparently not the slightest idea of the meaning of the words they employ .

		Our readers may recall a discovery made recently by Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	showing that in
1613	DATE	`` Mr.
Shakspeare	PERSON	'' was paid forty-four shillings in gold for having devised an im - prese or heraldic device for the
Earl of Rut	ORGANIZATION	- land .

		For various good and sufficient reasons , which need not be repeated here ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	students are agreed that this '' Mr.
Shak	PERSON	- speare '' was our poet .

		But Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	does not think it consonant with the dignity of a great poet to earn money in this fashion , and she proceeds to throw doubt on the iden - tification .

		She finds that there dwelt in Lon - don a bit-maker named
John Shakspeare	PERSON	who might -LRB- ! -RRB-

		have been called `` Mr. '' by the Stew - ard of
Belvoir Castle	ORGANIZATION	and who was `` probably '' -LRB- possibly ? -RRB-

		master of the
Lariners Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		After regaling us with extracts from the ac - counts of various noblemen , in all of which the bit-maker is spoken of as ``
John Shak	PERSON	- speare , '' Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	concludes that she has proved that there was another contemporary and well-to-do `` Mr.
Shakspeare	PERSON	'' in court service who might have been the person re - ferred to in the
Belvoir	LOCATION	accounts .

		As a mat - ter of fact , the extracts quoted by her prove nothing of the sort .

		Shakspeare the bit - maker is never given the appellation `` Mr. '' in the accounts she quotes , and we have there - fore no reason for assuming that it was he who was associated with
Richard Burbage	PERSON	in devising an emblem for the
Earl of Rutland	ORGANIZATION	.

		A phycho-analyst would find it difficult not to conclude that Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	's defective logic is due to an overwhelming desire to belittle the discoveries of others and to magnify the im - portance of her own .

		The latter tendency is strikingly , if uncon - sciously , manifested in Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	's chapter on the `` True Story of the
Stratford	LOCATION	Bust . ''

		As luck would have it , our author -LRB- re - -RRB- discov - ered that
Dugdale	PERSON	's '' History of the
Antiqui	PERSON	- ties of Warwickshire '' contains an engraving of the
Stratford	LOCATION	Bust which differs in certain details from the bust as we know it , and which had `` been entirely ignored by all '' Shakespeare students -LRB- except Halliwell-Phil - lipps , she might have added -RRB- , although it is the earliest known engraving of the bust .

		In her enthusiasm over her discovery , Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	goes into raptures over the fact that in
Dugdale	PERSON	's drawing the poet has '' large and full dark eyes , '' hollow and emaciated cheeks , a softly-drooping -LRB- instead of a `` perky '' -RRB- moustache , lacks the conventional sign-post pen , wants the familiar mantle , and is free from the `` plump earthliness '' of the bust .

		She finds in this engraving '' the tired creator of poems , exhausted from lack of sleep , '' and boldly and falsely asserts that `` it dif - fers in all important details from the bust as it appears now . ''

		The differences between the bust and the drawing can be explained only in one of two ways : either
Dugdale	PERSON	and his engraver were careless in the representation of the tomb , or the tomb was altered and remodelled after the publication of
Dugdale	PERSON	's work .

		Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	, as might be guessed , adopts the latter view because it heightens the importance of her discovery .

		Quite in keep - ing with this tendency , she exaggerates the imperfections of the bust , and the differences between the bust and the engraving , credits
Dugdale	PERSON	with painstaking care in his work -LRB- although she is forced to admit after read - ing
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's criticism of her essay he '' was no artist '' and '' was careless as to insig - nificant details , '' and `` made no attempt at accurate reproduction of the expression of the human countenance '' -RRB- , magnifies and misrep - resents the repairs of the bust made under
Ward	ORGANIZATION	's direction in
1748	DATE	-LRB- there is no war - rant for the assertion that the bust was '' sub - mitted to the moulder 's mercenary hands '' or that it was reconstructed -RRB- , and strips the Droeshout and Chandos portraits of their value as fairly authentic presentments of the poet .

		To further bolster up the significance of her find , she asserts as `` quite possible '' that
Dugdale	PERSON	saw Shakespeare in the flesh , but she omits to say that
Dugdale	PERSON	was only ten and one-half years old when the poet died , and was not a resident of
Stratford	LOCATION	.

		If all 322 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 14	DATE	that Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	says were true ,
Dugdale	PERSON	's engraving would be a portrait of Shakespeare of the first importance .

		But
Dugdale	PERSON	is not a reliable guide to the antiquities of
Warwick	PERSON	- shire , as a comparison of his illustrations with modern photographs of these antiquities will show .

		Sir
George Trevelyan	PERSON	has pointed out that
Dugdale	PERSON	's
Carew Clopton Monument	ORGANIZATION	is even more inaccurate than his
Shakespeare Monument	ORGANIZATION	, which seems to have been roughly and inexactly sketched for him or by him and subsequently elaborated by his draughtsman or engraver in accordance with the dictates of his fancy .

		Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	admits that Dug - dale 's rough sketch , in his diary , shows the mantle , though the engraving in his book does not .

		The failure to reproduce
Dugdale	PERSON	's sketch for comparison with the engraving is a suspicious circumstance , as is also the omis - sion of photographs of the monument and of the engraving .

		These illustrations would not have added greatly to the cost of the book , and the readers would then be in a position to judge for themselves .

		As a matter of fact , the differences between the bust and monu - ment and the engraving are such as result from the indifferent workmanship of an un - skilled and careless draughtsman , and sucn as to leave no doubt that there was no attempt at exactness in the reproduction .

		As for the rest of the book , with the excep - tion of the really commendable chapter on the poet 's maternal ancestry , it is too full of romancing to have any value as biography .

		Those who are not too particular about scien - tific exactness will find this a rather readable and fairly well written volume of odds and ends about
Shakespeare	PERSON	and his times .

		It may not be an unfitting close to this review to mention that the very first page of Mrs.
Stopes	PERSON	's introductory chapter contains a wholly inexcusable misquotation from '' Ham - let '' -LRB- '' There 's a divinity doth shape our ends Rough hew them as we will '' -RRB- which is sym - bolic of the unscientific method characteristic of this author 's work .


SAMUEL A. TANNENBAUM	PERSON	.

		BUDDHIST PSYCHOLOGY .

		* Like the psychology of
Europe	LOCATION	, Buddhist psychology is a growth , the result of a slow development through the centuries .

		Euro - pean psychology , however , presents some cataclysmic changes , such as those from paganism to Christianity and from supersti - tion to the scientific analysis of mind .

		This is not the case with Buddhist thought , * BUDDHIST PSYCHOLOGY .

		By Mrs.
C. A. F. Rhys-Davids	PERSON	. ''

		The Quest Series . ''


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		there is quiet and continuous growth from the earliest to the latest writings .

		Again , just as early European psychology is embedded in a larger body of philosophic doctrine , so this Buddhist psychology must be selected piecemeal from the philosophy through which psychological observations are scattered .

		These observations appear , how - ever , to be fundamental to the philosophy of the Orient , and incidental -LRB- or almost inci - dental -RRB- to that of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		In both cases , moreover , ethics seems to be the chief aim of the philosophic thought .

		To the above three rough similarities -LRB- grounded , perhaps , in the very nature of the human mind and its development -RRB- we may add a prime difference .

		The Buddhist thinkers did not begin with universals , but with more specific and concrete concepts of psychology .

		The chief categories are : -LRB- 1 -RRB- chitta , or consciousness ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- chetasika , lit - erally mental things , or `` mentals '' ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- rupa , visible form , material quality ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- nibbana -LRB- nirvana -RRB- , the ultimate good , or summum bonum .

		The Buddhist concept of consciousness is far more extensive and pantheistic than our notion of personal consciousness .

		It includes the universe of being , from the infra-human through both inferior and superior celestial worlds .

		As is well known , Buddhist philoso - phy teaches that by sedulous exercise in con - templation '' mundane consciousness might be temporarily transformed into consciousness experienced in either the less material or the quite immaterial worlds . ''

		Chitta is the name for this all-pervading consciousness , cheta - sika for its phases or factors ; though the logic of whole and part is not emphatic in
Budd	LOCATION	- hist thought , for it is a philosophy of the continuum .

		This pantheistic consciousness either `` happens '' in living individuals or is envisaged in them , and one of the most important attributes of consciousness is its badness or goodness .

		Hence ethics becomes an essential part of Buddhist psychology .

		The fleeting `` impermanent '' character of the stream of thought and experience is con - trasted with the more permanent human body in the earlier Buddhist writings .

		In later exegesis of this concept the mind is an '' inter - mittent manifestation happening only in re - action to a suitable stimulus . ''

		Consequently there is visual , auditory , and other sensational consciousness `` just as fire is different ac - cording to the kind of fuel . ''

		Besides the word chitta for mind or intelli - gence , the word vinnana , almost the equiva - lent of our word '' soul , '' was also used .

		The Buddhist notion of the genesis of individual
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 323 consciousness may then be inferred from the following quotation : `` Were vinnana , An - anda , not to descend into the mother 's womb , would body and mind become constituted therein ? ''

		There are also terms for the self , and for mental and bodily life as combined in one individual .

		The self is also doubled in ethical passages , as in our term '' self-accusa - tion , '' etc. .

		Finally , self-analysis is valued as a means of self-mastery .

		Man is an '' impermanent compound , '' with no unity save that conferred by the name , and he is capable of looking either into sense impressions or into spiritual impressions , in - cluding what may be called supernormal experience .

		The account of consciousness in Mrs.
Rhys	PERSON	-
Davids	PERSON	's little book , from which we derive the foregoing summary , includes discussions of the following : -LRB- 1 -RRB- stimuli , or `` those mate - rial qualities '' from which the individual receives sense impressions ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- feeling -LRB- in - cluding the `` feeling-tone '' of sensations -RRB- , it being of interest to note that the existence of neutral or indifferent feelings is claimed ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- perception , which includes both sense-percep - tion and the perception of meaning and rela - tions ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- thought or mental elaboration , later on volition seeming to have been in - cluded in this `` compound '' ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- conscious - ness in general -LRB- vinnana -RRB- , including the already-mentioned genetic consciousness .

		The reader will doubtless be surprised to find the fifth general notion , of which the preceding four are for us subdivisions , made coordinate with those four .

		This is accounted for by '' the absence in the Buddhist tradition of any cogent logic of division by way of genus and species , '' and `` an emphatic nega - tion of any substantial unity in vinnana . '' ''

		To see further separateness would be , wrote
Buddhgahosa	LOCATION	, ` as if one drew water at the
delta	ORGANIZATION	where the five rivers enter the sea say - ing : '' This is Ganges water ; this is Jumna water . '' '

		`` All these mental states are one with respect to their object . ''

		Vinnana in this phase of its meaning is almost the equiva - lent of our word '' awareness . ''

		No psychophysical theory of sensation , in the modern meaning , appears in Buddhist psychology ; yet the senses are discussed with the dominant place always given to sight and colors .

		The division of labor between the senses is also noted .

		In the heart , or seat of the mind , the senses become one , according to the early disciples of
Buddha	LOCATION	, though this idea is not to be found in the teachings of the Founder himself .

		Human emotions may be said to have begun only yesterday to yield to scientific analysis .

		Little wonder , then , that Buddhist psychology describes only sense-feeling , and includes in this term '' not well , '' '' ills and pains of body , ills and misery of mind , in a word , dis-ease . ''

		The analysis of intellectual processes is not carried far in the older books .

		Our every-day terms , perception , opinion , volition , wish , aspiration , remembering , comparing , discern - ing , etc. , are used , and give a hint as to the stage which analysis had reached .

		The chief aim of the Buddhist disciples was to teach how to practise the exercises which helped toward the '' emancipation of heart and mind from all hindrances and fetters ad - verse to spiritual perfection . ''

		The directions for auto-suggestion and the attainment of the trance-consciousness are excellent .

		Perhaps those in search of a rest cure for overwrought minds will find this portion of Mrs.
Ehys	PERSON	-
Davids	PERSON	's book the most valuable .

		Such in briefest outline is the psychology of the Buddhist books regarded as the earliest ones .

		Later writings made further advances in the study of the mind .

		Yet viewed from the standpoint of the sharp discrimination and keen analysis of modern psychology , this very ancient discussion reminds us of one who `` sees through a glass darkly . ''

		This re - minder , however , comes when one reads any chapter of ancient psychology .

		Perhaps that is the best `` exercise '' to teach us how much labor our modern psychology has cost .


L. W. COLE	PERSON	.

		A DIVIXE VISIONARY .

		* `` Your affectionate , enthusiastic , hope - fostered visionary ,
William Blake	PERSON	. ''

		Thus , in the conclusion of a letter to
Hayley	LOCATION	,
Blake	PERSON	describes himself ; and it would be hard to find more apt words of denomination .

		Add to them that
Blake	PERSON	was one of the greatest artists in lyric verse that the world has ever known , and that he was nevertheless sepa - rated from communication with men by an impenetrable wall of curious mysticism that almost ruined his art , and you do very fair justice to
Blake	PERSON	as a poet .

		Just because the larger part of
Blake	PERSON	's work is so nearly an unintelligible ruin .

		Dr.
Fred	PERSON	-
erick E. Pierce	PERSON	has performed an especially valuable service in issuing his '' Selections from the Symbolical Poems of
William ` Blake	PERSON	. ''


Blake	PERSON	's exquisite lyrics are known to every - one ; but his `` Prophetic Books '' are so in - * SELECTIONS FROM THE SYMBOLICAL POEMS OP
WILLIAM BLAKE	PERSON	.

		By
Frederick E. Pierce	PERSON	, Ph.D. , Assistant Professor of English in
Sheffield Scientific School	ORGANIZATION	,
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	.

		New Haven :
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		324 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 14	DATE	humanly repellent that not a hundred persons in a decade ever read them .

		It is as easy to penetrate into a virgin jungle as to venture into them ; the labor is enormous and the reward doubtful .

		Professor
Pierce	PERSON	, by sepa - rating from the great mass of
Blake	PERSON	's chaotic writings certain of the more coherent portions , has produced an attractive volume that will allure many a reader who would flee from the complete '' Prophetic Books '' in dismay .

		Per - haps such a reader may , even after making the attempt which this book facilitates , turn back hopeless and revert to those simple and subtle lyrics in which
Blake	PERSON	shows himself an unquestionable master of beauty ; but he will at least have had the satisfaction of partially soothing a conscience that may well hesitate to regard as negligible even the maddest work of a mind that could sometimes sing thus : '' Thou the golden fruit dost bear , I am clad in flowers fair ; Thy sweet boughs perfume the air , And ` the turtle buildeth there . ''

		There she sits and feeds her young , Sweet I hear her mournful song ; And thy lovely leaves among , There is love , I hear his tongue . ''

		Swinburne , great metrist that he was , chose this passage out for special admiration ; and , indeed , there stirs everywhere through the lines a high aerial vibrancy , an auroral flush of music , that rises into regions never touched by
Swinburne	PERSON	's own superb but earthly tides of sound .

		No one has ever really understood the whole of
Blake	PERSON	's `` Prophetic Books . ''

		Swinburne 's generous enthusiasm , called into being by the indisputable greatness of the lyrics , led him somehow to believe that he was able to fathom the longer poems also ; and Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	, influ - enced by his preoccupation with mysticism , has tried to make himself think that he can thread his way through these labyrinths .

		But neither one of them is very clear in his report of what he has seen in this cloudy nether - world ; and it is not necessary for us to imagine that either one saw very much more than we see .

		For though
Blake	PERSON	rose some - times to lyrical heights from which he could have looked
Milton	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	straight and level in the eyes , he sometimes sank to depths of intellectual confusion where he was below the eye-level of the maddest street-corner prophet .

		No great genius was ever more unequal than he .

		He wrote , on occasion , in terms so simple as to be universal , and at other moments in wild mythological images so complex and private as to be literally incom - prehensible .

		To get anything from the `` Prophetic Books , '' one must first of all put them aside and attempt to understand
Blake	PERSON	himself .

		Visionary and mystic though he was , he did not differ from ordinary men so much in the quality of his mental state as in the con - sistency with which he preserved a mental state that is for most men a very fleeting one .

		To the dullest of us come rare keen moments when in the glow of some sunrise the material phenomena of earth and sun are obliterated by the overwhelming spirit of flaming joy and new creation that cries out of that dawn ; and for every man who has ever lived , the phy - sical vesture of some woman has in a magic hour dissolved to nothing and left him staring into the spiritual Eden of a world beyond .

		But for most minds , these are passing moods ; for most minds , the external signals by which the world makes itself known to our con - sciousnesses are the final verities .

		To
Blake	PERSON	they were never verities .

		He forgot them as we habitually forget the alphabet through whose agency we read ; he passed immediately beyond them to touch lovingly the significant soul of beauty which was adumbrated to him by the phenomena of life 's episodes .

		In the clearest piece of self-analysis he ever uttered , he writes : '' I assert for myself that I do not behold the outward creation , and that to me it is a hinder - ance and not action . '

		What ! '

		it will be ques - tioned , ' when the sun rises , do you not see a round disc of fire somewhat like a guinea ? '

		Oh !

		no , no !

		I see an innumerable company of the heavenly host , crying ' Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God Almighty ! '

		I question not with my corporeal eye any more than I would question a window concern - ing sight .

		I look through it and not with it . ''

		Some such power as that , penetrating through commonplace phenomena to the more significant essences that lie behind them , is the very life-blood of poetical imagination ; and though
Blake	PERSON	was far from being the greatest of the poets , it may be doubted whether any human being has ever had a more intense light of poetry in his soul .

		What
Blake	PERSON	lacked was a cold calculating architec - tural intellect ; and he left no single edifice that can be spoken of in the same breath with those of
Milton	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	, who are in other ways his spiritual peers .

		Rather , his work is like a series of half-ruined Gothic windows , sometimes mere fragments of glowing mosaic ; but through them pours a light tinged with such unearthly splendor that , in certain moods , one asks for nothing more .

		He was a great craftsman , often , in these fragments ; and it is a well selected group of the frag - ments that Professor
Pierce	PERSON	has brought together .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 325 These selections will give to a reader un - familiar with the whole of
Blake	PERSON	's work an impression of greater lucidity than is wholly accurate or w r holly fortunate .

		Professor
Pierce	PERSON	would doubtless be the first to acknowledge that his attempt , while it will win
Blake	PERSON	many new readers , does on the other hand diminish the chaotic and cloudy grandeur of
Blake	PERSON	's wild universe without greatly abating its fundamental preposterousness .

		The selec - tions try to show in decent sequence the chief elements of
Blake	PERSON	's mythological system ; but this system is the one thing in the '' Prophetic Books '' that is quite negligible for sane men .


Blake	PERSON	was by no means the profound and
Platonean	PERSON	mind that some of his admirers think him .

		He was simply the wreck of a great artist .

		Those purgatorial visions , those volcanic fragments of thought , which in him too often take the place of really intelligent cerebration , he clothed in music and light - ning ; and they issued forth with a splendor that is dazzling and misleading .

		Unable to subdue these sub-rational fever-hallucinations to the discipline of any intelligible order or even to the requirements of communicable expression , he created out of them a fictitious world of phantasmagoria , filled with names and symbols of arbitrary and indecipherable meaning .

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	would doubtless damn to the pit a critic who chose to admit that he found the '' Prophetic Books '' chaotically unintelligible ; but
Gilchrist	PERSON	, the devoted and sympathetic biographer of
Blake	PERSON	, was forced to confess in his day that he believed them to be `` inco - herent rhapsodies , .

		.

		a perplexed region of morbid analogy . ''

		These symbolic poems , in spite of all their interest , are failures ; for art is expression , and these do not achieve expressiveness .

		One can not properly quarrel with
Blake	PERSON	for the mystical unreality of his conceptions ; but we may justly blame him for his neglect to embody these conceptiops in a form capable of conveying the vision to us .

		It is a pure case of insufficient artistic con - science ; the visionary who wrote `` Vala , '' ''
Milton	PERSON	, '' and ''
Jerusalem	LOCATION	'' has overwhelmed the artist who wrote `` The Tiger , '' and left him stammering in solitary darkness .

DAVISON FICKE	PERSON	.

		The first complete edition of the '' Poetical Works of
Lionel Johnson	PERSON	'' will be published this autumn by Mr.

		RECEXT PLAYS OF WAR AND TJOVE .

		* Like the rest of us , the dramatists can not get away from the war ; and like us , they can - not find much that is new to say about it .

		Alas , that `` bromides '' taste no fresher for being prescribed by a celebrated doctor !

		Timeliness and a great name did not avail to give Sir
James Barrie	PERSON	's `` Der Tag '' success on the stage ; and for reading , too , it is a futile and unimpressive piece of work .

		The fact is that
Barrie	PERSON	's genius is no better adapted to heroics than is that of his best known American interpreter .

		Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	's `` A Belgian Christmas Eve '' reads a good deal better .

		It is a new version of ''
Rada	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	's one-act play of the Balkan War , with the scene changed from
Servia	LOCATION	to
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		Dramatically and as a protest against war , `` A Belgian Christmas Eve '' is much less effective than the Amer - ican war play , `` Across the Border '' -LRB- reviewed in THE DIAL of
August 15	DATE	-RRB- .

		As a play - wright , Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	has not fully mastered his technique ; and the flavor of partisanship , from which the American play is kept scrupu - lously free , weakens the moral effect of the piece .

		Nevertheless , Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	tells an ap - pealing story ; and his verse , one need hardly add , is vigorous and at times imaginative .

		Its fault , as usual , is a fatal fluency .

		Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	seldom knows when to stop .

		Thus his epi - logue , beginning with the fine stanza quoted below , trails off into prolixity and weakness . ''

		Now the muttering gun-fire dies , Now the night has cloaked the slain , the stars patrol the skies , Hear our sleepless prayer again !

		A Russian tribute of pity to
Belgium	LOCATION	is paid by
Leonid Andreyev	PERSON	.


Emil Grelieu	PERSON	, the hero of '' The Sorrows of
Belgium	LOCATION	, '' is
Maeter	PERSON	- linck scarcely disguised ; and in style the play seems an attempt to imitate the Belgian master .

		As might be expected , it succeeds best in imitating his weaknesses , especially the vagueness and repetition of his earlier man - ner .

		A speech or two will serve as a sample : ``
Jeanne	PERSON	.

		But I can not ,
Emil	LOCATION	.

		What is it ?

		I can not understand .

		What is it ?

		Where are we ?

		My God , I do n't understand anything .

		Why such a dream ?

		Why such a dream ?

		I ca n't understand .

		My head is aching .

		By this recipe , dramatic dialogue is indeed easy to write .

		Of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's imaginative uplift and spiritual insight the play has not a trace .

		Far more effective than these new pieces , even as a plea for the
Belgium	LOCATION	of to-day , is
Sardou	ORGANIZATION	's powerful melodrama of the days of William the Silent , `` Patrie . ''

		First per - formed in
1869	DATE	, this play now appears for the first time in English , admirably translated for '' The Drama League Series '' by Mr.
Barrett H. Clark	PERSON	.

		In his Introduction , Mr.
Clark	PERSON	sensibly protests against the modern ten - dency to ridicule Sardou and the '' well made play , '' for which Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	set the fashion with his jests at '' Sardoodledom . ''

		So far as this tendency represents a reaction against a standardized and machine-made form of play , it is wholesome ; yet a machine - made form is infinitely better than no form at all , as anyone who reads '' The Sorrows of
Belgium	LOCATION	'' or
Gorki	PERSON	's `` Submerged '' -LRB- noticed below -RRB- will heartily testify .

		`` Patrie '' tells the story of the
Count de Rysoor	ORGANIZATION	, a heroic Flemish patriot who with the help of
William of Orange	ORGANIZATION	nearly succeeds in delivering
Brus	PERSON	- sels from the cruel militaristic control of the
Duke of Alva	ORGANIZATION	.

		The play is crowded with action , like a Shakespearean tragi-comedy ; its mate - rial is intensely dramatic , and is presented with the brilliance and skill of a great master of his craft .

		Beside the broad sweep of its action , its vivid and masculine force , most of the little modern '' dramas of ideas '' seem the peevish whinings of an invalid .

		For example , consider '' The State For - bids , '' a little tract in dialogue which scatters its fire of complaints among various supposed abuses , including war .

		The
State	ORGANIZATION	forbids the doctor to inform the drunkard 's wife how to avoid having children ; when the idiot child is born , the
State	ORGANIZATION	forbids its mother or the doctor to kill it ; and finally the
State	ORGANIZATION	through conscription takes away from the mother her only strong and intelligent son .

		Her conclu - sion , requiring no comment , is `` Damn the State ! ''

		In the reviewer 's opinion , the only one of these complaints which has any justifi - cation is the first , and it is obvious that this can not be satisfactorily treated in drama .

		A much stronger example of the play with a thesis is Miss
Crothers	PERSON	's `` A Man 's World . ''

		The central idea is that a woman who believes in a single standard of sex morality should not marry a man who has lived in accordance with the '' double standard . ''

		The plot is carefully constructed to fit this doctrine .

		The heroine , `` Frank '' `` Ware , a successful writer , has adopted the illegitimate son of an Amer - ican girl who died when the child was born , in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		As her love for the adopted '' Kiddie '' has grown , her hate of his unknown father has kept pace with it .

		When through an ancient but skilfully handled dramatic device , she learns that the man with whom she is in love is '' Kiddie 's '' father , her problem is before her .

		Here is the weak spot in the play .

		The author is determined that the hero - ine shall act consistently with her theory and reject her lover ; but in order to make this plausible on the stage , it was necessary to violate all plausibility in another matter , and to sacrifice the consistency of the lover 's char - acter .

		He is represented as a masterful and rather unscrupulous man of the world , much in love with
Frank	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yet when she makes it perfectly plain that she would instantly ac - cept him if he showed the slightest sign of repentance , he suddenly develops a strain of scrupulous and unseasonable truthfulness which enables her to reject him .

		In spite of this weakness , the play is in general well planned , and in so far deserves its success on the stage .

		In style and characterization , how - ever , it is decidedly crude .

		Whatever may be thought of
Gorki	PERSON	's '' Sub - merged , '' it can not be accused of having a thesis . ''

		These plays , '' the writer of the
Introduction	ORGANIZATION	tells us , `` pass the test of all supreme art ; they are slices of life . ''

		With - out commenting on the things which the '' test of supreme art '' would exclude , one may re - mark that this particular '' slice of life '' is cut from the toughest part of the rump .

		The scene is a Russian lodging house of the lowest type , an eddy into which the scum of human - ity has drifted .

		In this filthy hole appears
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 327 Luka , an aged pilgrim , and for a short time he brings a little kindness into the lives of the wretches who live there .

		Then for no apparent reason he disappears , and the in - habitants sink back to an even lower level than that on which they lived before his com - ing .

		The play is confusing to read on account of the large number of characters and the multiplicity of Russian nicknames .

		In this respect , at least , the translator would appear to have done his work rather badly .

		Of the three plays of
Maurice Donnay	PERSON	translated by Mr.
Barrett H. Clark	PERSON	for '' The Modern Drama Series '' two , as is usual with
Donnay	PERSON	, are concerned entirely with illicit sex relations .

		In '' Lovers '' and '' The Free Woman '' we are in a world where informal and temporary relations are the regular thing . ''

		Lovers '' opens , as one of
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	's plays does , with a children 's party ; but the moth - ers of these hopeful families are all unmar - ried .


Claudine R-ozay	PERSON	, who gives the party for her little daughter , has been for years the mistress of the
Count de Ruyseux	ORGANIZATION	.


Vetheuil	LOCATION	, the other man who gains her affections , be - comes dissatisfied because she will not break with the count and live with him openly .

		She is perfectly willing to be unfaithful to the count in secret , but for the sake of their daughter she refuses to leave him altogether .

		After a time
Vetheuil	LOCATION	can endure this no longer ; in spite of tears and storms he goes off on an exploring expedition to
Indo-China	LOCATION	, and on his return marries .

		Meanwhile , Ruy - seux ' wife having died ,
Claudine	PERSON	reconciles herself to marriage with her old lover .

		The title of '' The Free Woman '' is ironical .

		Antonia , like
Claudine	PERSON	, enters on another intrigue while still the mistress of
Roger Lembrun	PERSON	; but he , a man of considerable char - acter , discovers her infidelity and discards her .

		A sub-plot emphasizes the point of the play : that people in irregular unions -LRB- `` free '' -RRB- are really in a double bondage to their lovers and to their own passions .

		Both plays , it need hardly be said , are well con - structed , and the characters are analyzed and discriminated with skill .

		The translation ap - pears to be excellent ; but it is hard to see what good purpose is served by putting French plays of this type into English at all .

		If they are widely read , it will be not because of their literary merit , but because of their interest of scandal ; and surely they give a misleading impression of French life and character .

		The third play in the volume , '' They , '' is a clever and cynical one-act farce , in which a bridegroom and a bride , meeting by chance for the first time in a hotel , decide to leave their newly married spouses and elope .

		This trifle is written with much gaiety and spirit .

		At once more serious and more humorous are the three one-act pieces in Mrs.
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	's '' Love in Danger . ''

		The scenes are all laid in the kitchens of Cornish cottages , and the dialogue has a strong and delightful flavor of the soil .

		As the title of the volume sug - gests , each of the plays deals with a crisis in married love .

		In '' The Subjection of Kezia , ''
Joe Pengilly	PERSON	, rather stupid , much in love , and married two years , is perplexed and worried by the '' teasiness '' and crossness of his wife .

		He confides in his older friend ,
Matthew Trevaskis	PERSON	, a travelled philosopher who has had domestic troubles of his own .

		Matthew confidently diagnoses the case , and prescribes the cane as a remedy ; with much difficulty he induces the reluctant
Joe	PERSON	to go with him and purchase the hateful implement .

		The solution , unexpected by all three , is thor - oughly satisfactory .

		In `` The Pixy '' the endangered love is that of a husband for his dead wife .

		The situation is an uncommon one , and is not made entirely clear ; the piece succeeds as a study in character , but not as a play .

		In `` Mothers '' the threatened ruin of a family is averted by the triumph of the maternal instinct over the sexual , not in the wife , but in her rival .

		Mrs.
Ellis	PERSON	's characters are always firmly and delicately drawn , and her situations are presented sympathetically and with the restraint that gives added force .

		The first and third plays should act well .

		Love is in danger in Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	's ''
Plas	PERSON	- ter Saints '' also ; but the main issue is of a different sort .

		The Reverend Dr.
Rodney Vaughn	PERSON	is a leading light in one of the dis - senting churches .

		He is a robust , powerful , and thoroughly human minister , and exercises great influence throughout his neighborhood .

		His wife , a saintly Puritan , discovers and forces him to admit that a year or so pre - viously he has had a love affair with his secre - tary and is the father of her child .

		Mrs.
Vaughn	PERSON	tries to force him to public confes - sion , and threatens to divorce him so that he may marry the girl .

		He defends his course of deception on grounds of the harm his expo - sure would do to the church and to individu - als , and of the uselessness of destroying his future influence .

		It is through his sin , he declares , that he has become able really to help sinners .

		The problem thus presented is the theme of the play .


Vaughn	PERSON	comes ' over to his wife 's position , let the plaster saint be smashed , and the real man step forth to do what work he , can in the world .

		But when it appears that his public confession would ruin her daughter 's prospects , Mrs.
Vaughn	PERSON	too 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 14	DATE	reverses her attitude ; and the play ends rather weakly with a quasi-vindication of
Vaughn	ORGANIZATION	's original course .

		No real solution of the problem is presented ; but both sides of the case are vigorously argued , with some wit and much rhetoric .

		Why Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	should choose to call the piece in his sub-title '' a high comedy in three movements '' is a double mystery .

		The authors of our genuine '' high comedy , '' we may be pretty sure , would have shunned the term like poison if it had been invented in their days .

		`` Plaster Saints , '' in point of fact , is primarily not comedy , but melodrama .

		And why on earth should any dramatist think proper to call his acts '' movements '' 1 `` Plaster Saints '' is the work of a clever man of talent ; Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's `` A Bit o ' Love '' bears the mark of genius .

		Its charac - ters are never , like Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	's , '' stagey '' or rhetorical ; they are absolutely unconscious of an audience , and real .

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	is not here dealing with a sociological problem , as he does in some of his earlier plays .

		The wrong-headed criticism which must find a thesis in every serious play can doubtless dis - cover one here , but the interest does not lie in any thesis ; it lies in the vivid and charm - ing characterization , and in the development of the central character through the action .

		For background there is a village in the `` West of
England	LOCATION	, and a group of worthies whose talk is comparable in raciness and humor with that of
Hardy	LOCATION	's rustics .


Michael Strang	PERSON	- way , the curate , is a very human saint with the passionate heart of a poet or musician .

		His wife , with whom he is hopelessly in love , has deserted him for a former lover .

		She comes back to entreat him not to divorce her , since divorce proceedings would ruin her lover .

		Rather than be the cause of this , she will even return to the husband for whom she has never cared .

		After a cruel struggle with himself ,
Michael	PERSON	consents to let her go .

		The interview is overheard by one of his parish - ioners , and the news , spreading rapidly , brings upon the curate the contempt of the neighbor - hood .

		He is hissed as he comes out of the church .

		Even the rector 's wife an admira - bly drawn character , by the way , urges upon him the duty of divorce . ''

		This great church of ours , '' she tells him , `` is based on the rightful condemnation of wrong-doing .

		There are times when forgiveness is a sin . ''

		Strangway will not yield ; but his desolation brings him to the verge of suicide .

		The ap - pearance of a child whom he frightens and then comforts , and of a farmer .

		who is pluck - ily struggling with a great grief , restore him to his real self .

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's insight appears in nothing more strikingly than in this fine and strong conclusion .

		A lesser play - wright would not have resisted the tempta - tion of the obviously effective tragic end .

		The workmanship of the play , indeed , is every - where fine and strong ; from the literary as well as from the dramatic point of view , it is a continuous delight .

		An equally finished bit of work , which must be considered by itself , is
Anatole France	LOCATION	's charming mediaeval farce , '' The Man Who Married a Dumb Wife . ''

		This has been well translated by Professor
Curtis Hidden Page	PERSON	, who supplies also an interesting Introduction .

		The play is based on a story told by
Rabelais	ORGANIZATION	, of a man who , sad because his wife is dumb , becomes sadder when her speech is restored by a famous surgeon , and who finds relief only in an operation which makes him stone deaf .

		M.
France	LOCATION	has adhered closely to this simple outline ; but his play is a marvel of literary dexterity .

		Without any affectation of archaism , he has , as Professor Page re - marks , somehow infused the little farce with the very spirit of the old comedy , its lively action , its broad and simple humor .

		The thing is a trifle , a mere recreation for M.
France	LOCATION	, but it is executed with the cunning hand of the master .

		Our own writers lack this fine historical sense ; not one of them could so per - fectly assume the tone and manner of that earlier time .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* With the exception of two or three `` sports , '' Mr.
Harold Bindloss	PERSON	has written upwards of a score of novels having substantially the same thematic material , and it is surprising to note how successfully he contrives to in - vest this material with fresh interest upon each new venture .

		The scene is always West - ern
Canada	LOCATION	; the hero is always a man of simple integrity and self-reliant character ; the heroine is always something of a patri - cian , slow to reach an appreciation of the hero 's genuine human worth .

		Inimical social influences alw r ays work to delay the romantic consummation ; there is always a villain or two occupied in thwarting the hero 's activi - ties ; and there is always a fierce battle with nature , in which the fury of the elements is met and overcome by sheer pluck and dogged perseverance .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 329 of
Allenwood	LOCATION	, '' as it is of most of its prede - cessors .

		We note that Mr.
Bindloss	PERSON	's heroes are more convincing than his heroines .

		The charms of the latter are made known to us inferentially rather than by clear portraiture .

		The author is singularly chary in the matter of their personal description , and gives us no more than hints on the physical side .

		His heroes are much better done , and all in all he is a man 's writer rather than a caterer to the tastes of his feminine readers .

		But in his plodding prosaic way he does it all remarka - bly well , and it is a marvel that he can thus continue doing the same thing over and over again without making the monotony of the proceeding too w r earisome .

		One thing we know for certain that whatever the tragic complications of the romance , the difficulties will all be cleared away , and the ending made happy . ''

		The Landloper , '' Mr.
Holman	PERSON	Day 's new novel , hardly justifies its sub-title , `` A Ro - mance of the Woods . ''

		It is true that it opens in the woods , with its vagabond hero on the tramp .

		But it soon takes us to the city , and keeps us there .


Walker Farr	PERSON	-LRB- which is not his real name -RRB- has taken to the road as a fugitive from the law , owing to a situation created by his quixotic self-sacrifice to save his father 's reputation .

		He has also sought to divest himself of human sympathies that he may escape active participation in the affairs of men .

		But the social claim proves too strong for him when he comes face to face with the conditions created by the unholy alliance of business and politics in the
New England State	ORGANIZATION	which is the scene of his ad - ventures .

		An unscrupulous syndicate has got control of the municipal water-supply systems of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, and is sup - plying typhoid-infected drinking water to its customers .

		Farr feels constrained to make himself '' an enemy of the people '' by an attack upon this criminal conspiracy , and sets himself to work with such effect that he destroys the power of the syndicate , and causes the election of a new governor hon - est and courageous enough to overthrow the whole corrupt system .

		Along with this civic crusade goes
Farr	PERSON	's own personal romance , in which the villain is duly thwarted , and the girl securely won .

		Farr makes a very en - gaging hero for this complication of senti - ment and pathos and political intrigue , and his procedure has a quality of originality which does credit to the author 's invention , and does not permit the reader 's interest to lapse for a moment .

		From the imagined memoirs of one Lord
Henry Goade	PERSON	, in eighteen manuscript folio volumes , Mr.
Rafael Sabatini	PERSON	has pretended to gather the material for a romance entitled `` The Sea-Hawk . ''

		Without the aid of this ponderous autobiography , he tells us , `` it were impossible to reconstruct the life of that
Cornish	PERSON	gentleman who became a renegade and a Barbary Corsair and might have be - come
Basha	PERSON	of
Algiers	LOCATION	but for certain mat - ters which are to be set forth . ''

		Adopting the fiction , then , w y e express our heartfelt gratitude to the mythical Sir
Henry	PERSON	for pre - serving his record of the deeds of Sir
Oliver Tressilian	PERSON	, the mighty-thewed and fiery - tempered hero of this stirring tale of the spacious times of Queen
Bess	PERSON	.

		It is one of the most exciting yarns of its good old-fashioned sort that we have encountered for many years .

		Sir
Oliver	PERSON	became a corsair because the treachery of his half-brother caused him to be trepanned and sold into slavery , and because the fair
Rosamund	PERSON	believed him to have been the murderer of her own brother .

		When the whirligig of time eventually brought into his power both the treacherous half-brother and the faithless maiden , he was enabled to have his revenge upon the one , and so to enlighten the other as to regain her love .

		How he res - cued her from Moorish captivity , and how he cleared his own name in the eyes of the English judges who would have hanged him incontinently , is recounted for us in a thrill - ing tale which rises steadily to a dramatic climax , and comes out in a way to satisfy all our romantic instincts .

		Mr.
Sabatini	PERSON	is a wonder-worker in the narrative of adventure , and we are especially grateful to him for sparing us the fustian of the artificial ar - chaism in language with which practitioners in this kind are wont to clothe the products of their invention .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Peaceful There is an old saying that musings in before forty we seek pleasure , after forty we shun pain .

		Some such truth as that , if it be a truth , may help to explain why Mr.
Arthur Christopher Ben	PERSON	- son , in the maturity of his somewhat more than forty years , is inclined to look upon human life and all human activity as par - taking of the nature of an avoidance of ill .

		This , at any rate , is the view illustrated and defended in the opening paper of `` Escape , and Other Essays '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a collec - tion of meditative disquisitions refreshingly remote from the theme now occupying the minds of so many writers and of the great 330 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 14	DATE	majority of readers .

		It is a remoteness for which the author feels constrained to offer an apology , or a justification .

		`` Is it right , is it decent , '' he asks , '' to unfold an old picture of peace before the eyes of those who have had to look into chaos and destruction ? ''

		and he answers : '' Yes , I believe that it is right and wholesome to do this , because the most treach - erous and cowardly thing we can do is to dis - believe in life .

		Those old dreams and visions were true enough , and they will be true again .

		They represent the real life to which we must try to return . ''

		Therefore he directs his thoughts and ours to such perennial themes of interest as literature and life , sun - set , charm , dreams , schooldays , authorship , `` Walt Whitman , villages , and some of the deeper mysteries of our existence .

		Much of the writer 's intimate personal history creeps , here and there , into his pages .

		In his chap - ter on authorship it is curious to note his confession that without the prospect of pub - lication he could hardly retain his interest in writing .

		This contrasts with a much earlier assertion , in one of his first books , that the mere act of literary composition was enough in itself to keep his pen going .

		Art for its own sake then seemed to suffice him .

		He does not note this significant change of tone .

		We acquire a sadder wisdom with the passing years .

		In discussing dreams Mr.
Benson	PERSON	de - clares his belief that his own dreams , contrary to the usual rule , occur in the midst of pro- found sleep , not on its either edge ; for , says he , `` I have occasionally been awakened sud - denly by some loud sound , and on these occa - sions I have come out of dreams of an inten - sity and vividness that I have never known equaled . ''

		But , obviously , that proves noth - ing ; or it may argue the very contrary of the author 's contention .

		The book is a worthy addition to a notable series .

		A mine of entomological wonder-lore .

		The insect world remains a terra incognita to most people because of the small size of the individ - uals which compose its myriad hordes .

		The microscope makes possible , on the one hand , the minute examination of these diminutive hosts ; and microphotography , on the other 1 hand , has made such progress in recent years , due largely to applications of the electrio light , that permanent photographs of the scales of a butterfly 's wing revealing the minutest detail of form and ornament can be made with great success .

		The unobserved and hidden beauties of ^ the insect world which have hitherto been reserved for the profes - sional entomologist or amateur microscopist have thus become available for publication without the great expense entailed by expert technical drawings and lithographic reproduc - tion .

		The explorations of tropical lands since the days of Bates and
Wallace	PERSON	have accumu - lated great stores of unique and interesting in - formation about beautiful and curious insects largely unutilized since the compilations of Figuier and
J. G. Wood	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Edward Step	PERSON	, in his `` Marvels of Insect Life '' -LRB-
McBride	ORGANIZATION	,
Nast & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has availed himself of a re - markably large mass of fresh and out-of-the - way material in this field , and has portrayed it with the aid of camera and microscope , and also with the frequent help , especially in his full-page plates , of the constructive artist , who usually adds a few unnatural touches to intensify the entomological drama .

		We can hardly agree with Mr.
Raymond Ditmar	PERSON	's statement in his preface that
Fabre	PERSON	is here `` brought up to date . ''

		The great French popularizer of insect lore captivates his reader by the logical sequence as well as the dramatic interest of his story ; while there is about as much sequence in Mr.
Step	PERSON	's treatise as there is in a vaudeville programme .

		The author has studiously eliminated in his treatment all semblance of logical continuity of subjects or recognition of relationships of his material , with the false idea that chaos is simplicity .

		His sub-title , `` An Account of Structure and Habit , '' is for this reason rather misleading .

		Fortunately , his index makes it possible for an inquiring reader to ascertain what the book really contains .

		Mr.
Step	PERSON	uncritically calls the black gnat the '' pellagra fly , '' apparently unaware that
Sambon	PERSON	's theory of the relation of this insect to that dread disease has been discredited .

		The illustrations are very abun - dant , there being one or more on each page ; and many , the microphotographs especially , are fairly well executed .

		The technique of illumination has not been well achieved in some of the photographs under low magnifica - tions .

		The text is clearly written , and the book is a mine of interesting but somewhat disjointed entomological lore .

		Artless charm marks the candid Piquant passages .

		IT from the life of autobiography or the Japanese a Japanese poet .

		Nogachi > who , like his friend , Mr.
Yoshio Markino	PERSON	, came in tender youth across the
Pacific	LOCATION	to
California	LOCATION	, supported himself by various kinds of drudg - ery until he found his true vocation , pro- ceeded to our eastern coast and thence to
London	LOCATION	, and noted with observant eye the thousand and one things so strange and often amusing also often shocking to his orien - tal scrutiny . ''

Yone Noguchi	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- is illustrated , chiefly in color , by
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 331 Mr.
Markino	PERSON	, and thus unites the grace and idealism and ingenuousness of the reminiscent poet with the delicacy and dreamy beauty of this eminent artist 's brush .

		Both poet and painter are too favorably known to need a reviewer 's commendatory word .

		San Fran - cisco in its radiance and gaiety ,
Joaquin Miller	PERSON	on his '' Heights , ''
Chicago	LOCATION	in its smoke and busy turmoil ,
London	LOCATION	with its fog and beautiful women , and
Japan	LOCATION	after eleven years of absence these are the writer 's main themes , treated with much of the same boyish frankness and pleasing intermixture of native idioms that made Mr.
Markino	PERSON	's story of his similar wanderings so oddly engaging .

		The piquancy of these pages from the life of a Japanese poet-traveller finds no small part of its explanation in the author 's epigrammatic statement that '' the Japanese mind , like any other Japanese thing , only works upside down to that of Englishmen . ''

		Admirable is his enthusiasm for the Poet of the
Sierras	LOCATION	, next door to whom on the mountain-side he made his home in reverent discipleship for four happy though impecunious years .

		In fact , all that is poetic in suggestion stirs Mr.
Noguchi	PERSON	and gives eloquence to his pen , whereas the prosaic materialism of the
Chicago	LOCATION	viewed by him in a brief visit elicits expressions of not unnatural loathing . ''

		I think the god of the Chicagoans is a devil , '' he frankly declares .

		Like his friend and compatriot already named , he attains some of his highest flights in praise of occidental female beauty .

		Throughout his narrative he shows himself fair-minded , as scrupulous to censure Japanese defects as to praise foreign excellences .

		It is a book of no narrow outlook , and it is entertainingly writ - ten .

		Interspersed bits of the writer 's verse go well with his not unpoetic prose .


Germany	LOCATION	's economic In hls ^ ks On '' The Theory of the Leisure Class '' and '' The Instinct of Workmanship , '' pub - lished in recent years , Mr.
Thorstein Yeblen	PERSON	offered an acute and illuminating analysis of certain highly important modern sociological and economic conditions throughout the world at large .

		In his latest book , '' Imperial Ger - many and the Industrial Revolution '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , he has achieved equal success in the interpretation of the economic development of a single country .

		This volume , it should be observed , was written more than a year ago .

		Its publication was delayed by the war , but it is in no sense a '' war book . ''

		Furthermore , it has not been Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	's purpose in the volume to write an economic history of Ger - many ; that has been done by various other scholars .

		The object has been to establish a comparison and correlation between the eco - nomic phenomena of
Germany	LOCATION	and of the English-speaking peoples , '' considered as two distinct and somewhat divergent lines of cul - tural development in modern times . ''

		The ground upon which the inquiry runs is chiefly the `` industrial circumstances that have shaped the outcome in either case . ''

		And the intention has been to account for
Germany	LOCATION	's industrial advance and high efficiency by natural causes , '' without drawing on the logic of manifest destiny , Providential nepotism , national genius , and the like . ''

		The author begins his inquiry in the stone age of the Baltic peoples .

		But he adds little to the value of his work by so doing , except in so far as he is enabled to impress the facts of the hybrid character of the German people and the lack of essential difference in race between the Germans , English , Dutch , and the Slavs of
Great Russia	LOCATION	.

		His appraisal of the physical resources and adaptiveness of the German lands is valuable .

		It is , however , the economic development which has taken place under the regulating hand of the Hohenzollern dynasty , and especially since the
second quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	, that , deservedly , absorbs the author 's attention chiefly .

		It is demon - strated that
Germany	LOCATION	did not develop the technical arts as a native growth , but bor - rowed them , largely from
England	LOCATION	, and that she thereby escaped many of the unfortunate conditions which in the latter country at - tended the earlier stages of the Industrial Revolution .

		Her people , too , did not develop that individual initiative and habit of self - help which in
England	LOCATION	promoted the growth of political democracy and the decline of `` authority , '' a fact of the greatest impor - tance because it meant that there were pre - served those earlier habits of mind which were suited to the maintenance of centralized , coer - cive , irresponsible , dynastic control .

		The eco - nomic policy of the
Imperial State	ORGANIZATION	since
1871	DATE	is described fully and cleverly .

		That , in de - fault of the close and continuous regulation which the
State	ORGANIZATION	has imposed , the course of German industry and trade would have been as different from the historical one as Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	imagines , the reader may not agree .

		But the fact of regulation remains , and the inner character and significance of it has never been described more effectively than in the present volume .

		In a pregnant v chapter entitled '' The Net Gain '' the author makes an interesting appraisal of German `` Kultur . ''

		The conclusion at which he arrives is that the principal characteristic of this culture is its retarded adherence to certain mediaeval or sub-mediaeval habits of thought , the equiva - 332 THE DIAL
Oct. 14	DATE	lents of which belong farther back than the historic present in the experience of other western peoples , notably the English and French .

		The cultural scheme , in short , is out of date , and out of touch with itself in that it is in part archaic and in part quite new .

		On this account the main body of it can not be transfused abroad ; indeed , it can not per - manently be held fast in statu quo within the confines of the Fatherland .

Princeton University	ORGANIZATION	, and dealt with the gen - eral topic of human heredity .

		They are now published under the title , '' Heredity and Environment in the Development of Men '' -LRB-
Princeton University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Though many books have been issued in this field in the past five years , none has attained so successfully the vitally important features of simplicity , clarity , and progressive development of the subject , and a sympathetic correlation of the teachings of biology with ideals of human freedom and with the basis of personal and social ethics .

		The lectures were prepared for a general audience , and the subject has been made both plain and interesting without sacri - fice of scientific soundness or logical complete - ness .

		The subject is consistently developed to its final applications to human problems of gravest import .

		The book deals with the de - velopment of the animal body from the germ cells to the functioning body , and of the mind from the lowest tropisms to will and con - sciousness .

		It discusses the germ cells and the mechanism of heredity and of develop - ment , the significance of the individual , the laws of inheritance , especially of human traits , the influence of environment and of func - tional activity upon development and evolu - tion .

		The control of human evolution by the application of our growing knowledge of hu - man strength and weakness and its behavior in inheritance is sanely discussed , with a frank and forceful statement of the possibilities and limitations of eugenic measures .

		Most sug - gestive and stimulating is the lucid discus - sion of genetics and ethics , determinism and responsibility , and the relations between the individual and the race .

		Simple diagrams elucidate the objective phases of the subject , and there are an adequate glossary , a bibliog - raphy , and an index .

		The book is an authori - tative , scholarly , complete , and very up-to-date presentation of current biological fact and conclusions , applied with breadth of view to the fundamental problems of human life .

		The arduous life of a reformer .

		Descended from the Shaws of Rothiemurchus on her father 's side , and inheriting , apparently , many of the qualities of her maternal grand - mother , also a Scotch woman and a person of dauntless courage and of ideas in advance of her time , Dr.
Anna Howard Shaw	PERSON	has but obeyed the promptings of her nature in de - voting her life to the service of one worthy cause after another , until now she is classed by general consent with such noted reform - ers of her own sex as
Susan B. Anthony	PERSON	, Mrs.
Livermore	PERSON	, Mrs.
Stanton	PERSON	, and
Miss Willard	LOCATION	.

		A vivid and stirring account of her reform labors , and of her earlier life before the pas - sion for reform had seized her , comes from her own pen in '' The Story of a Pioneer '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , wherein her English birth and in - fant memories , her nearly fatal voyage to this country in
1851	DATE	, the well-nigh incredible hardships endured by her family on the
Michigan	LOCATION	frontier , and all the obstacles she herself had to surmount in attaining her present position , are set forth with the magic touch found only in a true narration of things well worth narrating .

		Let a single passage from the
Michigan	LOCATION	epoch indicate the char - acter of the long struggle that furnishes the substance of the book .

		`` During our first winter we lived largely on corn-meal , making a little journey of twenty miles to buy it ; but even at that we were better off than our neighbors , for I remember one family in our region who for an entire winter lived solely on coarse-grained yellow turnips , gratefully changing their diet to leeks when these came in the
spring	DATE	. ''

		Dr.
Shaw	PERSON	's public life is so well known that it need not be outlined here ; her earlier experiences in the forbidding enterprise of educating herself for that life in the face of family opposition and an utter lack of material resources are less familiar , and will be read with keen interest .

		School - teaching , the ministry , medical study and some occasional practice , and various reforms have successively or all together engaged her attention and her energies .

		In her character of President of the
National American Woman Suffrage Association	ORGANIZATION	she has the following to say on a subject of some present importance : '' There has never been any sympathy among American suffragists for the militant suffrage movement in
England	LOCATION	, and personally I am wholly opposed to it .

		I do not believe in war in any form ; and if violence on the part of men is undesirable in achieving their ends , it is much more so on the part of women ; for women never appear to less advantage than in physical combats with men . ''

		Of interest is her assertion that
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 333 `` Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	, at first opposed to woman suffrage , became a convert to it during the last years of his life a fact his son and daughter omit to mention in his biography . ''

		The book 's numerous illustrations have an attractive quality comparable with that of the reading matter .

		A Scandinavian Tt was exceptionally appropriate historical that the American-Scandinavian Foundation should include in its interesting series of '' Scandinavian Clas - sics '' a translation of that powerfully vivid dramatization of the career of one of Swe - den 's great historical characters ,
Strind	PERSON	- berg 's `` Master Olof . ''

		The hero of this drama was the Luther of his people , the relig - ious innovator who overturned the rule of
Rome	LOCATION	in the realm and reign of
Gustavus Vasa	PERSON	, and who was himself destroyed by his sometime protector , the
King	PERSON	, when he be - came involved with a group of Anabaptists holding social democracy as a prominent arti - cle of their creed .

		In
Strindberg	LOCATION	's presenta - tion of his hero , Olof becomes the prototype of all idealistic reformers , uncompromising at moments as
Ibsen 's Brand	ORGANIZATION	, but more living than he because more subtly studied in his moods of weakness as well as in his exalta - tions of strength .

		He was , the poet admits , a kind of shadow of his own rebellious self at twenty-three , '' ambitious and weak-willed ; unscrupulous when something was at stake , and yielding at other times ; possessed of great self-confidence , mixed with a deep mel - ancholy ; balanced and irrational ; hard and gentle . ''

		The pessimism that colors most of
Strindberg	LOCATION	's later work is here already strongly marked , but it is a pessimism by no means entire , since it is rooted in a thor - oughly scientific and impersonal idealism .

		There is no end to the struggle for human progress , Olof 's creator makes him say , although in the fight individuals who for - ward the victory must seem to fail and per - ish before they have done more than hold up the torch an instant to light their stumbling fellows on the way .

		Bodies politic and their government .

		A book reminiscent of Sir
John Seeley	PERSON	's '' Introduction to
Polit	PERSON	- ical Science , '' but with vastly more of fact and less of philosophy , is Mr.
B. S. Hammond	PERSON	's `` Bodies Politic and Their Governments '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , which supple - ments an earlier volume on the outlines of comparative politics .

		The note struck is classification : the classification of communi - ties or welded groups of communities as dif - ferentiated from states , the author contending that the
State	ORGANIZATION	is a legal and almost abstract conception , while the body politic whether we conceive of it as all the living members of a German tribe , or all the living inhabitants of the
British Empire	ORGANIZATION	lends itself to con - crete presentation in its capacity for acting as if it were a single person .

		Having chosen this basis , the writer can not deal directly with the evolution of forms of government , but gives a succession of historical and politi - cal sketches of the various nations at different periods .

		The necessary result is a sacrifice of smoothness of progression for vividness .

		His classification includes tribes , simple communi - ties , simple urban bodies politic -LRB- `` city states '' -RRB- , composite urban bodies politic , uni - tary nations , and heterogeneous empires , and is conveniently set forth in diagram at the close of his discussion of each epoch of his - tory .

		The historical sketches are accurate , and founded largely on original sources ; but much detail could have been omitted without damaging the pictures of the structure of the bodies politic .

		The author 's analyses of gov - ernments will not always pass without ques - tion , and there are especially to be noted some rather fantastic parallels , as in the compari - son of Tammany to the Parte Guelf a of Flor - ence .

		But this was inevitable in a field where speculation had to seek general analogies , and simply demonstrates what Mr.
Hammond	PERSON	would certainly admit that the laws of political phenomena are not sufficiently well established to serve as the basis for a genu - inely scientific classification of bodies politic .

		The work shows vigorous original thought , and is a useful coup d'oeil of the field of government .

		A scientist in
British East Africa	LOCATION	.

		With the best of good-will , we can see little of importance in Dr.
Felix Oswald	PERSON	's `` Alone in the Sleeping-Sickness Country '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		It is the narrative of a trip into
British East Africa	LOCATION	for the purpose of collecting fossil bones from Miocene deposits near
Karungu	LOCATION	, on the east side of
Lake Victoria Nyanza	LOCATION	.

		The collector was but two months in his field .

		The results of his expedition may have had importance for palaeontology , but are pre - sented elsewhere .

		While he was industrious and devoted to his task , there was nothing of adventure or of special interest in his expe - rience .

		He came into contact with two tribes of natives the Kavirondo , of whom * he saw considerable ; and the
Kisii	LOCATION	, of whom he saw little .

		He gives scant information regarding them , and some of what he gives is of doubt - ful quality .

		From the title of his book , we might expect him to present some information 334 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 14	DATE	about sleeping-sickness ; but we have merely incidental references to the subject .

		There is some geological matter in the book , but even this is uninteresting and scrappy .

		In other words , the book is a mere narrative , and as narrative it lacks the elements desirable in - cident , adventure , novelty .

		There are some good illustrations , chiefly of landscape and physical features , and an apparently good map .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		A recent addition to the '' Home University Library '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- is `` The Negro '' by Dr.
W. E. B. Du Bois	PERSON	.

		The greater part of the volume is devoted to the history and culture of the negro in
Africa	LOCATION	; the final chapters deal with the negro in
America	LOCATION	and the problems of the negro .

		As con - trasted with Mr.
Booker T. Washington	PERSON	, Dr.
Du Bois	PERSON	demands a radical programme ; but his learn - ing , his scrutiny of the past , the present , and the future from the colored man 's standpoint , and his exposure of the exploitation of negroes by the white races throughout the world in our day , make the volume informing and timely .

		Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	's '' Modern American Library Economy as Illustrated by the
Newark	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, Free Public Library '' has advanced to Part XVII .

		of Vol .

		II. , which treats of '' Maps , Atlases and Geographical Publications , '' and is a '' revi - sion and enlargement of the second part of the Business Branch pamphlet published in
1910	DATE	. ''

		Miss
Sarah B. Ball	PERSON	, who has charge of the Busi - ness Branch , is the compiler .

		Directions are given for the care of the class of material indi - cated in the title , and lists of the more important maps and atlases suitable for library use are added .

		Drawings and facsimiles help to make the whole subject plain to the reader .

		No other treatise , so far as we know , handles - the matter so fully and with such care and expert knowledge .

		Mr.
Porter E. Sargent	PERSON	has projected a new series of handbooks relating to education and travel , to be known as the '' Sargent Handbook Series , '' for which he is responsible both as editor and publisher .

		The first volume , `` A Handbook of the Best Private Schools of the
United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	, '' has been prepared chiefly for the guidance of the parent who wishes a discrimi - nating manual on the best schools of the country , the principle of selection being merit alone .

		There are chapters giving a general survey of the private school situation ; while histories and criticisms of the schools are included .

		In the Introduction to the volume the editor tells how the work of com - pilation suffered , while in progress , due to delays and the reluctance of principals to give the infor - mation required , and he promises improvements in the next annual issue , which will appear in the
spring	DATE	.

		So practicable and serviceable is this initial venture that it is probable no one will feel the dissatisfaction in question so keenly as does the editor himself .

		NOTES . ''

		The Elements of Style , '' an introduction to literary criticism , by Mr.

American Press	ORGANIZATION	at the British Headquarters in
France	LOCATION	, who recently published an account of his visit to the

		Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	is soon to publish through Messrs.

		Some of the chapters have already appeared in '' Scribner 's Magazine . ''

		A book from the trenches entitled '' The Red Horizon , '' by Mr.
Patrick Macgill	PERSON	, author of '' Children of the Dead End , '' is nearly ready for publication .

		Having related in '' The Amateur Army '' his experiences as a soldier in the making , Mr.
Macgill	PERSON	now describes some of his impressions at the front .

		One of the most interesting books of the season will doubtless be Mr.
William Dean Howells	PERSON	's autobiographical volume , '' Years of My Youth , '' which tells the story of his childhood and early manhood up to the time of his welcome into the circle of '' The Atlantic Magazine '' and his going abroad as
United States Consul	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	plan to publish the volume this month .

		Mr.
Walter Lippman	PERSON	, author of '' Drift and Mastery '' and `` A Prelude to Politics , '' has ar - ranged with Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	for the publication of his next book , '' The Stakes of Diplomacy . ''

		The volume attempts to picture the conditions under which diplomacy is carried on , the central prob - lem with which it deals , and the general policy which a firm and peaceful organization of the world requires .

		Under the title , '' The Nearing Case , '' Dr. Light - ner
Witmer	PERSON	, head of the
Department of Psy	ORGANIZATION	- chology of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, has prepared a complete statement of the events that led up to Doctor Nearing 's dismissal and the facts in all their ramifications .

		The new life of Wordsworth by Professor
G. McLean Harper	PERSON	, of
Princeton University	ORGANIZATION	, which will be ready next month , deals with aspects of the poet 's life little touched upon by his biog - raphers , especially in regard to his earlier years .

		Much unprinted material was placed at the author 's disposal for the purpose by Mr.
Gordon Wordsworth	PERSON	, the poet 's grandson , who also al - lowed him to examine the manuscripts of
Dorothy Wordsworth	PERSON	's Journals .

		Some unpublished letters of
Wordsworth	PERSON	, now in the British Museum and Dr.

		Professor

Sanatogen	PERSON	, and as it feeds and rebuilds the impoverished nervecells , you FEEL the old-time vitality re - turn , with a new vigor of mind and a new elasticity of body Would n'tyou be grateful ?

		385 THE PUGNACIOUS STYLE .

		It is the nature of man to love a good hater ; at any rate , a considerable part of mankind pays him the tribute of admiration for the vigor and constancy of his animosity .

		In like manner the reading world enjoys the aggres - sive energy and the keen stabs , or sledge - hammer blows , of him who writes with the intent of annihilating a foe or exploding a false doctrine ; and this in spite of the fact that little of worth in the cause of truth and justice has ever been effected by passionate vehemence of style , no wrong-headed person has ever been bullied into reasonableness , and no enemy has ever been crushed by mere force of vituperation .

		As is illustrated every week and every day in the heated discussions that in these fevered times claim so much space in our newspapers and magazines , and even in our books , the controversialist falls easily into the error of hurting his cause by undue warmth of manner , and repels by intemper - ance of speech where he might win by modera - tion and restraint .

		If it be true , as experience inclines one to believe , that nobody was ever convinced by argument who was not already more than half persuaded , it is doubly true that no prejudiced person was ever induced by vituperation to renounce his prejudice and alter his opinions .

		Intellectual independence is dear to every one of us , and the faintest suspicion that an author is assailing that independence is enough to erect a barrier against the cogency of his reasoning .

		But if the controversialist can so state his case as to seem to leave his readers entire freedom of choice between acceptance and rejection of his views , he stands a good chance of making converts ; and if , employing a somewhat subtler art , he can cause the reader to imagine himself a little more acute or a little more logical than the author , and can tickle him with the illusion of seeing important points that had escaped the other 's duller per - ceptions -LRB- though it was just these points that the writer had adopted this artful means of making manifest -RRB- , then the case is won , and the pleader is willing enough to renounce the glory of victory for its more substantial fruits .

		354 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 28	DATE	But the partisan pamphleteer of these fiery times is prone to begin his polemic by antago - nizing the very persons he wishes to conciliate , and so his purpose is often defeated before he has fairly begun his argument .

		He commonly writes in a lively and spicy and highly read - able style , and is therefore followed with im - mense satisfaction by those who are already on his side , or who are not positively opposed to him .

		The pugnacious style in itself , such is erring human nature , appeals to most read - ers w r hen it does not chance to be directed too pointedly and personally against them ; it keeps them awake , pleases them with a sense of taking part in laying low an army of stupid or malicious adversaries who needed only this unanswerable demonstration of the matter to induce them to confess the futility of further opposition ; and it is delightful to serve the cause of truth and righteousness in this easy fashion , when all that is just and virtuous and noble is so manifestly on our side , and all that is false and wicked and perverse and abomin - able so evidently on the other .

		The immense vogue enjoyed by such con - tributions to so-called popular science as Pro- fessor
Haeckel	PERSON	's widely-read solution of '' The Riddle of the Universe '' is no doubt largely due to the confidently aggressive air with which he exposes the folly of all those philoso - phers who pretend to see in the scheme of created things some element other than mat - ter and mechanism .

		How vastly superior one feels to
Plato	ORGANIZATION	and
Emerson	PERSON	and the whole tribe of mystics and dreamers when one has taken a hand with the Jena professor in their demoli - tion and has arrived at the point where one can say with this sturdy foe to every form of transcendental nonsense , '' The supreme and all-pervading law of nature , the true and only cosmological law , is , in my opinion , the law of substance , '' and can regard with him the be - lief in the soul 's immortality as the `` highest point of superstition . ''

		But what if one hap - pens to be a Platonist and a dreamer to begin with ?

		Will the controversial tone of `` The Riddle of the Universe '' work a change of heart and win a new convert to the Haeckelian doctrine ?

		Hardly .

		A long-recognized master of the pugna - ciously vituperative style , and one whom it is an unending delight to read , even though the reader be wise enough not to yield entire assent to what affords him this intellectual refreshment , is found in the author of that history of
England	LOCATION	which in the middle of the last century rivalled in popularity the novels of
Dickens	LOCATION	and
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		It has been said of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's style that it is admirable for almost every purpose but telling the truth .

		Certainly it is an admirable style to adopt when one wishes not to spoil a good story in the telling .

		With what an array of rhetorical weapons
Macaulay	PERSON	has assailed the luckless monarch who was the last of the Stuarts to sit on the throne of
England	LOCATION	, all the world knows .

		His merciless handling of that king 's infamous tool , the bloodthirsty chief justice whose name has become synonymous with judicial severity , is almost as notorious .

		Jeffreys , as we are now warranted in believing , was not absolutely devoid of humanity , though a reading of Macaulay or of
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	would incline a credulous person to regard him as a veritable monster of malice and cruelty .

		Mr.
H. B. Irving	PERSON	, not many years ago , showed us the man as a human being .

		When
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, trusting to authorities that have since his time become more or less discredited , speaks of
Jeffreys	PERSON	as `` constitutionally prone to igno - rance and to the angry passions , '' he is but just beginning the list of the chief justice 's evil qualities .

		In his early practice at the bar of the Old
Bailey	PERSON	, '' daily conflicts with prosti - tutes and thieves called out and exercised his powers so effectually that he became the most consummate bully ever known in his profes - sion .

		All tenderness for the feelings of others , all self-respect , all sense of the becoming were obliterated from his mind ... The profusion of maledictions and vituperative epithets which composed his vocabulary could hardly have been rivalled in the fish-market or the bear-garden ... There was a fiendish exulta - tion in the way in which he pronounced sentence on offenders .

		Their weeping and im - ploring seemed to titillate him voluptuously ; and he loved to scare them into fits by dilating with luxuriant amplification on all the details of what they were to suffer . ''

		This lavishing of the historian 's wealth of rhetoric upon one who was doubtless equally liberal in airing his vocabulary in the courts of law does not , to say the least , make for somnolence in the reader .

		As the popular opinion of `` Bloody Jeffreys '' was already far from complimen - tary when
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's work appeared , this valiant thwacking of the odious wretch gave untold satisfaction to thousands of readers .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL ; brar 355 For vituperative energy , combined with all | the resources of erudition and reinforced by i the weight of a commanding personality , there is little in our literature to compare with
Milton	PERSON	's famous reply , in his '' Defense of the !

		People of
England	LOCATION	, '' to Salmasius , the noted !

		Leyden professor whose espousal of the cause of
Charles I.	PERSON	had stirred the wrath of the ; Latin Secretary to the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	.

		When
Milton	PERSON	says of his adversary 's work , '' I per - suaded myself , the extemporary rhymes of some antic jack-pudding may better deserve printing , '' he is at his mildest ; and even when he calls Salmasius '' a vain and flashy man , '' and addresses him as '' thou superlative fool , '' he does not attain the pitch of abuse to which he subsequently lashes himself .

		But in his very first paragraph he is sufficiently heated to write such sentences as this : '' I would advise you not to have so good an opinion of your - self -LRB- for nobody else has of you -RRB- as to imagine that you are able to speak well upon any sub - ject , who can neither play the part of an orator , nor an historian , nor express yourself in a style that would not be ridiculous even in a lawyer ; but like a mountebank 's juggler , with big swelling words in your preface , you raised our expectations , as if some mighty mat - ter were to ensue ; in which your design was not so much to introduce a true narrative of the king 's story , as to make your own empty intended flourishes go off the better . ''

		And a little further on he adds : '' I will tell you what the matter is with you .

		In the first place , you find yourself affrighted and aston - ished at your own monstrous lies ; and then you find that empty head of yours not encom - passed , but carried round , with so many trifles and fooleries , that you not only now do not , but never did , know what was fit to be spoken , and in what method . ''

		This vigorous polemic was written , it is true , in
Latin	LOCATION	, in which it presents an appearance of perhaps greater seemliness and dignity than in the vernacular rendering ; but it illustrates a style no longer in vogue in our controversial literature , though whether it has given place to anything more worthy of admiration may be open to dispute .

		An eminent living writer has declared that no one should expect to accomplish anything in literature until he has first ruined his diges - tion .

		How much of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's fame he owes to his dyspepsia , one can not accurately deter - mine ; but his works contain an excess of invective that probably would have had no place there if he had been a eupeptic person .

		In all this amazingly fluent and varied and picturesque tirade , however , there , is a quality of artistic detachment , of humorous gusto even , without which these atrabilious outpour - ings would be offensive , or merely wearisome , instead of entertaining and stimulating .

		In his `` Latter-Day Pamphlets , '' with what wealth of disparaging language the doughty pam - phleteer exposes the ineptitude of Downing Street !

		If he had been born on the west in - stead of the east side of
St. Patrick	ORGANIZATION	's Channel he could scarcely have been more uncom - promisingly '' agin the government '' as may appear from a few random sentences .

		Con - cerning the solemn mummeries of the '' strange Entities '' in Downing Street he says , with characteristic opulence of imagery : `` How the tailors clip and sew , in that sublime sweat - ing establishment of theirs , we know not : that the coat they bring us out is the sorrowfulest fantastic mockery of a coat , a mere intricate artistic network of traditions and formalities , an embroiled reticulation made of web-listings and superannuated thrums and tatters , endur - able to no grown Nation as a coat , is mourn - fully clear ! ''

		The one invariable attribute of those who are set in high places to govern those beneath them , is stupidity .

		`` For em - pires or for individuals there is but one class of men to be trembled at ; and that is the Stupid Class , the class that can not see , who alas are they mainly that will not see .

		A class of mortals under which as administrators , kings , priests , diplomatists , etc. , the interests of mankind in every European country have sunk overloaded , as under universal night - mare , near to extinction ; and are indeed at this moment convulsively writhing , decided either to throw off the unblessed super-incum - bent nightmare , or roll themselves and it to the Abyss . ''

		Among more recent masters of the pugna - cious style , one of the most enjoyable to read , and one in whom an irresistible drollery of humor never fails to mask any possible sub - stratum of malevolence , is the author of that spirited defence of
Harriet Shelley	PERSON	, which was evoked by
Dowden	PERSON	's admired biography of this unhappy lady 's poet-husband .


Mark Twain	PERSON	, when moved to anger by any exhibition of arrogance or inhumanity , was capable of show - ing himself an antagonist whose pen was to be feared .

		356 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 28	DATE	Our brilliant and ever-entertaining contem - poraries , Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	and Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	, naturally come to mind in this connection as notable exponents of the literary style here under consideration .

		Perhaps the dominant note of these two , especially of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, might be indicated by the misquotation from Pope , `` Whatever is , is wrong . ''

		The world is all at fault and needs to be scolded and ridiculed and paradoxed into right con - duct .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's recent vigorous on - slaught on the Prussians leaves no doubt as to his mastery of incisiveness .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's infinity of resource when the perversities and asininities of his fellow-men require castiga - tion at his hands is too well known to call for comment or illustration .

		Although little of lasting value is ever accomplished by unbridled vehemence of in - vective , yet it may be assumed as certain that not until human nature shall cease to be what it now is , and not until the occurrence of a dog-fight in the street shall fail to draw an eager crowd of spectators , will the pugnacious style , as employed by a master of sarcastic vituperation , cease to be accounted an agree - able stimulus to the jaded senses , provided only one be not the conscious object against which this battery of abuse is directed .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	, .

		FRENCH LITERATURE AND THE WAR .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		One of the curious consequences of the war has been the suspension , in
France	LOCATION	at least , of the publication of many books which were on the point of appearing when the cloud burst .

		Let me give a few examples of this which have come under my personal observa - tion , as they throw a side light , which has many odd reflections , on this terrible conflict .

		M.
Jean G. Prod	PERSON	` homme , who is one of the best authorities in
France	LOCATION	on everything con - nected with music and musicians , has been engaged for several years in bringing out in French , through Delagrave of
Paris	LOCATION	, the com - plete prose works of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	, based on the German edition prepared by the com - poser himself between
1870	DATE	and
1883	DATE	.

		M. Prod ` homme 's translation was to consist of twelve volumes .

		`` I had corrected the final proofs of the tenth volume , when the war broke out , '' M. Prod ` homme said to me the other day when I met him in uniform at present everybody in
France	LOCATION	is a soldier .

		`` My publisher 's printer is established at
Lille	LOCATION	, which has been in the hands of the Ger - mans from the earliest days of the hostilities , and I often wonder what they have done with our plates .

		It would be a strange commen - tary on German culture if hatred of things French should cause the destruction of the only French translation of their great master ! ''

		The same publisher was engaged on a work in two volumes devoted to English and Amer - ican literature -LRB- '' Anthologie de la Litterature Anglaise '' -RRB- , whose author ,
M. Andre Koszul	PERSON	, is one of the most promising of the younger professors of the English department of the Sorbonne , but who , at the first sound of the guns , threw aside his university gown and donned the uniform of a second lieutenant , only to become a few days later a prisoner in
Germany	LOCATION	, where he is still in confinement .

		As though having an intuition of what was to happen , the dedication of the first volume of his work , published a few months before the war , was in these words , in English : '' To one by my side , who , with her two little chil - dren , has now deserted the cozy
Paris	LOCATION	home because it is so lonely without him . ''

		The second volume of
M. Koszul	PERSON	's work , which is to bring the review from the eight - eenth century down to the present day and which is all in type , contains sixty pages devoted to American literature , with extracts from the works of our principal authors , be - ginning with
Franklin	PERSON	, then skipping to Irving and
Cooper	PERSON	, and finally coming down to
Mark Twain	PERSON	and Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	.

		One of the last communications I had from this brilliant young scholar -LRB- who , if he wards off the diseases of the prison camp , will perhaps some day be a worthy successor of Legouis -RRB- before he started for the front , was a copy of his brief introduction to the American sec - tion of this second volume .

		A few extracts in translation , here made public for the first time , will be interesting perhaps : '' When one thinks of the formidable growth of the
United States	LOCATION	, one may say perhaps that soon the English written , read , and most widely spoken will be the English not of
England	LOCATION	but of Amer - ica ... Thus the literature of the English language is becoming less and less strictly the literature of
England	LOCATION	.

		More and more numerous are the writ - ers in English outside of
England	LOCATION	and who some - times even have foreign blood in their veins ... For the moment , it seems that , after having fol - lowed a distinct line of its own , American litera - ture is now much more disposed to fraternize with that of
England	LOCATION	, and vice versa ... The most notable literary movement in the rather confused ensemble is that which accompanied the grand philosophic and religious enfranchisement called
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 357 rather pompously Transcendentalism , to which is attached the noble effort of
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		-LSB- At the beginning of his career ,
M. Koszul	PERSON	made a long and thorough study of the
Concord School	ORGANIZATION	. -RSB-

		... Thanks to money , the universities , the libraries , and the special reviews of the
United States	LOCATION	are becoming the first in the world ...
America	LOCATION	al - ready offers some creations which force themselves on the attention of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		In very different ways ,
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	and Whitman in Ger - many exercise perhaps not less influence than does
Edgar Poe	PERSON	in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		What this
Poe	PERSON	influence in
France	LOCATION	is most of us know ; but we were to have been re - minded of it again , and in a most magisterial fashion , long ere this if the war had not checked , for the moment at least , the demon - stration .

		M.
Andre Fontainas	PERSON	, the
Franco	PERSON	- Belgian writer and poet , actually had in type when mobilization began his '' La Vie d'Edgar Poe '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Mercure de
France	LOCATION	-RRB- , which will now see the light only when peace comes and which promises to be the most important book yet published in
France	LOCATION	concerning
Poe	PERSON	.

		M. Fontainas can speak with considerable au - thority , being an author of established repu - tation , associated with the early symbolists , whose name has appeared on the title-page of seven volumes of poetry , three novels , and a half-dozen other works devoted to art , biog - raphy , the theatre , etc. .

		He is , furthermore , well acquainted with the English language and literature , and has translated into French parts of De Quincey ,
Keats	PERSON	, and
Meredith	PERSON	.

		Referring to his forthcoming book , `` while stricken to the heart 's core by the ineffable woes of my misused native land , '' he writes to me as follows : '' I have based my statements on more reliable and completer documents than those possessed by Baudelaire or
Stephane Mallarme	PERSON	, to whose memo - ries I dedicate my volume .

		I have tried to be very impartial , notwithstanding my profound admira - tion for the grand American poet whose glory is more wide-spread in some European countries than in his native land .

		I am quite ready to recognize the weaknesses and faults of
Edgar Poe	PERSON	on many unfortunate occasions ; but the conclusions which I draw therefrom are not marked by the severity , bias , I am almost led to say , of Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	. ''

		M. Fontainas concludes that
Poe	PERSON	was not an habitual drunkard , or an alcoholist , or a dipsomaniac ; and , taking into consideration all the surrounding circumstances , he con - siders him to have revealed a '' really heroic nobility of character . ''

		Nor does M.
Fon	ORGANIZATION	- tainas accept Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	's version of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's ignominious death ; and to the accusa - tion that the poet 's compositions were con - ceived '' in the fumes of drunkenness and the hallucinations of opium , '' M. Fontainas op - poses the statement that `` we have here a work of the purest kind of thought to be found in imaginative writing , where severe logic often plays a more important part than invention or caprice . ''

		Giving free rein to a resentment common in many literary circles in
Europe	LOCATION	against a certain puritanical estimate of Poe too often prevalent in our country ,
M. Fontainas	LOCATION	in - dulges in this criticism : `` Americans have not yet the intuition of what makes , in the opinion of certain English and French poets , artists and critics , the grandeur of their poet .

		They are too much wrapped up in positive and practical things not to be discon - certed by the singularity of an
Edgar Poe	PERSON	or a Walt Whitman .

		They are shocked by the absence of utility in his work , by the lack of that didac - tism which he so vehemently attacked .

		They are not open to what
Stedman	PERSON	already praised in him , ' the absolute love of beauty / and are inclined to see in him only , as
Emerson	LOCATION	put it , ' the jingle - man . '

		They are all the more ready to accept the existence of his vices because these seem to be the cause of what disconcerts them in his work . ''

		The progress of Mme.
Marcelle Tinayre	PERSON	's next novel , `` La Route Secrete '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Calmann Levy -RRB- , was also checked by the war .

		She was in
Paris	LOCATION	at the moment of the mobilization , and of course was carried off her feet , as were even many of us foreigners , by the magnificent manner in which the superb youth of
France	LOCATION	swept through the capital to the threatened front .

		What she then saw and felt , she has described in , `` Le Depart '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Calmann Levy -RRB- .

		But she is now at
Toulon	LOCATION	, in her retreat by the sea , deep in her story again , which , however , is to be given a turn not contemplated at first , as it will reflect the all-absorbing crisis through which
Europe	LOCATION	is passing , and which has struck down into this mother 's heart in a peculiar way , for her seventeen-year-old boy , `` a sculptor in embryo , '' catching the univer - sal fever , is clamoring '' to go too . ''

		And it is this same calamity which contra - dicts the rumor that has appeared in several English and American literary journals that
M. Edmond Rostand	PERSON	is engaged on a new volume of poems . ''

		This is not the moment to try to court the Muses , at least for a Frenchman .

		Even war songs should not be inspired now . ''

		Even such a staid writer as
M. Salomon Reinach	PERSON	is affected in the same way .

		The editor of the `` Loeb Classical Library , '' Dr.
T. E. Page	PERSON	, asked me , if I chanced to see
M. Reinach	PERSON	-LRB- who , it will be remembered , gave Mr.
Loeb	PERSON	the idea of founding this noble col - lection -RRB- , to inquire when they might expect to have the manuscript of the promised `` Lucan . ''

		M. Reinach 's excuse for the delay 358 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 28	DATE	was much like the remark of
M. Rostand	PERSON	, `` the war has prevented my getting 1 started . ''

		Another minor preventive , but of quite an - other sort , also due to the war , will interest American readers , as it is a fresh and rather striking example of the attention which
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope pays to our position in regard to this conflict .


M. Reinach	PERSON	, in the midst of his many other tasks , finds time to prepare a series of little unbound volumes , '' Voix Americaines '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Berger-Levrault , 60 centimes each -RRB- , made up of translations and analyses of the best contributions from American pens about the war appearing in our periodicals and newspapers .

		Two of these excellent brochures have been issued , and a third is in press .

		Nor has the war hampered '' The Loeb Library '' only in the matter of a delay in the translation of `` Pharsalia . ''

		Dr. Page writes me : '' When I retired
four years ago	DATE	, I was looking forward to rest and some indepen - dent work , but Mr.
Loeb	PERSON	's enterprise seemed to me so full of generosity and wisdom that I have attended to nothing else , except inci - dentally ; and though at the present time , the work can only be conducted imperfectly , I hope at any rate to see it through these trou - bled times '' ; and then , coming down to the more purely clerical side of the labor , he tells how `` we have lost two secretaries who have enlisted , and have only partial use of a girl typist . ''

		And from
Munich	LOCATION	, where the war found him caring for his health , Mr.
James Loeb	PERSON	writes : '' My own experience proves that in troubled times such as the world is now experiencing , there is no better or more delightful refuge than the Greek and Latin classics afford . ''

		So if the war has checked the output of the presses for the moment , it has sent some of us back to the old books that never grow stale ; and thus we are enabled to escape the censure of Guizot when he says : '' Ceux qui n'ont pas parcouru les etudes grecques et latines ne seront de toute leur vie que des parvenus en fait d'intelligence . ''

		THEODORE
STANTON	PERSON	.


Paris	LOCATION	,
September 30 , 1915	DATE	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		HIGHER LEARNING AS AFFECTED BY THE WAR is the subject of a thoughtful article by Presi - dent Thwing in the latest number of '' The Hibbert Journal . ''

		Some readjustments and changes are inevitably taking place in the educational field , and there will be others in the near future ; but any serious or permanent arrest of the advancement of learning seems not to be feared bv the writer or by those other observers whom he quotes , though there is likely to be a loss of prestige in certain quarters that might be pointed out by a self - confident prophet surveying the university world .

		Certain studies , such as history , di - plomacy , and international law , will probably be stimulated , and it may well be that the study of certain modern languages , with their literature , wnll receive - a fresh impetus , per - haps at the expense of a certain other , or others , in a manner not unconnected with the final issue of the struggle .

		The compilation of opinions presented by Dr.
Thwing	PERSON	is found by him to illustrate '' several great truths , '' and foremost among them the following : '' It illustrates the intimacy of the ties binding nation to nation .

		These ties are not simply diplomatic understandings and political alli - ances .

		They are also great relationships cov - ering every part of the life of man .

		No nation can say to another nation , ' I have no need of thee . '

		The relations are the growth of gen - erations of struggle and of mingled fellow - ship and enmity .

		Any breaking of these ties throws each of these relationships out of its proper place .

		Education among them is thus made to suffer .

		Its place in the sun is thus obscured , its laws are broken , and its work - ings interrupted . ''

		Woeful is the damage to the things of the higher life , as any writer on the f topic chosen by Dr.
Thwing	PERSON	must have been forced to admit : but in the very fact that this damage is discerned and deprecated lies hope for ultimate reparation , so far as reparation is possible . ''

		THE INSECTS ' HOMER , '' as
Henri Fabre	PERSON	has often been called , with ascription of the epithet to
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's poetic invention , has died at the age of nearly ninety-two .


Provence	LOCATION	, the country of Mistral , who discovered him in the obscurity and poverty that were almost his lifelong portion , and who procured for him a modest pension from the government , was the scene of his birth and death and the loving study that he devoted to the bees and spiders and other insects .

		Born of poor and uneducated parents ,
Fabre	PERSON	struggled with poverty from the beginning and was forced to acquire as best he could the excellent edu - cation in natural science that his writings show him to have possessed .

		Teaching , of the least attractive and poorest-paid sort , was the industry to which he turned for support as soon as he could meet its requirements .

		The chair of physics at the college of
Ajaccio	LOCATION	.

		with a salary of not more than eighteen hun - dred francs , and .

		later , a similar position at the Lycee of
Avignon	LOCATION	, were held by him for a while ; but his true vocation was entomologi -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 359 cal study , with occasional ventures into lit - erature as the poetic interpreter of the insects ' habits .

		His `` Souvenirs Entomolo - giques '' embrace the greater part of these reports from the insect world , though shorter studies appeared from time to time in various periodicals .

		In our own language have been issued a number of works under his name , but compiled with some freedom by others from the body of his writings .

		Thus he is known to English readers for his '' Social Life in the Insect `` World , '' `` Bramble-Bees and Others , '' '' The Life and Love of the Insect , '' `` The Life of the Fly , '' `` The Life of the Spider , '' and '' The Mason-Bees . ''

		The poetic and imaginative quality of his writing raises him to a place high above all other author - naturalists .

		HOW TO BE HAPPY THOUGH REJECTED -LRB- not as a lover , but as a writer for the magazines -RRB- may be learned from an engagingly frank edi - torial confession to be found in '' The Unpop - ular Review '' for the current quarter .

		After describing , probably with some exaggeration , his nearly uniform unsuccess for twenty years as a would-be contributor to magazines , and after admitting the worldly unwisdom of so lavish an expenditure of stationery and j stamps , the editor continues : '' But the charm j of literary ambition is in its lack of wisdom .

		One must exercise common-sense in earning the livelihood ; in the quiet of the study , with fair paper and an easy pen , one may lock common-sense out of doors .

		Delightful is it , after a day of compromises , to let one 's own notions have play .

		That conceit , laughed at by nobody , will appeal to the editor , once it is set down with reserve and climax .

		That bit of eloquence , debarred from the casualness of society , will find its way home in print .

		Alas , it too comes back to my drawer of rejections , no longer inspiring . ''

		But '' Writing as a Sport '' is the topic in hand , and so it must be remem - bered that '' if sports had not their pains and hardship , they would not be sports . ''

		The writer even holds that '' there is a richer expe - rience in getting a manuscript back than in winning any other game .

		In no other game may one lose so handsomely . ''

		Writing often serves as a safety-valve , and the failure to appear in print does not much matter .

		`` A man who has confided his dearest theories to an editor and promptly got them back is a better neighbor .

		He is never quite the same man : he is .

		somehow , vastly improved . ''

		Therefore it is urged upon all who have ideas pressing for utterance to `` write them down and send them off for print . ''

		or , more likely , for rejection .

		No malice lurks behind this ad - vice , for , says the writer , '' rejection has stead - ied us and made us more thoughtful .

		It has lessened conceit , improved the temper , made us more kindly to the race , and turned us to the vital work we can do well .

		And that is surely the test of sport . ''

		After this the editor of '' The Unpopular Review '' ought to have no idle hours for lack of manuscripts to reject .

		THE POTENCY OP STYLE , in literature , is such that it can often so dazzle the reader as to make him blind to the lack of thought and invention behind it .

		Naturally no self - respecting person likes to find himself thus imposed upon , and the bare suspicion of fraud , however unfounded , will not seldom excite hostility against the stylist .

		One of Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	's distinguished contempo - raries , himself a writer quite different in manner from the author of `` The Golden .

		Bowl , '' has rather wittily though not with the keenest discernment remarked that Mr.
James	PERSON	reminds him of an intelligent elephant vainly trying to pick up a pea that has rolled into the corner of its cage .

		Is it perhaps some lack of humor in Mr.
James	PERSON	that makes it possible to say such a thing about him ?

		Another stylist , of another nation , a poet and romancer very much in the limelight just now , is the author of the '' Canzone dei Dar - danelli , '' the Italian patriot for whose cap - ture the Austrian government is said to have offered a reward of twenty thousand crowns , the people 's idol at whose feet they prostrate themselves in an ecstasy of adoration un - mixed with any suspicion that those feet may be of clay .

		And yet
Signer d'Annunzio	PERSON	's critics maintain that there is nothing but style to anything he has written .

		Is it pos - sible that the mere trick of words , which this brilliant Italian certainly possesses , can raise one to such heights of popular favor ?

		To the winnowing hand of time it can safely be left to determine what else there is in the product of his pen ; but even now it is clear enough that one who takes himself with such tremen - dous seriousness , and in so dramatic a man - ner , is not exactly rich in the saving grace of humor .

		PHILOLOGICAL FRENZY , together with mania of a less interesting sort , seems to have pos - sessed that asylum inmate who astonished and delighted the late editor of the
Oxford Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	by sending him , first and last , be - tween five thousand and eight thousand quo - tations useful in his great work .

		Dr.
W. C. Minor	PERSON	, the eccentric philologist in question , was -LRB- or perhaps we should say is -RRB- an Amer - ican surgeon who served in his professional 360 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 28	DATE	capacity in our Civil `` War , became a victim to periodic fits of insanity , shot a man , a stranger to him , in one of these fits , but was acquitted on the grounds of insanity , and was confined in the
Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum	ORGANIZATION	, where Dr.
Murray	PERSON	, to his intense surprise , found him .

		In the preface to the
Dictionary Dr. Minor	ORGANIZATION	's services to that work receive due acknowledgment .

		In our own experience , si parva licet componere mag - nis , a certain mad philologist , a frequent sender of unsolicited comments and criticisms upon literary usages of the day , has demon - strated the possibility of retaining a more or less sane interest in scholarly pursuits after sanity in some other respects has departed and confinement in an asylum has been found necessary .

		In fact , this philological bent has a way of manifesting itself in all sorts of unlikely quarters .

		No less a celebrity than the present editor of the above-named diction - ary , Dr.
Henry Bradley	PERSON	-LRB- if he will pardon the mention of his name in this connection -RRB- , began life as clerk in a
Sheffield	LOCATION	hardware house , with the most meagre sort of school education behind him .

		Yet he rose rapidly to eminence in his chosen specialty , edited '' The Academy '' at one time , contributed to that and other leading periodicals , thrice served as President of the Philological So - ciety , was made a Fellow of the British Acad - emy , and achieved many other distinctions in addition to that of being chosen joint editor and then editor-in-chief of the greatest dic - tionary ever attempted -LRB- with success -RRB- of any language .

		If the son of a miller and clerk to a hardware dealer can accomplish these things , who shall say that philological hon - ors are not open to all competitors ?

		STATISTICS CONCERNING THE BOOK-READING HABIT among our own people are communi - cated to '' The Library Journal '' by Mr.
E. W. Mumford	PERSON	of the
Penn Publishing Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		Whereas the head of the
Macmillan Company	ORGANIZATION	has deplored , in the pages of '' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' what he would have us believe to be a decline in the reading of good books and an increasing resort to frivolous amusements , his
Philadelphia	LOCATION	contemporary sees unmistakable signs of exactly contrary tendencies .

		For example , the
February	DATE	number of ''
New York	LOCATION	Libraries '' reported the free library circula - tion of books in
New York City	LOCATION	for the decade ending in
1914	DATE	as nearly twelve millions in excess of that for the preceding decade , and the Central Building alone shows a gain in circulation for one year of more than a mil - lion , with a gain in the use of reference books amounting to nearly half a million .

		In Wis - consin one hundred and thirteen libraries of all sizes show collective gains of about seventy - five per cent in seven years .

		The city of Wash - ington increased its book-circulation by one hundred and
fifty-six per cent	MONEY	in the last decade .

		And so on .

		Certainly there is little ground for absolute despair in the present trend , however wide the gap between what is and what ought to be in such matters .

		A LEXICOGRAPHER 'S LAMENT comes to our attention in the reported utterance of Mr.
F. Sturges Allen	PERSON	, General Editor of the famous dictionary that still bears the name of
Noah Webster	PERSON	, who has been dead seventy - two years .

		`` It 's a strange thing , '' says Mr.
Allen	PERSON	, with that fondness for the good old things of our youth that grows upon us as the years pass , '' how the late generations are get - ting away from the old language , from the old figures of speech .

		The old simplicity , almost poetry , of nature images is going from ordinary conversation .

		Slowly , too , it is going from poetry .

		I do n't believe the world to-day could produce a Spenser . ''

		Of course not .

		Each generation speaks its own tongue , and the present age could no more produce a Spenser than his century could have given birth to a Kipling .

		One may regret , and with good reason , the carelessness , the laxity , one might almost say the irreverence , that are always threatening to make a shapeless wreck of our native language ; but the designs of the wreckers never quite succeed , though they always attain a measure of success .

		A later remark of Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's shows that even he is by no means devoid of hope for the future .

		Asked if he did not detect signs of danger `` that the poetical qualities of the race are being rubbed off by machinery , that the poetical qualities may ultimately be lost , '' he replied with both good sense and a sane op - timism : `` Oh , bosh !

		The poetry of life is life itself . ''

		A QUESTIONABLE ECONOMY has begun to show itself in the administration of public libraries in
England	LOCATION	.

		It is true that with an income tax of a crown in the pound sterling , and likely to go higher , tax-payers must con - tribute with diminished zeal toward the sup - port of the local library , but on the other hand the public library provides the least expensive and most wholesome form of popu - lar entertainment that can anywhere be found , and entertainment the people must have , of some sort , war taxes or no war taxes .

		At the recent meeting of the
Library Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion -LRB- of
England	LOCATION	-RRB- disclosures were made that presaged ill for the immediate future , at
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 361 least , of the public libraries of our British cousins .

		Current fiction is naturally the first to be struck off from the book-purchasing list , and it is feared that the more expensive of serious publications will follow .

		This latter retrenchment would be cause for regret , how - ever willingly one might consent to the other reduction .

		Some more or less disastrous effects from the European war debauch are sure to show themselves in European libra - ries generally , if not also in our own ; for no smallest department of human activity seems wholly exempt .

		THE POETIC SERBIANS are presented in very attractive colors to their English allies by the ex-Minister from
Serbia	LOCATION	to the
Court of St. James	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Chedo Miyatovich	PERSON	.

		He asserts that `` of all Slavonic nations the Serbians can legitimately claim to be the most poetical one .

		Their language is the richest and the most musical among all the Slavonic lan - guages .

		The late Professor
Morfill	PERSON	, a man who was something of a Panslavist , repeat - edly said to me : ' I wish you Serbians , as well as all other Slavonic nations , to join
Russia	LOCATION	in a political union , but I do not wish you to surrender your beautiful and well - developed language to be exchanged for the Russian ! '

		On one occasion he went even so far as to suggest that the future United States of the Slavs should adopt as their literary and official language the Serbian , as by far the finest and most musical of all the Slavonic tongues . ''

		Of somewhat questionable euphony might seem to an outsider a language abound - ing in such harsh geographical names as the present war has made familiar to our eyes , though not yet to our tongues .

		Those inter - ested in the Serbs and their capabilities in lit - erature are referred to Mr.
W. M. Petrovitch	PERSON	's '' Hero Tales and Legends of the Serbians , '' one of the books of the season , from the preface to which the passage above quoted is taken .

		A CONCESSION TO DELINQUENT BOOK-BORROW - ERS might , as a rule , encourage further delin - quency .

		On the other hand , a too rigorous enforcement of the rules relating to fines might drive an impecunious borrower away from the library .

		Let us call attention to what seems to be a wise exercise of discretion on the part of the
Springfield	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- libra - rian , who reports as follows : `` A procedure in the case of children who have had overdue books and failed to pay the fees has been worked out satisfactorily .

		It seemed undesir - able to deprive a child of the use of the library because of his neglect , and yet to remit these fees would discourage children , from paying them and lead to consequent carelessness in returning books on time .

		In occasional W stances children have been allowed to balance the charge by giving an equivalent of work in the library , but in more cases the payment of fines by installments has proved beneficial .

		At least one youngster was heard to announce that he had given up the ' movies ' so that he could save the money to redeem his library card ' '' COMMUNICATIONS .

		A FEW FACTS ABOUT
BRYANT	PERSON	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The warfare between facts and poetry , it has been said , is a conflict as irreconcilable as that between science and theology of which condi - tion there is much evidence to be adduced .

		New items thereof perpetually and uninterruptedly ac - cumulate , and the mass of it is more than moun - tainous it forms a world of itself .

		A very strange world , too or so such an item as that contributed to THE DIAL of
October 14	DATE	by Miss
Harriet Monroe	PERSON	would give us to believe .

		As this contribution is , moreover , in the nature of a reply to one of my own , entitled ``
Bryant	PERSON	and the New Poetry , '' which previously had appeared in your pages , I will perhaps be allowed sufficient of your space , not to '' answer '' it but to point out briefly , in justice to the illustrious name that figures so prominently -LRB- and to me so very strangely -RRB- in its context , some particulars in which it is indeed surprising .

		Doubtless it is a much better , a vastly more de - sirable thing , to be a live '' new '' poet than a dead great one .

		For the living bard or '' bardess , '' as the case may be can not only write '' new '' poetry , but can in addition indulge in the pleasant and poetical pastime of belittling if not actually vilifying , of misrepresenting if not deliberately falsifying , not only the poetry but the probity of the mighty dead .

		And the mighty dead can not perhaps rather luckily for the living little make reply , save as their works , which have lived after them , and the records of their lives -LRB- such as are extant -RRB- , may speak .

		Now I have not the slightest disposition to believe that
Miss Monroe	PERSON	wishes to be other than fair in her critical estimate of
Bryant	PERSON	which we are all of us at liberty to acclaim or to repu - diate as our individual tastes and preferences may prompt .

		She has chosen to belittle him , that being , doubtless , in her opinion no more than his poetical pretensions deserve .

		Whether her '' placing '' of his poetry is correct or not only the reading of that poetry can establish . '

		It , and it alone , can validly speak in its own behalf to those who care to hear .

		But it is quite another matter when we come to the facts of
Bryant	PERSON	's life , to which
Miss Monroe	PERSON	, in her communication above referred to , devotes considerable space , incidentally quoting from an editorial which previously she had contributed to 362 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 28	DATE	her own magazinelet , '' Poetry . ''

		I will reproduce a portion of her remarks , as follows : '' In that editorial I told of a publisher 's statement that
Bryant	PERSON	, toward the end of his long life , used to sell his name , along with his venerable portrait , as the author of books which he neither wrote nor edited , such as `
Bryant	PERSON	's History of the
United States	ORGANIZATION	' and '
Bryant	PERSON	's Collection of Poetry and Song , ' to such an extent that he was known among
New York	LOCATION	publish - ers as ' the great national tone-imparter . '

		... '' This story always comes back to me when I make the detour from Fifth Avenue to see the beautiful rear facade of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here a throned figure of the venerable poet faces the park named in his honor , and offers us his life as a high inspiration to American youth .

		To whose memory was the statue erected the poet of the Thanatopsis or the ' great national tone-imparter ' ?

		If the former , are we not honoring too much the man who did his best work at nineteen ?

		and if the latter , are we not honoring too much the man who sold out ? ''

		Continuing in the same strain ,
Miss Monroe	ORGANIZATION	holds
Bryant	PERSON	up to ignominy as an artist who was not '' true to his vision '' ; as one who '' preferred to lead a comfortable life and be a good journalist rather than a poet , and so he descended from the serene nobility of Thanatopsis to the puerile pieties of the Hymn to the Sea , The Future Life , The Crowded Street and many other truly orthodox utterances ...
Bryant	PERSON	was , in short , a man born to be a poet who sacrificed the muse , not to those violent enemies , the flesh and the devil , but to that more insidious one , the world or , in other words , comfort and respectability . ''

		With much more to the same effect , to which the reader can readily refer in your issue of
October 14	DATE	.

		Now these would be very damaging assertions if true .

		But , as it happens , they simply are not true .

		It was
Bryant	PERSON	himself who wrote that '' Truth crushed to earth will rise again '' ; and in the present instance , as regards him , I should like to hold out an assisting hand to Veracity as she arises from beneath the debris where
Miss Monroe	PERSON	has inhumed her .

		Who was the very vague '' publisher '' who made the preposterous statement upon which Miss Mon - roe has based her still more preposterous ones ?

		One would like to know , for he should write his own romances instead of publishing those written by other people .

		The allegation that
Bryant	PERSON	'' sold his name , along with his venerable portrait , as the author of books which he neither wrote nor edited , such as '
Bryant	PERSON	's History of the
United States	ORGANIZATION	' and '
Bryant	PERSON	's Collection -LSB- sic -RSB- of Poetry and Song ' '' is so gross a misstatement as to be absurd .

		By ''
Bryant	PERSON	's Collection of Poetry and Song '' I take it that
Miss Monroe	PERSON	means '' The Family Library of Poetry and Song , edited by
William Cullen Bryant	PERSON	'' ; and it also occurs to me that when she is making such serious charges concerning a work she should at least know enough regarding the book itself to be able to quote its title correctly .

		As for the facts about this work a work so well known that it has run through many editions they are as follows : It was originally issued in
1870	DATE	, and at once became widely popular , the demand for it being so insis - tent that a new edition , much enlarged , was got out in
1876	DATE	, and in
1878	DATE	a third one , still again enlarged .

		It is a copy of this edition which for over twenty j r ears has held an honored place in my library , and turning to it I quote as follows from the '' Publisher 's Preface '' : '' Shortly before his death , observing with gratifi - cation the great popularity attained by his book and the growing demand for it , Mr.
Bryant	PERSON	desired to thoroughly revise the work and make it still more worthy of the public esteem and his own fame ... The enlargement and reconstruction of this work entailed upon Mr.
Bryant	PERSON	much labor , in conscientious and thorough revision of all material , cancelling , inserting , suggesting , even copying out with his own hand many poems not readily attainable except from his private library in short , giving the work not only the sanction of his widely honored name , but also the genuine influence of his fine poetic sense , his unquestioned taste , his broad and scholarly acquain - tance with literature . ''

		This in itself settles the question regarding whether
Bryant	PERSON	really edited his `` Library of Poetry and Song '' or merely '' sold out '' his name and portrait to the publishers as an adver - tising asset .

		But beyond that we have the lengthy Introduction with the sub-title , '' Poets and Poetry of the English Language , '' written and signed by
Bryant	PERSON	for the original edition ; as well as the !

		similar preface which he also affixed to the second edition .

		So much for one of
Miss Monroe	ORGANIZATION	's allegations .

		As for that regarding the second work , ''
Bryant	PERSON	's Popular History of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' concerning which she makes , on the authority of the same i unnamed publisher , similar charges , it dissolves !

		into thin air in the same manner when investi - gated .

		This history -LRB- aside from the lengthy signed his - torical preface -RRB- was never claimed to have been written by
Bryant	PERSON	.

		It was in the main the work of
Sidney Howard Gay	PERSON	, but there were numerous collaborators , among them writers as well known as
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	,
E. L. Burlingame	PERSON	, etc. , etc. .

		And the connection of
Bryant	PERSON	with the under - taking was very clearly and explicitly set forth in the preface to the second volume in the following terms : '' To the first volume of this History , as well as to this , it is due to say that the oldest living and most distinguished American scholar , whose name it bears , has given to every line read in proof , before print - ing the benefit of his careful criticism , his ripe judgment and his candid discrimination . ''

		This second volume appeared almost coincidently with the death of the poet , in
1878	DATE	; and as the two concluding volumes did not come from the press for some time , the final one not until
1882	DATE	, there was absolutely no chance for any misappre - hension regarding
Bryant	PERSON	's authorship .

		These facts and they are the unimpeachable ones reveal pretty fully , I think , the grotesque nature of Miss
Monroe	PERSON	's remarks , and the totally ; unwarranted character of her allegations regard - ing the '' man who sold out . ''

		Let us now glance briefly at her further accusa - tion that
Bryant	PERSON	'' sacrificed the muse to the world , or , in other words , to comfort and respec - tabilitv . ''

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 363
Bryant	PERSON	was born in
1794	DATE	.

		His father was a country doctor in a tiny
New England	LOCATION	village , a man altogether admirable but without '' an eye to the main chance . ''

		He was always in straitened circumstances to the day of his death , and his family found the most rigid economy a necessity , while his sons were forced to enter the struggle with the world with no resources except such as those which the force of heredity and the best up-bringing that their parents found it possible to provide had endowed them with .


William Cullen	PERSON	, as Miss
Monroe	PERSON	truly says , '' was born a poet . ''

		But he was also born a human being , with the necessity of food , clothes , love , and a fireside .

		He first tried the law , and drilled away at it for a number of years .

		In his own words , at a time when his poetic genius was clamoring for utter - ance -LRB- the era of '' Thanatopsis , '' '' To a Water - fowl , '' '' Fairest of the Rural Maids , '' '' Summer Wind , '' `` A Forest Hymn '' -RRB- , and '' Each gaze at the glories of earth , sky and ocean To my kindled emotions was wind over flame , '' he was being '' Forced to drudge for the dregs of men And scrawl strange words with the barbarous pen . ''

		The struggle was a severe one and it was complicated by his early marriage and growing family .

		It was as impossible for a penniless New Englander to live by poetry alone , to say nothing of supporting a wife and family , in the
United States	LOCATION	of
1825	DATE	-LRB- or for many years afterward -RRB- as it is for a bee to gather honey from hornblende . ''

		Thanatopsis '' was written in
1811	DATE	, the '' Water - fowl '' in
1815	DATE	.

		The one waited seven years , the other four , for publication , finally appearing in
1818	DATE	in the `` North American Review '' -LRB- then an obscure literary bantling -RRB- , to which
Bryant	PERSON	's father , who had found them in his son 's desk , had sent them without the latter 's knowledge .

		Their author received no payment for them ; and when , three years later , their publication having caused him to be hailed as the first great American poet , he issued his first volume of verses , what was the result ?

		Why , five years after its publication he had realized net profits , from the sales , of pre - cisely
$ 14.92	MONEY	!

		Finally , in
1825	DATE	,
Bryant	PERSON	took a desperate step .

		He recognized that his vocation was literature , and that the only place in which its practice would yield him a livelihood was
New York City	LOCATION	; so there he removed , as , in his own phrase , '' a lit - erary adventurer . ''

		Previous to this time , as a poet , he had been receiving the princely stipend of
$ 200	MONEY	a year for contributing to the '' U. S. Literary Gazette '' not less than one hundred lines of poetry each month .

		Miss
Monroe	PERSON	can '' figure it out for her herself , '' if she wishes to , as a prob - lem alike in poetical stimuli and domestic economy .

		At the same time
Bryant	PERSON	sold his poems , wherever a market offered , for two dollars apiece !

		In
New York	LOCATION	, leaving his family in the country , he grubbed along as best he might , and was having a bitter time of it financially , until at last chance threw in his way an associate editorship of the '' Evening Post , '' which he accepted as one ship - wrecked does a friendly sail .

		It proved the turn - ing point of his fortunes ; but he had yet '' a hard row to hoe . ''

		The paper was not then strongly established , and its value was small so small that
four years later	DATE	he was able to buy a con - trolling interest in it for
$ 2,000	MONEY	, which he bor - rowed for the purpose .

		This was in
1829	DATE	.

		Eight years later he thought it safe to undertake the European tour which he had long dreamed of ; but returned to find that mismanagement during his absence had been such as to force him to go deeply into debt to straighten out the tangle , and to bind himself to the wheel again like '' a draught horse harnessed to a drag , '' as he ex - pressed it .

		This is an outline of the manner in which
Bryant	PERSON	, to quote the language of
Miss Monroe	PERSON	, '' sacrificed the muse to the world '' and '' sold out '' his '' name and venerable portrait '' to pro- mote publications sailing under false colors in his old age .

		I do not offer this outline on the author - ity of some nameless
New York	LOCATION	publisher , but as attested historical fact of which the proofs are all of record .

		Unless all credible witnesses are at fault , if ever there was a poet whose personal probity was irreproachable that poet was
William Cullen Bryant	PERSON	.

		If ever there was a poet who had a higher or more dignified conception of the nobil - ity and sacredness of poetry and the practice thereof or held more steadfastly to that concep - tion throughout his life , I have never heard of him .

		And , habituated as I have become to the reckless assaults which the '' new '' poetry makes upon the poetry of the past , it has been with a feeling not so much of surprise as of pain that I have found it necessary to thus come to the I defence of one whose name and whose fame , alike as a poet and as a man , should be a precious heri - tage to all the generations of Americans who shall come after him .

		VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND CITIZENSHIP .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I wonder if the '' vocation of enlightened citi - zenship '' and '' other vocations '' are really such extremes as Dr.
Showerman	PERSON	suggests in his arti - cle published in your issue of
Sept. 30	DATE	.

		I wonder if the ultimate end of liberal education is only the production of the ideal citizen and the ideal State .

		It is not conceded by all intellectual experts and educators that the
State	ORGANIZATION	is the final end of life , or that citizenship is the only aim of education .

		The fundamental principle of democracy repudiates the assumption that the
State	ORGANIZATION	is the end of education .

		That some business and professional men are handicapped by an incomplete knowledge of fundamentals can not be denied .

		But that the handicap is due to an incomplete liberal education is an assertion not substantiated by the facts .

		It is true we have too many stenographers and printers and proofreaders who can not be trusted with spelling , punctuation , and composition .

		It may be noted , however , that if these inefficient workers had enjoyed the benefits of vocational training instead of being bored by following the 364 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 28	DATE	dubiously helpful labyrinths of Latin conjugations and other dead high-school inheritances , they would know how to spell , to punctuate , and to write compositions .

		Had they been taught spell - ing , punctuation , and composition in a vocational class , organized for the definite purpose of pre - paring them for the occupations they were to pursue , instead of learning these branches in the dry , helpless , uninteresting method of the ordi - nary English class organized for an indefinite use in a still more indefinite future , there probably would be no occasion for this criticism .

		It is true that we have reporters , editors , and writers who use slip-shod English ; it is true that many teach - ers are inefficient ; and that numerous lawyers , physicians , and other professional men need ful - ness and rounding .

		But these defects can be remedied only by improving vocational training , not by inflating an already hazy education that leaves the victim of it hanging helpless in the air .

		Dr.
Showennan	PERSON	's article leaves the impression that vocational training is not liberal or cultural .

		It can not be denied that some vocational training is based on this lamentable principle .

		Usually the aim of cultural education is the cultivation of mental power and the acquisition of knowledge .

		A well-regulated vocational school teaching a bal - anced curriculum can accomplish this .

		It is not proved that a liberal education is the only means to secure mental power .

		It requires as much mental effort , as much hard thought , to assemble a gasoline motor as to assemble the dry bones of a dead language into a useless sentence or para - graph or composition .

		Moreover , in assembling a gasoline motor , or in making a table , or in baking a loaf of bread , we are learning something of the real everyday body of useful knowledge which is needed to turn the wheels of life .

		Vocational training supplemented by proper liberalizing stud - ies can accomplish more than a liberal education so called .

		The refinement of intellectual and spir - itual temper need not be lost .

		The perceptions may be deepened , and the vision broadened , by a curriculum that judiciously embodies the liberaliz - ing and spiritualizing elements of the old system with the usefulness of the new .

		After all , the day of poorly trained lawyers , preachers , and physicians , together with the atten - dant hosts in other professions , is rapidly passing .

		Yesterday , the day of liberal education , produced medical men whose education consisted of a year 's study with a country practitioner .

		The long - suffering public then became the victims of his ignorance .

		It was during the regime of liberal education that a prospective lawyer could read a few law-books and pass the bar-examination .

		It was also during this regime that the preacher with an unspeakable theology and the questionable diploma of an indefinite something misnamed a `` call , '' undertook the elevation of morals and religion .

		The tendency and influence of the new education resulted in legislation that eliminated the first two , and inspired a public opinion that is fast exterminating the third .

		Liberal education need not oppose vocational training .

		They may be made logical coordinates .

		We must preserve certain elements of both and discard others .

		Moreover , we must remember that the individual as well as the
State	ORGANIZATION	must benefit by our system of education .

		On its social side , education aims at the preservation of the
State	ORGANIZATION	; on its individual side , it aims to produce rounded as well as thoroughly equipped men and women .

		Let us not forget , however , that good citizenship is secured only when the individual is fitted to do his particular work .

		When we have cultivated mental power , broadened our vision , deepened our perceptions , and refined the intellectual and spiritual temper , we still fall short of fulfilling the duties of citizenship .

		We have hitched the horse only partly to the wagon .

		Citizenship implies efficiency to fill our place in the scheme of civil and social affairs , in other words , to accomplish with the skill that comes from special training , the work society gives us to do .

		To complete the figure , we must hitch to the cross-piece both tugs that draw the wagon .

		The great vocation needs both types of learning .

		THE GEKMAN WAE BOOK AGAIN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Mr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	's somewhat acrimonious letter -LRB- in your issue of
Sept. 30	DATE	-RRB- on my review of '' The War Book of the German General Staff '' -LRB- issue of
Sept. 2	DATE	-RRB- might be allowed to pass harmlessly into oblivion , were it not that it ignores in an astonishing way a point which the reviewer had thought would be manifest to all .

		Mr.
Tannen	PERSON	- baum asks , '' Since when is the doctrine that neces - sity knows no law a German doctrine ? ''

		The answer is obvious : since
August 4 , 1914	DATE	, when the German Chancellor proclaimed it unqualifiedly in the
Reichstag	LOCATION	.

		Speaking of the invasion of Bel - gium , von Bethmann-Hollweg said on that occa - sion : '' We are now in a state of necessity , and necessity knows no law . ''

		A little reflection will show that the doctrine is not synonymous with self-defence , as your correspondent seems to as - sume , but is a negative and euphemistic form of '' might makes right . ''

		Human frailty , which is not confined to
Germany	LOCATION	, has made use of the plea in all ages and climes to cloak injustice , but the reviewer is not aware that any modern state save the present
Imperial German Government	ORGANIZATION	has ever deliberately emblazoned that device on its escutcheon .

		As to charges of unfairness -LRB- and even of false - hood ! -RRB-

		the reviewer would like to assure the read - ers of THE DIAL that the text of the War Book was reproduced literally in the two quotations .

		A score or more of other passages might have been cited with almost equal appositeness .

		The German General Staff speaks for itself in this book , and he who runs may read .

		For the rest it might be pointed out that Mr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	's comparison of the German War Book with the
American Naval	ORGANIZATION	War Code breaks down in various ways .

		The regularly sanctioned usages of naval warfare differ from those of land warfare in certain important respects , as the na - THE DIAL 365 ture of things requires .

		A careful scrutiny of the two passages discloses also such differences of expression and implication in the American state - ment as will render probable a difference in the conduct of officers and men .

		The
American navy	ORGANIZATION	, we are fain to think , would not be guilty of a '' Lusitania '' massacre .

		But the real heart of the matter is that the tu quoque or '' you 're another '' argument , so liberally employed by Mr.
Tannen	PERSON	- baum and other German apologists , is both ethi - cally untenable and practically futile .

		American indignation at the violation of
Belgium	LOCATION	, for exam - ple , not only should not but also will not be quenched by a reminder that
America	LOCATION	has mal - treated the Indians in the past .

		And it is well that this is so ; if that form of argument were accepted as effectually silencing an opponent , all moral reprobation would cease and consequently all moral progress would be estopped .


Oct. 16 , 1915	DATE	.

		THE REVIEWER .

		DE .

		VIZETELLY AND DIPHTHONGS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		May I call attention to a confusion of terms to be found on pages 290-291 of Dr.
Frank H. Vize	PERSON	- telly 's '' Essentials of English Speech '' which escaped the comment of your reviewer .

		He says : '' We have been told that six of the symbols in the
National Education Association	ORGANIZATION	alphabet are ' conso - nants replacing our present symbols / which ' is unde - sirable since the sounds to be represented are clearly and adequately shown by our present letters . '

		This is not so our present letters do not show the diph - thongal characters of ch , sh , ng , th , and zh .

		The
Committee of the National Education Association	ORGANIZATION	recommended the use of ties in certain of these sym - bols purposely to bring out this very diphthongal character .

		The amateur philologist , who declares these undesirable , even though he may have sat at the feet of the great professors of languages in the universities of
Europe	LOCATION	, simply shows colossal igno - rance as regards these digraphs .

		Every one of the great dictionaries has decided that the sound of these letters is diphthongal . ''

		Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	then goes on to quote from the late Dr.
William T. Harris	PERSON	to the effect that ch is diphthongal , '' a combination of t and sh . ''

		This , of course , is true , and it is a fact which the
N. E. A.	ORGANIZATION	alphabet does not in the least bring out by tying a c and an h together in a digraph .

		But what can Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	mean when he calls sh , ng , th , and zh diphthongal , and says that '' every one of the great dictionaries '' has so decided ?

		On the contrary , there is no dictionary in En - glish , no authoritative phonetic statement in or out of a dictionary , which has not decided the direct reverse , that is , that the four sounds men - tioned -LRB- really five , since th stands for two differ - ent consonants -RRB- are monophthongs .

		Selecting the one consonantal diphthong out of the group of five -LRB- or six -RRB- , and quoting Dr.
Harris	PERSON	to prove that it is a consonantal diphthong , does not prove anything regarding the others , which are single sounds , sh the voiceless and zh the voiced open point teeth consonants of Mr. Sweet , th as in '' thin '' the voiceless , and th as in '' then '' the voiced open blade point consonants of the same authority , and ng his voiced back nasal consonant .

		The New English Dictionary gives them each a single character to that end , and there is no dis - senting voice among phoneticians anywhere .

		Will Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	explain why he uses the term '' colos - sal ignorance '' of others in this connection ?

		WALLACE RICE .

		THE AUTHOE OF '' SANINE . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I am surprised that the Russian author
Michael Artzibashef	PERSON	-LRB- he is really an admixture of five races -RRB- should be regarded as a so-called '' prophet of pessimism , '' when he distinctly says that in his view the outlook of any student of humanity is lia - ble to continual change . ''

		Each day , each hour even , '' he says , '' has its message for us . ''

		It appears so plain to me that , while he is acutely sensible of the unfortunate environmtnt of thousands of human beings , and to what appears to be the injustice of their fate , he is only portray - ing a few individuals of the millions or billions of humanity .

		He has also said -LRB- in '' Sanine '' -RRB- that no one can get a right conception of life from books .

		I observe also that his critics are prone to mistake the sentiments he attributes to the passing emotions of his characters for his own opinions and beliefs , which is deplorable ; and the liability to such misconstruction is accentuated in the transla - tion of his writings .

		It is gratifying , however , to find his American critics as a unit in recognizing the fact that he is essentially clean-minded .

		The character of
Sanine	LOCATION	, though a puzzle to some of the critics , is intended to show that no man can be sure of himself in the toils of temptation .

		And here he also presents one of the awful facts in life , the paralyzing power of a dominant will , call it hypnotism , mesmerism , or what you please .

		Some things that I have not seen commented upon -LRB- or only very lightly touched -RRB- are his admira - ble restraint and his remarkable gift of word paint - ing .

		He has told of his grief at not being able to devote his life to painting upon canvas ; but he possesses the great gift of handling words as col - ors , and his books are worth reading for this alone .

		We also observe his extreme sensitiveness to sounds and odors , his love of music , and his response to the tones of the speaking voice .

		Not the slightest sigh of the breeze or tremor of the leaves escapes him .

		* The activities of Mr.

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's prose is always easy and limpid , and sometimes sparkling .

		Here is a passage describing the launching of a cele - brated leviathan of fiction : '' One afternoon , some time in the winter of
1880	DATE	, just as I was preparing to close my desk , a young lady and her father came in , the latter bur - dened with an enormous package of manuscript .

		The daughter was about twenty , and admitted that this was her first attempt at literary production .

		The father did most of the talking , but his state - ment that the story that his daughter had pro- duced was certain to attract widespread attention was a word that is listened to so often in a pub - lishing office that it did not impress me very seriously .

		I could only dismiss my callers with the word that the manuscript would receive care - ful attention .

		The great amount of the material , the admitted inexperience of the author , even the detail that the script had been written , not in ink but in pencil and on yellow instead of white sheets , gave a pretty strong impression against the probability that the story possessed any publish - ing importance .

		I put a few of the first chapters into my bag and began the reading rather late in the
evening	TIME	when I had gotten through with other matters .

		I found myself annoyed , notwithstand - ing the troublesome strain on my eyes from the pencil script , that I had not brought home more chapters .

		The old man was right in his contention that the manuscript would attract at once the attention of the reader , for the book was the famous ` Leavenworth Case , ' and the murder , the solution of which constitutes the problem of the story , occurs in the second chapter .

		The narra - tive was absorbing , but its exceptional compass made it difficult , if not impossible , to manage on ordinary publishing lines .

		As first written ' The Leavenworth Case ' contained about 200,000 words .

		In arranging for another call from the father and daughter , I expressed my cordial interest and at the same time pointed out the difficulty from a business point of view in the management of such an elephant of a romance .

		With a good deal of protest
Miss Green	ORGANIZATION	accepted the task of elimi - nating certain portions of the narrative , but it was as if she had undertaken to cut up a baby .

		Twice did the manuscript go back for curtailment , but as finally printed the volume still contained 160,000 words . ''

		There is less in Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's book about the publishing enterprises of his firm than might be expected .

		Considerable space is devoted to an account of the publication of the series of '' Writings of the Fathers of the Republic , '' which may fairly be called among the major undertakings of the kind in this country .

		It covers the writings of Washing - ton ,

		Later the firm published the `` International Series , '' the `` International Science Series , '' the `` Story of the Nations '' series , and the '' Heroes of the Nations '' series .

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	has issued a fair shelf-full of books of his own .

		In
1893	DATE	he brought out `` Authors and Their Public in Ancient Times , '' a work which , though based on Ger - man scholarship , is valuable because it covers ground hardly touched upon in English .

		Later , he added a study of `` Books and Their Makers in the Middle Ages , '' which is largely an investigation as to how far the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, with its two sets of Indexes , Pro- hibitory and Expurgatory , interfered with authorship and publication in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		In
1909	DATE	there appeared from his pen a biograph - ical study of
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		An illustrated frivol - ity entitled '' The Gingerbread Man '' has had something of a popular success .

		The memoir of his father and the two volumes of his own `` Memories '' complete the tale of Mr. Put - nam 's contributions to literature .

		We have left to the last what many people will consider Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's most important service .

		He inherited from his father the interest in and the lion 's share of the work of furthering
International Copyright	ORGANIZATION	.

		The two of them seem to have borne the brunt of the fight for this important reform .

		As he points out , the wrongs were not all on one side .

		English publishers were just as free in `` conveying '' anything they wanted from American writers as our pirates were in deal - ing with English publications , only they did not want so much .

		The whole question of copyright is still on an unsubstantial and illogical basis .

		If any property at all is sacred it would seem to be those estates that writers conjure up out of their own minds .

		However , for the considerable protection thus far secured , authors both in this country and abroad owe much to the self-sacrificing labors of Mr.

		It is therefore desirable that these revised judgments and newly discovered facts should , at more or less regular intervals , be gath - ered , sifted , weighed , and woven into a re - statement of what may be , in essence , an old story .

		For this reason the authors of the `` Riverside History of the United States '' have undertaken `` to describe in proper pro- portions and with due emphasis .

		.

		the forces , influences , and masterful personali - ties which have made the country what it is . ''

		This is no small task which they have at - tempted , for the growth of the American people can not be treated as the simple and steady development of a nation , the various parts of which have been in harmonious accord as to ideals political , social , eco - nomic , or intellectual and the methods of realizing them .

		On the contrary , this growth has been an unsteady one , because sectional prejudices have been slow in giving way to national sentiment .

		Professor
Becker	PERSON	, who contributes the vol - ume on '' The Beginnings of the American People , '' writes from the viewpoint of the student of European history , and for this reason his work is of more than passing interest .

		He sees the colonies as parts of the European system .

		His thorough understand - ing of European political affairs , of social conditions and ideals , and particularly of the economic theory of the age , enables him to set forth in a remarkably clear and compact , but at the same time exceedingly entertaining way , the narrative of the three hundred years with which he deals .

		Generally the works on American colonial history which come to the hand of the average reader lack this broader interpretation which is so essential to the proper understanding of the period .

		It is true that the facts pertain - ing to the founding of the colonies , their growth , and the development of their insti - tutional life are known , as are the incidents connected with the French occupation of and expulsion from
America	LOCATION	.

		So , too , are the issues which developed in the
last half of the eighteenth century	DATE	, and which ended in the severing of our connections with the mother - country .

		But they are known from the standpoint of the American colonist .

		It is by no means damaging to one 's Americanism to examine the problems of this period from the standpoint of the British imperialists whom circumstances forced into the position of empire-builders .

		Viewing questions of pol - icy , as they did , in this light , it is reasonable to assume that their views surpassed in breadth those of many of the colonial leaders of the day , who , hampered by local pre - 368 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 28	DATE	judices , drifted toward provincialism and particularism .

		Professor Becker shows clearly that eco - nomic theory was at the bottom of the earlier colonial policy of
England	LOCATION	, as well as the later imperialistic policy .

		The cardinal doc - trine of the age was that to be politically independent a nation must be self-sufficing .

		In the nation dependent upon rivals for the necessities , not only the prosperity of the trading class was threatened , but the very life of the nation itself .

		When the English merchants , in the age of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, began to bewail the lack of markets , the chartered trading and colonizing companies came into existence .

		So it appears that the dependence upon foreign countries for various commodi - ties , coupled with the decline of the English export trade , gave rise to the colonizing move - ment .

		Other influences contributed to the founding of the English plantations in Amer - ica , but economic causes were of primary importance .

		As the colonies grew in commercial and polit - ical importance , the English statesmen came to feel more and more strongly that these na - tional investments should be made paying ones .

		They determined to regulate the com - mercial and political activities of these small states , not with any idea of limiting their growth or prosperity , but because they be - lieved that through regulation the greatest good would result to the greatest number of English subjects .

		Thus the numerous regu - lating acts passed prior to
1765	DATE	were attempts to foster the commerce and industries of the whole nation at the expense of foreign coun - tries , and to develop colonial industry along lines which would not come into competition with English industry .

		The overthrow of
France	LOCATION	in the New `` World brought some weighty problems to
England	LOCATION	.

		The latter country became an empire in terri - torial extent , but in territorial extent only ; for it lacked all the administrative machinery necessary for the consolidation and control of a political organism so vast .

		The attempts to create an administrative system capable of regulating the internal and external rela - tions of this empire were of necessity experi - mental in character , and were certain to meet with opposition wherever imperial interests ran counter to those of the small and widely scattered political units which heretofore had managed their own affairs according to their own inclinations .

		To assure a more perfect union , the political system must be over - hauled , and any such reorganization would of necessity tend to limit the chartered rights of the American plantations .

		Any reorgani - zation of the commercial system something which was demanded by the powerful mer - chant class now so important in English affairs was certain to interfere with the profits of the commercial class in the colonies .

		The enlargement of territorial holdings meant a decided increase in the size of the army ; the reorganization of the administra - tive machinery meant the creation of numer - ous offices .

		The increased operating expenses could be met only by heavier taxation , a part of which the colonies would be expected to bear .

		Upon these points of imperial policy was based the opposition to the mother-country .

		One can scarcely deny that from a legal point - of view the English statesmen had right upon their side .

		Lack of tact , however , and a stubborn disregard for the prejudices of the provincials , turned passive resistance into a revolt which rent asunder the imperial state the English lords were trying so earnestly to mould into an indestructible unit .

		It is not to be wondered at that the mother - country could not win the undivided support of the American colonies for her imperialistic policy .

		The colonies had difficulties in agree - ing among themselves on any subject .

		When it was scarcely possible for Puritan ,
Angli	LOCATION	- can ,
Calvinist	LOCATION	,
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	, and Catholic to live together in peace in this age of rancorous religious prejudice , it was highly improbable that these elements would gather themselves together into a single state without a decided struggle .

		Moreover , the geographical environ - ments of these groups were such as would intensify rather than diminish the prejudices of each , since economic differences , so power - ful in influencing the formation of political beliefs , were bound to develop .

		So it was that physiographic conditions , together with certain definite religious and political beliefs , developed a political , social , and economic unit in colonial
New England	LOCATION	which differed radically from the unit developed in Vir - ginia .

		Communication , except by sea , was well-nigh impossible ; and each colony , devel - oping along its own lines , nursing its own prejudices , and exalting its own ideals , strove to become sufficient unto itself .

		Commerce , the great agency for the widening of men 's minds , had little opportunity to exert its powerful influence upon these isolated bodies politic of seventeenth century
America	LOCATION	.

		In the course of events , a common danger from without compelled the colonies to bury their differences long enough to win inde - pendence and a place among the nations of the earth .

		The treatment which Professor Becker accords to the Revolution is not the
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 369 one generally set forth for American readers .

		It is impossible not to receive the impression that even the few successes gained by the poorly organized colonial armies in the early years of the war were due not so much to the patriotism of the American people as to the studied inactivity of the British generals . ''

		The ministers -LSB- of
England	LOCATION	-RSB- had doubtless thought that the policy of conducting the war with the olive branch and the sword in either hand would prove successful .

		Certainly
Howe	PERSON	had so interpreted his instructions .

		He had fought only when it was necessary to fight ; easily accom - plished everything he seriously attempted ; never pressed an advantage ; had supposed that by occu - pying the principal cities , affording protection to the loyal , and by moderation winning the luke - warm , the flame of rebellion would burn low for want of fuel and in good time quite flicker out . ''

		As it was , the colonial army looked with con - tempt upon a government which could neither feed nor clothe its soldiers ;
Congress	ORGANIZATION	criticized the army for weakness , and feared it when it threatened to usurp congressional powers .

		The states wanted to control their own troops and direct their activities ; fur - thermore , they tried to dodge taxes and to leave their quotas unfilled .

		Here and there a fortunate victory aided the cause of the colonies ; the French alliance gave new life to a weakened resistance ; but most of all the steadfastness of purpose displayed by `` Wash - ington brought success to the American cause .

		Professor
Becker	PERSON	's narrative thus differs in several essentials from the version usually accepted .

		The second volume of the set , `` Union and Democracy , '' by Professor
Johnson	PERSON	, covers the period from
1783	DATE	to
1828	DATE	.

		The writer treats first the commercial , financial , and political troubles of that unfortunate experiment in government , the Confederation .

		The forma - tion of the Constitution , the organization of the new national government , and the steps by which this government sought to establish its authority over the states , are portrayed in the orthodox way .

		The period is interesting and complex ; and although the term `` criti - cal period '' is pretty generally applied to that of the Confederation , the years imme - diately following the adoption of the Consti - tution may also lay claim to an importance scarcely less great .

		Particularism was strong , respect for the national government was slow of growth ; party loyalty and factional ani - mosity often obscured the goal toward which the nation moved .

		The constant and strenu - ous effort to establish itself as a nation , to protect its subjects , to maintain its rights , and at the same time to avoid being drawn into the general European war which was raging , laid heavy burdens upon those who guided the destinies of the new
American State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The unrest of these years was in - creased by the fact that the parties , divided as they were over the interpretation of the Constitution as to the relative powers of the states and the national government , were also clearly in opposition as to the attitude which
America	LOCATION	should assume toward the warring powers .

		Still another line of development the occupation of the West served to compli - cate the situation .

		Professor
Johnson	PERSON	points out that the '' greatest obstacle in the path of the people of the
United States	LOCATION	in their strug - gle towards national life was the vastness of the territory which they occupied . ''

		The occupation of the trans-Alleghany country was one of the tremendous movements of the period .

		This was accomplished in the face of the most serious opposition , not only upon the part of the Indians , but of the European nations as well , since each of these hoped by diplomatic intrigues among them - selves , with the Indians , and with the settlers in the West , to establish themselves in the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	, and thereby rob the American people of the fruits of the late war .

		This diplomatic contest for the possession of the West is one of the most fascinating and complex studies in our history .

		With the occupation of the West , which was accomplished with astonishing rapidity by the pioneers , a distinctly sectional feeling developed .

		The antagonism of the back - country farmer of colonial
Virginia	LOCATION	toward the planter of the tide - water country which in itself was really class antagonism based upon differences in wealth , social posi - tion , and political importance appeared again in the opposition of the young , provin - cial , trans-Alleghany West to the older and more conservative East .

		The West came into political power in
1811	DATE	.

		Urged on by the hatred borne by the western men for the English , whom they held responsible for most of the Indian trou - bles along the frontier , it carried the nation into the second war with
England	LOCATION	.

		As far as land operations were concerned , this war had little in it to which the American could `` point with pride . ''

		One lesson was not lost on
Madison	PERSON	, who , in a special message to Con - gress in
1815	DATE	, wrote : '' Experience has taught us that neither the paci - fic dispositions of the American people nor the pacific character of their political institutions , can altogether exempt them from that strife which appears , beyond the ordinary lot of nations , to be incident to the actual period of the world ; and the same faithful monitor demonstrates that a cer - 370 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 28	DATE	tain degree of preparation for war is not only indispensable to avert disaster in the onset , but affords also the best security for the continuance of peace . ''

		The influence of the war was beneficial , however .

		The nation was released from its close dependence upon
Europe	LOCATION	, and a favor - able peace laid the foundations for the settle - ment of our differences with
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		There developed , also , a national conscious - ness which drew attention to such internal problems as the tariff , the bank , internal improvements , and the extension of slavery .

		During these years , too , came several of the remarkable decisions of Chief Justice Mar - shall , by which the doctrine of Federal supremacy over the states was first given definite legal form .

		The triumph of American democracy came with the election of
Jackson	PERSON	.

		The period from
Jackson	LOCATION	to
Lincoln	LOCATION	, during which the nation wrestled with the most important problems it had been called upon so far to solve , has always been one of deep interest .

		The volume covering this period of '' Expan - sion and Conflict '' has the additional attrac - tion of being written by a Southerner .

		Pro- fessor
Dodd	PERSON	works upon the assumption that , except in extent of territory which they occu - pied , the American people did not form a nation until after the close of the Civil War .

		The assumption seems well founded , since sec - tional interests undoubtedly were uppermost in the thoughts of all save a few of the most broad-minded leaders .

		In this unsettled period the sectional feel - ing which had existed between the
Atlantic	LOCATION	states and those beyond the Alleghanies was submerged in a sectionalism much more vio - lent in character , which was determined along lines of latitude instead of longitude .

		The North was a land of towns and small farms ; the South a land of plantations , where the problem from the very beginning of the plan - tation system had been that of labor .

		Through the introduction of negro slavery , a solution had been reached at an early date .

		As long as the slave communities had been confined to the
Atlantic Plain	LOCATION	, the question of the extension of slavery had not been one of great political significance .

		With the expansion of the slave power , coming after the War of
1812	DATE	as the result of the rapid increase in the production of cotton and tobacco , the opponents of the institution be - came alarmed , and the question grew rapidly in importance until it came to over-shadow and finally to obscure all others .

		Very natu - rally the Southern leaders felt that the eco - nomic life of the South was dependent largely upon slavery .

		They could see , too , that sooner or later the rapidly growing North was to outstrip the South in the race for political supremacy , and consequently it was but a question of time until the several branches of the national government would fall into the hands of those hostile to negro servitude .

		This could mean only one thing : slavery would be declared illegal , and the economic structure of the South would be ruined .

		Southern leaders saw two possible ways through which the situation might be con - trolled .

		In the first place , the doctrine of strict construction of the Constitution must be rigidly adhered to , and developed still further .

		This was done most skilfully by the powerful mind , of
Calhoun	PERSON	; and out of the older doctrine grew the States Rights doc - trine , under which slavery in the common - wealths seemed safe .

		In the second place , the South must keep her representation in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	equal to that of the North , which was certain to gain control of the
House of Repre	ORGANIZATION	- sentatives .

		This could be accomplished by the extension of slavery into the territories , in the hope that when new commonwealths came to seek admission to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	they would come with constitutions legalizing slavery .

		The vigorous opposition of the North to this pol - icy led the sections into a series of violent controversies which could not be disposed of by compromises .

		The fact that the territory left open by the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise to the peaceful extension of slavery was decidedly limited in extent undoubtedly influenced the nation 's policy of expansion which prevailed in the forties .

		This storm and stress period , when the South fought hard for the extension of its power and the protection of its economic and social organization , Professor
Dodd	PERSON	treats from the standpoint of the historian , not the partisan .

		In addition to a clear sketch of the political events of the time , he has found space to give us a glimpse of the economic and social background so necessary to the proper interpretation of these years of un - rest .

		The great personalities under whose leadership the sentiment of either section crystallized are briefly characterized , the greater emphasis being laid , very properly , upon the influence each exerted in moulding the political thought of the time .

		The chap - ters on `` The Militant South , '' `` The Aboli - tionists '' and `` American Culture '' will attract attention , as will those on the war itself .

		The period from the close of the Civil War to the present time , which Professor
Paxson	ORGANIZATION	covers in '' The New Nation , '' is , from the
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 371 standpoint of the average college student at least , the '' Dark Ages '' of American history .

		Still it is a period of very decided interest .

		During the years of Reconstruction , states - men and politicians alike wrestled with the problem of the status of the seceded common - wealths .

		An undignified struggle went on be - tween the legislative and executive branches of the government , neither party being cer - tain of its constitutional ground in the mat - ter .

		In the meantime the South suffered under the rule of the carpet-bagger , which ruined what remained of its civilization , wasted its scanty resources , fastened upon it the rule of an inferior race , and delayed for years the efforts of the planter to rebuild his wrecked economic system .

		In the end , it was the mysterious
Ku Klux Klan	PERSON	and the Knights of the
White Camellia	LOCATION	, whose ghostly riders struck terror into the hearts of the dusky politicians and rid the South of the hated political adventurers .

		During the
quarter century	DATE	after the war the trans-Missouri West was occupied .

		These are the times of the cattlemen of the
Great Plains	LOCATION	; of the miners of the
Black Hills	ORGANIZATION	and
Colorado	LOCATION	; of Red Cloud , Black Kettle , Crazy Horse , and Chief
Joseph	PERSON	; of
Custer	LOCATION	,
Fetter	PERSON	- man , and Crook .

		Whoever loves the romance of the frontier will find something here to interest him .

		During these years the trans - continental railroads bridged the American Desert , brought about the disappearance of the frontier , and relegated the picturesque cowboy to the pages of fiction .

		Our foreign relations during the period are also of much importance .

		For years after the close of the war there was a decided ten - dency toward expansion , as is evidenced by the purchase of
Alaska	LOCATION	and the attempts to obtain the
Danish West Indies	LOCATION	and
San Domingo	LOCATION	.

		The settlement of the
Alabama	LOCATION	Claims , the Venezuelan question , and our several boundary controversies indicate the beginning of an era of cordial relations with the other great English-speaking people .

		Our relations with
Spain	LOCATION	grew more and more strained through these years , until at last we became involved in a war with that nation and emerged from it a world power .

		Pro- fessor
Paxson	ORGANIZATION	's treatment of this event is certain to attract attention , since it differs radically from the popular accounts usually accepted .

		To him it appears that
Spain	LOCATION	was not entirely to blame for the situation which developed ; that the Spanish nation made nearly every concession which could reason - ably be expected of it ; and finally that the `` yellow '' newspapers forced
America	LOCATION	into a struggle which diplomacy might have averted .

		Probably the most interesting part of the volume is that dealing with the economic , social , and political reorganization of the na - tion which shows itself in the widespread unrest of recent years .

		New parties have been formed to protest against the reaction - ary tendencies of the older political organiza - tions , and are demanding radical changes in the administrative system .

		A conflict is in progress to compel `` big business '' to con - form to the laws of the land .

		The restraining influence which the judiciary has exercised over state legislatures in their battles with the railroads has brought this branch of our government under closer scrutiny than ever before .

		There is an undoubted sentiment against the so-called legislation by the judi - ciary .

		Labor has organized to protect itself , and is making earnest demands for social and economic justice ; the
Far West	LOCATION	is insisting that its interests be given consideration ; the representatives of various powerful indus - tries are urging the national legislature to frame tariff bills consistent with the desires of each .

		The people have awakened to the value of the nation 's natural resources , and earnestly oppose that school of capitalists which supports the doctrine '' that all natural resources of the country should be trans - ferred to private hands as speedily as possi - ble , at a nominal charge , or no charge at all . ''

		Many thousands of government documents , monographs , and editorials have appeared treating these questions from every conceiv - able point of view , and each colored by the sympathies of the writer .

		By gathering the facts which are important , and presenting them in an orderly way , together with inter - pretations which are clear cut and consistent with the principles of sound scholarship .

		Professor
Paxson	ORGANIZATION	has made a contribution which will be appreciated by those who attempt to grasp the significant things in the development of this exceedingly interesting period .

		The `` Riverside History '' is a good one , but it will be found more serviceable to the reader who has some groundwork in the sub - ject than to him who has none .

		The treat - ment of the social and intellectual phases , although brief , is worth while .

		In some cases , however , it may call forth comments which are not entirely sympathetic .

		An abundance of really good maps will be an invaluable aid to the reader , as will also be the short bibliographies found at the close of the several chapters .

		As a piece of book - making the series could scarcely be improved upon .


WILLIAM V. POOLEY	PERSON	.

		372 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 28	DATE	DANTE IN A NEW TRANSLATION .

		* A new translation of an old classic must expect the keenest criticism , unless it be put forth under private imprint and confessedly as solace or pastime of the translator .

		Such , however , is not the case with Professor
John	PERSON	- son 's rendering of '' The Divine Comedy . ''

		Emanating from one university and endorsed by another , it challenges comparison with the already existing translations , and should show superiority to most or all of its predecessors .

		This new translator aims especially at `` mod - ern English , '' at '' rhythmical qualities pleas - ing to the English ear , '' while holding to a line-for-line version and giving consideration to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's words even so far as their place in the sentence .

		At the same time , he stands for the claim and obligation of the translation to be '' a work of art . ''

		Yet he alters the femi - nine endings of the original to masculine , thus , in the absence of rhyme , giving blank verse .

		It will be seen that the translator begins with certain inconsistencies in his programme .

		A reverence for the original which insists on retaining words in their place in the sentence is hardly reconciled with the license to alter the rhyme-plan and the metre of the master .

		Nor has the former adherence to the original as good grounds as could be urged for a close following of .

		the verse form .

		In fact , it has very poor grounds , and is altogether imprac - ticable as a working rule .

		Professor
Johnson	PERSON	must have forgotten it before he proceeded very far , for the lines in which the rule is violated are more numerous than those in which it is followed .

		The best that may be said of this new ver - sion is that it contains not infrequent pas - sages combining great dignity and great simplicity .

		The following , from
Paradise II.	ORGANIZATION	, may serve as an example of the best : '' ye , who in a very little bark , Eager to listen , have been following Behind my ship that singing makes its way , Turn back to look again upon your shores ; Put you not out to sea , lest it befall That , losing me , ye should remain astray .

		The water which I take was never sailed ;
Minerva	ORGANIZATION	breathes , Apollo is my guide , And Muses nine point out to me the Bears . ''

		Or this , from
Canto IX	ORGANIZATION	.

		of the Purgatory : '' It was the hour before the dawn , when first The swallow sings her melancholy lays , Perchance in memory of former woes , And when our mind is more a wanderer From flesh , and less held captive to our thought , And in its visions is almost divine . ''

		Clarity and simplicity are often far from our path in this version .

		Vocabulary and idiom are not always modern .

		Obscurity and awkwardness mar many passages .

		Worst of all , the versi - fication is painfully imperfect , a constant stumbling-block to distract attention from form and thought .

		Rhythm and clarity suffer alike in such a rendering as this -LRB- Inferno , I , 8-9 -RRB- : '' But yet , to treat of the good that I found there , I speak of other things that there I found . ''

		It is not sufficient to urge that the original is sometimes obscure .

		The translator should see clearly and make clear , especially when he abstains from any and all notes .

		So in Paradise I. , 76-77 : '' When the revolving , which Thou longed-for makest Eternal , drew my thought into itself . ''

		These are merely examples of numerous sim - ilar passages which might be cited .

		Not obscurity but mere awkwardness of expression is the fault with the following -LRB- Inferno IV. , 1 -RRB- : '' The deep sleep in my head was broken off By heavy thundering . ''

		We understand at the end of the sentence that thunder roused him from sleep .

		But certainly the first image from the chief ex - pression is of a sharp instrument `` broken off '' in the man 's head .

		A long list of constructions which are neither `` modern English '' nor manifesta - tions of `` the strength and beauty of our own language '' could be cited ; but the following may serve as typical : '' Like one who listens to some great deceit That has been done him , and resents it sore , '' Inferno VIII. , 22-23 . ''

		San
Leo	PERSON	can be reached ... With only feet , but here one needs to fly , ''
Purg	PERSON	.

		Moving his look only along his thigh , ''

		But the deep wounds from which Came forth the blood , in which I had my seat , ''
Purg	PERSON	.

		V , 73-4 .

		-LRB- No , reader , he was not sitting in a pool of '' S , u , s Who for the valley were not seen without , '' Purg .

		VII. , 84 .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 373 '' They both from

		VIII. , 37 , '' No salutation fair from each to each was silent , '' Purg .

		VIII. , 114 . ''

		I craved the mercy of his opening , '' Purg .

		IX. , 110 , -LRB- Meaning , `` I begged him to open it . '' -RRB-

		The fact that
Longfellow	PERSON	used several of these too literal and awkward translations will scarcely make them more acceptable in a later work .

		In addition to the stiffness of style , there is a considerable archaic vocabulary , puzzling to the modern reader .

		The rendering `` St. Lawrence '' for ''
San Lorenzo	LOCATION	'' takes us quite unnecessarily far from
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Is it good English to speak of an '' Empress over many languages '' when `` races '' is meant ?

		Is it permissible to locate `` mosques '' in the city of Dis ?

		Consider in the following the sense of `` thrust '' and `` gall '' -LRB- Parad .

		IV. , 27-29 -RRB- : '' These are the questions that upon thy will Thrust equally , and therefore I will first Treat of the one that has the more of gall . ''

		Or of `` seat '' in this -LRB- Parad .

		III. , 82 -RRB- : '' So that as we exist from seat to seat Throughout this realm . ''

		Or of this expression -LRB-
Parad	ORGANIZATION	.

		II. , 77 -RRB- : `` As a body Divides the fat and lean . ''

		A curious judgment has led to the transla - tion , in a supplement , of all the Latin phrases in the * text , such as suo loco , in exitu
Israel	LOCATION	de Egypto , miserere , Te Deum laudamus ,
Agnus Dei	PERSON	, etc. .

		Since all other annotations are dis - pensed with , it would seem as though the reader of `` The Divine Comedy '' could be trusted to cope with such small Latin , almost all of it being familiar in the
Bible	LOCATION	and tlje church service .

		If it was hoped that this translation was to be read for pleasure , alone or in comparison with any of the older versions , the necessary pains should not have been spared to make it scan better , to attain `` the rhythmical quali - ties pleasing to the English ear . ''

		It is not merely an occasional line which gives offence , where the excuse might be that fidelity to the text and the line-for-line rendering seemed in - compatible with pleasing rhythm .

		There are hundreds of lines in which an agreeable move - ment is attainable by the simple transposition of a word or a phrase , giving in most cases a better poetic construction .

		A few of these will suffice to demonstrate the validity of the criticism . ''

		I pray , bring me to the memory of men , '' Inf .

		VI. , 89 , -LRB- Bring me , I pray thee , to men 's memory -RRB- ; '' Of wishing to speak with them secretly , '' Inf .

		VIII. , 87 , -LRB- Of wish - ing secretly to speak with them -RRB- ; '' That he would tell me who might be with him , '' Inf .

		X. , 117 , -LRB- That he would tell me who with him might be -RRB- .

		It is a curious fact that a large number of the bad scansions have evidently been justi - fied by an unwarranted stress on a pronoun .

		But the most irritating cases are those of which the following is an example -LRB- Purg .

		VII. , 7 -RRB- : `` I am
Virgil	LOCATION	; and for no other sin , '' where the simple transposition , `` Virgil am I , '' gives good scansion and a stronger line .

		The line , `` My ancestors made me so arro - gant '' -LRB- Purg .

		XI. , 62 -RRB- , is doubly defective .

		It can be scanned only by stressing `` me '' ; and the sense is obscured by the idiom . ''

		My ancestry begot in me such pride '' deviates from the phrasing of the original , but it obvi - ates both defects .

		Yet since the translation deviates from the original anyway , one should at least save rhythm and sense . ''

		The rays were striking us full in the face , '' which gal - lops instead of stalks , is easily made into a good iambic line by inversion , '' Full in the face the rays were striking us . ''

		So also with '' I asked that I might give strength to thy feet , '' '' I went along through air bitter and foul , '' `` Me to Parnassus to drink in its caves , '' `` As it was possible when it lost her , '' '' Thou shalt see me come to thy chosen tree , '' and scores of other lines , which limp or refuse utterly to go ; with the aid of a simple inver - sion they march properly enough .

		The very small number of six-stressed lines would be overlooked much more readily than these rough ones .

		It is a disappointment to find the product of so much labor unsatisfactory , and it is painful to give an unfavorable judgment on the serious work of an earnest man .

		One function Professor
Johnson	PERSON	's translation may fairly serve , that of pacing-mate to the Ital - ian text , for one who needs assistance .

		THE FASCINATION OF JAPANESE PRINTS .

		* The sense of detachment necessary to the formation of an impartial estimate of the worth of a book is made difficult when the book is dedicated to the reviewer , and various complimentary references to him are scat - tered through its pages .

		It is with a keen * CHATS ON JAPANESE PRINTS .

		374 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 28	DATE	realization of this disability that the present reviewer ventures to tell the readers of THE DIAL , what he thinks of Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	's '' Chats on Japanese Prints , '' and he craves their indulgence should what he have to say seem lacking in critical judgment .

		There is the more need to ask this because the book is of such conspicuous merit as to call for generous praise .

		In the forty years or thereabout since the color prints by the Ukiyoe masters first came to the attention of art lovers in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, the circle of their ardent admirers has steadily widened , and without doubt would be far wider still were there more abundant opportunities for seeing prints of the better class .

		From the beginning these prints have gone into the portfolios of eager collectors , who were quick to feel their charm and to appreciate their artistic worth , but who have been loath to lend them for exhibi - tion or even to hang them upon their own walls , for they soon learned that extended exposure to light was at the risk of virtual destruction through the fading of the lovely reds and yellows printed in fugitive tints .

		As for the most precious prints of all , the supreme impressions in perfect preservation of the most distinguished designs by the greatest artists of the school , they are so rare that the number of their possessors at any time can never be more than a very few .

		Although the collector 's prizes are so scarce as to make the search for them an exciting pursuit , with the hope ever present to give it zest that some wonderful hidden stores may yet be discovered , the number of prints of a little less distinction , but still of great beauty , is very large , and these have found their way into many hands .

		And while op - portunities for seeing the finer prints have been restricted , they have not been altogether lacking .

		Some very good prints have been acquired by museums and public libraries in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, where they are accessi - ble to all who apply ; important exhibitions have been held in
Paris	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and
Chicago	LOCATION	, and smaller ones an other cities ; and everywhere collectors have been gener - ous in showing their treasures privately .

		`` With increasing interest has come desire for information .

		This the books hitherto available very imperfectly supply .

		The need has been for a compact and readable work , which , while giving the historical facts so far as they are known , should emphasize the aesthetic charm of the prints and make clear the soundness of the conception upon which it rests .

		Such a book Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	has now given us .

		It opens with a '' Preliminary Sur - vey '' in which the claims of
Far Eastern	ORGANIZATION	art are admirably presented .

		Then the incep - tion , development , and decay of the
Ukiyoe School	ORGANIZATION	are passed in review , all of the more important artists being taken up in turn and the strong and weak points in their works put before the reader in nicely discriminating phrase .

		Throughout , the aim is to set forth the distinctive qualities that to the discerning mind make the prints '' a unique source of repose and exaltation . ''

		A few sentences from the introductory chapter will show how vividly the right point of view is put forward : '' That sublimated pleasure which is the seal of all the arts reaches its purest condition when evoked by a work in which the aesthetic quality is not too closely mingled with the everyday human .

		.

		.

		All Asian art has recognized for centuries the fact that vision and imagination are the faculties by which the painter as well as the poet must grapple with reality ... Its function is the func - tion which the European public grants to poets but not always to painters the seeking out of subtle and invisible relations in things , the percep - tion of harmonies and rhythms not heard by the common ear , the interpretation of life in terms of a finer and more beautiful order than practical life has ever known . ''

		These considerations are reiterated and specifically applied in dealing with the sev - eral artists upon whose works Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	pleasantly discourses .

		His pages are packed with information for the student and the col - lector , but so deftly is it worked in that the reader may easily fail at first to realize its extent .

		There are a few mistakes , but all of them relate to matters of minor importance .

		Still , as even little things are of interest to students , it may not be amiss to point out those that seem to invite comment .

		In the opening chapter the assertion is made that `` the linear perspective of the Japanese exactly reverses that of Western painting , '' and that '' in their system , par - allel lines converge as they approach the spectator . ''

		Isometric projection , which the Japanese artists employed until the elements of linear perspective were learned from the Dutch at
Nagasaki	LOCATION	, can not be called ''
Japa	PERSON	- nese perspective , '' and when it is used par - allel lines do not actually but only apparently converge as they approach the spectator .

		The
Hanekawa Chiucho Motonobu	PERSON	men - tioned on page 105 is identical with
Hane	PERSON	- kawa Chincho named on page 91 , and it is not known that he was a pupil of
Okumura Masanobu	PERSON	, nor is it likely , for he appears to have been the elder man by some ten or eleven years .

		Whether the artist who , unless it should be determined that
Torii Kiyonobu	PERSON	did not die
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 375 in
1729	DATE	, must be regarded as the second
Kiyonobu	PERSON	, produced any hand-colored prints is not `` uncertain , '' as Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	asserts on ; page 88 .

		Two pages farther on he says it is j '' fairly established '' that he did .

		The fact is !

		that there are in existence several hand - colored prints signed
Torii Kiyonobu	PERSON	which !

		can be definitely ascribed to the year
1742	DATE	.

		The blue of Koryusai 's '' own devising , '' mentioned on page 163 , was used before his !

		day by
Harunobu	LOCATION	,
Kiyomitsu	PERSON	.

		and
Toyonobu	ORGANIZATION	.

		i And
Shuncho	PERSON	was so far from having '' only ; one manner except in a few early actor j prints , '' that , after the passing of
Kiyonaga	ORGANIZATION	's style , he designed prints in that of
Eishi	LOCATION	,
Utamaro	PERSON	, and even Sharaku ; and early in his career he made a few that closely imitate the style of Shigemasa .

		Such errors as '' the
Kikunojo	PERSON	clan '' -LRB- p. 135 -RRB- in place of the
Segawa	PERSON	line ; or specifying
Nakamura Matsuye	PERSON	when
Naka	PERSON	- mura Tomijuro is depicted -LRB- plate 20 -RRB- ; or of naming one of
Kiyonaga	LOCATION	's masterpieces rep - resenting a party of merrymakers in a room open upon one side , '' The Terrace by the Sea , '' when no terrace is shown , are of little consequence .

		More serious is the spelling of certain j Japanese names in a way that will not stand critical examination .

		That one should be confused by such divergent forms as
Ukioye	LOCATION	,
Ukiyoye	LOCATION	, and
Ukiyoe	ORGANIZATION	is not surprising .

		For the first form , however , there is no warrant save that it has obtained currency among English writers .

		The word is made up of the three syllables Uki -LRB- floating -RRB- yo -LRB- world -RRB- e -LRB- picture -RRB- .

		It is possible to use the syllable ye , which also signifies a picture ; but as the y is silent , the other syllable is preferable and is the one that is used by the Japanese .

		In transliterating Japanese words there is seldom any occasion for the use of ye .

		It represents a sound heard only in the middle of words where , as in '' Shunyei '' for ex - ample , the sound of the preceding syllable forces it .

		It is not heard in such names as
Eishi	LOCATION	.

		Eiri ,
Edo	PERSON	, and the like ; and the forms
Yeishi	PERSON	,
Yeiri	PERSON	, and Yedo therefore invite mis - pronunciation .

		So also does the spelling '' Koriusai , '' though in lesser degree .

		In the accepted system of phonetic transliteration i has the sound of ee in '' meet . ''

		To represent correctly the name of the artist just men - tioned we must spell it Koryusai .

		The r is slightly rolled , the y sounded full , and the u prolonged .

		The word is made up of the syl - lables Ko -LRB- lake -RRB- ryu -LRB- dragon -RRB- sai -LRB- studio -RRB- .

		Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	's estimates of the work of the several artists are singularly just .

		His clear - sighted appreciation of the qualities in these works that commend them so strongly to peo - ple of taste , and his felicitous portrayal of their fascination , are the things that give his book its value .

		With very few of his asser - tions respecting the leading artists is it pos - sible to quarrel .

		Of Harunobu he truly says that '' his real theme was the great harmonies of colour and line . ''

		But when he claims that `` every print signed Harunobu is suspect , '' until we know whether
Shiba Kokan	PERSON	, the con - fessed forger of a few prints signed
Haru	PERSON	- nobu , was `` the greatest liar or the greatest forger in history , '' he does grievous injury to the reputation of a great artist .

		The truth is that none of
Harunobu	LOCATION	's important works can be suspect .

		Kokan was far from being his equal .

		He had some ability , and a few clever forgeries put forth immediately after
Harunobu	PERSON	's death were not inferior to some of the master 's pot-boilers .

		But the number of his forgeries that are easily recognizable by their mannerisms makes it fairly certain that all or nearly all of them must similarly betray their origin .

		That
Koryusai	PERSON	also may have forged
Harunobu	PERSON	's signature is a state - ment with which the reviewer can not agree .

		He has never seen a scintilla of evidence to support the supposition .

		Aside from this failure to realize the un - approachable charm and the strength of
Harunobu	ORGANIZATION	's designs , Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	's remarks about the several artists are all that could be desired .

		Take , for example , his chat about Sharaku .

		How could the significance of his work be better expressed than in the words of the opening paragraph ? ''

		Few people approach
Sharaku	ORGANIZATION	's work for the first time without regarding him as a repulsive charlatan , the creator of perversely and sense - lessly ugly portraits whose cross-eyes , impossible mouths , and snaky gestures have not the slightest claim to be called art .

		At first these strange pic - tures may even seem mirth-provoking to the spec - tator a view of them which he will remember in later years with almost incredulous wonder .

		To overcome one 's original feeling of repulsion may take a long time ; but to every serious stu - dent of Japanese prints there comes at last a day when he sees these portraits with different eyes ; and suddenly the consciousness is born in him that Sharaku stands on the highest level of genius , in a greatness unique , sublime , and appalling . ''

		The final chapter of the book is addressed to the collector , and is full of practical wis - dom .

		The author was perhaps ill-advised in giving instructions for washing prints , since it may lead people to attempt it with disas - trous results .

		And when mentioning the possibility of certain stains being removed mechanically it would have been well to add that the knife should be used only on un - 376 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 28	DATE	printed parts of the paper .

		The other sug - gestions as to the care of prints , and the advice about what to look for and what to avoid when buying , are very much to the point .

		A unique and delightful feature of the book is found in the poems that serve to introduce many of the artists to the reader .

		The volume is well printed , and is illustrated with half-tone reproductions of a considera - ble number of prints .

		To say that it is a distinct contribution to the literature of the subject is not enough : it is easily the best book about Japanese prints that has yet been written .

		* Remembering the tendency to sluggishness that at all times besets the human imagina - tion , and our proneness '' In the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie reclined On the hills like Gods together , careless of mankind , '' it is perhaps well for us that by a blast as from some subterranean trumpet , we should be reminded of the under-world of tragedy and suffering from which we are separated by the thinnest of partitions .

		The time seems peculiarly appropriate for just such a call to serious thinking as Mr.
Sinclair	PERSON	's anthology , '' The Cry for
Justice	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The collective con - science of the world , with its accompanying sense of responsibility for the woes of human - ity , is awakening in these latter days to an extent that constitutes this a new age .

		But like all awakening sleepers , the world resents the intrusion of troublesome realities and the disturbance of pleasant dreams , and is fain to turn on the other side and sink once more into slumber .

		It is this proclivity to somno - lence that must justify the bringing together of these vivid pictures of human misery selected from the entire range of the world of literature .

		That the volume will serve a useful purpose in arousing many from the ignoble repose which life offers to even a moderate degree of affluence , when combined with a sensitiveness to the joys of the intellect and the things of the spirit , we can not doubt . ''

		The Cry for Justice '' must be considered as being specially addressed to those middle - class people who are the chief creators of public opinion , who owe little of their enjoy - ment of life to the leverage of special privi - lege , and who are not too removed from the menace of poverty to be alive to the * THE CRY FOB JUSTICE .

		appeal for social justice .

		That the anthology is as forceful and convincing as it might have been we can not concede .

		When one remem - bers the immense field over which the mate - rial for such a compendium is scattered , one hesitates to suggest that the book might well have been condensed or boiled down .

		Every writer and editor knows , however , as every horticulturalist knows , the wisdom of ruthless pruning , and we fancy the readers of this book will agree with us in thinking that much which is included might with advantage have been omitted .

		Passages from
Talleyrand	LOCATION	,
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	,
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, the German Em - peror , and others that could be named , seem to have little bearing on the main purpose of the book , and only weaken its appeal .

		We should have liked to see greater use made of the writings of the later prophets of
Israel	LOCATION	.

		The cry for justice has never gone up to Heaven in more impressive language than was constantly used by
Habakkuk	LOCATION	,
Hosea	PERSON	,
Malachi	PERSON	, and Amos ; and the condemnation of the economic structure of Society which prevails to this day was never more convinc - ingly expressed than in the words , `` Behold , it is not of the Lord of Hosts that the people should labour as in the fire , or weary them - selves for very vanity . ''

		While admitting that the production of this anthology is fully justified by the tragic con - ditions under which human life is being passed upon this planet , by the seething restlessness and discontent on the part of those who have to bear the heavy burdens of life while debarred from participation in its higher joys , and by the stupid misunder - standing of the signs of the times on the part of the governing classes , a critic 's function would not be discharged if he failed to point out that , as inevitably happens in such cases , the picture presented is composed entirely of shadows , and the lights -LRB- not to speak of high lights -RRB- are completely omitted .

		The conse - quence is that the feeling of atmosphere and perspective is lost , and the impression left upon the mind of the ' reader is not entirely true to fact .

		There is , for instance , little in the book to remind us that misery is not dis - tributed in inverse ratio to affluence , nor happiness directly in proportion to wealth .

		There is no suggestion of `` the soothing thoughts that
spring	DATE	out of human suffering . ''

		There is little hint of the gleams of joy that gild the horizon of the most wretched , or of the abject joylessness that attends life in many a luxurious drawing-room .

		The editor quotes an impressive passage from
Carlyle	LOCATION	, '' It is not because of his toils that I lament for the poor ; we must all toil , or steal -LRB- howsoever we
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 377 name our stealing -RRB- , which is worse .

		The poor is hungry and athirst , but for him also there is food and drink ; he is heavy-laden and weary , but for him also
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	sends sleep and of the deepest ; in his smoky cribs a clear dewy heaven of rest envelops him , and fitful glimmerings of cloud - skirted dreams .

		But what I do mourn over is that the lamp of his 1 soul should go out ; that no ray of Heavenly or even of earthly knowledge should visit him . ''

		But none knew better than
Carlyle	PERSON	that the lamp of the soul is extinguished by wealth more readily than by poverty and oppression , and that the spiritual plight of the slave - owner or the irresponsible capitalist is fre - quently worse than that of the slave .

		Indeed , it may reasonably be maintained that the capacity for joy in the human soul expires more rapidly in the asphyxiating atmosphere of riches than in the social stratum where a struggle for the bread that perishes is the rule of daily life .

		That it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of Heaven , is not merely a poetic metaphor but a statement of fact which many millionaires are bitterly aware of ; while those who are best acquainted with the life of the poor know well that it is difficult to find a human being so destitute as to have entirely lost the capacity for joy , or the power of reacting to the stimuli of starlit nights and the beauty of the sunrise .

		We should be exceedingly unwilling to appear as though acting the part of apologist for things as they are .

		Our only concern is that we should see life as it is , and in its true proportions and perspective ; and if the reader of `` The Cry for Justice '' can be trusted to bear in mind that the picture is inevitably out of drawing and lacking in the elements that constitute truth in art , the les - son that the book teaches of the dire necessity to save civilization by a study of the eco - nomics of industry , will be well learned .

		But after having steeped himself , possibly to the point of despair , in the atmosphere of misery which the book presents , we recommend the reader to seek a quiet corner in which to study carefully
Burns	PERSON	's '' Jolly Beggars '' by way of a spiritual counterpoise .

		There he will find all that is lacking in the doleful pic - tures of life presented in the book he has just read .

		The joy in human companionship ; the delight in that irresponsibility that only those know who have nothing to lose ; the trustful instinct which feels no anxiety for the future and tastes with gratitude the cup of joy as it passes , without a misgiving as to what may come next ; the sane and rational attitude toward life that is unknown to most men of wealth and which expresses itself in the lines , '' The present moment is our own , the next we never saw '' : all these side-lights on the life of the poor he will find in that great mas - terpiece , and will be compelled to admit that it bears the stamp of truth which only a great artist can give to a picture .

		A NEW VERSION OF THE PAKSIVAL LEGEND .

		* The idea of translating
Gerhard Haupt	PERSON	- mann 's '' Parsival '' was indeed a good one , but in Mr.
Oakley	PERSON	``
Williams	PERSON	's rendering the spirit of the original has been grossly mis - interpreted .


Hauptmann	PERSON	's work was written as a child 's book , for his twelve-year-old son , and published with spirited pictures .

		Disre - garding this fact , the translator has sought to make it into a sententious '' allegory of life . ''

		The book jacket advertises the transla - tion as '' retaining to a remarkable degree the beauty and simplicity of the original . ''

		One who has really read
Hauptmann	PERSON	's exquisite German will feel that the kind of alliterative prose in which the translator has rendered it is little more than a mockery .

		The legend of the Grail was one which entered German literature early in the thir - teenth century , with `` Wolfram von
Eschen	LOCATION	- bach 's `` Parsival . ''

		To him is due the trans - formation of the fantastic story of the Grail into a legend filled with deepest human signifi - cance , the principal characteristics of which have endured and reappeared in modern ver - sions .

		Wolfram divested the legend of the churchly character which his French prede - cessor had endeavored to give it , and made the Grail a centre of extra-ecclesiastical wor - ship , guarded in a castle accessible only to the truthful and pure of heart .

		The Grail that hovered before the poet 's eyes was rather an
Aladdin	ORGANIZATION	's lamp than a body relic .

		In the centuries after
Wolfram	PERSON	, the meaning of the Grail fell rapidly to a significance purely sen - sual ; its castle became an earthly paradise .

		Neither the printing of
Wolfram	PERSON	's poem in
1477	DATE	nor
Bodmer	PERSON	's attempted revival in
1753	DATE	-
81	DATE	bore fruit .

		The literary renaissance of the legend , stimulated by new editions of the poem and by histories of mediaeval literature , began with
Immermann	PERSON	's `` Merlin , '' 1830-32 , and culminated in
Wagner	PERSON	's `` Parsival . ''

		These two were not dramatizations of the mediaeval epic , but rather new creations de - * PARSIVAL .

		In his work
Hauptmann	PERSON	has reverted for the main outlines of the story to the version of
Wolfram	LOCATION	, but has restored to the legend much of the lofty religious atmosphere and significance which it had lost .

		Parsival , who | has lived alone with his mother Heartache , unconscious of the existence of other human j beings , forsakes her to battle against the world .

		After slaying the Proud Knight of the
Heath	LOCATION	to avenge a maiden , he turns back only to find that Heartache and the hut where she lived have disappeared .

		Parsival sets out to find her and to kill the man from whose wrong she suffered .

		In his wanderings he comes upon the Grail , but forsakes it because he does not know its meaning .

		When he guesses what it may be he is never again able to find it .

		Intent on the search , he forsakes his young wife Blanchefleur .

		and casts away an earthly. , kingdom .

		When he returns , after years of fruitless search , it is only to find that his wife has just died .

		His son
Lohen	PERSON	- grin does not recognize him .

		nor does anyone except the old Arab from whom he had learned that the Grail was a miraculous sym - bol of Christ 's passion , and that
Amfortas	LOCATION	, its keeper , was his own father .

		Parsival then becomes a serving man .

		a bearer of burdens in the cities and a serf in the country .

		He comes to realize that Heartache is but a sym - bol for the sorrows of the whole world .

		Finally , when he feels that his search is near an end , the aged messenger of the Grail , fol - lowed by a knightly train , enters his hut .

		He places upon
Parsival	ORGANIZATION	's own head the `` crown of joy and sorrow of the Grail . ''

		The episode of the Proud Knight of the
Heath	PERSON	preserves the germ of the ancient inci - dent of Schionatulander and Sigune .


Haupt	PERSON	- mann 's Arab recalls the Priest
Johannes	PERSON	, who in
Wolfram	LOCATION	's version tempts men 's fancy to stray in distant
India	LOCATION	.

		The Grail castle , however , is no longer a gay paradise where the comrades live in luxurious ease , but `` there where God-like beings of their own free will suffer torment to the end that they may release the world from its burden and yet are immortal in the light of their near-by Paradise . ''

		Notwithstanding its modest pretensions as a child 's book ,
Hauptmann	PERSON	's '' Parsival '' may be regarded as one of the most noteworthy modern versions of the story , a great poet 's contribution to a great legend .

		It is unfor - tunate that the present English rendering should be so inadequate .

		jyj Q OEBEL RECENT FICTION .

		* Since Professor
Phelps	PERSON	devoted a chapter to
Michael Artzibashef	PERSON	in his book on the Russian novelists , and since the publication of an English translation of '' Sanine '' a year ago , the name of this writer has become fairly familiar to American readers .

		More recently , we have had `` The Millionaire '' -LRB- a group of three novelettes -RRB- , and now we have a very long novel entitled '' Breaking-Point . ''

		The meaning of the title gradually dawns upon us as the characters commit suicide one after another , and it becomes evident that the author intends to sweep the board .

		Other - wise , the novel might have grown to an in - definitely greater length , since it has nothing in the nature of a rounded plot to force a conclusion .

		All these tragic people live in a little village of the steppes ; all but one or two lead strictly sensual lives , without a gleam of the higher motives for existence ; and when their appetites fail to provide them with enduring satisfaction , they naturally force their exits from an intolerable world .

		There is ` in the book hardly a suggestion that there is such a thing as morality for men and women , and none of these characters could read '' Comus '' with the faintest idea of its meaning .

		Their watchword seems to be : `` Let us eat and drink -LRB- especially drink -RRB- and indulge the sexual passion , for to-morrow we die -LRB- by our own hands -RRB- . ''

		We have had occasion to characterize certain conspicuous English novels of recent years as devoted to a portrayal of the futility of life , but the gloomiest of them are optimistic tracts in comparison with this exhibition of the soul of
Young Russia	LOCATION	.

		The author bares this soul remorselessly ; and if we believed his revela - tion to be typical , we should indeed despair of the great people from which he has sprung .

		But we must not forget that the people that claims a
Gogol	PERSON	and a
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	and a
Tourgue	LOCATION	- nieff has a great deal more to say for life than this , even when we admit a strain of temperamental melancholy running through their work : and we must not allow ourselves to be persuaded that
M. Artzibashef	PERSON	speaks for anything more than a disillusionized sec - tion of the younger generation .

		That he speaks powerfully there is no question , but even the magic of his passages descriptive of nature does not go far to rescue us from de - pression as we contemplate his studies of the human animal wallowing in the trough .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL ' 379 The hero of '' God 's Man / ' a lengthy novel by Mr.
George Bronson Howard	PERSON	, is one
Arnold L'Hommedieu	PERSON	, descended from a long line of distinguished ancestors , domiciled since colo - nial times on
Long Island	LOCATION	.

		The title of the novel is thus accounted for in a literal way ; but the author intends it also to be taken symbolically , as indicating a man 's struggle against temptation , and his underlying pur - pose to do God 's will in a very demoralized world .

		About midway in the narrative , Ar - nold makes a confession which epitomizes the success which he has at that time attained . ''

		May be you can tell me why two of my friends and myself who had intended to live decent lives and be some help to our fellows why we have been forced into shoddy prac - tices and shady lives ?

		For exposing a rascal , I was expelled from college .

		For shielding a friend , I was reduced to the worst kind of poverty .

		For trying to get justice for a help - less woman , I got into jail .

		By using influ - ence with the most corrupt kind of politicians I got out .

		To get back to my former kind of life I had to accept a position with a man who is a wholesale poisoner .

		To get the little money I 've saved , I had to blackmail my employer . ''

		This confession shows that '' Ein guter Mensch in seinem dunkeln Drange 1st sich des rechten Weges wohl bewusst . ''

		But we are a little dubious about accepting Arnold as God 's man when he thereafter engages , from strictly sordid motives , in a scheme for smuggling a cargo of opium into the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The story of this enter - prise , and of the way in which it was finally thwarted , forms the core of the narrative , which is by no means devoid of exciting inter - est. .

		Arnold 's relations with the underworld of
New York	LOCATION	give the author an opportunity to display his minute knowledge of the activi - ties of that sphere of life , and his extraor - dinary acquaintance with the thieves ' jargon \ diieh in these circles serves as a medium of communication .

		The linguistic feats of Mr.
George Ade	PERSON	and Mr.
George M. Cohan	PERSON	are outdone in these pages .

		And yet , despite the sickening atmosphere of the novel , it displays a considerable degree of power , a remarkable gift for characterization , and a kind of philos - ophy of life .

		In its exuberance and its ar - resting commentary upon life it even suggests the later work of Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	.

		But it does not convince us that its hero is cast for the role implied by the title of the novel .

		Some weeks ago , we reviewed a novel in which American inventiveness came to the rescue of a world in agony , and ended the war by means of a device for neutralizing the force of gravity , whereby an aerial warship was constructed that should hover , massive and impregnable , at a convenient altitude over the enemy 's fortress or host , and bring it quickly to terms .

		To-day , in '' The Pass - port , '' by Mr.
Emile Voute	PERSON	, we have another ingenious phantasy of the same type , the invention in this case being an asphyxiating gas , discharged from shells or toy balloons over the heads of its victims , and in a trice reducing them to an unconsciousness that lasts for several hours , but has no injurious after-effects .

		This is the most humane method of enforcing peace that has thus far been suggested .

		Armed with his invention , our hero proceeds to the theatre of war , has an interview with the German Emperor , and dictates the terms upon which the new weapon will be withheld from his enemies .

		When these conditions are rejected , the formula is turned over to the allies , and the German forces are speedily routed and dis - armed .

		The author writes as an American , although his name appears to be French , and he contrives to tell a singularly interesting story .

		He is beset by German spies from the moment when he is suspected of having some - thing `` up his sleeve '' ; but his resourceful - ness , aided by good luck , is quite adequate to all the difficult situations in which he is placed , and whenever he gets into a fix we are confident that he will get out of it in the next chapter .

		The author is clearly no parti - san of the method that piles up agonies until the denouement , and then sweeps them all away at once , leaving us to recall our scat - tered senses from their bewilderment .

		One crisis at a time is his motto , and that is to be surmounted before the next one arises .

		The ; story derives its title from a rather foolish wager made by the hero , to the effect that he will make his way through the warring camps without a passport .

		He is provided with one , of course , but he destroys it as an evidence of good faith at the time the terms of the wager are agreed upon .

1914	DATE	President in
American Hadley	ORGANIZATION	delivered at the Uni - polltics .

		, n - rr ' ' ' versity of
Virginia	LOCATION	a series of i three lectures on Political Methods , < and at
Oxford University	ORGANIZATION	a similar series on Prop - erty and Democracy .

		The six lectures have now been gathered into a single volume enti - tled '' Undercurrents in American Politics '' -LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , although in his preface the author suggests that an equally 380 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 28	DATE	appropriate title would be '' Extra-Constitu - tional Government in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		The
Virginia	LOCATION	lectures undertake to show how those matters which were placed by the framers of the Constitution in the hands of the federal government have frequently been managed by agencies which are extra-constitutional and very different from those which were intended to manage them .

		The agencies principally considered in this connection are political par - ties and the press , the most original and illu - minating of the lectures being that one devoted to the press as the present seat of actual political power .

		It is demonstrated that in a democracy public opinion must some - how be organized in order to be effective .

		This organization was once the work almost entirely of party managers ; but it is main - tained that nowadays it is through the press that the American people forms its opinion as to men and measures , and that the man who accomplishes most in modern politics is he who recognizes this fact most fully .

		The organization of public opinion by the news - papers instead of by the party managers has the advantages , we are told , of involving a more direct appeal to reason and of causing public opinion to be formed in the open ; but it affords no necessary guarantee against appeals to prejudice , emotion , and impatience .

		The
Oxford Lectures	ORGANIZATION	, on Property and Dem - ocracy , show how in this country a great many organized activities of the community have been kept out of government control alto - gether .

		Here are traced the gradual growth of political democracy in the
United States	LOCATION	, the essentials of the constitutional position of the property owner , and the more important recent tendencies in economics and in .

		legisla - tion .

		It is shown that in spite of frequent acts of adverse legislation the constitutional position of the property owner in the
United States	LOCATION	has been stronger than in any country in
Europe	LOCATION	, and that there is no nation which is so far removed from Socialism as ours by its organic law and its habits of political action .

		The rights of private property are substantially buttressed by numerous provi - sions of the Constitution , and they have re - mained unshaken amidst the most sweeping democratizing changes in the domain of poli - tics .

		Only since the opening of the present century has there been any serious movement toward
State Socialism	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	, the main -
spring	DATE	of this movement being popular dis - satisfaction aroused by the manifest failure of competition as a regulator of business and of industrial operations .

		Experiments in
State	LOCATION	control , however , are proving more costly than the general public knows , and Mr.
Hadley	PERSON	properly concludes that the solution of the problem will not be reached until the public demand for
State	ORGANIZATION	control of industry and for trained civil service go hand in hand . ''

		Until the public appreciates expert work in the offices of state , industrial control in the
United States	LOCATION	is likely to remain in the hands of the property owner '' ; after that , the inference is , there may be a very considerable extension of public ownership and control .

		, of a genial sprinkled with quotation marks is indicative of lively reading , the '' Recollections of an Irish Judge : Press , Bar , and Parliament '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- ought to be one of the sprightliest volumes of the season .

		It is not and does not profess to be an auto - biography ; it is a collection of anecdotes con - cerning illustrious and other persons known or at least met with by the writer , the
Hon. M. McD	ORGANIZATION	.


Bodkin	PERSON	,
K. C.	PERSON	, in his varied activities as journalist , at the bar , on the bench , and in
Parliament	LOCATION	.

		Descended from the Bodkins of
Galway	LOCATION	, he has evidently inherited the quick - ness of wit that one expects to find in every true son of
Erin	PERSON	; for have we not his own testimony to that effect in his book ?

		Here is a parliamentary incident of which the narra - tor was the hero : `` On one occasion Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	, of
Ballykilbeg	LOCATION	, whose comic bigotry was a source of perennial amusement , ob - jected .

		.

		to the use in primary schools of the book containing
Moore	PERSON	's song , ` Row , brothers , row , ' on the ground that its allusion to ` saints of our own green isle ' inculcated the worship of saints .

		Before the Minister could reply I popped up with a supplemen - tary question . '

		Is the right honourable gen - tleman aware , ' I asked , with a face as grave as a mustard-pot , ` that in the intermediate schools and universities they require the study of an alleged poet named Homer , who encourages the worship of

		and `` the uproarious laughter of the
House	ORGANIZATION	'' told him he had scored .

		Portraits , including the author 's in the frontispiece , abound .

		Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's ideas about literary art rather than a work the great war .

		Qf j n f ormat i on or disCUSSion , Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	's '' The Pentecost of Calam - ity '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- differs from most of the books dealing with the present war .

		The style throughout is keyed up to the pitch of the somewhat apocalyptic title .

		Much skill is shown in the disposition of the material .

		Mr.
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 381
Wister	PERSON	, who was in
Germany	LOCATION	shortly before the war began , tells first of the delightful impressions made on him by the smiling order - liness and smooth efficiency of life there .

		But months and years before this , as he now be - lieves ,
Germany	LOCATION	had been crouching for her
spring	DATE	.

		In his opinion , she had been mad - dened by self-esteem , the mania of grandeur complemented by the mania of persecution .

		The Superman , the Superrace , and the Super - state were the new Trinity of her worship , and war became for her a sort of holy crusade .

		Then in a short chapter he gives a composite statement of Prussianism , compiled sentence by sentence from the utterances of the
Kaiser	PERSON	and some of his most illustrious subjects , which , it must be granted , goes far to confirm his thesis .

		There is very little discussion in the book , and perhaps no new fact is brought out unless it be the amazing confession , which the author ascribes to Prince Lich - nowsky , that the
Kaiser	PERSON	had sent him as ambassador to
England	LOCATION	to find out when the English were so embroiled in their own domes - tic troubles as to enable
Germany	LOCATION	to strike her blow on the Continent with impunity .

		Mr.
Wister	PERSON	ends by pointing out the special significance of the struggle for
America	LOCATION	, who , he thinks , can not stand aside with mute lips and folded arms while what he regards as the deadliest assault ever made on democracy is being perpetrated in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Desultory studies '' A Q ulet p m * Library , '' in four by Mr.
William Henry Hudson	PERSON	, wooes the reader by its title and wins him by its agreeable contents .

		Four authors are discussed in as many chapters .

		They are
Thomas Hood	PERSON	,
Henry Carey	PERSON	,
George Lillo	PERSON	, and
Samuel Richardson	PERSON	.

		The Lillo paper gives a foretaste of a more elaborate work , now nearing completion , on ''
George Lillo	PERSON	and the Middle Class Drama of the Eighteenth Century '' ; the article on Hood is expanded from a lecture prepared many years ago for
California	LOCATION	hearers ; but nothing in the book has before been printed .

		Good read - ing will be found between the covers of this compact little volume , even though there is nothing in the subjects chosen or the treat - ment of them to give promise of novelty .

		But a certain freshness of interest felt by the writer is likely to communicate itself to the reader .

		In his thirty-three pages on
Henry Carey	PERSON	, Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	rather unaccountably omits all mention of the one production that in some if not in many minds is most nearly associated with that oddly gifted genius .

		Though the authorship of '' God Save the King '' is ascribed to
Carey	PERSON	without conclu - sive proof , yet it is thus generally ascribed , and to tell his story without the slightest ref - erence to that famous anthem is somewhat like narrating the life of
Newton	LOCATION	with no allusion to the law of gravitation .

		It is even asserted by Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	that of all
Carey	PERSON	's works , '' the one which , leaving ' Sally in Our Alley ' out of the question , has done most to preserve his name from oblivion .

		.

		is ' Chro - , nonhotonthologos . ' ''

		It is a good and schol - arly book , however , and its closing chapter , on
Richardson	PERSON	, is perhaps the best of the four .

		-LRB-

		the W0rld is becoming income in the wealthier no one denies .

		But it
United States	LOCATION	.

		f , , j , i .

		, , is often asserted that while the rich are growing richer , the poor are growing poorer .

		In his volume entitled '' The Wealth and Income of the People of the United States '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Dr.
Willford Isbell King	PERSON	defines wealth and income , and dis - cusses the distribution of wealth and of in - come in this country among the factors of production , corporations , and families .

		The book is based upon a careful study of various sources , both public and private .

		The author does not claim mathematical exactness for his conclusions , but believes that they are approx - imately correct .

		Good evidence is produced to show that '' since
1876	DATE	there has occurred a marked concentration of income in the hands of the very rich ; that the poor have lost , relatively , but little ; but that the mid - dle class has been the principal sufferer . ''

		In some cases the poorest four-fifths of the popu - lation own scarcely ten per cent of the total wealth , while the richest two per cent own almost three-fifths .

		Whether the individual is to be regarded as a gainer by this condition of affairs will depend upon the answers offered to a number of questions of economic and social import .

		- The facts gathered are interesting in themselves , and are presented in an orderly way , subject to some criticism of details .

		A primer of animal psychology .

		Interest at large in the seem - ingly intelligent behavior of animals has received fresh im - petus from the remarkable performances of the clever '' thinking horses '' of Elberfeld in
Germany	LOCATION	and of '' Captain '' in this country .

		These performances range from the doing of simple sums in arithmetic to the reputed ex - traction of the roots of large numbers .

		Some horses , on the other hand , exhibit an apti - tude for spelling .

		Mr.
E. M. Smith	PERSON	, in his `` Investigation of Mind in Animals '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- , dismisses at once the suggestions of 382 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 28	DATE	telepathy , an unknown sense , and of fraud as adequate explanations .

		He analyzes the evi - dence , put forward by
Pfungst	PERSON	and others , of unconscious involuntary signs on the part of the interrogator -LRB- who is generally the trainer of the horse -RRB- , such as infinitesimal move - ments of the head or eyes which give the horse his cue .

		He cites as militating against this explanation the success of blinded horses , the marked individual preferences of the horses , the nature of the errors made , and the evidences of indecision in the replies .

		On the whole , he believes that the evidence tends to discountenance the sign theory ; but that , with a few notable and as yet unexplained exceptions , all of the feats so far achieved might be accounted for by association , involv - ing an excellent memory but not certainly any rational process .

		The booklet is a brief and inadequate summary of the main facts and theories regarding the evolution of intel - ligence among animals , from the lowest to the highest , as evidenced by behavior .

		The au - thor avoids extensive considerations of the much debated tropism theory , and fails to utilize a wide range of available and valuable material from the insect world .

		Bitsoftra aedv The '' `` Woman Homesteader '' and romance known to the many lortunate West ' readers of her published `` Let - ters '' continues her vivid sketches of
Wyo	LOCATION	- ming life in further communications to her '' dear Mrs.
Coney	PERSON	, '' and this time the packet of letters is entitled `` Letters on ' an Elk Hunt '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It was on or during the hunting excursion of two months in the au - tumn of
1914	DATE	that the letters were written , not about the hunt , except a few pages ; and thus it is that so much of the writer 's well-known skill in depicting character and incident finds room for exercise .

		Humor and pathos , trag - edy and comedy , romance and realism , suc - cessively enrich these unstudied accounts of every-day persons and events amid the hard conditions of the western frontier .

		Mrs.
Stewart	PERSON	has a genius for discovering heroic characters in humble life , and for making her readers feel that heroism .

		She can also pre - sent the amusing or otherwise interesting side of any man , woman , or child not hopelessly devoid of interest .

		Her great-hearted Mrs.
O'Shaughnessy	PERSON	and sturdily unromantic Mrs.
Louderer	PERSON	reappear in this book , and new friends are introduced , including two prom - ising youngsters that Mrs.
O'Shaughnessy	PERSON	feels irresistibly moved to adopt on the jour - ney .

		To what extent -LRB- if any -RRB- Mrs.
Stewart	PERSON	had designs on a book-reading and book - buying public in writing this second series of letters , is a matter of conjecture ; but her pages have the freshness and naturalness that one looks for in the friendly correspondence of a bright and observant woman .

		If you ca n't see the difference , m. asks the pragmatist , what is the difference ?

		And , conversely , wherever there is a difference , this same prag - matist emphatically proclaims , distinguo .

		` To such a series of distinguo 's Dr.
H. M. Kallen	PERSON	is led after a searching analysis and com - parison of the Jamesian and the Bergsonian philosophies .

		For this task the author , who was for several years in intimate contact with
James	PERSON	, and who edited
James	PERSON	's unfinished '' Some Problems in Philosophy , '' is eminently fitted .

		In his ``
William James	PERSON	and
Henri Bergson	PERSON	: A Study in Contrasting Theories of Life '' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Dr.
Kal	PERSON	- len argues that
James	PERSON	's , and not
Bergson	PERSON	's , is the theory of life that '' faces forward '' ; that in their Weltanschauung , in the intuitional and the pragmatic methods , and in the result - ing implications about God , the universe , and man , the two philosophies , despite current near-identification , are fundamentally and diametrically opposed .

		These challenging conclusions Dr.
Kallen	PERSON	expounds , for the
Packman	PERSON	, with painstaking detail ; for the layman , with a captivating style ; for both , with the zeal of the disciple .

		Mr.
Arthur Machen	PERSON	more than half slls P ects that the recent crop of legends concerning sun - dry miraculous occurrences in the critical retreat from
Mons	LOCATION	may all have sprung from seed of his own sowing , in the shape of a little story that he wrote and sent to a
London	LOCATION	newspaper in the early days of the war .

		This fanciful tale now reappears as the first in a little book of stories , '' The Bowmen , and Other Legends of the War '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , all by Mr.
Machen	PERSON	, and all in similar vein , par - taking of the supernatural and appealing to the credulous reader 's love of the miraculous .

		The Bowmen in question are ghostly archers led to the rescue of the hard-pressed English by
England	LOCATION	's patron saint .

		Such tales of celestial succor seem to have spread from one end of the Anglo-French battle-line to the other , and it appears more likely that they are all traceable to the peculiar horror , the stupen - dous magnitude and unspeakable awfulness .

		of the titanic struggle , than to any single invention .

		But the curious in such matters will enjoy Mr.
Machen	PERSON	's argumentative introduc - tion and postscript .

		The book is a slight pro- duction , but of considerable present interest .

		430 THE LYEIC LORD .

		Of all forms of verse , the lyric alone still remains in the ascendant .

		It does not ex - actly keep the zenith , nor is it allowed to burn clear and unobscured .

		But it is at least aloft in the literary sky , whereas the epic , the poetic drama , the narrative poem , and the ballad are muffled in clouds on the horizon .

		Poetry in lyric roles is still allowed to flaunt itself a courtier of the sun ; though of course it is not quite equal to the aldermanic or beadle-like figures of prose .

		In its other forms , however , it is a Belisarius begging for obols in the shadow .

		How shall we account for the popularity , or at least the permitted existence , of the lyric ?

		That it is brief may have something to do with it . ''

		'T is a very excellent piece of work ; would ' t were done ! ''

		says the ennuied
Christopher Sly	PERSON	; and the modern intellectual helot echoes him in regard to long poems .

		But the short story and the essay have not displaced the novel , the history , the book of travels or biography .

		Poe thought that a long poem was impossible because it could not be read at a sitting , and so must lose its totality of effect .

		But what we can read at a sitting depends on the character of our minds and the interest of the piece of work itself .

		Most of us have often sat up nights to get through some enthralling novel three times as long as the '' Iliad '' or '' Paradise Lost . ''

		Mere brev - ity will hardly explain the lyric 's hold on the public mind .

		The fact is that lyrical poetry is usually the expression of emotion , and the capacity for emotion is universal .

		Anyone can recog - nize a natural feeling or instinctive mood of the soul put into words ; whereas the ordered designs and logical sequences of the drama or narrative poem require thought and labor to understand .

		Again , the movement and the music of lyrical poetry are as a rule more apparent , more obvious , though not loftier or nobler , than those of the continuous verse forms .

		Even the great mass of the unmusical like to hum or whistle some short recollected air : we do not expect of them the intelligence or effort to appreciate
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	or
Brahms	PERSON	.

		402 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 11	DATE	Its emotional quality and its lively or striking musical accent would therefore seem to be the secrets of such hold as the lyric retains .

		It has been said that with a thorough knowledge of the Bible and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Gibbon	PERSON	's ``
Rome	LOCATION	'' a man would be educated .

		We do not think that the study of lyrical poetry would amount to a liberal education .

		Too much of the spectacle of life , its intellect and action , would be left out .

		But for the training and stimulation of the emotions , lyrical poetry alone would very nearly suffice .

		What feelings , what instincts , are there , which have not been perfectly expressed by it ?

		Religious ecstasy , patriotism , martial ardor , love in all its moods , hope , joy , resignation , the beckonings of nature , the brotherhood of man , all the agitations and intoxications which lift and sweep us out of dulness and routine , ring from the vibrant chords of the lyric lyre .

		If we should say that a lyric is primarily a gush of emotion , more vivid in picture and more vital in movement than other verse forms , we should perhaps define its central type .

		This would exclude narration and character creation , and also overmuch medita - tion .

		But it is a question whether the ballad is or is not a lyric .

		The odes of
Pindar	ORGANIZATION	are full of mythological episodes .

		Some of the so-called Homeric hymns are pure narrative .

		Dry den 's `` Alexander 's Feast '' is a story .

		And the sonnets of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Tennyson	PERSON	's '' In Memoriam , '' and a multitude of other pieces usually classed as lyrical , are weighted with the profoundest meditation .

		Thus do art forms elude limitations .

		Taking the world over , the variety of lyric forms is very great .

		By means of the chorus it interpenetrated the Greek drama .

		The Book of Job and the
Song of Solomon	ORGANIZATION	are half lyrical and half dramatic .

		Dante 's great trilogy is more like a lyric than an epic poem .

		Every race has its own lyrical forms .

		In the time of the Irish Bards , or of the Trou - badours and Minnesingers , men must have put in as much time in metrical invention as we give to the making of machines .

		In English poetry the lyric falls into four or five great divisions , the ode , the somewhat related forms of the elegy and the epithalamium , the song , and the sonnet .

		There are , of course , minor forms , such as the religious hymn , the epigram , and possibly others .

		The stanzaic and the irregular ode are the two species of this form in English .

		The first of these is of two sorts , the pure Pindaric ode , with its strophe , antistrophe , and epode ; and the ode where but one stanzaic form is repeated throughout .

		Gray 's `` Bard '' and `` Progress of Poetry '' are the only famous Pindaric odes in the language .

		Cowley made an awful mess of the business , and
Shelley	PERSON	muddled it still further .

		The latter poet puts his epode before his strophe , and makes no attempt to repeat the metres of the three divisions .

		To the trained mind , there is some - thing inexplicably pleasing in the regulated motion of the three parts of the poem , re - peated , as they usually are , two or three times .

		The strophe is like a line of figures in a dance , moving toward the spectator ; in the anti- strophe they retrace their steps , and in the epode they break up into lively groups .

		The stanzaic form of ode is very much more common in English , and it boasts by far the greatest number of successes .

		Such include
Milton	PERSON	's `` Ode on the Nativity , '' Gray 's `` Eton College '' and the `` Hymn to Adversity , ''
Wordsworth	PERSON	's `` Ode to Duty , ''
Shelley	PERSON	's '' Skylark , ''
Keats	PERSON	's '' Grecian Urn '' and '' Ode to a Nightingale , '' and scores of others .

		The irregular ode also seems natural to English poets , though the triumphs in it are much fewer than in the stanzaic form .

		Words - worth 's `` Intimations '' is the greatest of these , and
Dryden	PERSON	's `` Alexander 's Feast , ''
Collins	PERSON	's `` Passions '' and `` Liberty , ''
Tennyson	PERSON	's `` Death of
Wellington	LOCATION	, '' and
Lowell	PERSON	's `` Commemora - tion Ode '' the other pieces of high rank .

		The form is `` free verse '' with a vengeance : the writer changes the length of his stanza or lines , and their rhythm and movement , as his mood dictates .

		Theoretically , this ought to consort with '' poetic frenzy '' ; but the human mind prefers the circumscribed and the sym - metrical , and discipline usually wins out over lawlessness .

		Of the great English elegies ,
Milton	PERSON	's `` Lycidas '' can scarcely be called irregular .

		It is a mighty gush of music , breathed forth almost without stop , written in smooth-slip - ping couplets and quatrains with only the occasional break of a short line .

		The other best known pieces of this kind ,
Shelley	PERSON	's `` Adonais , '' Arnold 's '' Thyrsis , ''
Tennyson	PERSON	's `` In Memoriam , ''
Swinburne	PERSON	's `` Ave atque Vale , '' are stanzaic in form .

		The rarity of
1915	DATE	-RSB- 403 great wedding songs in the language would seem to imply that our writers of the English tongue did not hold the marriage state in high regard ; but we suspect that the lack is due rather to their reticence about that relation .

		Spenser 's two pieces are the only famous epi - thalamia that come to mind ; though perhaps Suckling 's sparkling `` Ballad of a Wedding '' could properly be classed with this genre .

		It is plain that what we have been describ - ing are lofty and elaborate performances of the
Muse	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lyrical they are , but they are not central in their type .

		The song is really the norm of lyrical poetry .

		It is not only capable of being sung , as the longer works scarcely are , but it answers better to the instinctive and emotional qualities of the form .

		If this is so , then
Burns	PERSON	is certainly the central lyrist of our language , and possibly of the race .

		No lyrical poet in the world outranges him .

		Passion , pathos , heroic ardor , pure imagina - tion , fun , satire , and world-upsetting humor are all within his compass .

		It is a curious fact that more of his songs have been set to music and widely sung than of any other really great poet .

		As a rule , composers seem to fight shy of words which would compete in effect with their tones .

		Shakespeare ,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Tennyson	PERSON	come next in their count of song successes .

		Perfect and lovely and varied as their pieces are , there is a touch of art , of brain-work , in them which makes them just a trifle set and artificial as compared with the purely instinctive and natural utterances of Burns .

		The Elizabethan dramatists and lyrists , the Cavalier poets , the Scottish minor poets ,
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	, Sir
Walter	PERSON	himself , whose wealth of lyric poetry is scarcely realized by the world , hidden as it is in the mass of his work , these and scattered writers through the ages have added vastly to the English stock of lyrical poetry .

		One good song has been found enough for an immortality .

		The Irish poets ,
Moore	PERSON	,
James Clarence Mangan	PERSON	, and
George Darley	PERSON	, are melodists and pas - sionists of the first water .

		Barley 's ``
Innis	PERSON	- f alien '' is one of the great war lyrics of the language .


Emily Bronte	PERSON	's half a dozen fine lyrics give her precedence among the women poets ; they are as intense as
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	's frag - ments , though they have not
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	's perfec - tion of picture .

		Poe fused the Irish gift of melody and the Welsh gift of picture , and his dozen or so lyrical pieces are unsurpassed .

		He does not possess
Burns	PERSON	's immense range , otherwise he might stand side by side with the latter .

		The sonnet draws away from the central lyric type on the side of meditation , as much as the ode and elegy do on the side of narra - tive and description .

		Yet such sonnets as
Milton	PERSON	's `` Avenge , Lord , thy slaughtered hosts '' and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's '' Let me not to the marriage of true minds '' ring out like trum - pet notes .

		The first question about the sonnet is one of form .

		Which is best , the Italian or the Shakespearean model ?

		Two such high judges of verse as
Tennyson	LOCATION	and
Palgrave	PERSON	gave the preference to the latter .

		And
Scho	PERSON	- penhauer , in his greatest philosophical work , devotes a page to proving the superiority of the Italian form .

		Roughly speaking , this form tends to the abstract ; the Shakespearean , to the concrete .

		The former is likely to go off into sound , while the latter turns into picture .

		The sonnet is a small thing , it has not even the ordinary length of a song in which to develop itself , and it must therefore be con - centrated .

		Now concentration is best secured by vividness of image .

		To our mind , at least , there are about fifty of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's son - nets which have more of this concentration and vividness than any others .

		Yet
Keats	PERSON	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	occasionally reach an equal objectivity .

		In
Rossetti	PERSON	's , which are the best regular sonnets of recent times , the concen - tration is overdone .

		They become vague and monotonous by too much particularity .

		They are so rich in image that they surfeit us , like a cake which is all plums .

		A rich sim - plicity , that is the ideal which the sonnet - writer should aim at .

		Perhaps it is the ideal of all art .

		There have been many attempted innovations in the number and order of rhymes of the sonnet ; but no one has yet improved upon the two great forms .

		The Italians have a form of sonnet con coda , with a tail , which has never been naturalized in English .

		It may be said in favor of the lyric that it is essential poetry .

		It does something that can not be done in prose .

		The creative mind can work with the latter material , though it loses a good deal by putting off the wings and cloud-apparel of verse .

		The prose epic , the novel , and the prose drama may be very great ; but the prose lyric practically does not exist .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 11	DATE	LITERARY AFFAIRS IN
LONDON	LOCATION	, THE AUTUMN PUBLISHING SEASON .

		NEW WORK OF THE YOUNGER ENGLISH POETS .

		BACON versus SHAKESPEARE ONCE MORE .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The autumn publishing season has opened here .

		It will be a flat affair .

		One or two of the lesser houses have increased their output , and are pouring forth floods of cheap novels ; but most of the lists are much shorter than usual , and one of the most important firms in
England	LOCATION	presents a list only a quarter of the normal length .

		From publishers and book - sellers alike I gather that the reduction is fully justified by the falling-off in sales .

		The lighter novels are selling well , and the minute sales of poetry are less minute than usual .

		But the demand for war books except for the class in which the future settlement is seriously discussed has dropped almost to nothing -LRB- for one can not go on reading for ever the same remarks about Huns and Kultur -RRB- ; and all kinds of '' heavy '' books are unsaleable .

		The purely decorative books the bibliophile 's book and the expensive illus - trated edition have naturally gone the way of all luxuries .

		The new Budget has given them the coup de grace .

		Little of interest , in fact , may be expected to issue from this side during the present season .

		About the most interesting of the announce - ments , to my mind , is that of a second volume of `` Georgian Poetry . ''

		The first volume of this anthology of the work of certain of our younger poets appeared three years ago ; and its success has been so great that its editor -LRB- who half-conceals his identity under the qualified anonymity of the initials `` E. M. '' -RRB- has compiled another .

		I do not know exactly what material he has got together this time ; but if the new collection is as good as the old it should be very useful .

		For the majority even of intelligent readers have as yet no idea at all of the profusion of good poetry which was produced in
England	LOCATION	during the ten or twelve years before the war .

		You may put aside the most distinguished of the long - established poets , Mr. Bridges , Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	, `` A. E. , '' and Mr.
A. E. Housman	PERSON	, none of whom has done much in recent years ; and you may also put aside Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, who , having deserted fiction , is writing in his green old age lyrics of extreme originality full of a new music .

		There still remains a body of writers whose work would entitle this age to consider itself richly productive .

		Rupert Brooke and
James Elroy Flecker	PERSON	have , un - happily , died young since '' Georgian Poetry '' appeared ; but Mr.
Sturge Moore	PERSON	, Mr.
W. H. Davies	PERSON	, and Mr.
Walter	PERSON	de la Mare are still writing , and none of them has passed early middle age .

		Not one of these men , perhaps , can be called a great poet ; they are all of them , if you care for classifications , in the ranks of the lesser immortals .

		But each of them unlike those poetic aftermaths of the mid-nineteenth century who are so well-known on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	is original and individual , and their work is very varied .

		Mr.
Sturge Moore	PERSON	, the one man of our time who can write on classical subjects without writing at second-hand , is best read in bulk : except in a few poems like '' The Gazelles '' an unfamiliar reader will never get his quality out of a selection .

		Mr.
Davies	PERSON	, on the other hand , has written about three hundred `` nature - poems '' ; of which , say , forty are perfect , as many others rather taking , and the rest imita - tions of his better self .

		Mr. de la Mare has not written very much verse , but if '' The Listen - ers , '' `` Arabia , '' and a dozen other of his lyrics do not last , posterity will not know its busi - ness ; and
Rupert Brooke	PERSON	and Flecker , had they lived , might have done very fine things , for they both had , everything else apart , un - usual intellects , the full powers of which they had only begun to apply .

		All these poets were represented in the Georgian Book ; and others , such as Mr.
Gordon Bottomley	PERSON	-LRB- who has written a few extraordinarily fascinating things -RRB- , and Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	, whose `` Biog - raphy '' -LRB- which was included -RRB- is a much bet - ter poem than those celebrated narratives in which he held the mirror up to the flabber - gasted populations of rural
England	LOCATION	.

		I would not be misunderstood .

		I do not think that everything in the Georgian Book was good , for there were certainly a few bad poems and a few unnecessary names in the book .

		And I am far from contending that there is as yet any evidence that this genera - tion has been , or will be , as fruitful as that which was illuminated by -LRB- though it did not , in most cases , purchase -RRB-
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Cole	PERSON	- ridge ,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	, and
Byron	PERSON	.

		But there was before the war an unmistakable stir in the air , a new atmosphere of keenness , a new intellectual fervor , and a strongly marked tendency on the part of the most sensitive and intelligent of the young men to dedicate them - selves to verse rather than to any other me - dium of expression .

		This last tendency was and is so obvious that it is the commonest thing to hear people asking whence on earth the next group of good novelists is to come .

		The Shakespeare-Bacon controversy seems to have resolved itself into a struggle of
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 405 M. P. 's .

		Sir
Edwin Burning-Lawrence	PERSON	has died , so the Conservative benches at
Westmin	ORGANIZATION	- ster are no longer graced by the intrepid scholar Avho found irrefutable proof of
Bacon	LOCATION	's authorship in the fact that one of '' Shakespeare 's '' characters said something very like `` hie , haec , hog , '' and in the still more staggering fact that the initial letters of three consecutive Shakespearean lines are P , I , G .

		But the remaining protagonists in the fight -LRB- at any rate as far as the English Front is concerned -RRB- are both Members of Par - liament .

		One is Mr.
J. M. Robertson	PERSON	and the other Mr.
George Greenwood	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	is one of the most energetic , versatile , and per - tinacious men in the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	; and , one is bound to add , one of the most acrimo - nious of our controversialists .

		He began pub - lic life as assistant to the late
Charles Brad	PERSON	- laugh , the Colonel Ingersoll of
Europe	LOCATION	; and for many years he spent his whole time in the congenial atmosphere of hopeless minorities .

		He was a Socialist before Socialism became fashionable ; a Rationalist before Atheism be - came fashionable .

		He venomously attacked `` Joe ''
Chamberlain	PERSON	at the height of that statesman 's popularity ; and the time which he could spare from politics and the fight for religious free-speech he employed in demon - strating to his own satisfaction , with all the apparatus of mythological research , that Jesus Christ was not merely not God but had never even existed .

		The most heterodox of us , however , has a w r eak spot somewhere : and the '' soundness '' of Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's opinions on literature is impeccable .

		As for the accu - racy of the ascription of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays to the gentleman whom Sir
Edwin Burning	PERSON	-
Lawrence	PERSON	used invariably to denounce as `` the drunken , illiterate clown of
Stratford	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	is shocked , appalled , when anyone questions it .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	is grim .

		He devotes to lit - erature all the seriousness and industry that he used to devote to the rites of Osiris and Mithra and he was at the
Board of Trade	ORGANIZATION	when holding office in the late Liberal Gov - ernment to the exports and imports of Tientsin and the
Bahamas	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	, on the other hand , is a cheerful soul .

		His chief political hobby has been a long cam - paign against `` blood-sports '' and the de - struction of wild-life , and he has even infused a certain vivaciousness into this .

		His line in the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	controversy is a wary one .

		He does not claim
Bacon	PERSON	as the Swan -LRB- or shall we , with Sir
Edwin	PERSON	, say the Hog ? -RRB-

		of
Avon	LOCATION	.

		He does not know who wrote the plays .

		All he knows is that
Shakespeare	PERSON	did not .

		Some years ago he formulated his views in a large volume , '' The Shakespeare Problem Restated . ''

		To this Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	replied in another large tome entitled -LRB- the expositor of a hundred heresies must have found a deli - cious savour in the name -RRB- '' The Baconian Heresy . ''

		Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	has now counter - attacked in six hundred closely printed pages of a book which he calls `` Is There a Shake - speare Problem ? ''

		`` Let us hope there is , '' one feels inclined to say , aghast at the thought that all this laboring may have been totally superfluous .

		It is a readable , good-tempered , and sensible piece of argument .

		The author returns once more to the questions of Shake - speare 's learning and his law , with the conclu - sion that he was a learned lawyer ; he discusses his will , his handwriting , his name , his portraits , and his knowledge of '' Nature , '' which he contends , with some force , to have been rather that of the gentleman who knows his hounds , hawks , and horses well and other birds and beasts not so well , than that of the person who stalks the blackbird and the but - tercup in their native haunts .

		It is all one to me . ''

		I do n't care where the water goes if it does n't get into the wine , '' sings Mr.
Chester	PERSON	- ton in one of his most earnest lyrics ; and for myself I do n't care what the critics say if they leave the plays intact .

		But Mr.
Green	PERSON	- wood 's book , if you enjoy this perennial dis - pute at all , is well worth reading .

London	LOCATION	,
October 20 , 1915	DATE	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE AUTONOMOUS UNIVERSITY is an educa - tional ideal , never to be fully realized outside of
Utopia	LOCATION	, although presenting itself as an inviting possibility in countries far less favored than that pattern republic .

		In the
State of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	there has for four years been in preparation a plan for a greater measure of efficient self-government on the part of the
State University	ORGANIZATION	; and a constitution with that end in view has finally been drafted by a committee of professors and other officers of that institution , and now awaits formal action from the proper authorities .

		In 107 clauses , filling seventeen octavo pages , this scheme of internal administration is carefully developed , with three additional pages of tentative sug - gestion , the whole prefaced by a , detailed '' historical statement '' from Professor
Henry B. Ward	PERSON	, chairman of the committee .

		Among notable items in this
Magna Charta	LOCATION	from
Urbana	LOCATION	-
Champaign	LOCATION	, a document too long to be even summarized here , attention may be called to the following as of considerable sig - 406 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 11	DATE	nificance : '' In the election or re-election of a president ,
the University Senate	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- in a gen - eral way , the Faculty -RSB- shall be represented by members of its own selection on the nomi - nating committee of the
Board of Trustees	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		No nomination of a college dean shall be effec - tive without '' a majority vote of the profes - sors and associate professors in the college faculty , voting by ballot . ''

		Direct access to the
Board of Trustees	ORGANIZATION	on the part of profes - sors and other university officers , in matters concerning their work or their relations to the university , is made possible , `` upon formal application '' and '' provided that such mat - ters have first been presented to the President without receiving his approval . ''

		Nomina - tions to teaching positions shall , in general terms , originate with the department con - cerned .

		`` Academic freedom in the pursuit and teaching of knowledge shall be main - tained . ''

		Activities `` incompatible with the proper performance of his duties in the Uni - versity '' may not be engaged in by any mem - ber of the academic or administrative staff .

		But who is to determine what is '' incompati - ble '' ?

		Retirement pensions are provided for .

		Amendments to the constitution shall be pro- posed by the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	or referred to that body for consideration and recommendation ; and not until then shall they be passed upon by the
Board of Trustees	ORGANIZATION	.

		President
James	PERSON	in - vites outside discussion of the proposed con - stitution , copies of which , we infer , may be obtained on request .

		IMPLACABLE FOES TO FICTION have risen in their might , or in their impotence , in the city of
New York	LOCATION	, and are demanding that the public library shall cease to provide novels for the amusement of the people .

		This , at least , is the recommendation or suggestion of the head of the municipal
Bureau of Statistics and Investigation	ORGANIZATION	, which of course is not actu - ated exclusively by a tender concern for public morals , but chiefly by a desire to effect economy in the city 's finances ; and the old cry against the frivolity if not the actual wickedness of novel-reading is raised in sup - port of the proposed measure .

		No disastrous , outcome from this agitation need be feared by
New York	LOCATION	novel-readers , since the enter - tainment-providing function of the public library is too generally recognized and ap - proved to be discontinued .

		But the incident arouses discussion and a rehearsal of the old arguments for and against the story-book and its right of admission to the people 's library .

		More than sixty years ago
George Ticknor	PERSON	, who was a member of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	's first
Board of Trustees	ORGANIZATION	and was appointed one of a committee to draw up a plan for the proposed library , urged the desirability of providing a generous supply of copies of `` the more respectable of the popu - lar books of the time , '' so that `` many per - sons , if they desire it , can be reading the same work at the same moment . ''

		Wholesome fic - tion was evidently included by him in this class .

		The protest against `` trashy novels , '' so often raised by those who think the library too liberal in its provision of fiction , is one that few library officials can listen to with patience ; for is it not the earnest endeavor of these officials to bar out the trashy novel ?

		And are they not in general succeeding as well as the obvious difficulties of the problem will permit ?

		On this head there appears a sane and well-informed utterance by Mr.
Edmund Lester Pearson	PERSON	in the
October	DATE	issue of '' Branch Library News , '' which he edits for the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		He takes occasion to quote from a letter of
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	's to
Edward Everett	PERSON	, in the same vein as the pas - sage cited above .

		Significant , too , are the statistics he gives of the circulation of stand - ard fiction , the recognized classics of romance .

		Despite the people 's unwisdom in clamoring for the very latest fiction , regardless of qual - ity , the public library ought not to be and will not be forbidden to furnish what
Ticknor	PERSON	called `` the pleasant literature of the day . ''

		ENTERPRISE IN THE PUBLISHING BUSINESS has recently exhibited a new and thought - provoking development .

		The publisher of a juvenile series of books which , he boldly asserts , are '' the most successful of their kind ever published , '' was approached last
summer	DATE	by a costume-maker in
New York	LOCATION	, for permis - sion to name a dress after the breezy young heroine of his best-sellers .

		The publisher , who presumably has not attained to his present measure of success without a sad realization of the relatively wide appeal that clothes make to the buying public , eagerly assented to the proposal of the costume-maker .

		Between them they worked out a plan whereby each purchaser of the costumer 's dress should , in return for her own name and that of five friends , be entitled to receive a free copy of whatever book in the publisher 's series she preferred .

		The names thus obtained are put upon the mailing list of both publisher and dressmaker , each of whom is carrying on an extensive campaign of advertising this sea - son .

		The manufacturer has a reasonable ex - pectation of selling ten thousand dresses , and this should ensure to the publisher at least twenty-five thousand new names , to which he is mailing special circulars .

		As a final coup
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 407 the publisher has issued a circular to retail book-sellers , offering - a dress to each of the fifteen salespeople who dispose of the greatest number of the titles in his series during the rest of the year .

		Salesmen are not excluded from the contest ; the suits they win will be fitted to their `` wives or daughters . ''

		`` We believe , '' concludes the circular , `` that this is something entirely new in the book-selling business , but it promises to prove exceed - ingly popular . ''

		Without doubt , it will be popular .

		Our astute publisher has seen the main chance ; he has put books , which nobody buys except under stress , into connection with clothes , which are bought casually and lav - ishly by the average American woman .

		And it is our women who buy books , when they are bought at all .

		HALF A CENTURY OF LIBRARY SERVICE , and in fact rather more than that , is credited to the account of the lately deceased
John Ed	PERSON	- mands , whose activity in his chosen profession began in
1846	DATE	at
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	, where for a year he had charge of the library of the
Society of Brothers in Unity	ORGANIZATION	, and where also from
1851	DATE	to
1856	DATE	he was assistant librarian of the college library .

		From
1856	DATE	to
1901	DATE	he guided the fortunes of the
Mercantile Library	ORGANIZATION	in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, being Librarian Emeritus at the time of his death .

		Significant of his bibliographic bent is the fact that in the very earliest months of his library service he pre - pared and published a small work that served as the germ of the later and much larger ''
Poole	PERSON	's Index . ''

		This was his list of '' Sub - jects for Debate , with References to the Authorities . ''

		He also compiled bibliogra - phies of the '' Letters of Junius '' and of the `` Dies Iras , '' drew up one of the first of the now somewhat numerous lists of historical prose fiction , devised a system of book-classifi - cation , and was a valued though not frequent contributor to periodical library literature .

		Memory recalls to the present writer the ven - erable figure of Mr.
Edmands	PERSON	presiding over some of the earlier meetings of the association of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	librarians formed by a group of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	library workers in the early nineties of the last century .

		He was the first president elected by that body , and his age and experience gave dignity and impressive - ness to its deliberations .

		A charter member also of the
A. L. A.	PERSON	, and one of its first vice - presidents , his name has long been familiar to the American library world .

		He furnished a conspicuous example of the sustaining power , physical and mental , of rather arduous intel - lectual pursuits continued considerably be - yond the scriptural threescore years and ten .

		THE SECRET OF SUCCESS IN MARTIAL VERSE IS not to be revealed in a dozen w r ords , nor yet in a hundred .

		Some glimmerings of the ele - ments of effectiveness in this variety of metri - cal composition may nevertheless be caught from an examination of the enduring exam - ples familiar to all the world .

		In no other form of poetry is the personal and the par - ticular , as contrasted with the general and the abstract , so sure of finding favor .

		`` My
Maryland	LOCATION	'' and the lines inspired by
John Brown	PERSON	's tragic fate are no vague appeals to patriotism .

		Even the `` Battle-Hymn of the Republic '' begins with a possessive pronoun denoting the first person singular .

		An English writer -LRB- Mr.
Arthur Waugh	PERSON	-RRB- on the subject of war poetry , in the current issue of the
London	LOCATION	`` Book Monthly , '' lays emphasis on this quality of personal appeal , and goes so far as to say that '' probably no single war - song ever exercised more influence in its time than
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	's republican .

		master - piece , and the appeal of that hymn will be found upon examination to be entirely per - sonal , embellished with a quantity of highly effective decoration which inflames the fancy without portraying actualities . ''

		Then he quotes the opening lines and calls attention to their personal touch combined with '' pure though noble rhetoric . ''

		He continues : '' There is great virtue in this ; indeed % it may be said to be the secret of the whole matter , so far as the achievement of war-poetry is concerned .

		The best war-songs are always those that speak straight to the individual .

		The best war-poetry is invariably subjective . ''

		It is true that lofty verse may be inspired by the general theme of armed strife , and it may be immeasurably finer poetiy than the favor - ite ballad of the camps and trenches ; but the martial lays that live in the hearts and on the lips of men are of the less abstract quality indicated above .


INDIA	LOCATION	'S FIRST LIBRARY EXHIBITION was held recently at
Mehsana	LOCATION	, in the
Kadi District of the State	ORGANIZATION	of
Baroda	LOCATION	; and '' The Library Mis - cellany '' -LRB- product of the enterprise of Mr.
B. M. Dadachanji	PERSON	, member of the
A. L. A.	PERSON	, now living in the city of
Baroda	LOCATION	-RRB- gives con - siderable space to a description of its notable features , with a view of the fine library build - ing that was the scene of the interesting event .

		Graphic representations of library progress in the
Kadi District	ORGANIZATION	, with pictures bf noted foreign libraries , including many in
America	LOCATION	, greeted the eye of the visitor , who was further instructed and entertained by cinematograph and stereopticon views , all illustrative of li - brary activity .

		`` Another specially noteworthy THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 11	DATE	feature of the exhibition , '' we read , '' was the children 's room , specially organized .

		There in cases were attractively arranged typical children 's books , such as ragbooks , picture books , artistically bound books , including the charming series of the Japanese fairy tales , as also various kinds of children 's game - and puzzle-boxes . ''

		It was , too , with all its variety of interest , a rather impromptu exhibition , hurriedly prepared in honor of an unexpected visit from the Maharaja of
Baroda	LOCATION	, who seems to be an exceedingly popular as well as actively beneficent potentate . ''

		The Library Miscellany '' gives in each issue detailed and highly encouraging accounts of library prog - ress in its own and other districts of
India	LOCATION	, but its fortunes , like those of many another periodical , - seem to have been adversely affected by the war .

		At any rate the number now at hand is dated ``
January & April , 1915	DATE	. ''

		denoting a merging of two quarterly issues into one half-yearly number .

		Bein , g a tri-lingual magazine , its publication is neces - sarily a rather arduous undertaking .

		A PATHETIC APPEAL TO BOOK-BUYERS takes the form of a volume , lately published in
London	LOCATION	, entitled '' The Blinded Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Gift Book , '' which the beneficiaries will never be able to read .

		All the profits from the sale of this volume are to be devoted to carrying on the work , inaugurated at '' St. Dunstans , ''
Regent	ORGANIZATION	's Park , of teaching the sightless unfortunates of the war such trades as will make them self-supporting in the future .

		Artists , poets , and prose-writers have liberally responded to the call to collaborate in the making of this gift book , and the con - tributors are said to include '' most of the best names in literature and art . ''

		Many of the illustrations are products of the four-color process , and are of great beauty , if report is to be trusted .

		Queen
Mary	PERSON	shows a most helpful interest in the work , which is also cordially received by less exalted purchasers .

		By issuing a very large edition the publishers , Messrs.
Jarrold	PERSON	& Sons , have kept the price down to three shillings .

		It is to be hoped that the book will be on sale in
America	LOCATION	as well as in
England	LOCATION	.

		APHORISTIC WISDOM commends itself to us in inverse proportion to our need of it .

		Impa - tient and self-confident youth is prone to regard all maxims as the feeble-foolish maun - derings of doddering old age ; while the hoary-headed sage , past the time for profiting by apophthegmatic counsels , prize these nug - gets of wisdom .

		The
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	issues to all members of its staff a `` Rule Book '' for their guidance , and on the inside of its covers are printed pithy bits of advice like the following : `` Do what you are paid for and then some ; it 's the ' then some ' that gets your salary raised . ''

		`` Folks that never do any more than they get paid for , never get paid for any more than they do . '' ''

		Some men are ground down on the grind - stone of life , while others get polished up .

		It - depends on their kind of stuff . '' ''

		You will never push yourself forward in this world by patting yourself on the back . '' ''

		The man who thinks he can learn nothing thinks a great truth . ''

		One need not be a head librarian or even a library assistant in order to have the capacity to appreciate and perhaps to derive benefit from these '' wise saws . ''

		A PRIZE COMPETITION FOR ESSAYISTS IS just announced , with the tidy sum of five thousand dollars as bait to lure the writers .

		The sub - ject of the prospective essays and the circum - stances attending the offer of the prizes are interesting , for more reasons than one .

		In brief , as reported in the daily press , Colonel
Gustave Pabst	PERSON	of
Milwaukee	LOCATION	, newly elected president of the
United States Brewers	ORGANIZATION	' Asso - ciation , made it known at the recent conven - tion of that body that the aforementioned sum of money was to be appropriated to stimulate literary and argumentative zeal in the treatment of the saloon problem .

		It will readily be believed that the presidential ad - dress was not lacking in eloquent tribute to
Gambrinus	ORGANIZATION	, and a careful reading of that address might advantageously precede the competitor 's effort to win one of the offered prizes ; just as a cold disregard of its tenor might , and probably would , result in no pecuniary addition to the essayist 's resources .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		MADAME TINAYEE 'S WAR NOVEL .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Some months ago I contributed to this depart - ment of your journal a brief review of the novels of
Madame Tinayre	ORGANIZATION	, in which I indicated the feminist trend in her work .

		She has recently issued a new book , '' La Veillee des Armes , '' which should be of interest to your readers .

		On the cover we read '' roman , '' but the dedication de - scribes the work more accurately as '' a mirror in which are reflected the familiar and the heroic aspects of a
Paris	LOCATION	which will never be seen again . ''

		The centring of the action about a few characters merely serves to heighten the human interest and pathos of the narrative .

		The author adds that none of her books '' owes less to imagination and depends less on literary artifice . ''

		We have , then , a poignant picture , or rather a photograph , of a
1915	DATE	THE DIAL 409 tiny corner of
Paris	LOCATION	, and never did a part better represent the whole , on
July 31	DATE	and
August 1 , 1914	DATE	.

		Whoever had the privilege of being in the city at that time has witnessed all that Madame Tinayre relates , and the dramatic simplicity of her narrative will make the scenes live again even for those who did not witness them .

		As '' a moment 's monument , '' the book deserves a place with
Sar	ORGANIZATION	- cey 's '' Siege de
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		The scene is laid in a quiet little street on the left bank of the
Seine	LOCATION	, inhabited by the petite bourgeoisie .

		Its denizens are charming , and the reader follows with keen interest the varying emo - tions of each one .

		We meet first the keeper of a newspaper stand , who flatly refuses to give change for a fifty franc note .

		Every new comer is promptly suspected of wishing to procure a little precious gold or silver under pretext of paying for his paper with a bill .

		Customers devour and com - ment upon the latest news as they stand before the booth .

		A veteran of
1870	DATE	mutters , ''
Bon Dieu	LOCATION	, must we go through that again ? ''

		A young man exclaims , as he spies two marauding cats , ' There 's some fresh meat for the siege ! ''

		Work - men discuss eagerly the loyalty of their brothers across the Rhine to the Socialist cause ; women , eager to lay by provisions for emergencies , com - plain of the crowds at the grocers ' , and of the greed of the dealers who have already raised prices .


Marie Pourat	PERSON	arrives to get the papers for her patrons ; she is a sturdy woman , slaving to give her two children a better chance in life than she has had .

		Though not given to gossip , for once as she performs her duties she relates the rumors of the morning to her late-rising employ - ers .

		A German firm was hidden behind the '' Maggi '' milk depots , and a plot to poison
Paris	LOCATION	had been discovered .

		Already crowds were smashing the windows of these unhappy dairies .

		Germans had been arrested trying to cross the frontier with enormous sums of gold .

		Marie goes iirst to the studio of
M. Frechette	PERSON	, an artist who cohabits scandalously with his models and is so sympathetic for all that !

		At the first glance over the paper he cries : ''
Hurrah	PERSON	!

		now we 'll escort the cubists -LSB- e. g. the
Munich	LOCATION	artists -RSB- to the fron - tier ! ''

		Marie carries the paper to
Simone Daves	PERSON	- nes , the heroine of the story , in so far as there is one .

		Her youth had been pinched and sad ; but two years before the scene opens , she had mar - ried a lieutenant , now an engineer in an aviation factory .

		Fleeting glimpses of their idyllic happi - ness are offered the reader .

		From the first , Fran - cois
Davesnes	PERSON	has been convinced that
Germany	LOCATION	wishes war .

		He says calmly that
France	LOCATION	will know how to accept it when it comes .

		From day to day his wife watches him become again what he has never ceased to be a soldier ; and she can not entirely repress her sadness .

		The following bit of dialogue may be cited , as it rang from one end of
France	LOCATION	to another in those terrible days : '' ' Then you must love me as one should love a soldier without weakness . ' '' '

		I will try , Francois ... ' '' ' You must be calm , wait , hope , accept destiny ... I shall only be truly strong if I feel you strong behind me .

		Until evening , dearest . ' ''

		| And so the story goes on , the same simplicity obtaining throughout .

		The men conceal their emo - tion under a stoic mask or with a jest , while the women try to love them as soldiers should be loved , that they may be truly strong .

		Here is no literary artifice ; it is photographic truth .

		Interesting are the recurring scenes which show the French people , torn asunder on the very eve of the conflict by the scandal of the
Caillaux	PERSON	case , rapidly welding together under the foreign menace .

		We see the police grow paternal , the Socialist laborers salute their superiors as they leave the work-shops , while one phrase rings through all classes : '' On ne pent pas devenir Prussiens ! ''

		The spirit of coolness in which the book is written is striking .

		Though all the characters are convinced that
Germany	LOCATION	wished the war , there is no expression of hatred for the enemy .

		The same was true of the
Paris	LOCATION	of
last August	DATE	.

		Perhaps the moment was too solemn for violent outbursts of feeling ; but no small credit is due to this author for having observed truth to the reality .

		The spirit of '' the new
Germany	LOCATION	'' is judged as follows : '' They are modern Germans .

		They dream only of material power , wealth , domination .

		They despise all that is not German , I have felt in them this strange mysticism , this cult of force , almost lyrie in its ex - pression , which has become the mental malady , the megalomania with which all their race is afflicted . ''

		In my previous review , I presented
Madame Tinayre	ORGANIZATION	as a perhaps over-ardent champion of feminism .

		I confess that on first seeing her new book , I feared to find something like the spirit of the recent play , '' War Brides . ''

		No such matter .

		The fact that the lot of the women who stay behind is more bitter than that of the men who fight is fully appreciated .

		The women feel a keen sense of wrong , all that the heroine of '' War Brides '' felt , as is shown by the following out - cry from a porter 's wife : '' ' It 's heart-breaking .

		We are n't cowards ; but when we have borne a child and suckled and reared him to manhood by our toil , and then they say to us : '' Now give him up , to be killed perhaps , and you will remain alone in your old age , you will have nothing ... , '' that breaks the heart ... it 's worse than death ... Ah !

		~ bon Dieu Seignerur !

		If there were women in the government , it would be over , all this warring !

		Soldiers fight the battles , but women bear the soldiers ... Between us , we 'd always come to an agreement to save our children .

		I ca n't believe that German mothers ' hearts are different from mine .

		. ' ''

		But in the final hour , la patrie en danger in - spires an idealism of sacrifice , each one his part ; and , as the author says in her dedication , '' the weakest among us felt throbbing in his mortal heart the eternal heart of
France	LOCATION	. ''

		A SOUTHERN TRIBUTE TO A NEGRO .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		There has been gross mistreatment of the negro in the South .

		Of this fact we are often and vehemently reminded .

		There has also been recog - nition , friendship .

		Of this fact , though more pleasant , we hear less .

		The kindlier relationship , 410 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 11	DATE	to be sure , has not gone wholly unproclaimed .

		White men in the South can not cease to be grate - ful to
Booker T. Washington	LOCATION	for reminding North - ern audiences that where a Southern negro has succeeded , in nine cases out of ten it is through the encouragement , goodwill , and financial assistance of some white neighbor .

		We should not ignore , as Mr.
Washington	PERSON	does not ignore , the wrongs , the grave problems ; but surely we should not close our eyes either to the understanding and cordial cooperation which so often exists between the two races .

		I subjoin a tribute to a negro which appeared editorially in the
Lynchburg	LOCATION	'' News '' on
October 10	DATE	.

		It is the more appropriate to your columns because the negro whose virtues are celebrated has long been a living force in one of the oldest of Southern educational institutions .

		To my knowl - edge the editorial has been read by housekeepers here in
Lexington	LOCATION	to their colored servants as an inspiration and a reminder that negro merits are perceived and acknowledged .

		THE PASSING OF
HENRY MARTIN	PERSON	.


Henry Martin	PERSON	, for more than half a century the colored janitor of
the University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, has ceased to walk the rounds of his daily duty ; sur - rendered his keys ; abandoned all temporal responsi - bilities and his place in the ranks of the living will know him no more .

		The man was widely known his passing will be widely noted with regret .

		You remember him .

		Mr.
Alumnus	PERSON	; you and your con - temporaries .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	used to know him ; so did Attorney General
Gregory	PERSON	; and
Secretary MeAdoo	ORGANIZATION	, and
Supreme Court Justice McReynolds	ORGANIZATION	, as did Mr.
Underwood	PERSON	and
Senator Martin	PERSON	, and
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	Page but why go on ?

		The roll is all too long , which embraces those of high or mediocre sta - tion in the current affairs of human life who knew
Henry Martin	PERSON	, and in knowing , honored him .

		How easily he can be summoned to the chamber of our memories , and there be visualized as we used to see .

		him a striking and pleasing figure of a man .

		Tall , erect , kindly visaged , with a nameless sort of ease and courtliness of carriage , which served an admira - ble setting for a noble soul that was
Henry Martin	PERSON	.

		We need no photograph to aid in the delineation .

		It may be truthfully said of '' Uncle
Henry	PERSON	, '' as he used to be affectionately called , that in high degree he exemplified the attributes of fidelity , courtesy and the sort of dignity which is as easily , instantly recog - nized as it is certain to command the tribute of high respect .

		He was naturally , unostentatiously the gen - tleman always .

		He was very true to his trust faithful in the performance of duty ; gentle of heart and yet equipped with an unassuming force of per - sonality that made distinct impression upon all with whom he came in contact .

		Besides ,
Henry Martin	PERSON	was a man of upright life ; clean of character ; scrupulous and vigilant in observing all polite ameni - ties .

		And so as he passed from one period of service to another , he grew into a sort of influence in the
University	ORGANIZATION	's life , which was of good import .

		We dare say that of all the many thousands of students who knew him , there was not one who did not see in
Henry Martin	ORGANIZATION	something to respect something in his manner , bearing , or in the outward manifestation of his heart to merit the unaffected esteem of others , regardless of their color .

		It is good to know that
Uncle Henry	ORGANIZATION	lived to a ripe old age ; that he discharged well and conscien - tiously all that was given him to do , and that in passing , he yet dies not in the kindly regard of Vir - ginia 's alumni who are now scattered throughout the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Even , Mr.
Alumnus	PERSON	, as he used to tip his hat to you and me as we passed him on the old walks or under the old arcades of the
University	ORGANIZATION	, so may we both now salute his memory with uncov - ered head this and besides this the throb of sadness in the heart .

		HAWTHORNE 'S SHORT STORIES IN
JAPAN	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have read with great pleasure and profit the article by Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	on '' The Best Short Stories '' in your issue for
Sept. 2	DATE	last .

		Of course , the selection made in such a case will depend , to some extent , upon the individual taste ; it would be quite difficult to eliminate entirely the subjective element in such a critical choice of '' the best . ''

		And yet the general '' rules for guidance '' in such a choice , as suggested by Mr.
Moore	PERSON	, are those which one would not over - rule .

		But I wish to raise a query concerning the application of one of those rules .

		I refer to the mention of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, whose short stories are all rejected on the ground that '' they have been stopped at the frontiers of other countries , '' and thus lack '' a certain universality , '' which is the requisite of the second rule .

		Now , I beg to submit that
Hawthorne	PERSON	's short stories have not all been stopped at the frontiers of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		If '' The Miraculous Pitcher '' is out of this court , because it is not exactly original but rather a kind of translation , '' The Great Stone Face '' is certainly original , and it has crossed the boundaries of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		I do not mean merely that it has been translated into Japanese ; I mean that it has proved '' capable of general acceptation '' in
Japan	LOCATION	by the Japanese and that it is somewhat popular here .

		This may be partly due to the fact that there is a counterpart in an old Japanese fairy-tale called '' The Matsuyama Mirror . ''

		And yet the latter is not well known to Japanese youth , who never fail to appreciate '' The Great Stone Face . ''

		Anyhow ,
Hawthorne	PERSON	's great short story has become a naturalized citizen in the Japanese school world . ''

		David Swan '' and '' The Ambitious Guest '' are also popular here .

		I write this not to dispute Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's general rules or even their special applications , but only to point out that one application -LRB- to
Hawthorne	LOCATION	-RRB- does not apply in the case of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		And I write this after several years of experience in using '' Twice-Told Tales '' as a text-book in English .

		Since writing the above , I have made inquiries of some of my Japanese colleagues , who are teach - ers of English , and find that I am supported , not only in my general contention , but even in my specific choice of stories .

		And one of them added that he liked ''
David Swan	PERSON	'' because it has '' a Japanese tone . ''

		For an
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	story to have an Oriental tone is a good proof of its univer - sality -

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 411 goohs .

		THE DIPLOMAT OF THE GOLJXEX RULE .

		* Few men of note in American life have | worked their way more deeply into the hearts j of their intimate associates than
John Hay	PERSON	.

		!

		When he chose to give of his personal affec - tion at all , he gave unstintingly and received i unstintingly in return .

		This innate tendency ; was doubtless powerfully developed by the fact that when hardly more than a boy he came under the influence of the most intimate daily association with the strong and tender nature of President Lincoln .

		And it was one j of his most lovable traits that the boy in him never died .

		The fresh , breezy jest , full of | youthful spirit , - keeps breaking out even dur - ing the closing year , after he had written the lines , '' At eve .

		when the dull wintry day is sped , I muse beside my fire 's faint-flickering glare Conscious of wrinkling face and whitening hair Of those who , dying young , inherited The immortal youthfulness of the early dead . ''

		It was only a year earlier than this that he had given to the
Ohio Society	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	the following humorous description of his origins : '' If I am not that altogether deplorable crea - ture , a man without a country , I am , when it comes to pull and prestige , almost equally bereft , as I am a man without a
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		I was born in
Indiana	LOCATION	, I grew up in
Illinois	LOCATION	, I was educated in
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, and it is no blame to that scholarly com - munity that I know so little .

		I learned my law in
Springfield	LOCATION	and my politics in
Washington	LOCATION	, my diplomacy in
Europe	LOCATION	,
Asia	LOCATION	and
Africa	LOCATION	.

		I have a farm in
New Hampshire	LOCATION	and desk-room in the
District of Columbia	LOCATION	.

		When I look to the springs from which my blood descends , the first ancestors I ever heard of were a Scotch man , who was half English , and a German woman , who was half French .

		Of my immediate progenitors , my mother was from
New England	LOCATION	and my father was from the South .

		In this bewilderment of origin and experience , I can only put on an aspect of deep humility in any gathering of favorite sons , and confess that I am nothing but an American . ''

		With his college course at
Brown	PERSON	, sur - rounded by men and women of culture and refinement , Hay imbibed an ardent apprecia - tion of the things of the mind , and developed an ambition for a literary career .

		But hin - drances came , which he chose , perhaps un - necessarily , to regard as decisive , and his cultivation of the muses was never more than * THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF JOHN HAY .

		By
William Roscoe Thayer	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		desultory .


Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	took him to task for desertion , thirty years ago . ''

		Such poetry as the blank - verse impromptu on Liberty shows the higher worth of a man who should rise above indifference , and the hindrance of his mood , and in these spiritless times take up the lyre again , nor fitfully touch the strings . ''

		This insinuation that it was lack of will power which kept Hay out of a great literary career was seconded , after his death , by Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, who expressed the opinion that in the literary work which he did do '' he avouched his ability to have done what he wished in literature if only he had wished it enough . ''

		That the mood and not the want of inborn ability was at fault in his failure to place his name among the very highest on the roll of American poets will probably be the final judgment in the case .

		But whether the country could well have spared him to the muses is another question , which will be more easily answered when the lapse of years shall have shown whether certain high ideals which he sought to engraft upon diplomacy have effected a connection vital enough to stand the douche of Prussic acid to which interna - tional relations are now being subjected .

		With no definite prospects which seemed to justify the devotion of his talents to letters , Hay turned to the law and entered the office of his uncle ,
Milton Hay	PERSON	, of
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Illi	PERSON	- nois .

		Here he soon met
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, who had recently gained fame throughout the land by his debate with
Douglas	PERSON	.

		Two years later ,
Lincoln	LOCATION	was in the
White House	ORGANIZATION	and Hay had begun his preparation for a states - man 's career by taking service as assistant to
John G. Nicolay	PERSON	, the President 's private secre - tary .

		During the four momentous years that followed , he was employed on many a delicate enterprise , such as feeling out the possibility of setting up loyal state governments in the South , or slipping across the river from
Niagara	LOCATION	and meeting informally the alleged agents of the Confederacy through whom
Greeley	PERSON	was making his famous and fatuous effort of the
summer of 1864	DATE	to put an end to the war .

		The contribution of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's great spirit to the impressionable mind and heart of Hay was of course immeasurable , but Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	's pages give ample evidence that the young Secretary , humble though his position was , made no insignificant contribution to the success of the most vitally important admin - istration ever seated in
Washington	LOCATION	' .

		After
Lincoln	PERSON	's death , Hay went to
Paris	LOCATION	as Secretary of Legation , carrying from Thur - low Weed a letter to
John Bigelow	PERSON	,
American Minister	ORGANIZATION	, recommending him as '' a bright , gifted young man , with agreeable manners 412 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 11	DATE	and refined tastes . ''

		Weed doubtless saw in the appointment only the taking care of a young man who had been
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's secretary .

		In
Paris	LOCATION	, Hay drank in disgust for the petty - spirited despotism of
Napoleon III.	PERSON	, found food for moral reflection in '' The tremulous shafts of dawning As they shoot o'er the Tuileries early , '' wormed his way into the intricacies of Papal politics through conversation with the
Rever	PERSON	- end Professor of Dogmatic Theology in the
Propaganda Fide College	ORGANIZATION	at
Rome	LOCATION	, learned the running gear of Imperial diplomatic func - tions , tasted of the higher artistic and intel - lectual life of the incomparable French capital , and then came home in
1867	DATE	.

		all the better American for this varied and broadening ex - perience .


John A. Dix	PERSON	had succeeded Bige - low as Minister , and wished , as a politician , to have a secretary of his own choice rather than to retain one already trained to the du - ties of the position .

		Hay went to
Washington	LOCATION	, willing to receive another position , though instinctively unwilling to press his claims by the wire-pulling methods of which he had seen so much during his service with Lincoln .

		At
Washington	LOCATION	he was invited to dine with Sum - ner , who discussed the
Tenure of Office	ORGANIZATION	bill , then under consideration in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sum - ner severely criticized Senator
Sherman	PERSON	for opposing the inclusion of members of the Cabinet under the provisions of the bill , but Hay was not blinded to fundamental truths by the passions of the moment , as is shown by an entry made in his diary the same evening : '' In all this ingenious and really clever and learned talk of Sumner 's , I could but remark the blindness of an honest , earnest man , who is so intent upon what he thinks right and necessary that he closes his eyes to the fatal consequences of such a course in different circumstances and dif - ferent times .

		The
Senate	ORGANIZATION	is now a bulwark against the evil schemes of the President ; therefore he would give the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	a power which might make it the most detestable engine of anarchy or oppres - sion . ''

		Sumner was opposing the confirmation of Dix as Minister to
France	LOCATION	; and if he had succeeded , Hay was to have been sent to
Paris	LOCATION	as Charge d'Affaires .

		But the friends of Dix won the battle , and Hay returned to his Indi - ana home , without money and with no suita - ble occupation yet in sight .

		He and
Nicolay	PERSON	were already planning a biography of Lincoln , but with no encouragement from publishers .

		`` Nobody is keen for our book , '' he reported to
Nicolay	PERSON	.

		`` We will have to write it and publish on our own hook some day , when we can afford . ''

		Within a few weeks , however , he was appointed as
Secretary of Legation	ORGANIZATION	, to act as Charge d'Affaires , at
Vienna	LOCATION	, the post from which
Motley	ORGANIZATION	had been driven through a piece of that brutal political bungling all too characteristic of our diplomacy .

		On his way to his new position he met
Motley	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	, still chafing bitterly over the injus - tice and rudeness of his recall , and tried to persuade him that the incident indicated no hostility on the part of Secretary
Seward	PERSON	.

		though he admitted that
Seward	PERSON	's letter of recall was '' a frightful one for a gentleman to write or to receive . ''

		Hay 's own career was never to reveal such dulness of perception in matters of the kind .

		Public life could not kill in him the essential qualities of the gentleman .


Vienna	LOCATION	gave him still more of the training and culture which he had absorbed at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		And he acquired there , too , a reasoned hatred for militarism . ''

		The great calamity and danger of
Europe	LOCATION	today , '' he wrote to Sew - ard , `` are these enormous armaments .

		No honest statesman can say that he sees in the present attitude of politics the necessity of war .

		No great power is threatened .

		There is no menace to peace that could not be imme - diately dispelled by a firm protest of the peacefully disposed majority of nations .

		There would be , therefore , no danger to any people , but a vast and immediate gain to all from a general disarmament ... Why then is this awful waste of youth and treasure con - tinued ?

		I believe from no other motive than to sustain the waning prestige of Kings . ''

		In the
Europe	LOCATION	about him he thought that he saw many germs of progress toward a greater human freedom .

		England had come abreast of
John Bright	PERSON	, while
Austria	LOCATION	was governed by
Forty-Eighters	ORGANIZATION	.

		The spirit of freedom which
Bismarck	PERSON	had suckled with the blood of
Sadowa	LOCATION	was rising up to appal him : while
France	LOCATION	, still in a comatose slumber , was talk - ing in her sleep and murmuring the
Marseil	PERSON	- laise .

		`` And God has made her ruler blind drunk , that his Helot antics may disgust the world with despotism .

		If ever in my green and salad days I sometimes vaguely doubted .

		I am safe now .

		I am a Republican till I die .

		When we get to
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	we can try a monar - chy , perhaps . ''

		In the
autumn of 1868	DATE	, Hay resigned and returned to
America	LOCATION	, but the following sum - mer found him again in diplomatic harness , as Secretary of Legation at
Madrid	LOCATION	.

		Here he remained for a year , and in addition to his secretarial duties gained that intimate knowl - edge of
Spain	LOCATION	and her people which he was later to give to the world in '' Castilian Days . ''

		Castelar .

		then in his prime as the eloquent advocate of Republicanism , won his especial admiration .

		A chance visit to the office of the
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 413
New York	LOCATION	'' Tribune , '' as he passed through the city on his way home , and the chance writing of an able editorial comment on a cable dispatch which happened to arrive just at the time , chanced to please
Greeley	PERSON	so highly that Hay was at once invited to join the staff of the paper .

		The offer was accepted , and Hay 's status was fixed for the next five years .

		He then resigned and went to
Cleve	PERSON	- land , partly because the strain of newspaper work was undermining his health , and partly in accordance with the desire of
Amasa Stone	ORGANIZATION	, the founder of Adelbert College , whose daugh - ter lie had married in
1874	DATE	.

		In
1871	DATE	'' Castilian Days '' and the ''
Pike County Ballads	ORGANIZATION	and Other Pieces '' had been published by
Osgood	PERSON	.

		Hay himself was sin - cere in placing very little value upon that part of his verse which won immediate popu - larity , and one may trust his judgment rather than that of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, who has said that the `` Pike County Ballads '' would as infal - libly carry his fame as the ''
Biglow	PERSON	Papers '' carry
Lowell 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Only a year before his death , '' Castilian Days '' was to figure as the basis of an impudent demand from some extremists that he be expelled from the Cabinet , because of certain strictures against the Spanish Cath - olic Church .

		During the World 's Fair at
Chicago	LOCATION	someone with intentions superior to his information introduced him to the Span - ish Princess Eulalia and her companions as the author of a book on
Spain	LOCATION	which they really ought to read , `` unconscious , '' Hay wrote to
Henry Adams	PERSON	, `` that my unhappy little volume treats the
august	DATE	family of
Spain	LOCATION	as a set of pas grandes choses from Wayback , who have no place outside of penal and reformatory institutions . ''

		This , by the way , is a good illustration of Hay 's character - istic freedom of expression in private corre - spondence , which he , as many other great men , was wont to employ as a kind of offset to the dignity imposed by a keen sense of fitness in public utterances .

		After leaving the '' Tribune , '' Hay began in earnest his long labor on the Lincoln biog - raphy , which was finally published in
1890	DATE	.

		In the meanwhile , he had written '' The Bread - Winners , '' stimulated by reflection on the railroad riots of
1877	DATE	, but published anonymously and never formally acknowl - edged .

		In
1879	DATE	, Secretary
Evarts	PERSON	asked him to become Assistant Secretary of
State	ORGANIZATION	, and he held the position until the opening of the
Garfield	PERSON	administration .

		It is a poor com - ment on the management of our diplomacy that from
Lincoln	LOCATION	to McKinley a man of Hay 's qualities was used only to fill occasional gaps of short duration .

		Thrown out with the passing of
Evarts	LOCATION	, he served for six months as editor-in-chief of the '' Tribune , '' while
Whitelaw Reid	PERSON	was touring
Europe	LOCATION	on his honeymoon .

		His editorial ability and judg - ment were severely but successfully tested in dealing with the crisis in
New York	LOCATION	politics caused by the break between the
New York Senators	ORGANIZATION	and the administration , and the subsequent assassination of the President .

		In the early eighties , Hay left
Cleveland	LOCATION	and built a fine home in
Washington	LOCATION	, by the side of that of his most intimate friend ,
Henry Adams	PERSON	, both structures being designed by
Henry H. Richardson	PERSON	, foremost of Amer - ican architects .

		Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	gives a charm - ing picture of the social and intellectual life that centred in these two homes .

		Hay 's appointment to diplomatic service was sug - gested to President
Harrison	PERSON	, who only made the foolish answer , '' There is n't any politics in it . ''

		And so the fated diplomatic career had to await the coming of
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	, who was too deeply indebted to Hay 's kindness to have passed him by on any mere balancing of political values .

		We may well believe , how - ever , that Hay would have received the Lon - don
Embassy	ORGANIZATION	on the score of his conspicuous fitness , even if
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	's rise to the Presi - dency had not involved certain incidents which many would gladly forget , but which Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	chooses to set forth with no dis - guise of their inherent unpleasantness , doubt - less that the unvarnished truth may show Hay 's kindness to
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	to have had no ulterior motive .

		Nor does Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	's nar - rative conceal the fact that the same can not be said of the aid rendered to
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	by the
Ohio	LOCATION	Republican boss of the period .

		One does not need to dwell on the details of Hay 's service in the
London Embassy	LOCATION	.

		A sentence from a letter to Senator Lodge , writ - ten after the outbreak of the war with
Spain	LOCATION	, gives the keynote of his policy : '' It is hardly too much to say that the interests of civiliza - tion are bound up in the direction the rela - tions of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	are to take in the next few months . ''

		In Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	's words , `` He realized that on the welding to - gether of
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, the future welfare of two hemispheres depended . ''

		Meanwhile ,
John Sherman	PERSON	, broken under the burden of the
State Department	ORGANIZATION	, into which the
Ohio	LOCATION	Republican boss had forced him in order to clear his own path to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, had surrendered his portfolio to Judge Day .

		Three months later .

		Day resigned , to take service on the
Paris Commission	ORGANIZATION	which was to conclude peace with
Spain	LOCATION	.

		The President immediately tendered to Hay by cable the office of
Secretarv of State	ORGANIZATION	.

		He took his desk 414 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 11 on the first of October , 1898	DATE	, and remained there , absorbed head and heart in far-reaching labors for his country 's good and the good of humanity , until he sank in the harness from exhaustion , in the
spring of 1905	DATE	.

		A journey to
Bad Nauheim	ORGANIZATION	did no good , and he came back to his own country , to die in his
New Hampshire	LOCATION
summer	DATE	home , on the first of
July	DATE	.

		In the
Department of State	ORGANIZATION	, it is fair to say that he alone turned the tide which for a time threatened to precipitate a mad struggle for the partition of
China	LOCATION	among the great powers .

		Of our dealings with the
Boxer	PERSON	trou - bles he wrote to
Henry Adams	PERSON	: `` At least we are spared the infamy of an alliance with
Germany	LOCATION	.

		I would rather , I think , be the dupe of
China	LOCATION	than the chum of the
Kaiser	PERSON	. ''

		He saw clearly that
England	LOCATION	was for a time deceived by
Germany	LOCATION	in the
Boxer	LOCATION	matter ; and if later , in
1905	DATE	, he worked in apparent harmony with
Germany	LOCATION	in maintaining the integrity of
China	LOCATION	, it was only because Ger - many had been forced by circumstances to his position .

		It was characteristic of Hohenzol - lern diplomatic methods that the
Kaiser	PERSON	and von Billow tried to persuade Hay that the other European powers were all in a con - spiracy , headed by
France	LOCATION	, to break down his policy .

		Hay sent out his famous '' self-deny - ing circular , '' asking the other powers to join in a policy of respect for the integrity of
China	LOCATION	; and the prompt and satisfactory re - plies , he writes in his diary , '' show clearly the extent of the
Kaiser	PERSON	's illusion . ''

		But the
Kaiser	PERSON	, as was soon disclosed , had merely been planting his mines for the humiliation of
France	LOCATION	; and the forced resignation of Del - casse , the
French Minister of Foreign Affairs	ORGANIZATION	, was signalled on the same day by making a Prince of von Billow , whom Hay once char - acterized as having made German diplomacy '' as brutal as possible . ''

		In the matter of upholding the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	against the desire of European powers to collect claims from
Venezuela	LOCATION	by force , as well as in the establishment and recognition of the Republic of
Panama	LOCATION	, Presi - dent
Roosevelt	PERSON	assumed responsibility and Secretary Hay was not directly concerned in the negotiations .

		In the
Venezuela	LOCATION	matter the real antagonist was
Germany	LOCATION	, though she had inveigled
England	LOCATION	into temporary and not very resolute partnership .

		Mr.
Roose	PERSON	- velt 's threat to Dr.
Holleben	PERSON	, German Ambas - sador , to send Dewey to
Venezuela	LOCATION	with the American squadron unless
Germany	LOCATION	should agree at once to arbitrate her claims , brought the desired answer .

		In the
Panama	LOCATION	matter , Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	devotes a chapter to the task of proving that President
Roosevelt	PERSON	's course was justifiable and honorable ; but he is careful to indicate that Hay was not even informed as to a good deal that was going on , and he leaves ample ground to those who prefer to believe that if Hay himself had been in charge methods would have been very different .

		That Hay never criticized that or any other official act of Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's was only in har - mony with his unbroken characteristic of entire devotion to any administration under which he served .

		Hay was a believer in peace and the things that make for peace , and if he could have had things entirely his own way the chances would have been good that the whole
Panama	LOCATION	matter would have been so handled as to make the canal a more powerful factor in promoting world peace than it may perhaps become , with the

		When Hay was negotiating with

		Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	has given us a remarkable book on a man to whom all will concede unusual poAver , even those who can not follow Mr.
Howells	PERSON	in ranking him as the ablest statesman of his time .

		As if to prove that he was not more than human , there were points which his usual breadth of mind and sympathy did not cover .

		As late as
1885	DATE	he could write to Nicolay : ''
Gilder	PERSON	was evidently horrified at your saying that Lee ought to be shot : a simple truth of law and equity .

		I find , after a careful reading of a dozen biographies and all his own reports , that
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	was a howling crank . ''

		Fortunately he realized , and added , that it would be folly for him to say so , in the Lincoln biography .

		In spite of his personal affection for
Henry Adams	PERSON	, he never got above an instinctive prejudice that no Demo - crat could really be fit for a responsible gov - ernment position .

		It is only fair to add .

		however , that his experience with the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	in trying to secure the ratification of arbitra - tion treaties convinced him that many promi - nent Republicans were in the same boat .

		`` A treaty going into the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, '' he wrote , `` is like a bull going into the arena : no one can say just how or when the final blow will fall , but one thing is certain it will never leave the arena alive . ''

		His deep personal affection for
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	led him to an estimate of
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	's abilities and services far higher than many who were not his enemies or oppo - nents would now be disposed to allow .

		And
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 415 his attitude toward Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	was much the same .

		Perhaps the nearest he ever came to a really damaging criticism of Mr.
Roose	PERSON	- velt lies in the suggestion which one might find in a diary entry concerning a luncheon at the
White House	ORGANIZATION	at which Hay himself ,
Yves Guyot	PERSON	, and Mr.
Theodore Stanton	PERSON	were the guests : '' The President talked with great energy and perfect ease the most curious French I ever listened to .

		It was absolutely lawless as to Grammar and occasionally bank - rupt in substantives ; but he had not the least difficulty in making himself understood , and one subject did not worry him more than another . ''

		Which is calculated to make the gray-haired reader green with envy of the younger generation , which may live until time shall unseal even the most intimate of the private diary entries which the career of the Rough-Rider has doubtless inspired .

		THE NEW DKAMA IN ENGLISH .

		* It would seem the irony of fate that while literary discussion in this country has recently centred around the drama , it is our poets and not our playwrights who have pleasantly sur - prised us by finding themselves .

		Can it be that the movement for a better stage has suf - fered from self-consciousness ?

		At any rate , to neither its workers nor its patrons have most of the prophetic utterances about it proved of practical value .

		To these utter - ances .

		Professor
Dickinson	PERSON	's '' The Case of American Drama '' presents a wholesome con - trast .

		It is a sober and thoughtful analysis of the underlying problems of our contempo - rary theatre , such , for example , as the ten - dency toward centralization , which , while increasing the financial returns for manager , author , and actor alike , has resulted in disas - ter for the art that is in the last analysis also the life of the stage .

		Unlike most writers on the subject , the author does not attack the syn - dicate system of theatre management in itself , finding it on the whole '' a necessary outgrowth of the spirit and methods of the time . ''

		It is the entrance into this system of '' the theory of monopoly and absentee managerial con - trol '' which he deplores , and the consequent organization of '' the entire country as tribu - tary to one city . ''

		Working on this basis , he points out that the system has not only alien - ated the audience for good plays , caused the * THE CASE OF AMERICAN DRAMA .

		art of acting to decline , and `` perverted the springs of playmaking , '' but it has in so doing proceeded to defeat its own end of financial success .

		Its unfortunate effect on the pro- vincial theatres is well known .

		But the chief set-back , as Professor
Dickinson	PERSON	shows , has come from the dramatists who have registered the artificiality and the futility of the system by their failure to provide the neces - sary plays .

		For all these ills , the author proposes no panacea , nor does he admit that a panacea is needed .

		Yet his criticism is not entirely de - structive .

		He believes that forces are already at work that can be depended on for the ulti - mate solution of the main problems .

		On the business side , the more efficient and less cen - tralized management of the `` movies '' and vaudeville is teaching its lesson to the heads of the theatre `` trusts . ''

		Sporadic repertory theatres and independent producing societies are doing much to encourage both actors and authors ; while the growing tendency to read and study plays , and the reviving interest in out-of-door theatricals and pageants , are edu - cating popular taste .

		It is accordingly on the leavening possibilities of these forces rather than on the influence of any individual or group of individuals that Professor
Dickinson	PERSON	rests his case for the American drama .

		Thus our stage is to work out its own salvation , and eventually we are to arrive at the form of repertory theatre best adapted to our national temper and traditions .

		Just what this form will be , the author does not undertake to say .

		He does , however , show clearly and concisely what we have to build on in the experience of the short-lived New Theatre of
New York	LOCATION	and that of the typical repertory theatres of
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		For the completeness of the picture , and also because it touches more nearly our own problems , some account of the recent renaissance of the repertory theatre in
England	LOCATION	might well have been in - cluded here .

		It is proof of the emphasis that the author desires to lay on the significance of the open - air play and pageant that he treats these from the practical as well as from the theo - retical side .

		And the general reader will per - haps find his chapters on the construction of the theatre in the open and on the production of pageants both happily free from techni - cal terms among the freshest and most stimulating of the book .

		The lack of an index , or at least a detailed table of contents , will be felt by those who wish to use the volume for reference , particu - larly as the reasons for the arrangement of the material are not always apparent .

		And 416 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 11	DATE	here and there , an unqualified statement in - vites challenge .

		Such is the assertion with regard to the ancient Greek theatre that `` it was really of little importance that the audi - ence was seated in the open , '' and '' in every essential respect the performance might as well have taken place behind closed doors . ''

		Yet , in the main , the book is distinguished for its sound sense , its thorough understanding , and its vigorous presentation of the status quo of American drama .

		For the practical guidance of the many who by reading plays are , as Professor
Dickinson	PERSON	suggests , making straight the way for our stage , Mr.
Clark	PERSON	's `` British and American Drama of To-day '' is designed .

		Its advan - tages as a play-reader 's or a play-goer 's hand - book must be obvious at a glance .

		Here may be found brief biographies of the foremost modern writers of drama in English , with a concise statement of the consensus of opinion regarding their chief works , chronological lists of stage productions , and bibliographies that include even articles in the magazines .

		For definitive studies of the dramatists men - tioned , the reader must still go elsewhere .

		Indeed , the benefit he derives from the book will depend largely upon the background of knowledge he brings to it , and the use he makes of the excellent bibliographies .

		In cer - tain cases these should have been made still fuller by the inclusion of works in other lan - guages than English .

		To the list of criticisms of
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, for example , might well have been added such works as those by Cestre and
Hamon	PERSON	in French and by
Julius Bab	PERSON	in German .

		Some mention , also , of the
Conti	PERSON	- nental productions of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's plays was to be expected , especially in view of their remark - able popularity on the German stage .

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	shows a wide acquaintance with modern plays of all nations , and his facility of reference is well-nigh bewildering .

		Never - theless , in several instances he allows himself to be betrayed into hasty generalizations .

		Many will be quite unable to subscribe to such a dictum regarding contemporary American drama as this : '' The dialogue is usually good , idiomatic , and clever '' ; or to this astonishing statement : '' The only criticism to be made against such plays as ' On Trial ' is that their very novelty is soon outworn , and that it is above all useless . ''

		Indeed , throughout his book Mr.
Clark	PERSON	puts a far more favorable con - struction on what our dramatists have already achieved than does Professor
Dickinson	PERSON	or than the facts of the case would seem to war - rant .

		Of this the American reader will fortu - nately be able to judge for himself .

		It should be stated that even though such a reader may not agree with the general conclusions , he will find Mr.
Clark	PERSON	's exposition of the stagecraft of dramatists like
Augustus Thomas	PERSON	and
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	instructive .

		Yet it is chiefly for its sug - gestive reading lists , and its body of informa - tion , conveniently arranged and indexed for purposes of reference , that the volume may be recommended .

		MoArBE > CASSANDRA-VOICES OF '' PREPAREDNESS . ''

		* Preparedness is the topic of the hour .

		The press is filled with it , organizations are pro- moting it , military training camps are teach - ing it , and politicians are carefully surveying it as a possible political issue .

		Naturally , the publishers are not behindhand , but have pro- vided books for those who wish to read .

		The volumes to be considered in the present review vary greatly in quality and purpose .

		Professor
Johnston	PERSON	's `` Arms and the Race '' exhibits a much broader and more philosophi - cal view of human relations than any of the others .

		It alone of these books shows that its author views society as an evolving organism which forever goes on to other things ; hence he alone has some idea of the philosophy which underlies anti-militarism , and considers the international mind worth some discussion .

		Like most of those persons who really know the past , he is not disposed to rest his case on it ; and so , unlike the other authors here noted , he does not consider statements of Washing - ton as final proof that we need a greater army to-day .

		He also recognizes that to get any - where one should rest one 's case on facts instead of on opinions .

		Contending that the nationalizing of armies with the adoption of popular sovereignty has removed the danger of armies being agents of tyranny , the author continues with the view that the
United States	LOCATION	alone has not perceived that the modern army is not to be feared , and has consequently fallen behind other nations in its armaments .

		For this reason he holds that we need a greater military establishment .

		He favors strength - ening the navy primarily , and the army sec - ondarily , but making less than we are doing of
coast defense	ORGANIZATION	.

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 417 tized for the '' movies '' under the title , '' The Battle Cry of Peace . ''

		The book is clever and entertaining , and in parts gives evidence of having been written in collaboration with men in our army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is prepared dis - tinctly with one idea , to arouse the Amer - ican people to provide greater defenses .

		Its author does not , probably can not , grasp the fundamentals of anti-militarism .

		No better illustration than this book could be found of what Mr.
Norman Angell	PERSON	has called '' one - sided aberration , '' - the process of trying to solve questions involving many nations by considering only one of them .

		Mr.
Maxim	PERSON	thinks that all will be well if we but get '' ade - quate preparation , '' whatever that means .

		He neglects to state what effect our getting that preparation will have on other nations , which is a strange oversight ; for if his course for us is the highest wisdom , why should not rival nations continue to act on it ?

		It is need - less to state that Mr.
Maxim	PERSON	says nothing about the final issue of the armament race between nations , beyond quoting ex-Secretary Meyer to the effect that '' we are rich enough to match dollars for national defense with any other nation in the world . ''

		So the ultimate triumph is to be with dollars !

		It does sound truer to experience to say that '' dollars make right . ''

		It also contributes to make clear why Mr.
Maxim	PERSON	should call the area wdthin two hun - dred miles around
New York	LOCATION	the `` heart of
America	LOCATION	, '' though the reason which he ad - vances is that in this district lie most of the factories of armaments and war materials , and the coal beds for their use .

		After the fore - going one need not be surprised at a certain vein of prophecy and also finality in these pages . ''

		It is a fact , which I absolutely know as certainly as anything can be known in hu - man affairs , that we .

		.

		are sitting to-day on a powder magazine with the train lighted , '' etc. .

		To announce as a fact what can not pos - sibly be other than an opinion of course ends all discussion .

		Major
Carter	PERSON	's book on '' The American Army '' is the straightforward and unpreten - tious work of a professional man .

		The writer sticks to his specialty and to fact , and there - fore his book , though not entertaining read - ing , has real merit .

		Not so with Mr.
Neeser	PERSON	's '' Our
Navy	ORGANIZATION	and the Next War , '' the title of which indicates that it has to do with things yet to come , rather than those.that w r e know about .

		The book is free and easy with opinions and generalizations that are announced as though they were axioms .

		It does not stick to its topic of the
navy	ORGANIZATION	, but rambles considerably , and therefore repeats itself .

		Altogether , it is a compilation of the author 's opinions and wishes , without an ade - quate presentation of his reasons for those opinions , and therefore can not expect to con - vince its readers .

		`` America Fallen ! ''

		by Mr.
J. Bernard Walker	PERSON	, editor of '' The Scientific American , '' is the account of an imaginary invasion of the
United States	LOCATION	by
Germany	LOCATION	, one month after the end of the European War .

		There are some difficulties in making the thing reasonable , but the author surmounts these with the same superhuman skill that his Germans show in their attack on us .

		Mr.
Walker	PERSON	is pro- Ally , hence
Germany	LOCATION	must be and is defeated in the present war .

		But for the sake of alarming us about our defenses , we must have an invasion .

		Of course
England	LOCATION	would n't think of this ; hence it must be the Germans , even though de - feated .

		However ,
England	LOCATION	, vexed at our con - duct during the Great War , does agree not to hinder
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The attack is planned and executed without a hitch of any consequence .

		The Germans get across the sea without any - body , even the British seemingly , getting word of it .

		They attack
Boston	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, Wash - ington -LRB- having slipped by the coast forts un - noticed -RRB- , and the
Atlantic	LOCATION	end of the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal on the same night , and with practically no difficulty or mistake .

		Two Germans cap - ture a ferry boat with its crew ; the German submarines , having sneaked in at night , sink or destroy every warship in
Norfolk	LOCATION	yards and in the yards of the
Newport News Shipbuild	ORGANIZATION	- ing Company .

		Even Nature favors the Ger - mans , for the fatal night is '' unusually dark '' ; the sea at
Boston	LOCATION	is '' calm and clear '' ; and at
Coney Island	LOCATION	, where the pleasure-seeking Ger - mans land a force , there is a `` scarcely per - ceptible surf . ''

		Need it be added that , in the face of these supermen , we Americans prove to be plain fools , showing not a single bit of the initiative or ability about which we ordi - narily boast ?

		Nobody in the whole `` heart of
America	LOCATION	'' thinks of destroying the
New York Central	ORGANIZATION	tracks leading to
Albany	LOCATION	, of which the Germans take possession as they might take another glass of beer .

		-LRB- It is pertinent to note here that Professor
Johnston	PERSON	believes that
Germany	LOCATION	does not constitute a great danger to us at the present time ; and that
New York	LOCATION	could probably be defended with complete success against a sea raid . -RRB-

		The effect of this book is questionable ; it may be pernicious , as others of its kind have been .

		So eager is it to insure its effect on Americans that it alto - gether forgets the effect it will have on the nation it represents as our foe . ''

		The Battle of Dorking , '' which told of a similar invasion of
England	LOCATION	by
Germany	LOCATION	in
1875	DATE	, increased instead of diminishing apprehension on both 418 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 11	DATE	sides .

		Can we not secure adequate prepared - ness without goading our possible rivals into resentment and accelerated action ?

		The anonymous author of '' Stultitia , '' who is '' a former government official , '' employs the dramatic form to awaken us from our defenselessness .

		The book is melodramatic , appeals to blind emotion , makes the average congressman unpatriotic and shifty and the military man the real patriot .

		It , too , imag - ines a war which sets everybody right about preparation .

		It has not , to our present knowl - edge , been staged .

		Taken together these books show certain in - teresting similarities and divergencies .

		They all contend that we are unprepared .

		They offer programmes which differ in detail and exactness ; but space forbids a discussion of these .

		All show a disposition to prophesy that we are to have a rude awakening unless we change our policy .

		They are unanimous , in condemning the pacifist ; but the prize for picturesqueness of vituperation must go to Mr.
Maxim	PERSON	.

		Civilian control of the army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	comes in for a good deal of condemna - tion ;
Congress	ORGANIZATION	is freely blamed for sacrificing defense to politics ; and the people are charged with incompetence .

		Our authors agree in the main that national defense ought not to be made a matter of politics .

		Certain tendencies of other recent writers on preparedness reappear in these books .

		They rebuke our historians for making our past wars glorious , when in fact they were badly managed and unnecessarily drawn out .

		It is contended that the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	has hith - erto endured chiefly because
Great Britain	LOCATION	protected it for us , but that she may refuse to do this any longer .

		All of the writers , so far as they express themselves on militarism , declare they are op - posed to it .

		Yet one can not help but observe a certain admiration for the success of the German methods .

		Mr.
Neeser	PERSON	would have uni - versal military service .

		Mr.
Maxim	PERSON	thinks conscription in
Germany	LOCATION	produces excellent results , and states that it is not an unreasona - ble conclusion that militarism is responsible for the German culture of efficiency , since German militarism is the greatest school of economics that the world has ever seen .

		Else - where he says : '' `` We must play the game as a World Power , and as other nations are play - ing the game .

		To get fair play we must pro- vide ourselves with the weapons with which they are providing themselves . ''

		Mr.
Maxim	PERSON	says he is opposed to militarism , and is urging `` preparedness against war '' : yet his words just quoted are not very different from the utterances of
Bernhardi	LOCATION	.

		who is now every - where except in
Germany	LOCATION	regarded as the arch-priest of militarism .

		That the coming session of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will deal with the subject of preparedness is evi - dent , and as it should be .

		We want reasonable preparedness , but we ought to go about it rationally and not hysterically .

		Unhappily , some of the books here reviewed tend to cloud reason , and thus to benumb the very faculty which should give the country what it really neec * s.

		PETRARCH AGAIX . '

		In the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	copy of Professor
Norton	PERSON	's catalogue of the
Fiske Petrarch Collection	ORGANIZATION	in the library of
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, there is preserved a letter from the late Professor
Fiske	PERSON	.

		Norton had offered
Fiske	PERSON	his copy of the Venetian folio of
Petrarch Bevilaqua	ORGANIZATION	's of
1503	DATE	.

		Pardonable satisfaction may be detected in his reply : '' I already possess an excellent copy . ''

		The possessor of folios is not unfamiliar with this note of satisfaction ; owner or not , one feels a stirring of pride in the knowledge that there are folios in the country , should one care to study them .

		The letter continues : `` The Villa Forini -LSB- he was about to sail for
Italy	LOCATION	and
Florence	LOCATION	in
July , 1883	DATE	-RSB- will at least not lose its Scan - dinavian attractions , as I also take with me my Icelandic collection , the gathering of which , instead of being , as is my Petrarch collection , a whimsey of my old age .

		has been the work of many years .

		I hope to do some work with both these collections , but the danger is that I may
fall	DATE	between two very attractive stools . ''

		The letter is a poignant reminder of fruit - ful days at the
Villa Forini	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Fiske	PERSON	gathered about him students and professors , silent scribes and talkative counts .

		He ar - ranged comforts for his American guests at which
Browning	PERSON	might have cavilled as being un-Italian .

		But no change was made in the smoking-room at the top of the house .

		There old-fashioned frescoes in the slender strips of wall were left undisturbed and undiscerned between open spaces of purple haze beyond

		Fears that the Icelandic and Italian Col - lections would be left in
Europe	LOCATION	were finally dispelled ; and now the catalogues of the Fiske-Cornell libraries may be had , and the books are available within twenty-four hours , more or less .

		If we have appropriated so much of
Italy	LOCATION	, we are now also assimilating it .

		Petrarch 's Latin works refuse to stay in folios :
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	and
the University of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago have revealed , most readably , some of the treasures first used in English by Chau - cer .

		Yale has given us the Concordance to the Italian poems .

		Sooner or later we may learn all that
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	himself wished us to know , without changing spectacles over the solid printed page , or halting to expand the Latin of incunabula .

		No labor is involved in reading the latest American book about Petrarch .

		In '' Some Love Songs of Petrarch , '' Dr.
William Dud	PERSON	- ley
Foulke	PERSON	continues the long tradition of the English poets .

		If Chaucer made no son - net of his '' Song of Troilus , '' he showed that Italian verse may be fitted to English .

		Yet even he , with his wealth of rhyme , most of it now lost to us , felt that it was impracticable to attempt complete imitation of Italian rhymes , every one of which had a feminine ending .

		Five masculine rhymes come first in the '' Song of Troilus , '' then seven feminines , then masculines until the final couplet .

		In Dr.
Foulke	PERSON	's version feminine rhymes appear now and then , oftener in other forms than the sonnet .

		Shakespearean are forty-six of his sonnets , and a Petrarchan sestette ap - pears in each of the other five .

		The object , then , has been to render the substance faith - fully in the more flexible English form ; and in the cases selected for comparison this has been effectively done .

		Petrarch 's enjambe - ments are at times preserved ; in the four - teenth ode and in the '' Hymn to the Virgin '' one is reminded of the melody of Dry den .

		Monosyllables , the bane of the translator , have been avoided where possible .

		How could one escape them in turning such a rugged sestette as this ? ''

		Poi che se ' sgombro della maggior salma L'altre puoi giuso agrevolmente porre , Salendo quasi un pellegrino scarce .

		Ben vedi omai siccome a morte corre Ogni cosa creata , e quanto all ' alma Bisogna ir leve al periglioso varco . ''

		This is translated , with a courageous sub - junctive , as follows : '' For , when delivered of thy heaviest load From what remains thou canst be quickly free , And like a pilgrim to thy new abode Rise all unburdened .

		Thou canst clearly see How all things move to death .

		Well may we pray The soul go light upon its perilous way . ''

		Yet the technique of the English sonnet , so challenging since
Milton	PERSON	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	, invites no tricks of the translator .

		The verse is never careless , nor is it mechanical or labored .

		With the diction
Saxon	PERSON	and idioma - tic , and the style simple and severe , the reader will not be surprised to find lines of dignity and elevation , less Asiatic than
Petrarch	PERSON	, less Italianate than older English translations .

		The introductory sonnet to
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	betrays restraint , and an artistic sense of the sonnet 's limitations .

		It is grati - fying to record the classical spirit of this little volume when romantic , not to say untu - tored , freedom in verse invites public favor .

		A judicious Introduction and biographical sketch informs the reader without obtruding the quarrels of critics , French and Italian .

		An appendix , reviewing the attempts made to identify Laura , will stir the dullest of stu - dents or the most unliterary of psychologists .

		The '' Epistle to Posterity '' is printed , and a convenient list of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		The book must be welcome to all whose care it is to make a revue of literature stimulating , and devote a few precious hours to
Petrarch	PERSON	and his influence .

		The general reader will be grateful for a fresh appraisement of the poet and the man .

		It is a useful complement to Professor
Robinson	PERSON	's version of the `` Letters '' and his volume on Petrarch .

		Dr.
Foulke	PERSON	, it may be urged , should not confine his verse to translation .

		One note to return to the folios may be added .

		The `` six folio editions of his Epistles and other prose works printed at
Basle	LOCATION	and
Venice	LOCATION	between
1494	DATE	and

		Gardens are of various kinds , but the developing interest referred to is that in flower gardens , kept by amateurs for the love of natural beauty .

		We have heard it said by those who ministered to the broken down and criminal classes in
London	LOCATION	, that men who seemed to have lost almost every good feeling would still respond to the beauty of flowers .

		In the mining camps of
Colorado	LOCATION	, where there has long been such bitter discon - tent with the conditions of life , the little rows of box-like houses stand in barren desolation , without the gardens which would make them at least resemble normal homes .

		Miners and owners alike would doubtless laugh at the suggestion that the lack of flowers was one of the things most seriously the matter with the whole situation ; yet the idea is by no means wholly grotesque , nor is it altogether false to say that the development of flower , gardens is a fair index to the civilization of a neighbor - hood .

		In
England	LOCATION	, when the '' Garden Cit = ies '' were first established , the factory hands , moved suddenly into rural surroundings , did not altogether like the change .

		What were gardens compared with the '' movies , '' and all the excitement of city life ?

		In a year or two , however , they learned to appreciate their new opportunities , and settled down to a really normal life , which we hope will in course of time everywhere replace the distorting en - vironment of crow r ded towns .

		Thus in all schemes for human betterment , the garden necessarily has a large part , and floriculture becomes an intensely vital thing for the whole community , instead of a mere amusement for the rich .

		Mrs.
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	writes of her '' home - made '' garden on a
New Hampshire	LOCATION	moun - tain as a thing beloved ; growing under her hands and that of the ''
Meister	PERSON	, '' to whom we may well believe that flowers and music seemed to have a certain kinship , in the imme - diacy of their - appeal to the higher human emotions .

		Very charmingly are \ ve led through the history of the garden 's develop - ment , seeing almost with the author 's eyes the many interesting little happenings , some triumphant , others quite the reverse .

		The combination of pure delight with innumerable little practical suggestions will appeal to all those who are growing flowers , although the exact circumstances will not be duplicated elsewhere .

		Then there is the keen interest in all that lives , in the birds and animals , all of which belong to the scheme of things and are part of the purpose for which the garden exists .

		There is a story of a French author , who was visited by a friend who was about to journey around the world .

		Said the au - thor : `` I can not leave my home ; but while you go around the world , I will go round my garden . ''

		This he did , and wrote a charming book about the things he saw .

		but he who circumnavigated the globe left nothing for posterity .

		Mrs.
Thomas	PERSON	, in the same spirit , can stay at home and enjoy the drama of life , M r hich never becomes stale .

		Mrs.
King	PERSON	writes a more ambitious book , in which she discusses , with the judgment born of experience , the planning of a somewhat elaborate garden .

		Much is said about color harmony and the grouping of plants , mat - ters w r hich the beginner is too likely to over - look , either from ignorance or indifference .

		Mrs.
King	PERSON	writes : '' I have a new profession to propose , a profes - sion of specialists : it should be called that of the garden colorist .

		The office shall be distinct from that of the landscape architect , distinct indeed from those whose office it already is to prescribe the plants for the garden .

		The garden colorist shall be qualified to plant beautifully , according to color , the best-planned gardens of our best design - ers .

		It shall be his duty , first , to possess a true color instinct ; second , to have had much expe - rience in the growing of flowers , notably in the growing of varieties in form and color ; third , so to make his planting plans that there shall be successive pictures of loveliness melting into each other with successive months ; and last , he must pay , if possible , a weekly visit to his gardens , for no eye but his discerning one will see in them the evil and the good . ''

		Finally , it is suggested that '' he '' will usu - ally be a woman .

		This is not exactly the '' home-made '' idea of Mrs.
Thomas	PERSON	, w r ho also appears to know nothing of '' that man who must be constantly in sight of those who garden , the gardener , the paid , the earnest , and almost always the friendly , assistant in our labors w r ith flowers . ''

		Mrs.
King	PERSON	's garden is not the back-yard of a cottage , nor are her plans those of a small clerk in a grocery store .

		We confess to a preference for the genuinely amateur point of view , which can make something worth while out of a window-box , and will under no circumstances abandon the control of things to a '' discerning one '' who will alone see this or that .

		Yet .

		after all , Mrs.
King	PERSON	's main con - tention , set forth with such a wealth of exam - ples and illustrations , is entirely wise and sound .

		It is , that gardens , like houses , large or small , should be regarded in their entirety , and so planned that the parts harmonize .

		Furthermore , as in music , so in color and form , harmony is a reality , the sense of which
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 421 can and should be cultivated .

		By ignoring these things , we not only fail to develop some of our best faculties , but shut ourselves out of much of the pleasure of life .

		Thus '' The Well-Considered Garden '' has its mission even for those who have only a few yards of earth at their command ; while its larger ideas may be carried out in public parks , under the stimulation of citizens who have been converted to the newer point of view .

		To those of us who are old enough to remem - ber the ribbon-like arrangement of flower - beds in the seventies of the
last century	DATE	, the tremendous advance in -LCB- esthetic feeling repre - sented by modern gardening is astonishing , as is the increasing variety of plants cultivated .

		Among the minor matters which we are led to consider , is the not unimportant one of names .

		We greatly need , in this country , some organization with power to standardize the names of garden varieties , or at least to prevent each dealer from giving new names to old things , with the implication that what he offers is different from that sold by his com - petitors .

		We would even suggest that short latinized names would sound better than some of the designations now in use .

		One can get used to anything , perhaps ; but does it not sound a little queer to read in an orchid catalogue of '' The Duke of Marlbor - ough , parentage unknown , '' or to be informed that Mrs.
W. T. Ware	PERSON	is badly blighted ?

		Professor
Francis Darwin	PERSON	, the eminent bota - nist , is a living reality to us , and we do not altogether like to be told that his '' tones are Rouge fraise No. 2 within the petals , Vin de
Bordeaux	LOCATION	No. 2 outside . ''

		Were the tulip named
Danvini	PERSON	, there could be no offence , and the name would be less cumbersome .

		like every other Englishman worth his salt ; but he seems to be able to disregard that hor - ror , at least in his thinking .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's thoughts are prone to run ahead of the actual event : in `` The World Set Free '' he said what he had to say of the war before people had much of an idea that there was to be one .

		Now his ideas have got back to the regular line , he does not write as though the war were over , but rather as though there had been no war ; he is going ahead on the road whereon he was moving before .

		Several of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's books have been stud - ies of society from the general standpoint ; but in some of his later stories , such as '' The New Macchiavelli '' and '' The Passionate Friends , '' he has been more interested in thinking of what the individual life could do in and for society .

		His latest book , '' The Research Magnificent , '' is the story of a man who , being unlimited by minor matters , set himself to find some '' theory of his work and duty in the world , a plan of the world 's future that should give a rule to his life . ''

		`` A world-state sustained by an aristocracy of noble men , '' that idea or theory is not new to a reader of
Wells	LOCATION	; but here will be found someone who tried to work out some practical way in the matter .

		`` Not a novel , '' one may readily say , just as White , the literary man who was called to look over
Ben	PERSON	- ham 's papers , said , when the magnificent search had come to an end .

		It is not unlike those autobiographical novels that -LRB- as Mr.
Wells	PERSON	once wrote -RRB- `` were popular throughout the
third and fourth decades of the twentieth century	DATE	. ''

		It is the work of a novelist , of course , a story by a man who feels things keenly , a man who is sensitive , appreciative , humorous , whimsical .

		But it is chiefly a mat - ter of record , valuable for the results it has in it .

		The main thing from this standpoint is that now Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has his eye on the limitations of the finer life .

		What is it that prevents those who desire from being the aristocrats of the newer world ?

		Benham , with the keenest desire , finds himself continually hindered , limited , `` cribbed , cabined , and confined , '' stopped from something here , held back from something there .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has settled in his own mind the four great limitations of life : fear , sex , jealousy , prejudice ; and he presents the experience of
Benham	LOCATION	with each .

		r These are individual limitations , it will be seen , not caused by social life .

		All that is stimulating , especially to those who have other limitations , also , which
Benham	PERSON	had not : income , education or lack of it . ''

		circumstances . ''

		and so forth .

		But one 422 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 11	DATE	must confess that
Benham	LOCATION	, whatever he learned or found out or decided for himself , seems actually '' not to live but know / ' or , if not to know , to strive for knowledge .

		The search for knowledge is a fascinating thing , one of the most fascinating things in the world , if it be not the finest .

		But in this book it weighs on the reader somehow that
Benham	LOCATION	brings nothing to pass , and does not even try .

		And that rather impoverishes the novel though it may thereby be more like life .

		Benham was a pioneer .

		Perhaps now that he has lived his life with less accomplishment than knowledge , others may put his inven - tions to everyday use .

		However that may be , this is one of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's interesting books , full of things wholly in his especial way , like the experiences in the
Balkans	LOCATION	, and aimed at a high ideal , bringing into a definite form many fine ideas that one has met with else - where in Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's work .

		Mr.
Theodore Dreiser	PERSON	does not hold the commanding position in letters that Mr.
Wells	PERSON	does , but his work is always worth while , for he has certain fine possessions , one of which is a vast amount of knowledge of the thing he is writing about , which is joined to an unrestricted willingness and great abil - ity to impart whatever he knows .


Eugene Witla	PERSON	, the chief figure of his new novel , '' The ' Genius , ' '' is not in the least like
Ben	PERSON	- ham , but his very unlikeness suggests much .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's man , like Mr.
Wells	PERSON	himself , was intent on knowledge , in a large way a scien - tist , a person who wanted to know .

		Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's character is an artist .

		Whether Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	means that he is a great artist , or only that people think he is .

		may be doubtful .

		The quotation-marks in the title imply a query which becomes more insistent as one reads the book .

		Certainly Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	con - veys no notion of a great artist that is ade - quate to ordinary conceptions ; he presents a man of `` artistic temperament '' who has no ideas or feelings that are not shared by many .

		His ideas of art seem ordinary , such as would come from a reading of the magazines .

		Here Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	seems deficient .

		He gives chap - ter and verse for most of
Witla	LOCATION	's acts and ideas ; but for his artistic aims and accom - plishments , even so far as they go , he depends usually on what seem rather bare common - places .

		Perhaps he means to do so .

		What - ever he means , he has depicted a man very unlike Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's creation .

		Benham was a man of average abilities who was led to a fine life by mere determination ;
Witla	PERSON	was a man of great abilities who passed through strug - gle , success , failure , without any definite mo - tive or idea , except that of doing just as he liked at any given time . ''

		He loved beauty , not a plan in life , '' that is what Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	says of him .

		That may be the real difference between artist and scientist :
Benham	PERSON	had a plan .

		But
Witla	PERSON	's love of beauty -LRB- as of course one will guess -RRB- brought about a great deal that would make any plan of life look rather mean .

		Whatever kind of man he was and let us be glad of a chance not to take him for a typical American , great artist or not Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	presents him with his usual remarka - ble vitality .

		He seems to do this by a multi - tude of details that flow .

		from his pen as readily as ideas come from Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, and much more voluminously .

		This is a good thing ; it gives confidence .

		Compare Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	in this respect with another American novelist : Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	at a critical point of his hero 's career tells us that his religious beliefs underwent a change , caused by three months reading in books furnished by the head of the public library .

		What were the particular ideas and what were the par - ticular books we are , with a few exceptions , left to guess .

		But Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	, when -LRB- rather by the way -RRB-
Witla	LOCATION	becomes reconciled to some sort of religious feeling , tells us exactly what ideas he had and exactly what books he read .

		In half a dozen pages he puts a great mass of detail ; it may be good or bad , sound thinking or not , but there it is .

		If it is worth while you can look it up and see what it is all about .

		You do not have to take it on trust .

		That is the way with Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	, as a rule .

		He is generally '' there with the goods , '' as they say .

		Many do not care for what he offers , but at least he does offer it .

		And that is a great thing .

		It means an original imagination .

		We do not have a big figure struck out in outline from a set of ideas actually or conven - tionally held .

		We have a figure definitely conceived , doing this and that , thinking and feeling this and that ; but in all his thinking , feeling , and doing , quite definite , real , and vital , except in the one point mentioned , where perhaps Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	meant that his '' genius '' was not definite , real , and vital , and therefore necessitated the quotation-marks .

		In ''
Eltham House	ORGANIZATION	'' Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	had a subject which was certainly , as she con - ceived it , an immensely good one .

		She thought of the case of Lord
Holland	PERSON	, who in
1796	DATE	ran away with the wife of Sir
Godfrey Webster	PERSON	, and subsequently became a great figure in English social and political life : and in meditating on the questions involved , she thought of presenting the same case to-day .

		Would the twentieth century endure a man whom the nineteenth century had honored ?

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 423 What sort of change in manners and morals would the experiment bring forth ?

		It will be no surprise that
Lord Wing	ORGANIZATION	, when he tries to enter politics , finds that his alliance with a charming and able woman who had left her husband for him , constitutes an insuperable obstacle , in .

		spite of divorce and marriage .

		Most people would agree with Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	in her estimate of current feeling .

		Her book is rather disappointing , however , in that it does not really deal with the subject presented .

		Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	does not seem to try to give an adequate idea of how people at large feel about such matters .

		Lord Wing fails , almost by an accident , on the arousing of a senti - ment against him .

		which Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	presents in the main as narrow and prejudiced , if not mean .

		That may have been just what she meant to do .

		If she did , one would think that she misread public feeling ; if she did not , she hardly carried out her first idea .

		More prob - ably , however , Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	really gave little attention to the larger , the social , aspects of the case ; for most of her effort is given , and that successfully , to a presentation of the position of Lady Wing .

		The novel is really very little of a social document , but rather the picture of a personal experience .

		This is true .

		also , some will say , of Judge Grant 's new book . ''

		The High Priestess . ''

		It is the story of a woman of our day , a woman of ability and character , who is presented as having misunderstood the true direction of woman 's progress and as only reaching a true valuation of her own great powers after much trouble and difficulty .

		Here readers will dif - fer as to whether we have a particular story or a general case .

		I think the former , but the fact is one of sociology or current history rather than of literature .

		It is more than a generation , now , that Mr.
Grant	PERSON	has been an observer of society and a maker of books , and in that time his eye has not grown dim or his hand lost its cunning .

		He began as something of a satirist in a lighter way , and he has never quite lost the satirical touch .

		He continued in life in a profession that is almost of necessity mindful of general laws and regular precedents .

		Such a combination of influences , one might think , would render impossible either the exuberant ideality of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	or the elaborate imagi - nation of Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	or the personal sym - pathy of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	.

		But it gives other things quite as interesting , all sorts ' of pic - tures of manners and character ; so that the book is good reading even to those who do not care for its thesis .

		But it does not succeed in giving something which is lacking in the oth - ers as well , and which is very often lacking in the fiction of our day , namely , power of construction : ability so to order one 's mate - rial as to make the most telling effect on those who read .

		That is one of the great things of fiction , Mr.
James	PERSON	has it preeminently , and Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	and some others of our day .

		Any of the above books would be better with it , if they lost nothing else thereby .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS oxJSjsw BOOKS .

		If proof were required of the obvious fact that the intellec - tual and spiritual development of the human mind is taking place at present chiefly along the feminine side , it may be found in the number of first-rate contribu - tions to the study of religious psychology that are being offered by women writers .

		Following upon the excellent triad of books on Mysticism by Miss
Evelyn Underbill	PERSON	, we welcome Miss
Annie Lyman Sears	PERSON	's '' The Drama of the Spiritual Life '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The Introduction by Professor
Josiah Royce	PERSON	adds much to the interest of the work ; and though any conscious or intentional direction of Miss
Sears	ORGANIZATION	's arguments and conclusions is generously disavowed by Professor
Royce	PERSON	, it is not difficult for anyone who is acquainted with '' The Problem of Christianity '' and '' The Philosophy of Loyalty '' to trace the influence of the master on the pupil .

		Nor need this be regarded as in any sense a dero - gation from the claim to originality on the part of the writer .

		We are all in large part what our teachers have made us , and the highest service any writer can perform is to `` interpret '' the truth and focus the light generated through the spiritual experiences under which his own mind has been formed .

		In the opening chapter , Miss
Sears	ORGANIZATION	deals with religious idealism in a particularly satisfying manner , and reveals the distinguishing char - acteristic of Man as a creature who `` looks before and after , '' who creates ideals and is unhappy because of his inability to attain to them .

		How the ideal which is '' not his actual self but beyond his present self '' becomes sublimated into the concept of God , and this in turn '' becomes moralized and spiritualized into the Absolute Self , '' is discussed in a way that does no violence to the thought that the law of continuous evolution has ordered the course of spiritual as well as physical devel - opment .

		The consciousness of sin becoming ever more keen as ideals of perfection rise higher , is seen to be a natural corollary to growth in grace ; and its ultimate develop - 424 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 11	DATE	ment into that consciousness of moral re - sponsibility for the sins and oppressions of society which so strikingly characterizes mod - ern times , is shown to be what it is , a step toward the ultimate end of all religion , union with the beloved community .

		Very timely , however , is the warning that '' the emphasis on the social experience easily tends to the external and mechanical , and yet the conscious goal of the modern .

		social movement is not an external and mechanical one .

		It is in part brotherhood , but not merely broth - erhood .

		It is in part an emphasis on the enhancement of life , that is , on a value which is aesthetic and individual as well as social . '' ''

		Shall we not , '' our author asks , '' behold a new type of rebel ?

		The rebellion of the new day will come , I believe , not from the rebels against established religion , but from the idealists , the artists and poets , for it is these who to-day suffer under the authority of scientific-materialism and of social prac - tical life . ''

		If it does not seem ungracious to say so of a book that is good in every page , we could have wished it had been considera - bly shorter .

		When so much claims our atten - tion , it makes too great a draft upon time and thought to face nearly five hundred pages of closely printed matter of a kind that forbids '' judicious skipping . ''

		With this qualifica - tion , we estimate '' The Drama of the Spir - itual Life '' as among the most valuable of recent contributions to the subject dealt with .

		Problem , of Although the end of the great readjustment European war is not yet in sight , discussion of the probable results , economic , social , and political , and of the problems of reconstruction that must be faced by
Europe	LOCATION	after the conclusion of peace , has already begun .

		In a collection of essays entitled '' The Problems of Readjustment after the War '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , a group of dis - tinguished American professors has under - taken to forecast certain of these results , and to point out the problems of readjustment .

		Professor
Hart	PERSON	of
Harvard	LOCATION	, who is the editor of the volume , discusses some of the political transformations that have already occurred , particularly in respect to democracy , and some that are likely to take place in conse - quence of the war .

		He points out that the measures to which some of the belligerent governments have been compelled to resort have given a marked stimulus to Socialism , which as a principle has never before in the history of mankind won such a victory .

		The method of the war , he tells us , has given the Socialists ammunition for half a century to come by proving that the community can work more efficiently through collective effort than through individual effort .

		Whether the war will enhance the principle of representa - tive government depends in a large degree , he thinks , upon the success of republican
France	LOCATION	and democratic
England	LOCATION	.

		Finally , he asserts that there are certain lessons which we in
America	LOCATION	can learn from European ex - perience during the war , especially in regard to organization for defence .

		Professor
Selig	PERSON	- man of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	undertakes the more diffi - cult task of discovering the origins of the war in economic rather than in political causes .

		His economic interpretation of the war shows originality and insight , but his theory of causes is not entirely convincing .

		Professor Giddings , also of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, deals with the social aspects and results of the war , with particular reference to their bearing upon the future birth rate and the character of the offspring begotten by those left behind and the physically enfeebled who return .

		His conclusions are less pessimistic than those popularly held ; indeed , he is skeptical enough to doubt whether war greatly affects the course of natural selection .

		Professor
Wil	PERSON	- loughby of
Joljns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, in an essay on `` The Individual and the State / ' contrasts the German theory of state control with that which prevails in
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The German doctrine , which largely sacrifices the individual to the
State	ORGANIZATION	, possesses , he admits , elements of lofty ideal - ism , but it rests on a false assumption and demands sacrifices for which no real return is made .

		He agrees with Professor
Hart	PERSON	that if the extraordinary extension of state func - tions produces good results the regime will in many instances be continued after peace is established .

		Professor
Wilson	PERSON	of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	reviews the conduct of the belligerents in respect to their observance or non-observance of the laws of war , and points out possi - ble modifications in the existing rules that may be necessary on account of the new agencies and methods of warfare .

		One of the most valuable essays in the volume is that by Professor
Emory R. Johnson	PERSON	of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, who considers the financial and commercial aspects of the war and the probable results on international trade , the rate of interest , investments , credit , etc. .

		Professor
Johnson	PERSON	thinks the interest rate will undoubtedly be higher , that there will be ` an abnormal inflation of credit , that the American supply of gold will be greatly reduced , that a period of business depression will in all likelihood follow the war .

		and that there will probably be a marked rise in the tide of immigration .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 425 From
Waterloo	LOCATION	to
Liege	LOCATION	.

		The fourth and concluding : vol - ume of Mr.
Arthur D. Innes	PERSON	's `` History of
England	LOCATION	and the British Empire '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- covers the full and intensely interesting period from
1802	DATE	to
1914	DATE	, and has been finished since the beginning of the '' ^ schylean drama '' now being enacted upon the stage of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Thus the writing of this volume has laid upon the author the task of opening and closing his narrative with the circumstance of a general European war .

		His treatment , at the outset , of the Napoleonic struggle has the advantage of a century of historical perspective ; the volume ends with a nine-page epilogue which outlines the well known events from
1911	DATE	to the outbreak of hostilities among the protagonists of the pres - ent war .

		The account of the military and economic conditions leading to the Peace of
Amiens	LOCATION	, which opens the first of the eleven chapters of the book , shows very clearly that
England	LOCATION	's re-entrance into the continental upheaval was self-defensive .

		Napoleon 's pur - pose to absorb the small states of
Holland	LOCATION	and
Switzerland	LOCATION	, as well as the little princi - palities of
Germany	LOCATION	, involved the presump - tion that the affairs of the continent were no concern of
England	LOCATION	's .

		This imperial attitude led to the conflict that ended at
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		As the student of this period reads again , in Mr.
Innes	PERSON	's well written account , the story of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's attempt at imperial expansion by conquest , he will find himself reflecting upon how far the French and German positions of a century ago have changed places , and to what extent the political principle on which insular
England	LOCATION	then fought
France	LOCATION	is re - asserting itself in the present `` pentacost of calamity . ''

		Mr.
Innes	PERSON	traces the story of
Britain	LOCATION	's succession of great changes during the century in politics , industry , and litera - ture .

		His treatment of persons and events is admirable in proportion , and his style is always free from obscurity and iteration .

		His judgments on the greater English writers are expressed with dignity and with insight , and he speaks clearly and sympathetically throughout of the growth of democracy among the English people .

		As he reaches the latter half of his story , however , his comment at points becomes less satisfactory .

		This is par - ticularly true of his treatment of foreign affairs .

		His exposition , for example , of the '' Trent affair '' is somewhat misleading .

		A mere statement of facts without comment would have been better .

		There seems to be no real ground for the phrase that
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's position in the matter , which averted war , was `` yielded , though with an ill grace '' -LRB- page 303 -RRB- .

		This statement , as well as another on page 460 to the effect that Presi - dent
Cleveland	LOCATION	's attitude in the
Canadian Fisheries Treaty	ORGANIZATION	and the Venezuelan dispute '' was an electioneering move , '' and that Lord
Salisbury	PERSON	's management of the affair was un - influenced '' by the blatancy of the presiden - tial appeal , '' is too journalistic for historical purposes .

		Mr.
Innes	PERSON	's volume is rendered still more useful by the addition of an ab - stract of a recently issued report of the British Admiralty stating in detail the tac - tics employed by
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	and
Collingwood	ORGANIZATION	at
Trafalgar	ORGANIZATION	.

		The abstract is accompanied by a good diagram exhibiting the relative posi - tions of the French and English at the point of attack , as well as the relative parts played by the two English commanders in the battle .

		Platitude , Dr -
Charles W. Eliot	PERSON	's `` The for the college Training for an Effective Life '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a compact little volume containing seven lectures or addresses to students .

		When one recalls some of the classic utterances to students by
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and others , one realizes all that such exhortations to the higher life by a veteran scholar might be , and one regrets the more that such exhortations should contain any - thing that savors of the merely platitudinous .

		In few sentences does Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's book rise above the level of
Samuel Smiles	ORGANIZATION	's '' Self - Help . ''

		The Englishman 's heaven of `` Getting on '' is too persistently held before the mind of the reader .

		One is forced to recall
Ruskin	PERSON	's scathing satire on that idea of '' advancement in life '' which means having a visitor 's and servant 's bell at one 's door , and his sugges - tion that advancement in life conceived in such terms may mean literally '' advancement in death '' ; or that the most pathetic life - failures are to be found among what the world calls the effective successes .

		We are distressed , also , by one or two obvious slips which amount almost to a descent into the grotesque .

		On page 5 the author defines an honorable man as `` one who never oppresses or cheats a person that is weaker or poorer than himself . ''

		We had assumed that an honorable man is equally scrupulous in his dealings with the powerful and rich .

		Again , the student is enjoined to `` associate with your superiors rather than with your infe - riors ; this is an excellent rule on which to select your friends . ''

		The obvious rejoinder is that this may turn out to be rather hard upon our superiors ; and that the altruism which Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	assures his readers `` is an important element in the enjoyment of most kinds of work , '' might suggest seeking the companionship of our inferiors for the infe - 426 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 11	DATE	riors ' sake if not for our own .

		Some one has said of Jesus that he not only loved the poor and outcast ; he did more , he liked them , and preferred their company to that of the rich and powerful .

		Perhaps Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	intends his injunction to point to our spiritual superiors , regardless of wealth , education , or social status ; but we fear that most readers of his address entitled '' The Character of a Gentle - man '' will hardly interpret his words in this way .

		On the whole , this little book does nothing to enhance the high estimate in which Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	is held , and for that reason we could have wished it had not been published .

		Favorites in poetry and fiction .

		`` A Book of Preferences in Lit - erature '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Eugene Mason	PERSON	, is well named .

		The author presents a few of his favorites in poetry and fiction , and tells why they are his favorites .

		The list contains ten names :
M. Anatole France	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, Guy de Mau - passant ,
Jose-Maria de Heredia	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	,
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	,
Paul Verlaine	PERSON	,
Francis Thompson	PERSON	,
Walter Pater	PERSON	, and the author of the '' Roman de Brut / ' The second and third names figure prominently in a chap - ter on '' The Short Story , '' in which is traced the development of that form of literary art and it is asserted that
England	LOCATION	shares with
France	LOCATION	the glory of having revived the conte in the
last quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	, with no slightest reference to
America	LOCATION	's nota - ble contribution to this species of literature .

		The author .

		of ''
Sylvestre Bonnard	PERSON	'' is made to serve as an example of '' the complete scep - tic , ''
Heredia	PERSON	is `` the poet as artist , '' Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	is '' the poet as mystic , ''
Christina Ros	PERSON	- setti and
Paul Verlaine	PERSON	appear as '' two
Chris	PERSON	- tian poets , ''
Francis Thompson	PERSON	as '' a Catholic poet , '' ``
Walter Pater	PERSON	is exalted , as a master of English , to an eminence not below that of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, and
Newman	PERSON	, and ``
Wace	ORGANIZATION	's name heads a hitherto unpublished introduc - tion to the
King Arthur	PERSON	portion of the `` Roman de Brut . ''

		The atmosphere of the little volume is that of refined taste and care - ful scholarship , and in its style the book is a refreshing oasis in the desert of arid medi - ocrity of facile English .

		Admirably expres - sive is the author 's characterization of the sonnet as viewed by the average reader . ''

		I believe , '' he says , `` the public considers the sonnet a very hard boiled egg at best . ''

		No one would think of applying Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's playful metaphor of quackery to the kindly and venerable author of the sayings in `` An Art Philosopher 's Cabinet '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- ; yet many The
Harold Bell Wright	PERSON	of art criticism .

		of these sayings show a parallelism with the quotations from best-selling novels that Mr.
Wister	PERSON	has adduced .

		Mr.
George Lansing Raymond	PERSON	's books on aesthetic subjects have become so many , it seems , that a chrestomathy is necessary , to supplement the compendium already issued .

		The congenial task of prepar - ing it has fallen to his disciple , Mr.
Marion Mills Miller	PERSON	, who shows the same appreciation as in his earlier four-hundred-page classified selection from Mr.
Raymond	PERSON	's poetical works .

		A semester under
Theodor Vischer	PERSON	.

		which convinced him that the basis of art is expres - sion , a sympathetic reading of
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		an astonishing accumulation of curious lore , together with a sound piety of character , have been Mr.
Raymond	PERSON	's equipment in writing his voluminous system of comparative aesthetics .

		The
Burlington	LOCATION	''
Hawkeye	LOCATION	, '' '' The Christian Register , '' and '' The Fireside , '' with some more sophisticated periodicals , have united in acclaiming the successive volumes , as the pub - lishers recite with pardonable gratification .

		For those who have not had the leisure to read them , we may quote the following statement by Mr.
Miller	PERSON	of one of his author 's most important fundamental propositions : '' The primary and most universal endeavor of the imagination when influenced by the artistic tendency is to form an image that is made to seem a unity by comparing and grouping together effects that , when seen or heard , are recognized to be wholly or partially alike . ''

		Those who wish an inspiring and reverent treatment of artistic topics incidental to the main theme , can not do better than refer to the sections under such rubrics as '' Fads in Art , '' '' Nude Art , '' and so on .

		As the
Buf	LOCATION	- falo '' Courier '' says of the companion vol - ume . ''

		The compiler has done fine work . ''

		The disease of lying .

		Dr. and Mrs.
William Healy	PERSON	have written an interesting and significant book under the title , `` Pathological Lying , Accusation , and Swin - dling , '' which forms the initial number of the `` Criminal Science Monographs '' -LRB- Little .


Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Of the nineteen cases of '' normal '' mentality here dealt with , in which at least the lying is the central symptom and in some cases the total abnormality , all but one are young women -LRB- ages mostly sixteen to nineteen . -RRB-

		Thus it will be seen that the mal - ady is a strikingly feminine failing ; which means that the masculine counterpart of the kindred disorder takes a different form .

		One girl comes with a pathetic story of family tragedy ; another is a mystery to herself and friends : a third simulates illness and makes the rounds of the hospitals : a fourth accuses
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 427 her father of immorality and also indulges in shoplifting ; a fifth confesses to her professor that she has killed a man ; a sixth indulges in wild romancing about all sorts of exploits ; a seventh is plainly incorrigible and includes lying among her bad habits ; the eighth , ninth , tenth , and the rest range from mild falsifica - tion , petty swindling , accusing self and others of imaginary crimes with elaboration of de - tails , to most serious criminal violations and charges .

		From beginning to end it is a tissue of lies , and , until the clue is found , a baffling one .

		Many of these cases come forward in the courts or in preliminary legal investiga - tion , when testimony is contradictory or scan - dal seems unfounded .

		Society has an interest in such offenders ; and the clear connection in many cases with subnormal mentality estab - lishes the close relation of such vagaries with mental deviation .

		Dr.
Healy	PERSON	seems inclined to limit the diagnosis of hysteria to cases with marked major or bodily symptoms , and thus loses the chance to expand the hysterical concept to precisely fit his cases .

		The self - centred mentality , the alliance with the sex - impulse , the desire for attention , interest , sensation , the weak hold of the objective world , the indulgence in romancing , make a classic picture of the hysterical culture-bed .

		As a fact , his cases have simply carried the issue to a more dramatic conclusion .

		They ap - proach the borderland , and some belong on the yonder side .

		The feminine quality of the complex is equally convincing , as is also the occasional alliance with nervous symptoms equally characteristic of the feminine liabil - ity .

		The collection of cases is valuable , and the interpretation restrained and objective .

		The facts are available for some interesting psychological and sociological conclusions .

		History of dubious value .

		It is reported that when the
Kaiser	PERSON	sent his soldiers to
China	LOCATION	in the year of the Boxer uprising , he counselled them to terrorize the Chinese as the Huns terrorized the people of
Europe	LOCATION	in the
fifth century	DATE	.

		The story may be mythical , but Englishmen find it very credible just now and frequently refer to the German soldiers as Huns .

		In order to prove that the appellation is not without its justifi - cation , Mr.
Edward Hutton	PERSON	has written a vol - ume on `` Attila and the Huns '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , in which
Attila	ORGANIZATION	's policy of '' f rightf ulness '' is illustrated by the citing of recent events and parallels .

		The author also accepts and con - tends for the theory that the Prussians are of Finnic origin , and consequently of the same race as the Huns .

		We do not know much about
Attila	PERSON	's career , so his story is soon told ; to lengthen the book somewhat , the author has published his sources , which comprise about one-third of the volume .

		If these were translated , their introduction might be of real value ; but there seems to be but little justifi - cation for printing Latin documents in a book which is evidently intended for popular con - sumption .

		In his account of the preliminaries of the battle of Chalons .

		which , by the way , was also fought on the
Marne	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	takes occasion to rebuke the Americans for their failure to assist the allies : `` The
Visi	PERSON	- goths replied as
America	LOCATION	is doing to-day : ' It is not our business ; see you to it . ' ''

		Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	's history can have no value , and can serve no purpose except to stir up hatred ; but unfortunately it is to be feared that in this respect it will not differ from much of the history to be written during the next decade .

		As seen from the editor 's sanctum .

		Rather unusual must be the cir - cumstances justifying the pub - lication of a four-hundred-page volume of short editorials on questions of the day that is , of the day on which they sev - erally were written .

		But the publishers -LRB-
George H. Doran Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of `` National Flood - marks : Week by Week Observations on American Life as Seen by
Collier	PERSON	's '' would doubtless maintain that ''
Collier	PERSON	's '' is no ordinary newspaper - , and in fact the editor of the book , Mr.
Mark Sullivan	PERSON	, takes pains to inform the reader that no perfunctory utterances have ever been allowed to deaden the vivacity of that weekly 's editorial col - umns .

		Each article is `` the sincere expres - sion of either a conviction or a mood , '' and not `` written to order , '' he earnestly assures us .

		These selected expressions of convictions and moods run back over four years and are grouped under twenty-three general headings , making a total of about three hundred more or less piquant paragraphs on topics not yet of purely antiquarian interest .

		Admirers of Mr.
Norman Hapgood	PERSON	's trenchant style might wish the volume to have been extended so as to cover an even longer period .

		There is , however , good reading in plenty , of the sort here indicated , in the present collection .

		True stories of the deaf and the blind .

		Miss
Margaret Prescott Mon	PERSON	- tague tells a number of pathetic and moving stories about some of the little deaf children and blind children whom she has learned to know as only a sym - pathetic teacher -LRB- next to a loving mother -RRB- can know them .

		`` Closed Doors '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- she appropriately names this collection of first-hand narratives from a certain State school for the deaf and blind .

		Touching in - 428 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 11	DATE	deed is the story she tells of the little deaf and dumb boy who heroically and successfully struggled to articulate the one word that gave ecstasies of rapture to his blind mother when next she visited him at the school .

		Equally moving is the account of the deaf boy threat - ened with blindness and vainly trying to wipe away the darkness from his eyes .

		The pompous and unfeeling Mr.
Prouty	PERSON	, head of the
Board of Control	ORGANIZATION	and an astute politician , is also well portrayed ; one is glad to see , in the end , that the piteous sights before him do finally move him to some show of feeling .

		Dr.
Richard C. Cabot	PERSON	warmly commends the book in an appreciative preface .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Publication of the late
Francis Fisher Browne	PERSON	's '' Every-Day Life of Lincoln '' has been taken over by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons , and the book is now issued in a new and cheaper edition .

		Since its first appearance , nearly thirty years ago , this work has gradually taken precedence in popular - ity over all other biographies of
Lincoln	LOCATION	; and the excellent form of this new edition , combined with the low price , will undoubtedly ensure for it a still wider circle of readers than it has hitherto had .

		A fine photogravure reproduction of Mar - shall 's portrait of
Lincoln	LOCATION	is included as a frontis - piece , and there are two other portraits in the volume .

		One of the latest school texts in English history is the '' Short History of
England	LOCATION	and the British Empire '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , by Professor
Laurence M. Lar	PERSON	- son of the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	.

		This book covers the field adequately for secondary schools .

		It is written in a clear and direct style , and constitutes one of the most readable texts in its class , at the same time producing the impression of a scholarly acquaintance with the sources .

		The industrial and social facts , as well as the political , are dealt with .

		There are nearly seven hundred pages in the vol - ume , and a number of illustrations are included .

		As a text for high schools , it will doubtless meet with general favor .

		The momentous events now transpiring in the Far East make timely the new edition of Sir
William Muir	PERSON	's `` The Caliphate : Its Rise , De - cline , and Fall . ''

		First issued in
1883	DATE	, the book at once became the standard treatment in English of its subject .

		Subsequent editions appeared in
1891	DATE	and
1899	DATE	, and now Mr.
T. H. Weir	PERSON	has given the work a thorough revision .

		Among the changes which he introduces are the adoption of the system of Arabic transliteration followed by the
Royal Asiatic Society	ORGANIZATION	, the incorporation of many observations from
Wellhausen	ORGANIZATION	's `` Das Ara - bische
Reich	PERSON	und
Sein Sturz	PERSON	, '' and the compilation of an up-to-date bibliography .

		The publisher , Mr.
John Grant	PERSON	of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, has given this new edition a most attractive and workmanlike setting .

		NOTES .

H. C. Chatfield	PERSON	-
Taylor	PERSON	's scholarly biography of Goldoni will be published at once by

		512 `` JUST A NICE STORY . ''

		The old-fashioned woman of a generation ago used always to be looking for that isle of safety in the perilous thoroughfare of current fiction which she called the `` sweet pretty story . ''

		Her mother had escaped to it from unpleasant writers like
Thackeray	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	.

		She herself sought refuge there from the deeper distresses of
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, the shocking young cynicism of Kipling , and those new importations , from
France	LOCATION	and Rus - sia of the strange thing called realism , which showed only too plainly what a dreadful state foreigners must be in .

		A quaint figure now : and yet not all her daughters have outgrown her .

		From the novels of sex , of crime , of sophistication , of the supernatured man and the denatured woman , they still , in their thou - sands , look for relief to the white-and-gold volume with the red-haired girl on the cover ; and they pass it on , murmuring more or less shamefacedly -LRB- for it is frightfully unfashion - able to be innocent -RRB- that it is `` just a nice story . ''

		Now the critic , in his crusty moods , or at moments when his virility obliges him to cor - rect female members of his family , is wont to dispose of this kind of commodity as '' mush , '' or peradventure '' slush . ''

		He builds a fence , and barbs it stiffly , between true idealism , the stuff of which manly life and manly imagina - tion are made , and the insipid sentimentalism with which the ladies , and the ladylike gen - tlemen , love to confound it .

		But even the critic , unless he is fairly frozen in among his categories , must have his more responsive or relenting moments .

		In these days , when authoresses pride themselves upon being vir - ile , it is a relief , now and then , to own the soft impeachment of parlor romance , to taste the lucent syrups of the sentimentalist .

		Granted that the `` pretty '' story is often sickish to a robust appetite ; nevertheless has it not its proper place in the diet ?

		There is a balance to be kept : the gamijiess of the game course , the altitude of the cheese , de - mand offsets at the other extreme of the palate .

		What is the genesis of the nice story ?

		I suggest that it is time for some budding Ph.D. .

		472 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 25	DATE	to make a serious study of it -LRB- very serious it must be , with tables and diagrams -RRB- for the academic mart .

		Unless she were very ambi - tious , she might make shift with a start in Sanskrit or
Pali	ORGANIZATION	literature .

		The tale of
Ruth	PERSON	would edge her along through the somewhat grim Hebrew pages .


Greece	LOCATION	, handled with discretion , would respond more liberally to her coaxing hand .


Rome	LOCATION	, I fear , would hold off a little ; sweetness and prettiness were not much in the Roman line .

		For the middle ages , the tale of Griselda hangs on the peril - ous edge of tragedy ; but the lady is the real sort , and everything turns out right in the end ; Boccacio could be as pretty as you please when he was not happening to be naughty .

		The days of Elizabeth were not too spaciously masculine to produce several of the nicest stories in the world .

		Rosalind was prototype of how many hundreds of virtuous daring heroines ?

		Viola , her damask cheek not more than becomingly ravaged by con - cealment , her humor -LRB- as
Rosalind	PERSON	's is not -RRB- always subject to her sentiment , is nearer the sweet pretty type , while
Perdita	PERSON	and
Miranda	PERSON	are perfect embodiments of it .

		There was not much chance in the days of Dry - den and
Congreve	ORGANIZATION	.

		The eighteenth century trickled its damper sentiment through the channel of the so-called
Eastern Tale	ORGANIZATION	, that queer concoction of sickly sentiment and pre - posterous action , concerning persons with names which no longer figure in print except on the covers of cigarette-boxes .

		And of course there was `` Paul and
Virginia	LOCATION	, '' not too tragic in the end for the lachrymose taste of the time .

		This is all very sketchy and doubtless inac - curate , and will , I fear , only suggest to our aspirant for academic honors the way in which the thing ought not to be done .

		Any - how , I am sure she will find more prettiness and niceness in the nineteenth century than in all the others put together .

		Of course the lachrymose habit persisted in its earlier years yes , well into its middle .

		If you will look into any of those quaint annuals which flour - ished in the forties and fifties , the Tokens , and Souvenirs , and Books of Gems , you will observe that the happy ending as a requisite of the nice story is a relatively modern affair .

		People loved to have
Little Nell	ORGANIZATION	die by inches , under a pink light .

		Poets were encouraged to warble about their pleasing woe and their cherished despair .

		It was at least as popular to kill a pair of lovers in each other 's arms -LRB- preferably by lightning -RRB- as to land them at the altar .

		But a little later in
Victoria	LOCATION	's reign fashions changed , melancholy ceased to be a preferred pleasure ; the kiss curtain , as they say in dramatic circles , came in once more .

		The light that never was on sea or land was spotted upon the happy pair at that supreme instant of tableau when happiness has not begun to be menaced by the grocer , the cradle , or the third member of the triangle .

		We saw them married , and we left it to them to be happy ever after .

		However dismally , in real life , we might be bored by the young lady who has just struck a final balance between her skirts and her back hair , or the young gentleman who has just `` graduated , '' we , or the females of our species , were well content to philander with them for a season , in print .

		For they are youth , ourselves as we are , have been , or might have been .

		Therefore the silly and wonderful time that links adoles - cence to the hour of mating is the one age of man which is of universal interest .

		Hence the enormous and hardly yet dimin - ishing popularity of '' Little Women . ''

		Here , if you like , is the nice story , the pretty story , the story that leaves a pleasant taste in one 's mouth .

		If it is capable of furnishing mate - rial , now and then , for '' a good cry , '' and if its sentiment is unabashedly Victorian , it lived and still lives chiefly in an atmosphere of harmless laughter .

		Miss
Alcott	PERSON	's world is an undergraduate world without cynicism , a '' flapper '' world which somehow escapes silli - ness , the world of immortal youth at some - thing approaching its best .

		That world has its rightful limitation .

		When its young fig - ures have passed in pairs up the church steps , and we have lingered a moment to hear the strains of Mendelssohn or '' The Voice that Breathed o'er Eden , '' we may well let the curtain fall .

		We have had the cream of life , never mind about the skimmed milk .

		For our purposes , at least , the hero and heroine , having discharged , with the act of mating , the supreme function of youth , have rightly ceased to be .

		Against this view of life let the realists rage .

		Turning an ingenuous ear , we simply perceive that they are talking about some - thing else .

		Life happens to interest them chiefly in other phases .

		They are willing to admit that puberty and the act of mating are episodes of physiological and racial import ;
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 473 but they find more absorbing themes in the physiology or psychology of marriage as a state , in the devious conduct of the `` ever after '' if , indeed , they condescend to treat life in themes rather than in slices or in hunks !

		Well , there is no real matter for argument here , is there ?

		It all comes down to the old brass tacks of preference .

		And one is not invariably a silly ass because he fails to be a curmudgeon .

		Some people like to grit their teeth and stare at things , others like to shut their eyes and dream of them .

		It is a ques - tion of mood , with a great many of us .

		The sweet pretty story , reduced to its elements , is merely a sort of easy and soothing substitute for poetry , prepared for what used to be called the boudoir .

		It is a literature for the emotional toilet , and very useful in restoring -LRB- for the moment at least -RRB- the bloom and perfume of life .

		In its purest form , I have said , it deals with young love and its immediate conse - quences the license , the ring , and the mar - riage-peal .

		This article is warranted to soothe the tenderest emotional cuticle .

		But there are variants .

		One of them pushes the action back into infancy , and represents the little child -LRB- in a blue sash and gold ringlets -RRB- leading them .

		Nowadays , to be sure , she often leads them by the nose .

		The old theory of her as an influence powerful through its very weakness and innocence is exploded .

		She is now very much '' in the know , '' the family oracle and censor ex officio .

		It is she who persuades poor father to give up playing auction for money which she can so ill afford ; it is she who reveals to dear mother that it is her own fault poor father is drifting away ; it is she who tells grandfather just what she thinks of him for his treatment of big brother .

		And father and mother and grandfather are all tickled to pieces , when they come to think it over .

		Or it is the fine manly little fellow who , not yet in his teens , supports his wid - owed mother and orphaned sisters , and stops the runaway which is hurling the sash and ringlets to their last home , and they are the daughter of the President of the
Bank	ORGANIZATION	, and everybody knows the rest .

		A queer cult of precocious love-making is important in this kind of yarn .

		It does not hesitate to extend the range of mating-sentiment clear below the bounds of adolescence .

		Another popular variant of the pretty story owes its fascination to its activity in pushing this same sentiment along in the other direction .

		I recall a story hailed enthu - siastically the other day by lovers of the sweet pretty .

		It was about an aged pair , wed for many years , who call each other Pelleas and Etarre , and whose chief occupa - tion turns out to be making eyes at each other and otherwise going through the exercises proper to a normal and healthy - calf-love .

		I thought it rather indecent , myself an ex - treme instance of the kind of thing which I suppose represents a reaction against the sor - did or squalid aspects of marriage as shown up by the gloomier realists .

		The reaction is legitimate enough , up to a certain point .

		The natural way to see a thing is with the naked eye .

		But if some people are going to use a glass , and to insist on looking through the uncomplimentary end of it , there will natu - rally be other people to reverse the process .

		If some people are going to be forever telling us that all of the sweet sentiment of life van - ishes during the honeymoon , other people are sure to try to persuade us that none of it need ever escape or be transmuted .

		There are a goodly number of writers now producing nice stories along this line , stories eagerly or wistfully piping the tune of domes - tic sentiment .

		Were not we , after all , mis - taken in our readiness to bury romance at the altar ?

		Has youth , in truth , such a monopoly of heart-interest ?

		Do home and mother necessarily mean haircloth and a red shawl ?

		By no means , cry these gospellers any more than they mean a bridge-table and a make-up .

		Look !

		here is happiness in your thirties and forties .

		Here is the kind of fiction in which tired and middle-aged women may find a sweet flattery , which let no man grudge them .

		Here is no pretty fancy out of the faded past , but a dream based upon real life as they know it .

		It is a vision of humdrum colored by romance : themselves and their surround - ings bathed in a rosy light of sentiment ; the everyday worjid of housewife and commuter blown upon by consciously wholesome airs of `` idealism '' ; a world , in short , where being good is really being happy , and loving one 's neighbor the popular sport .

		Yes , it is easy enough for us to make fun of this kind of commodity it is not the lit - erature upon which men 's souls are fed .

		But it has its function .

		If we are going to look 474 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 25	DATE	upon the world as it is not , we may quite as profitably see it the color of a rosebank as the color of a dunghill .

		After all , daydreams are better medicine for tired hearts than night - mares are .

		We may safely let mother have her sweetmeat .

		Lord knows , we shall have plenty of stories left that are neither sweet nor pretty nor nice !

		MAXIM GORKY 'S SON , AND OTHER COMING
EURO	ORGANIZATION	- PEAN LECTURERS IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		M.
JULES Bois	PERSON	's NEW NOVEL .

		THE LATE REMY DE GOURMONT .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		One day
last summer	DATE	when I came into one of the smaller wards of our American
Ambu	ORGANIZATION	- lance at
Neuilly	LOCATION	, where I go afternoons to write letters for the wounded , I noticed a little table alongside of that of the nurse , heaped with books and writing materials .

		A few days later I found seated behind this table
M. Zenovi Pechkoff	PERSON	,
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	's son , a ner - vous , energetic young man of perhaps twenty - five , whose left arm had been amputated close up at the shoulder , for he has been for many months a soldier in the first regiment of the
French Foreign Legion	ORGANIZATION	.

		Perhaps I may say in passing that my own son is also a member of this regiment , which has seen some of the hardest fighting on the western front .


M. Peehkoff	PERSON	, who has been decorated for bravery and has an honorable discharge from the army , is now residing near
Genoa	LOCATION	, and is engaged in delivering lectures in
Italy	LOCATION	on the war and writing out for publication his im - pressions and experiences at the front , these latter being of no ordinary nature . ''

		I have had an informal invitation , '' he tells me , `` to lecture in the
United States	LOCATION	; and if the offer takes definite shape , I will go . ''

		I seized the opportunity at one of our meetings to ask
M. Pechkoff	PERSON	if there was any truth in the rather surprising statement contained in `` Who 's Who '' for the present year , that Gorky had '' enlisted in the Russian army , '' and his reply was much what I expected , '' Gorky has not only not enlisted in the Rus - sian army , but is hard at work at his usual literary occupations in a town in
Finland	LOCATION	. ''

		Another possible early foreign lecturer in
America	LOCATION	is the Belgian publicist , Professor
Celestin Demblon	PERSON	, who always writes proudly after his name , '' Depute de
Liege	LOCATION	. ''

		He will be remembered perhaps less to his credit as the author of the theory that
Lord Rutland	LOCATION	was the writer of the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	plays .

		The fact is that he was on the point of starting on an American lecture tour on this subject when the war broke out . ''

		But I may go over when the peace comes , '' he said to me in
Paris	LOCATION
last spring	DATE	.

		M. Demblon is now in
London	LOCATION	nego - tiating for an English translation of his magnum opus , `` Lord
Rutland	LOCATION	est Shake - speare '' and `` L'Auteur d'Hamlet et son Monde , '' while engaged in seeing through the press , also in English dress , his latest book , `` La Guerre a
Liege	LOCATION	. ''

		M. Demblon was in the noble little city all through the memorable month of
August	DATE	of last year , and his family is still hedged in there .

		And before I dismiss the subject of
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- peans lecturing in
America	LOCATION	, I should add that
M. Jules Bois	PERSON	is just back from a several months ' sojourn in the
United States	LOCATION	, where I understand he had a really remarkable suc - cess on the platform and in drawing-rooms . ''

		I am going back shortly , '' he wrote me from
Bordeaux	LOCATION	on landing
last month	DATE	, which shows that he feels that he had a good time there .

		Since then I have spent a most inter - esting afternoon with him , when he gave me a resume of his next novel , '' The Woman who Killed , '' which Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		are to bring out this season in
New York	LOCATION	.

		The book , written especially for the American public and based largely on
M. Bois	PERSON	's expe - riences on your side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, will , if published in
France	LOCATION	, have quite another and more commonplace title , '' L'Impitoyable . ''

		In fact it is in the
United States	LOCATION	that the volume will probably attract the most readers , and I venture to predict that the number will be large , for it is unquestionably a powerful story , which will certainly provoke contro - versy .

		The heroine , Mrs.
Cynthia Maitland	PERSON	, `` the type of the super-lady , '' as
M. Bois	PERSON	describes her , first appears on the scene as a nurse at the
American Ambulance	ORGANIZATION	already referred to .

		The two other chief characters are Frenchmen ,
Michel d'Aulnieres	PERSON	, the hero of the tale , an officer who has invented a remarkable gun ; and Lavisor , '' a great mor - alist , who has become a sort of mystic because of the war . ''

		The development of the per - sonality of Mrs.
Maitland	PERSON	is the feature of the book ; and though she certainly will not wholly please the New Woman , the New Woman will find not a little comfort in the fact that it is the heroine who stands forth the stronger , and the hero the weaker , vessel .

		Though the late
Remy de Gourmont	PERSON	, who died at the very end of
last month	DATE	, never lec - tured in
America	LOCATION	and never dreamed of doing so , he was , at a certain period of his life , quite `` at home '' in some of the drawing - rooms of the
Paris American Colony	ORGANIZATION	.

		During
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 475 the last half of the eighties , he was par - ticularly assiduous at the house of a wealthy American widow who had three or four very - pretty marriageable daughters .

		He there sounded his title of Marquis for all that it was worth , probably for more than it was worth , and was even seen waltzing with the hostess 's girls .

		I will never forget this waltz - ing .

		Remy de Gourmont had a short , rather stoutish body , was awkward in his move - ments , wore clothes without any cut , always had his trousers '' ` up for high tide , '' as a young American said , and then went whirling around like a top , French fashion , without ever reversing .

		All these strange things , doubly strange in the
Remy de Gourmont	ORGANIZATION	whom we knew later , happened before he was known as a writer ; and he was brought into this stylish circle by his bonne amie of that day , who became his faithful Egeria at the end , a pleasant niece of the well-known French sculptor Clesinger -LRB- 1814-84 -RRB- , son-in-law of George Sand , and whose fine statue of his famous mother-in-law is one of the art treasures of the foyer of the Theatre f ranc.ais .

		This very slight connection with
Nohant	ORGANIZATION	and its group gave a dash of literary color to the early life of
Remy de Gourmont	ORGANIZATION	, even before he began himself to write .

		But what suddenly made him a full - fledged man of letters was one of his first contributions to the '' Mercure de
France	LOCATION	, '' of which , by the way , he was one of the eleven founders , and where all his volumes have been published , for the `` Mercure '' has a book - publishing department , and where he wrote almost uninterruptedly for twenty-five years , the last article from his pen appearing there on the very day of his funeral .

		In
1891	DATE	he there aired his views on Patriotism , and boldly declared that he cared no more for Alsace-Lorraine than for the ashes of his cigarette .

		Thereupon the ultra-patriotic li - brarian of the
National Library	ORGANIZATION	, where
M. de Gourmont	PERSON	was one of the assistants , and where he might have continued down to the present day engaged in passing out books to the public , ruthlessly discharged him .

		Yet
Remy de Gourmont	PERSON	was at bottom a good enough patriot , as is sufficiently proved by his book , `` Pendant 1 ` Orage , '' issued recently by Champion .

		Furthermore , his article was really a protest against the braggings of
Paul Deroulede	PERSON	and his group , who were always bent on plunging
France	LOCATION	into a war with
Germany	LOCATION	, with what result we see only too clearly to-day .

		So , to use a vulgar but expressive phrase , the over-zealous director of the National Li - brary kicked
Remy de Gourmont	PERSON	up into the galaxy of contemporary French authors , where he has become one of the most brilliant stylists of the present generation .

		His French is clear-cut and pure , and he was always sure of himself .

		M.
Andre Fontainas	PERSON	, however , said to me very truly as we left the church after the funeral : `` He was not an inventor of style , a finder of images , a turner of happy phrases , which create new relations between ideas by means of words . ''

		Nor does this delicate Belgian poet think that '' because of its style would one , after reading a para - graph of
Remy de Gourmont	ORGANIZATION	, be likely to exclaim , ' That 's de Gourmont , ' as one can say , ` That 's Voltaire , or Renan , or Flaubert . ' ''

		The social change that came over
Remy de Gourmont	PERSON	when he rose to the rank of a lead - ing writer should also be pointed out .

		When he stopped dancing in the
American Colony	ORGANIZATION	, he shut his door on society and practically never '' went out '' again .

		The last time I saw him ,
several years ago	DATE	, was when I called on him in his plain , huddled-up , bachelor quar - ters in the old Rue des Saints-Peres .

		The whole place looked like the pictures of those ancient astrologers , wrapped in big morning - gowns something like Balzac in
Falguiere	LOCATION	's statue in the
Avenue Friedland	LOCATION	, and buried among their books and papers .

		And how his face had changed since the eighties !

		The victim of some skin disease , I believe , his features had become really repulsive , and this repulsiveness was increased by the remedy that the doctors had had recourse to , the burning of the cheeks in such a way that they were covered with many ugly little scars .

		This physical state alone would have checked
Remy de Gourmont	ORGANIZATION	from entering a drawing - room again , even if he had wished to do so , which , however , was not the case .

		While I of course admire the intellectual
Remy de Gour	PERSON	- mont of the post
National Library	ORGANIZATION	epoch , I have always felt a discreet preference for the modest , kindly , gentle , young Marquis de Gourmont of the ante `` Mercure de
France	LOCATION	''
THEODORE STANTON	PERSON	.


Paris	LOCATION	,
October 25 , 1915	DATE	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE DRAMATIC RENASCENCE is the subject of a notable contribution to the current '' North American Review '' from Mr.
Thomas H. Dickinson	PERSON	, who pays especial tribute to Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	as a prominent fig - ure in this encouraging development .

		Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	joyfully proclaims the rebirth as an accomplished fact , and continues : `` Be - 476 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 25	DATE	ginning with
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's respectful words written in ' The Nineteenth Century ' for
1879	DATE	the first respectful words spoken for the modern English drama by an acknowl - edged critic of our day the consideration of drama has grown more and more familiar under the pens of the learned .


Augustine Birrell	PERSON	,
H. D. Traill	PERSON	,
W. L. Courtney	PERSON	, Ed -
mund Gosse	PERSON	, Professor
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	are but a few of those who have turned from the concerns of the scholar to the consideration of modern drama .

		Drama has entered the uni - versities of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, no longer as a species of elocution , or a debased form of literary teaching , but as an art that is con - nected structurally and by content with the interests of our day .

		Moreover , drama is win - ning acceptance in the sisterhood of the arts .


Arthur Symons	PERSON	applies to the play the same delicate criticism that he applies to music and painting .

		Barrie gives up the novel for the play .

		Even
Meredith	PERSON	and
Hardy	PERSON	and
James	PERSON	, to mention those of an older generation , tried their hands at dramatic composition , and
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	and
John Galsworthy	PERSON	of the newer generation are almost as well known for their plays as for their novels .

		The fact that the kindly recognition that is coming to drama is based no less on what drama is expected to do than on what has already been performed , quite as much on potential as actual achievements , does not diminish the significance of the standards of respect that have been enforced for an hitherto despised art . ''

		But there is no happy accident in all this ; it has come about by well-directed effort ; and among the zealous workers for the good cause high honor is paid to Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	and Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	in our own country .

		A review of the history of the stage might incline one to name the present attitude of scholars and writers toward the drama not a renascence , a rebirth , but a wholly new and unprece - dented manifestation .

		Has the player 's art ever before been held in such esteem and made the subject of so much serious study ?

		BETTER TEXTBOOKS AT LOWER PRICE has been the trend for a quarter century or more in the great domain of educational literature .

		It is pleasant to be able to name something that has not followed the general rule and mounted skyward in price .

		One of the lead - ing publishing houses in this field -LRB-
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- issues a readable and instructive pamphlet , '' Quality and Cost , '' in which it is asserted that this steady decline in price since
1890	DATE	now amounts to more than ten per cent , notwithstanding a constant increase in the cost of materials and of workmanship in the making of this class of books .

		Competition in the business , combined with a wise insistence upon the best quality on the part of teachers and other school authorities , must be re - garded as the cause of this gratifying devel - opment .

		But , as Professor
Kittredge	PERSON	has publicly declared , the genius of the late
Edwin Ginn	PERSON	is not to be overlooked in any explana - tion of the present high standing and mod - erate price of the American school textbook .

		The firm founded by Mr.
Ginn	PERSON	in
1867	DATE	set up and maintained a higher standard in text - book-publishing than had been known to most of us before that time , or to our fathers and grandfathers if our memory goes not quite so far back .

		Significant in this connection are certain statistics lately published by the na - tional
Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	, showing that , contrary to the general impression , our an - nual expenditure for schoolbooks is no very staggering sum .

		Seventy-eight and
one-third cents	MONEY	for each pupil will be found to cover the bill and leave a little over ; that is , about
seventeen million dollars	MONEY	, all told , for one year , while in the same length of time twenty -
five million dollars	MONEY	is spent for chewing-gum , one hundred and thirty-five million for candy , and three hundred twenty-five million for ice - cream soda and similar liquid refreshments .

		Emphatic denial of the existence of any text - book trust is given by the above-named firm .

		Perhaps so comparatively small a market is not thought worth cornering .

		IMAGISM AND PLAGIARISM may be found in rather surprising association in the
October	DATE	number of '' Poetry : A Magazine of Verse . ''

		The last piece in a group of what are de - scribed in the contents list of this issue as '' three poems by
T. S. Eliot	PERSON	'' consists of some dull data concerning one Miss
Nancy Ellicott	PERSON	, evidently a person of extraordinary physical if not intellectual weight , who '' strode across the hills and broke them , .

		.

		riding to hounds over the cow-pasture , '' and who '' smoked and danced all the modern dances , '' while `` her aunts were not quite sure how they felt about it , but they knew that it was modern . ''

		-LRB- We like those aunts , by the way . -RRB-

		This stuff , with more of the same sort , is broken up into lines of irregular length , each of which begins with a capital letter .

		The old-fashioned reader to whom poetry is something more than capitalized lines of irregular length , if he finds sufficient entertainment in following this society item to the end , will be struck at once by the closing line , a phrase whose genuine poetic quality stands out in vivid contrast with the prose wish-wash that pre -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 477 cedes it . ''

		The army of unalterable law , '' there is a familiar ring to that ; and the old - fashioned reader will probably not be long in identifying it as the closing line , also , of Meredith 's fine sonnet , '' Lucifer in Starlight . ''

		It would be edifying to have
Meredith	PERSON	's own comment on this incident , and his opinion of the company into which his fastidious muse had been forcibly introduced .

		THE FASCINATION OF FORBIDDEN FICTION works often to the bookseller 's advantage , in - asmuch as books banned by the public library are likely to enjoy a '' boom '' at the book - shop .

		Conversely , the removal of previous restrictions on novel-reading ought to take away also some part of the charm investing the interdicted literature .

		And something of this sort has been found to be the case where limitations imposed on the circulation of fic - tion have been abolished .

		At the
Pratt Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tute Free Library , for example , the restriction of one novel at a time to a card-holder had , as almost everywhere else , been the rule until
five years ago	DATE	, when two novels at a time became the limit .

		No general demoralization following , the bars were further lowered last
February	DATE	and , except to borrowers under eighteen and also excepting the latest fiction , as many novels as are desired have since then been at the borrower 's disposal .

		One might have expected from the irksomeness of the one - novel or the two-novel rule that its annul - ment would have greatly increased the fiction circulation ; but we learn from the librarian 's report that no such increase has taken place , even in the first few months when , if ever , it ought to have been a dizzy delight to stagger away with all the thrillers one could hold in one 's arms .

		Perhaps now that the charm of novelty is rubbed off , the enlarged privilege may even beget a loathing for story-books .

		The poster baby familiar to us all will cry for the cake of soap just beyond his reach till he gets it , and then he wo n't care for it .

		THE YEAR 'S PERIODICAL POETRY receives at this time a little earlier than in former seasons Mr.
William Stanley Braithwaite	PERSON	's expert review and criticism .

		For the twelve months ending with
September	DATE	-LRB- not with
December	DATE	as heretofore -RRB- he has examined more than thirty publications , quarterly , monthly , weekly , and daily , reading fifteen hundred poems from five hundred and thirty writers , and sifting the `` poems of distinc - tion '' from those of ordinary merit .

		His results are published , as usual , in the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript , '' and show a generous and cor - dial attitude toward verse-writers of promise .

		Too long to be counted is his list of '' distinc - tive '' poems , five of which he prints in full as the five best of the lot .

		They are , in the assigned order of merit : '' Patterns '' by Miss
Amy Lowell	PERSON	, '' The Adventurer '' by Mr.
Odell Shepard	PERSON	, '' Needle Travel '' by Miss
Margaret French Patton	PERSON	, `` The Road mot Taken '' by Mr.
Robert Frost	PERSON	, and ``
Peter Quince	PERSON	at the Clavier '' by Mr.
Wallace Stevens	PERSON	.

		Encour - aging to poetry 's well-wishers is this critic 's view of the year 's product and his outlook toward the future .

		He sees '' continued prog - ress of the art -LSB- of poetry -RSB- in the magazines , '' and notes with especial satisfaction `` the in - crease of critical writing about contemporary poets and poetry . ''

		Of course every lover of poetry likes to be and ought to be his own critic and guide , but the well-weighed opinion of the professed student of this form of art is always more or less interesting and of more or less authority .

		Many will take issue with Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	in his bestowal of highest honors upon the vers libre of the Imagist poet whose name stands first in the foregoing list ; and , fortunately , everyone is at liberty to draw up a list to suit himself , an exercise as harmless and as inconclusive as naming the ten or twenty or hundred best books .

		Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's researches are about to be pub - lished in full in book form , `` Anthology of Magazine Poetry and Year Book of
American Verse	ORGANIZATION	for
1915	DATE	. ''

		A QUARTER-MILLENNIAL JUBILEE is in
prepa	LOCATION	- ration at
Newark	LOCATION	-LRB- our chief city of that name -RRB- , and `` The Newarker '' devotes its
November	DATE	issue to a proclamation of the great event .

		Otherwise we might have forgotten that next year a quarter of a millennium will have passed since
Robert Treat	PERSON	and his sturdy little band of followers from
Connecticut	LOCATION	landed on the banks of the
Passaic River	LOCATION	and founded the city that was destined to have , among other things , one of the most promi - nent , progressive , and aggressive public libra - ries in all
America	LOCATION	.

		From
May	DATE	to
October , 1916	DATE	, the people of
Newark	LOCATION	are expecting to indulge in pageantry , oratory , feasting , and rejoicing of divers sorts not uninterruptedly for six entire months , we assume , but more or less spasmodically , though systematically and with befitting dignity .

		And now , as to the literary part of these elaborate prepara - tions indicated by the appointment of many kinds of committees and other preliminary measures : Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	reminds his fellow-Newarkers that the rich store of books under his charge is there to be drawn upon for the better accomplishment of the end in view . ''

		Before anything else , '' he tells them , 478 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 25	DATE	`` you must learn what kind of a celebration it is to be , and who is to run it and how it is to be paid for , and where help is needed .

		And all this you can learn at the library and can take away the information in print , and read it .

		And then you must learn about
Newark	LOCATION	itself , .

		unless you know it already , and the only man who knew it all has moved to
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		Until further notice , it appears , Mr.
Dana	PERSON	's enterprising monthly is to be used for celebration purposes by the
Committee of One Hundred	ORGANIZATION	having charge of the great fes - tival ; and then the paper is to return to the quieter walks of bibliothecal and kindred interests .

		OUR DEBT TO THE PATIENT SCRIBE who has subordinated himself to the fame of his mas - ter is beyond calculation .

		What should we know of
Johnson	PERSON	, the real , every-day
Johnson	PERSON	, had there been no
Boswell	PERSON	?

		Lost to the world would have been the wise sayings of Epicte - tus , had not his pupil Arrian preserved them for us .

		jEsop seems to have left no book of fables , written by his own hand ; or at least none has come down to us only the frag - mentary records of such versifiers as Babrius and Phsedrus .

		Socrates without a Plato to report him to the world would have been all but lost to posterity .

		In like manner , the latest and perhaps the best of
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	's productions , his posthumous '' Inter - pretations of Literature , '' owes its being to the faithful labors of his student hearers at
the University of Tokio	ORGANIZATION	, where these lectures were delivered between
1896	DATE	and
1902	DATE	, and where they were so fully taken down in the students ' notebooks from the lecturer 's lips -LRB- he lectur - ing without notes , but slowly , as befitted the needs of his Japanese audience -RRB- that the whole series was afterward reproduced in proper shape for publication , and was pre - sented to the beloved teacher 's literary execu - tor .

		Not many college classes in the western world would have taken the pains that these young men of
Japan	LOCATION	evidently took to pre - serve intact the lecturer 's ipsissima verba .

		THE MOST VOLUMINOUS REFERENCE WORK IN '' THE WORLD was , before its destruction by fire in the
Boxer Rebellion	ORGANIZATION	of
1900	DATE	, the Chinese Encyclopaedia Maxima , in 11,100 volumes , housed in the
Han-Lin College	ORGANIZATION	, which fell a victim to
Boxer	ORGANIZATION	fury .

		Last year two stray fragments of this work that seem to have escaped incineration made their appearance in a
London	LOCATION	bookshop and were picked up for a trifle by someone who afterward lent them to the
London	LOCATION	Library .

		Only one other prod - uct of industrious scholarship comes to mind at present as in any degree comparable in scope with this Chinese work .

		The story goes that long ago a certain oriental potentate , filled with a desire to promote the welfare of his people , ordered the wise men of the land to prepare an exhaustive history of the hu - man race .

		Accordingly these men of learning formed themselves into an academy , elected the proper officers , and set about the com - pilation of the desired work .

		After twenty - five years of unflagging industry they appeared before their sovereign lord accom - panied by a train of camels bearing the completed history in five hundred formidable volumes .

		Terrified by its mere bulk , the monarch ordered an abridgment .

		Fifteen years of labor ensued , after which the surviv - ing academicians -LRB- a slender body by this time -RRB- appeared with a fifty-volume epitome of their former work .

		But even this was too much for their royal master to think of read - ing , and with tears in his aged eyes he begged them to abridge the abridgment .

		Five years passed , and then the sole surviving member of the academy presented himself , on crutches , with one stout volume borne upon the back of an ass .

		But the king , himself on the edge of the grave , turned away in despair at sight of the huge tome .

		Thereupon the academician , seized with an inspiration , threw down the rejected volume and cried to his moribund master : '' Sire , the history of the human race may be summed up in three words , man is born , he suffers , he dies . ''

		Might not the 11,100 volumes of encyclopaedic learning have been advantageously subjected to some such compression ?

		SAFETY FIRST IN JUVENILE LITERATURE is the slogan with which all promoters of good read - ing for the young folk are expected to make the welkin ring during the week beginning
Nov. 28	DATE	.

		In other words , this is to be
Safety First Juvenile Book Week	ORGANIZATION	in the libraries and other haunts of young readers , thus appointed by the organization of
Boy Scouts of America	ORGANIZATION	.

		Precautionary measures for the protection of the young from the dangers of deleterious lit - erature are urged upon librarians , booksellers , editors , and others of influence in the book world ; and attention is especially called to the book-lists prepared by the Boy Scouts association and furnished to all libraries desiring them .

		These lists , headed `` Books Boys Like , '' embrace about three hundred carefully selected works , with annotations , the selection being based upon reports re - ceived from many librarians and booksellers throughout the country , and the titles grouped in the following three general classes of chief
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 479 interest to boys : 1 , Stories of adventure ; 2 , Books on how to do things ; 3 , Books of information .

		It all makes a pamphlet of thirty-two pages , and may be had in such quantities as are needed by addressing the
National Headquarters	ORGANIZATION	, Boy Scouts of Amer - ica , 200 Fifth Avenue ,
New York City	LOCATION	.

		`` ANDROCLES AND THE LION '' IN
GERMANY	LOCATION	, acted by a company of interned British civil - ians at Ruhleben on the outskirts of
Berlin	LOCATION	, is described as a most entertaining and credita - ble performance .

		But what a curious mixture of incongruous elements is presented by the whole affair , an old Roman legend , turned into a farce by an English playwright of Irish birth , acted by a chance assemblage of British subjects held in detention on German soil , with a stolid Prussian commandant as chief spectator , the scene of the strange enter - tainment being the grandstand of a disused racetrack , and the stage properties , costumes , etc. , showing a marvellous exercise of ama - teur ingenuity and resourcefulness on the part of the `` scratch '' company engaged in the difficult undertaking !

		Full descriptions of this theatrical event have been slow in making their way to the outside world , but we are now assured that the success of the performance was such as to elicit from the above-named German officer a very polite ``
Danke Ihnen	PERSON	, meine
Herren	PERSON	!

		Aeusserst nett ! ''

		But this is by no means the first time that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's genius has evoked German applause .

		THE DECEITFULNESS OF APPEARANCES IN BOOKS , to those unskilled in looking beneath the surface , was well expressed at the late annual meeting of the
New York Library Association	ORGANIZATION	by Dr.
Slosson	PERSON	, editor of `` The Independent . ''

		With epigrammatic pithiness he told his hearers that `` the least valuable volumes in the library are those with the finest bindings ; the most valuable are those with no bindings at all . ''

		To be sure , the modern librarian is ever on the alert , dress - ing the ranks of his literary regiment and keeping their uniforms in good condition , so that the most valuable book is now likely to be the most recently rebound book ; but the epi - gram deserves to stand as it is .

		Another pregnant word from the same speaker was this : '' The man who needs the library most is the one who draws a book with as much reluctance as he draws a revolver . ''

		Never - theless it remains true , epigram apart , that the man who most readily draws his revolver is the very one who most needs the civilizing influence of the library .

		WILLIAM
CULLEN BRYANT	PERSON	AGAIN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		No one would be better pleased than I if your correspondent , Mr.
John L. Hervey	PERSON	, could per - suade us that
William Cullen Bryant	PERSON	remained , throughout his long life , '' true to his vision '' as an artist and righteously jealous of his fame .

		But I submit that Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	's indignant defence of the `` mighty dead , '' as contained in your issue of
Oct. 28	DATE	, does not establish his case .

		Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	asks , '' Who was the very vague ' publisher ' who made the preposterous state - ment ? ''

		that
Bryant	PERSON	, during his later life , was known to '' the trade '' as '' the great national tone-imparter , '' because he was willing to sell his name and portrait as the author of books he did not write .

		Because my informant died last year I have been reluctant to mention his name , but perhaps this reticence is a mistake .

		He was
John Denison Champlin	PERSON	, long in the employ of
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , and the chief author , or com - piler , of their '' Cyclopedia of Painters and Paint - ings '' and '' Cyclopedia of Music and Musicians , '' and , I believe , other such works .

		Mr.
Champlin	PERSON	's characterization of the poet as a '' tone-imparter , '' and the facts he related in support of it , were at the time a great shock to my youthful mind .

		And I find nothing in Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	's long letter to con - tradict the facts or allay the shock .

		Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	presents absolutely nothing to dis - prove the charge that the '' Family Library of Poetry and Song , Edited by
William Cullen Bryant	PERSON	, '' which is popularly known as ''
Bryant	PERSON	's Collection of Poetry and Song , '' was not actually edited by
Bryant	PERSON	at all ; or the other charge that ''
Bryant	PERSON	's Popular History of the
United States	LOCATION	'' was not actually written by
Bryant	PERSON	.

		On the con - trary , he admits the truth of the second charge , and tries to cover up the first in nearly a column of vague talk and personal denunciation of the accuser .

		Let us study
Bryant	PERSON	's own words .

		In the `` Editor 's Introduction '' to the `` Library , '' the poet naively writes : `` At the request of the pub - lishers I undertook to write an Introduction to the present work , and in pursuance of this design I find that I have come into a somewhat closer per - sonal relation with the book . ''

		-LRB- Italics are mine . -RRB-

		A '' somewhat closer personal relation '' with a book accredited to him on the title-page and sold by the authority of his fame I He then hastens to explain : '' In its progress it has passed entirely under my revision , and although not absolutely responsible for the compilation or its arrange - ment , I have , as requested , exercised a free hand both in excluding and in adding matter according to my judgment of what was best adapted to the purposes of the enterprise . ''

		This is < first-hand testimony that the '' Library '' was neither com - piled nor arranged by the poet , that he merely supervised its contents , and that he had to write an Introduction in order to acquire a feeling of '' somewhat closer personal relation '' with the book !

		Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	quotes a paragraph from the 480 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 25	DATE	`` Publisher 's Preface '' to the edition of
1878	DATE	, which states that the poet made a `` thorough revision '' of the work before he died .

		Is not Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	close enough to the inside of the publish - ing business to know how stretchable is such a phrase in an unsigned '' Publisher 's Preface '' ?

		Of the second charge Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	writes : '' This history -LRB- aside from the lengthy signed historical preface -RRB- was never claimed to have been written by
Bryant	PERSON	. ''

		This surprises me .

		It is true that everyone '' in the trade '' knew that , as Mr.
Cham	PERSON	- plin said , ''
Bryant	PERSON	scarcely even read the proof - sheets . ''

		But what of the public who bought the book ?

		Let me copy the title-page from the
London	LOCATION	edition of
1876	DATE	in the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		This title-page , which faces a steel-engraving of the poet , reads : `` A Popular History of the
United States	LOCATION	from the
First Discovery of the Western Hemisphere	ORGANIZATION	by the
Northmen	PERSON	to the End of the
First Century of the Union	ORGANIZATION	of the States : by
William Cullen Bryant	PERSON	and
Sydney	LOCATION	Howard Gay . ''

		I leave it to your readers to decide what sold this work , here and abroad the real author - ship of Mr.
Gay	PERSON	, or the pretended authorship of Mr.
Bryant	PERSON	.

		Was it , or was it not , as I alleged , a case of
Bryant	PERSON	's selling his name and venerable portrait as the author of a book which he did not write ?

		As for
Bryant	PERSON	's reputation as `` the great national tone-imparter , '' let us consult that valua - ble bibliography , `` American Authors , 1795-1895 , '' compiled by
P. K. Foley	PERSON	and printed in
Boston	LOCATION	in
1897	DATE	.

		There we find that , while no other cases were so flagrant as the '' Popular History of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' the poet spread his name pretty thin , as editor , or author of Prefaces , Introduc - tions , etc. , over many title-pages ; sometimes out of mere good will , perhaps , but more often , proba - bly , for a financial consideration .

		He appears , for example , as one of the editors of the ''
Strat	PERSON	- ford Edition '' of Shakespeare ; but was it he , or Mr.
Duycinck	PERSON	, who actually did the work ?

		I regret that I am not yet able to change my opinion that
Bryant	PERSON	, highly gifted and full of fine ideals in his youth , yielded gradually to worldly influences toward ease , comfort , and respectability , to such a degree that his poetic inspiration , and even his moral sense , became dulled .

		As proof of the dulling of his poetic inspiration I offer the facts that
Bryant	PERSON	's best poem , the '' Thanatopsis , '' was written before he was twenty , and his next best , '' Lines to a Waterfowl , '' only a few years later ; and that his later poems show a diminishing sensitiveness to the true and permanent spiritual values , along with increasing sentimentality and conventional piety .

		Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	, Mr.
William Ellery Leonard	PERSON	, and all other admirers of
Bryant	PERSON	, may of course give him , as a poet , whatever rank they think he deserves .

		But in the interest of a saner , juster , and more temperate criticism I submit that to place this poet among the '' mighty dead '' is pre - posterous .


HARRIET MONROE	PERSON	.

		THE LIBRARIAN AS LITERARY CRITIC .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The function of the modern librarian is a multi - form one .

		He must be an administrator , under - standing how to control subordinates and plan out their work .

		He must be a practical man , who knows how to build and repair the structures he administers .

		He must be a man among men , hav - ing that priceless knowledge of how to make friends among the people of the community where his work is carried on .

		He must possess those gifts which would have made him a good salesman , able to meet the wishes of the public and to induce them to use such of his wares as he wishes to put in their hands .

		But he must also be much more than all this .

		The librarian must be a scholar , knowing books , with ability to judge them , evalu - ate them , and appraise them at their true value .

		In other words , he must be a literary critic .

		Many of those who carry on library work are , in greater or less degree , possessed of such a character , which is after all the highest attribute of the true libra - rian .

		He is the mediator between the author who has a message for men , and those to whom the message is designed .

		To librarians , these ideas are not new ; but to the general public they are not so familiar .

		The average person is too likely to forget this vitally important feature of the modern librarian 's work .

		Mr.
Charles Miner Thompson	PERSON	, writing in '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly '' for
July , 1908	DATE	, remarked : '' There are five groups interested in literary criti - cism : publishers of books , authors , publishers of reviews , critics , and finally the reading public . '' ''

		No one can quarrel with this grouping , '' said Professor
Bliss Perry	PERSON	in '' The Yale Review '' for
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 481
July , 1914	DATE	, '' although the more superstitious among us may be inclined to assert that there is a sixth person present , namely , Literature herself . ''

		Both of these writers ignore the librarian , and for that reason I do not hesitate to quarrel with their grouping as incomplete .

		When the literary criticism of librarians is given to hundreds of thousands of people who come to libraries for books , when the old and young of all grades of education and all classes of society come to libra - rians for suggestion and advice as to what books they should read , when the librarian is continually guiding those who borrow books from library shelves , is not he one of the most important of literary critics ?

		One may readily admit that some librarians are not as good literary critics as others , because of lack of education or taste or early culture ; yet the fact remains that one of the most potent influences tending to form literary taste in
America	LOCATION	is that proceeding from the contact of the librarian with the book borrower .

		The bor - rower realizes this , and often bears testimony to the guidance he receives , if it be only that mute guidance which comes through the inclusion or the exclusion of a book on the shelves , or on a reading list .

		The librarian realizes it , when an advanced student thanks him for the appraisal of some unknown work , or when a child asks for '' another pretty book like the last one I had . ''

		If the library is to do its best work , however , the general public must recognize the fact that , by the very nature of things , the librarian is forced to become a literary critic ; for only through such recognition can the people secure the greatest advantage they may expect from the library .

		We have said that the librarian , from the nature of things , must be a literary critic .

		He must be more than this , however , for men and women come to the library for many books which are not literature .

		The librarian must be able to guide the intending reader to satisfactory books on plumb - ing , the indoor cultivation of flowers , the care of infants , the keeping of bees .

		In other words , he must take all knowledge for his province , and must be a fingerpost to all roads to learning .

		None of these roads are royal ; but the librarian who is a good roadbuilder may be of great assistance to the wayfaring person who may wish to walk in them .

		It follows , from the vastness of the world of books , that the librarian must take much of his criticism at second hand .

		He must know where to look for the information that he lacks .

		This may be gained from an acquaintance who is versed in the subject on which advice is needed , or from some periodical of established reputation which reviews books in that department of knowledge , or from some general guide like the `` A. L. A. Book List , '' or from some such specialized evaluation of books as
Larned	ORGANIZATION	's `` Literature of American His - tory . ''

		Even in the narrower field of the literature of power and of inspiration , one must know how to use the histories of literature .

		Then , too , the librarian must be an adept in the art of skimming over a work , of glancing through a series , of browsing over a shelf of books ; he soon learns what a deal of information even the lettering on the back of a volume or the words on a title-page can convey .

		Most of all , he must have an insatia - ble thirst for reading and a love for the best in literature .

		He must have high ideals and stand - ards of life , along with an infectious enthusiasm , for literature ; and he must endeavor to kindle in his readers similar ideals and standards and a like love for the written expression of man 's highest thoughts , hopes , yearnings , and disappointments .

		With the multitudinous details of administration , and the constant call of the day 's routine , the temptation comes to every librarian to relax in his duty as a literary critic .

		This temptation is some - times yielded to , for librarians are but men and women .

		But , in any case , the librarian must per - force be a critic , whether good or bad , and must do his share toward molding the literary taste of the community in which he lives .

		To perform this duty aright , he must possess a love for his fellow-men and a desire to help them , a broad culture based upon a thorough and accurate educa - tional training , an ardent zeal to impart to others that appreciation of good literature which he has gained for himself , and the knowledge of the books in which that good literature may be found .

		THE LAW OF NECESSITY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your issue of
October 28	DATE	, the reviewer of `` The War Book of the German General Staff '' attempts to defend himself against my charge of having misrepresented
Germany	LOCATION	by assuring your readers that '' the text of the War Book was repro - duced literally '' in his review .

		But I did not , directly or indirectly , charge him with misquoting the War Book .

		My charge was that he misrepre - sented
Germany	LOCATION	by asserting that to the Germans military necessity takes precedence over interna - tional law .

		I quoted from the
American Naval	ORGANIZATION	War Code to show that with us , too , military necessity precedes international law .

		Your re - viewer says , absolutely without warrant , that '' the regularly sanctioned usages of naval warfare differ from those of land warfare in certain impor - tant respects . ''

		I refer your reviewer and your readers to any book on International Law for proof that the law pertaining to non-combatants , the only point now at issue , is the same on land and on sea .

		This is an inevitable and necessary corollary of the law of self-preservation , the first principle of military law .

		-LRB- Cf. the text-book on International Law by
G. Davis	PERSON	, professor of his - tory and law at West Point . -RRB-

		Your reviewer insists that the German principle of warfare re - duces itself to '' might makes right . ''

		Let anyone read Mr.
Davis	PERSON	's book and he will be convinced that all international law is based on this principle .

		Every nation can decide for itself what it chooses to consider right if it has the might to enforce it .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The reviewer of the German War Book quotes Dr.
Tannenbaum	PERSON	in your issue of
October 28	DATE	: '' Since when is the doctrine that necessity knows no law a German doctrine ? ''

		And he attempts an answer which he says is obvious .

		If the answer is not thoroughly British in its view-point , it is obviously anti-German , at least to one who is thoroughly American , to the extent of eight gen - erations .

		This answer is that the doctrine dates from ``
August 4 , 1914	DATE	, when the German Chancel - lor proclaimed it unqualifiedly in the Reichstag . ''

		That proclamation referred to the invasion of
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		We can not agree with the reviewer .

		We regret the invasion of
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		But we have not for - gotten the pleas made in the
United States Senate	ORGANIZATION	in
1847	DATE	, that necessity knows no law .

		The doc - trine was applied to the continuance of an unneces - sary war against a country more unfortunate , and therefore less influential , than
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		But the necessity was not one of self-preservation .

		It was not a case of fear for the invasion of one 's own fatherland .

		The '' necessity '' was an imagined need for '' space . ''

		We fought the Mexicans for a year after they were ready for peace , because we needed their vast territory that would give us the
Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	as a protection from invasion on the
West	LOCATION	.

		In the course of his noble speech oppos - ing this policy ,
Daniel Webster	PERSON	spoke as follows : '' Since I have lately heard so much about the dis - memberment of
Mexico	LOCATION	, I have looked back to see how , in the course of events which some call
Providence	LOCATION	, it has fared with other nations who have engaged in this work of dismemberment .

		I see that in the
latter half of the eighteenth century	DATE	, three powerful nations ,
Eussia	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	, and
Prussia	LOCATION	, united in the dismem - berment of
Poland	LOCATION	.

		They said , too , as you say , ' It is our destiny . '

		They ' wanted room . '

		Doubtless each of these thought that with his share of
Poland	LOCATION	his power was too strong ever to fear invasion or even insult .

		One had his
California	LOCATION	, another his
New Mexico	LOCATION	, and the third his
Vera Cruz	PERSON	.

		Did they remain untouched and incapable of harm ?

		Alas , no !

		Far , very far from it !

		Eetributive justice must fulfill its ` destiny ' too .

		A very few years pass and we hear of a new man , a Corsiean lieutenant , a self - named ' armed sol - dier of Democracy '
Napoleon	PERSON	.

		He ravages
Austria	LOCATION	, covers her land with blood , drives the
Northern Caesar	ORGANIZATION	from his capital and sleeps in his palace .


Austria	LOCATION	may now remember how her power trampled upon
Poland	LOCATION	.

		Did she not pay dear , very dear , for her
California	LOCATION	? ''

		He who runs can read the retributive justice that has followed
France	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	since
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon 's day .

		But how about
Prussia	LOCATION	?

		How about
Mexico	LOCATION	?

		One wonders what
Mexico	LOCATION	would be to-day with her
California	LOCATION	.

		Three years after
Webster	PERSON	's speech ,
California	LOCATION	asked for admission as a state , and the conflict was precipitated that resulted in a war compared with which the Mexican War was a child 's adven - ture .

		And it was the slavery issues raised by the asking of this state for admission that resulted in the introduction of the Clay resolutions and the '' Seventh of
March	DATE	Speech . ''

		That speech was a plea for temperate tongues and pens and loyalty to the constitution .

		It failed of its object because those in power considered that necessity knows no law .

		We defied the Fugitive Slave Law , and
Daniel Webster	PERSON	died of a broken heart two years later , as pure a patriot as
George Washington	PERSON	or
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, and the greatest statesman this country has produced .

		But he stood unsuc - cessfully for the idea that the Law must teach us patience and wisdom when it comes in conflict with what we conceive to be our necessities .

		It would be interesting to know about Mr.

		Why should he not slip his burden onto their willing shoulders ?

		Are they too strict in their criticisms to be acceptable to the writers , or is it feared that their criticism will have reference not to the merits of the work criticized but to the prospect of further employment ?

		Doubtless the fact that an authors ' agency must naturally charge a fee for its services , whereas Mr.
Benson	PERSON	could not or at least would not ask payment , has a great deal to do with the case .

		Pronunciation has a profound effect upon poetry .

		Take , for example , those famous lines of
Whittier	LOCATION	's : '' Of all sad words of tongue or pen , The saddest are these : ' It might have been ! ' '

		If this sentiment were expressed by an English poet , he would be forced to write : '' Of all sad English words , I wean , The saddest are these : ' It might have been ! ' '

		And a poet of the
Middle West	LOCATION	would probably have done it like this : '' Sad words are sorrow , sickness , sin ; But sadder are these : ' It might have been ! ' '

Paul	PERSON	of
Tarsus	LOCATION	whom admiring men have since named Saint , '' in writing to the Church at
Corinth	LOCATION	on the gift of tongues , declares : '' There are , it may be , many kinds of voices in the world , and not one of them is without significance .

		Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice , I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian , and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me . ''

		Countrymen of the author of ''
Sartor Resartus	PERSON	'' who owe their spiritual awakening , or `` Baphometic fire baptism , '' to the spirit which animates that notable book , are apt to classify the human race under the two categories of those who have and those who have not a natural affinity for the Carlylean philosophy , the Carlylean temper , and the Carlylean language .

		It is not easy for those who have rounded the corner of middle age , and who are conscious that the whole direction of their life-currents and their attitudes toward the mysteries and eternities have been determined by an early encounter with the printed utterances of that incan - descent soul , to convey to the youth of this generation any adequate impression of all that
Carlyle	PERSON	has meant for them .

		By what con - ceivable collocation of words is it possible to describe the enfranchisement of the spirit , the liberation of the imagination , the widened horizon , and the breaking of the shackles that bind the natural man to the commonplace and conventional and make of him a mere atom in the cosmic '' dance of plastic circumstance '' ?

		It can not be done .

		Ruskin declared that he lamented not so much what men suffer as what they lose , and the disciple of

Carlyle	PERSON	: How to Know Him , '' Professor Bliss
Perry	PERSON	writes what might perhaps more appropriately have appeared in the preface : '' How many Americans , in this
first quarter of the twentieth century	DATE	, may be fairly said to know
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's work ?

		We read by scraps and patches .

		We recall phrases , we retain impressionistic glimpses of characteristic attitudes and gestures , we hazard our facile American guess at the per - sonality of a
Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	, as we do at a hun - dred others of yesterday 's distinguished names .

		The intent -LSB- of this book -RSB- is to invite a new gen - * THOMAS CARLYLE : How TO KNOW HIM .

		By
Bliss Perry	ORGANIZATION	.

		With portrait .

		Indianapolis : The
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		eration of hurried and pre-occupied Americans to look back steadily and wisely upon a great figure , and to study that figure in the light of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's own varied stimulating and magnificent utter - ances . ''

		That the present book will accomplish this high purpose we sincerely hope and confi - dently believe .

		Twenty years ago we should have said that another volume on the great Scottish seer was unnecessary , that it would indeed have been a superfluity , and that the last word that need be said had already been spoken .

		But to-day conditions have altered .

		A mighty change has come over the world and human life .

		A revo - lution has broken out in
Europe	LOCATION	, similar in character to , but immensely greater in volume and significance and tragedy than , that which took hold of the imagination of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	in his youth and whirled it upwards in a tempestu - ous flame of prophetic interpretation .

		In a sense we may say that the French Revolution made
Carlyle	PERSON	the kind of man be became , and gave to his mind the peculiarly individual quality by which we have known him .

		The volcanic eruption that shook human society to its foundations called for an artist-inter - preter , and
Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	appeared .

		Has Destiny a similar interpreter of the course of human affairs under her wing for us at present ?

		Shall the time call in vain for a seer who will tell us the meaning of present - day happenings , and restore to us our faith in the eternal goodness and wisdom ?

		Are our great publishing houses expectantly looking for the advent of such a prophet ; or are they , while we write , rejecting the manuscripts of God-sent teachers , as the Frasers and Long - mans and Hurrays rejected the priceless ''
Sartor Resartus	PERSON	'' eighty years ago ?

		These are questions it may be well that all should ask themselves whose function in society it is to stand at the outposts of thought and watch for the coming of the interpreters .

		Doubtless spurious imitations will abound , as they al - ways do ; but this only makes it the more imperative that we keep the feeling for real greatness alive , that we may know what a seer and prophet is like , and be able to `` sense '' him on his approach .

		For this reason it is well that we should be recalled to a grateful re - membrance of the best gift of the gods to the English-speaking people of the nineteenth century .

		`` We therefore welcome Professor
Perry	PERSON	's book , and commend it to the attention not only of those fortunate ones to whom the words of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	are already luminous , but even to those others who may yet for the first time come under his strange and magnetic influence .

		484 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 25	DATE	To rightly assess
Carlyle	PERSON	's value to the world , to accurately estimate his true propor - tions , to determine the directions in which his vision was sure and unerring and those in which his limitations may be discovered , here is a task requiring not only knowledge , intellectual power and feeling , but unbounded admiration and sympathy .

		For , notwithstand - ing the popular maxim , Love is not blind .

		Love is indeed the only human faculty that does see clearly , that can discern faults as well as virtues and limitations equally with tran - scendent powers .

		In the case of a glowing soul of many facets like that of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, only the devout lover can be trusted as his judge , to determine the particular niche in the Tem - ple of Fame he must ultimately occupy .

		The mere lapse of time , too , makes this more pos - sible .

		The dust of controversy has been finally laid ; personal animosities and the '' scrannel - piping of the night-birds and screech-owls of journalism '' have died down ; the happenings of his time have fallen into their proper perspective ; and the titanic figure is revealed to those who will lift their eyes , towering above the men of his age and generation .

		It can hardly be said that Professor
Perry	PERSON	has provided answers to the questions which he sets forth as follows : '' It may well be granted that
Carlyle	PERSON	's eye and hand are marvellous , but how about his mind ?

		What shall be said about his political views , his theory of the hero , his diagnosis of the Condition of
England	LOCATION	, and the social remedies he proposes ?

		Has he trust in progress , in the education of the race ?

		Does he believe that a democracy develops leadership or promotes fellowship ?

		With the word ' faith ' so often on his lips , has he himself a living faith in Man and in God , and in the coop - eration of man with God ? ''

		These are among the insistent questions which many a youthful Carlyle-worshipper of thirty -
five years ago	DATE	is now compelled to ask himself after a working life-time of experience has en - riched the content of his mind and changed his angle of vision .

		For it is indeed a strange fact that the impassioned utterances of a poet-phi - losopher frequently make a more direct appeal to the youthful mind before the experiences have arrived of which these utterances are the interpretation .

		And when these experiences do come , with something of the power of original reaction , it requires a strenuous mental effort to recall the teachings that had then seemed to be as a voice from
Sinai	LOCATION	, and to re-assess their value in the light of the wider horizon and enlarged vision that the years have brought .

		Such a one , if a true hero-worshipper , will inevitably be haunted by self-accusations of the sin of presumption .

		Even if endowed with a large measure of spiritual independence , he may have an uneasy recollection of the fable which tells of an ass braying at a dead lion , and the smallest degree of modesty may deter him from putting to himself just those ques - tions which Professor
Perry	PERSON	asks .

		Justice to our great men , however , demands that we who stand upon their shoulders , and thereby enjoy an outlook which but for them would have been impossible , should in all humility correct their reports in so far as our enlarged horizon requires .

		To revert to the similitude contained in the fable mentioned , we may admit our kin - ship with the humbler creation , yet claim to have a vision of a sharper focus though of a less wide range and a narrower angle than that of our natural superiors .

		To abandon meta - phor , the plain man must recognize that just because he is a plain man the duty lies upon him of interpreting life for himself , of see - ing the world not solely through the eyes of the prophet , but by his own vision , aided and clarified by what the prophet has told him .

		His critical understanding will thus revive , and he will realize , as he did not when under the influence of unreasoning devotion , the true uses of great men in the world .

		With these precautionary considerations , we may examine the questions that Professor
Perry	PERSON	presents for his reader 's consideration .

		It will readily be granted that
Carlyle	PERSON	's eye and hand were marvellous .

		His eye was that of a seer rather than of an onlooker at human life .

		His vision was like that of the artist to whom the curtain has been lifted which -LRB- like the blinkers on the restive horse -RRB- shuts out to ordinary mortals all that distracts atten - tion from the immediate and practical , and the lifting of which reveals the inner mean - ings and hidden realities of things .

		And here we touch upon one of the paradoxes which we must accept as inseparable from the history of those who are naturally eman - cipated from the '' foolish consistency ' which is '' the hob-goblin of little minds . ''

		That man was created to work rather than to speculate or feel or dream was , as Professor
Perry	PERSON	indi - cates , the central maxim of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's philoso - phy ; yet his whole life 's energies were ` spent in feeling and dreaming and speculation , the results of which are preserved for us in twenty-five octavo volumes .

		And if we love him all the more for this fact , it is because we demur to his maxim and believe that in his inmost heart
Carlyle	PERSON	knew that man was made to speculate , and that his work -LRB- in the ordinary acceptation of the word -RRB- ought only to serve as a means for helping him to those higher elevations from which to scan the hori - zon of life and provide food for his dreams and speculations .

		What , indeed , are all his
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 485 hero-worships , clothes philosophies , and bis - torical phantasmagorias but adventures in the field of speculation , and attempts to draw aside the veil which limits our vision to those things that pertain to our `` work '' ?

		In all our attempts to define the intellectual limita - tions of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, or to estimate the value of his guidance in the politics of the world , we must accord him the highest place as an ad - venturous speculator , as a seer and prophet .

		His instinct for the lightness and wrongness of things as they are was accurate and un - erring .

		He gave the world an impetus in the direction of righteousness such as no other modern teacher has done .

		His name repre - sents the greatest moral force that has moved
Europe	LOCATION	during the nineteenth century .

		His craftsmanship , too , was indeed marvellous .

		Never has an instrument been so perfectly adapted to its work as was the natural lan - guage of
Carlyle	PERSON	to the delivery of his mes - sage .

		It is almost impossible in thought to dissociate the two ; and a translation of `` Sartor Kesartus '' into `` classic '' English would be nearly as unendurable as the ren - dering into French of the poems of Burns which we were recently privileged to peruse .

		Carlyle 's command of his own language was that of the supreme artist over his chosen medium of expression .

		But granting the seeing eye and the skilful hand , what about his mind , as Professor
Perry	PERSON	asks ?

		Were his intellectual percep - tions , his judgments on the correlations of causes and effects , his diagnosis of `` the con - dition of
England	LOCATION	question , '' trustworthy and of value for the guidance of poor stumbling humanity ?

		Regretfully we reply in the nega - tive ; and though Professor
Perry	PERSON	makes no very definite pronouncement of opinion , we gather from his quotation of
Mazzini	PERSON	in the case for democracy that he too feels the time has come when we must out of our very love for
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	recognize wherein his guidance has been untrustworthy .

		His attitude toward democracy becomes more and more intolera - ble in these latter days , when we are realizing that the only hope for the permanent peace of the world lies in the direction of a still more complete democracy than any we have yet known .

		Since
Carlyle	PERSON	was laid to rest , Autocracy has been tried on a scale such as Nero of
Rome	LOCATION	or Frederick of
Prussia	LOCATION	only feebly foreshadowed ; and , as a consequence ,
Europe	LOCATION	is now aflame .

		Autocracy has been weighed in the balance and found wanting ; and the prophet who told us in words of thunder that our highest good lay in finding our strong man and putting our affairs blindly in his hands , will never again be fully trusted as a guide in the conduct of life .

		In regard , again , to the relation of the classes , the governing to the working , and the capi - talist to the laboring classes , could any utter - ance be more offensive both to the reason and to the sentiment of a sane and high-souled modern democrat than the words : `` Despotism is essential to most enterprises ; and freedom too , this is indispensable , we must have it and will have it .

		To reconcile despotism with freedom ; well , is that such a mystery ?

		Do you not already know the way ?

		It is to make your despotism just . ''

		It would be an ungrateful task to multiply quotations from the many that might be given of an intellectual attitude toward the prob - lem of social life which is becoming more repugnant to good men every day .

		Nothing , indeed , but a lofty admiration combined with a sense of humor can protect a democratic reader from a tendency to throw his `` Past and Present '' out of window on coming upon passages like the one quoted .

		We must con - tent ourselves with inquiring into the cause of this curious survival of medievalism in the mind of a modern prophet .

		Professor
Perry	PERSON	remarks that ''
Carlyle	PERSON	's difficulty lay in his distrust of humanity , '' and this brings us pretty near to the cause of all his intellectual tortuosities .

		If the first duty of a free and independent soul is to escape from his ances - tors , then
Carlyle	PERSON	, in spite of his enormous endowment of original force , failed to do this , for the theology of eighteenth century
Scot	PERSON	- land held him firmly in its grasp till the close of his life .

		`` A Calvinist with the bottom fallen out of his creed '' is probably the most accu - rate description that has yet been given of his emotional attitude toward human life and destiny .

		His faith in God and in human depravity were equally profound .

		`` Mostly fools '' was no mere carelessly dropped expres - sion in referring to his three million fellow - Londoners , but represented his real estimate of average humanity .

		From such a view - point what could have been expected in the way of sociological theory other than the hope for a beneficent despotism to drive the `` fools '' along the paths of pleasantness and peace by the masterful hand ?

		Another explanation which a sincere dis - ciple may offer of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's reactionism in social philosophy is his deeply rooted distrust of the intellectual processes , his profound contempt for logic-choppers and theory - grinders and for mere thinkers in general .

		Shortly after the death of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	a story bearing the marks of probability went the round of literary circles in
London	LOCATION	, and may not yet have become familiar in
America	LOCATION	.

		486 THE DIAL I
Nov. 25	DATE	After the only known occasion on which Car - lyle and
Spencer	PERSON	intersected one another 's orbits ,
Spencer	PERSON	wrote in his diary in his usual methodical manner : `` Have just been intro - duced to
Carlyle	LOCATION	, a poor creature lacking in co-ordination of ideas both intellectual and moral . ''

		Carlyle , in a letter to a friend , wrote of the same interview : '' I have just met
Spencer	PERSON	, an immeasurable ass . ''

		Apart from the grim humor of the story , it reveals the limitations of genius in a pathetic man - ner .

		That the great apostle of the understand - ing and the mightiest preacher of modern times should have utterly failed to obtain even a glimpse of one another 's souls , while multitudes of plain men and women have been able to catch the light that flowed from the one and the heat that radiated from the other , is a circumstance full of consolation for mediocrity , and one that should go far to justify the plain man in trusting his critical judgments .

		It is , however , because we believe that after all the deductions which the discovery of his limitations demand , and when every possible allowance is made for his inherited prejudices and perversities , there will stand forth in the stronger relief the greatest spirit that has descended among men during a hun - dred years , and the force without which our intellectual life would be immensely poorer , it is because we believe this that we welcome and commend Professor
Perry	PERSON	's book .

		THE PAINTING .

		* A good alternative title for Mr.
`` Willard Huntington Wright	PERSON	's book on `` Modern Painting '' would be '' The Purification of Painting . ''

		This is the manner of its thought . ''

		Paint - ing has been a bastard art an agglomera - tion of literature , religion , photography and decoration . ''

		A '' dead cargo of literature , archaeology and illustration '' has kept it from functioning freely . ''

		Those qualities in painting by which it is ordinarily judged are for the most part irrelevancies from the standpoint of pure aesthetics . '' ''

		It is the misfortune of painting that literary impuri - ties should have accompanied its development , and it is the irony of serious endeavor that on account of these impurities there has been an indefinite deferment of any genuine appre - ciation of painting . ''

		But '' painting should be as pure an art as * MODERN PAINTING .

		Its Tendency and Meaning .

		By
Wil	PERSON	- lard
Huntington Wright	PERSON	.

		Illustrated in color , etc. .


New York	LOCATION	:
John Lane	PERSON	Co : music '' an art expressing itself `` with the means alone inherent in that art , as music expresses itself by means of circumscribed sound . ''

		And the means alone inherent in painting is color . ''

		Since Cezanne , painting means , not the art of tinting drawing or of correctly imitating natural objects , but the art which expresses itself only with the me - dium inherent in it colour . ''

		This idea that color alone is the concern of painting is the thread that runs through Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's entire treatment .

		The reader of psychological bent will feel like proposing as a third title , `` The Adventures of an Idea . ''

		After a hundred years of misunder - standing and persecution , the Idea has hero - ically arrived .

		Its final helpers up the rocky steep have been the Cubists and the
Synchro	LOCATION	- mists .

		Its ultimate triumph in Synchromism represents the `` final purification , '' or , in the somewhat less elegant alternative term of Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's , the '' defecation , '' of painting .

		There have been three epochs in painting .

		The first began with oil painting about
1400	DATE	, and terminated with
Rubens	PERSON	in the `` attain - ment to the highest degree of compositional plasticity which was possible with the fixed means of his period . ''

		The second a cycle of `` research and analysis , of scientific ex - perimentation and data gathering '' was ushered in by
Turner	ORGANIZATION	, Constable , and Dela - croix .

		Courbet and Manet , in this epoch , '' liberated the painter from set themes '' ; the Impressionists followed ; the Neo-Impression - ists `` went further afield with scientific ob - servations ; and finally Renoir , assimilating all the new discoveries , rejected the fallacies and co-ordinated the valuable conclusions . ''

		The third epoch resulted in the final purifi - cation of painting .

		Cezanne was its primi - tive . ''

		Colour with him became for the first time a functional element capable of produc - ing form . ''

		Absolute freedom of subject - selection was followed by absolute freedom also in the treatment of subject .

		Unconven - tionality of form went hand in hand with unconventionality of theme .

		Cezanne and
Matisse	ORGANIZATION	, making distortion an aesthetic princi - ple , led to
Picasso	ORGANIZATION	and Cubism .

		Throughout this epoch , abstraction was the aim the exclusion of recognizable objects , `` the final elimination of natural objectivity , '' the rele - gation of the illustrative . ''

		So long as recog - nisable objects are presented , '' art purely as abstract form can not be appreciated . ''

		The Cubists , by breaking up a model into parts which separately bore little resemblance to nature , proved that they not only recognised the demands of pure organisation but that they knew those demands could never be met
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 487 so long as there were recognisable objects in a painting . ''

		Synchromism '' took the final step in the elimination of the illustrative object . '' ''

		Thus was brought about the final purifica - tion of painting .

		Form was entirely divorced from any realistic consideration : and colour became an organic function .

		The methods of painting , being rationalized , reached their highest degree of purity and creative capabil - ity . '' ''

		The evolution of painting from tinted illustration to an abstract art expressed wholly by the one element inherent in it colour ; was a natural and inevitable progress .

		Music passed through the same development from the imitation of natural sounds to har - monic abstraction . ''

		`` Form and colour the two permanent and inalienable qualities of painting have become synonymous .

		An - cient painting sounded the depths of com - position .

		Modern painting has sounded the depths of colour .

		Research is at an end .

		It now remains only for artists to create ... No more innovatory ' movements ' are possible .

		.

		.

		The era of pure creation begins with the present day . ''

		Upon reading the penultimate sentence at least , public and artists alike , of whatever aesthetic creed , will heave the traditional sigh of relief .

		No more innovatory movements are possible . ''

		The means have been per - fected : the laws of organisation have been laid down . ''

		Painting has at length settled to her task .

		The production of ineffably puri - fied and unrecognizable masterpieces may now be expected as a matter of course .

		The clearness and sureness with which Mr.
`` Wright	PERSON	records the triumph of the Idea are such as to prompt the lively hope that the experience of painting is symptomatic .

		It is a daring thought , but it may be that in mor - als , in religion , in pedagogy , in civics , in social relations , in poetry , and in other fields where Ideas have been adventuring , as well as in painting , we are nearer than we suspect to ultimate defecation and absolute unrecogniza - bility .

		In these fields , too , we may live to see the day when we can stop talking about things and begin to do them .

		Yet '' it is with feelings of dismay that the lover of art contemplates the history of paint - ing as told in these pages .

		The path to per - fection has been strewn with awful wreckage .

		One movement after another is proved by a quickly arriving successor to have been abor - tive .

		Impressionists ,
Pointillists	LOCATION	, Divisionists , Chromo-luminarists , Neo-Impressionists ,
Cu	ORGANIZATION	- bists , Futurists , Intimists , Vorticists , Syn - chromists all have come and gone with ever increasing swiftness .

		There has been endless theorizing , talking , and experimentation , with a good deal of wild putting of things on canvas ; but only once in a while an achieve - ment in itself worth while , even in Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's mind .

		Of the Vorticists , whose headquarters are in
London	LOCATION	, he says : '' Their creed is an intelligent one , and is in direct line with the current tendencies .

		As yet they have produced no pictures which might be called reflective of their principles , but have kept before English artists the necessity of eliminating the unessentials . ''

		The Cubists are already a thing of history .

		Even the Futurists are in the past tense .

		Besides , the Futurists never did represent real advance .

		They are `` at bottom decadent , inasmuch as they turn their art back to illustration . ''

		The reader who wishes to know the extent of Futurist reversion to illustration may satisfy his curiosity by turning to Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's two reproductions ,
Severini	PERSON	's Hieroglyphe Dynam - ique du Bal Tabarin and
Russolo	PERSON	's
Dyna	PERSON	- misme d' une Auto .

		For specimens of the really unillustrative and objectively unrecog - nizable as it culminates in the Synchromists , he should look at
Russell	ORGANIZATION	's Synchromie Cos - mique and
Macdonald	PERSON	-
Wright	PERSON	's `` Arm Organi - sation in Blue-Green . ''

		The latter is impure , however ; we are bidden to look near the centre for a '' small and arbitrary interpreta - tion of the constructional form of the human arm . ''

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	is conscious of the disparity between claims and achievement in the New Painting .

		Men and movements have con - tributed to theory and technique rather than to art , to possibility rather than to possession .

		He explains : '' The new methods are so young that painters have not had time to acquire that mastery of material without which the highest achievement is impossible ... Mod - ern art , having no tradition of means , has sapped and dispersed the vitality of its expo - nents by imposing upon them the necessity for empirical research .

		It is for this reason that we have no men in modern art who approximate as closely to perfection as did many of the older painters . ''

		And yet the gravity and assurance with which Mr.
Wright	PERSON	presents and discusses his illustrations leave no doubt in the reader 's mind as to his very favorable estimate of the actual achievement of modern painting .

		Praise of the modern and disparagement of the old go hand in hand .

		Courbet 's
Les Cas	ORGANIZATION	- seurs de Pierres is `` far greater than any - thing
Millet	PERSON	has ever done , despite the vast popularity of such purely sentimental pic - tures as the Angelus and The Man with the Hoe ... In
Millet	ORGANIZATION	's best canvases one finds at most only a parallelism of lines , and in his 488 THE DIAL
Nov. 25	DATE	lesser pictures even this amateurish attempt at organisation is lacking . ''

		In the light of so much assurance , it is interesting to examine the four subjects in color and the twenty-four reproductions with which Mr.
Wright	PERSON	has adorned his book .

		If they illustrate anything as a whole , it surely is that in proportion as the painting of the past century has ascended in the scale of theory and technique it has descended in the scale of beauty , intelligibility , and emotional j appeal .

		Of the twenty-eight illustrations as j they appear in this book , fifteen would be classed by any person except a modernist stu - dent or a devotee of the comic supplement as either ugly , grotesque , or mystifying ; and most of the fifteen fall within the period of nearest approach to '' final purification . ''

		Nor is it clear how these qualities could fail to be felt before the actual canvas , however perfect the color .

		It is significant , too , that Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's criticism is almost wholly con - cerned with the Idea the theory and the science of painting , rather than its apprecia - tion .

		Of enthusiasm for beauty there are comparatively few traces .

		Of course the answer to this is all ready .

		The competence of the adverse critic is con - sistently denied . ''

		The ignorant and reac - tionary may laugh and hurl philippics .

		For centuries painting has been reared on a false foundation , and the criteria of aesthetic appre - ciation have been irrelevant . '' ''

		The lack of comprehension and consequently the ridi - cule which has met the efforts of modern painters , is attributable not alone to a misun - derstanding of their seemingly extravagant and eccentric mannerisms , but to an ignorance of the basic postulates of all great art both ancient and modern . ''

		Preferences for the old masters , `` if they are symptomatic of aught save the mere habit of mind immersed in tradition , indicate an immaturity of artis - tic judgment which places prettiness above beauty , and sentimentality and documentary interest above subjectivity and emotion . ''

		`` An untechnical onlooker .

		.

		can never sound the depths of art ... Critics for the most part are writers whose admiration for art has been born in front of the completed works of the great masters . ''

		What this really means is that what the modern painters say of themselves is true because the modern painters say it is true .

		It is a denial of the right of even the cultivated public to participate a denial of the social nature of art .

		And of course we are reminded that criti - cism has a record by no means free from examples of fallibility , and that genius has often before been laughed at .

		The logic of this is simple .

		The critics fought
Wagner	PERSON	, and the critics were wrong ; therefore the critics are wrong in opposing the
Synchro	LOCATION	- mists .

		Genius has sometimes been resisted and laughed at ; therefore everything that is resisted and laughed at is genius .

		And yet Mr.
Wright	PERSON	himself says the Futurists are at bottom decadent .

		He does not laugh at them .

		The modernist is incapable of laughter at anything except what are foolishly called the eternal verities .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's book is well written , and dis - plays a thorough familiarity with modern painting .

		Considering the content , it is writ - ten even with some restraint .

		It serves well the purpose of definition , and is for this rea - son very welcome .

		But for most lovers of art it has a fundamental defect .

		They will deny ignorantly and undefecatedly , of course the doctrines of unrecognizability and the all - sufficiency of color .

		We often speak of carry - ing a thing to its logical conclusion , and it is no very great compliment to logic that we usually balk at the carrying of things to their logical conclusions .

		Modern painting and its apologists have not balked .

		Ordinary earthly logic could ask no greater compliment than the one they have paid it .

		But perhaps the musical analogy is not perfect .

		Perhaps a symphony itself is not absolutely uninvolved with illustration .

		It is to be doubted whether any art may or ought to be perfectly pure .

		Perhaps painting must be , let us not say a bastard art , but a complex art .

		Perhaps the old masters , and the earlier of the new , were not wholly illogical or incompetent in still conceiving of color as instrument rather than end .

		The old masters were undeniably geniuses , if only in a small way .

		For the reader who desires to regard the painter 's art from a different angle ,
Kenyoii Cox	ORGANIZATION	's solid and spirited '' The Classic Point of View '' can not be too strongly recommended .

Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 489 sometimes occurs in his recollections is admira - bly filled with his own letters , and also with those of his friends of whom , indeed , there were an army .

		Sir
Robert	PERSON	's account of his early years at
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	is a charming record of undergraduate life ; and his own efforts to perfect his charac - ter , as well as his scientific studies , are shown in the records of this period .

		In one of these he says : '' I have not sufficiently practised -LRB- 1 -RRB- kindness , -LRB- 2 -RRB- moderation , -LRB- 3 -RRB- gentleness , -LRB- 4 -RRB- sufficient thought before speaking , -LRB- 5 -RRB- re - pression of sarcastic habits . ''

		His first position after leaving college was that of tutor to Lord
Rosse	PERSON	's three youngest sons , a very congenial billet .

		Lord
Rosse	PERSON	was hospitably inclined toward the young tutor , who already felt a drawing to astronomy , and permission to use the famous
Rosse	PERSON	telescope was his chief delight .

		This instrument was actually constructed by Lord
Rosse	PERSON	; and al - though since removed to the
Victoria	LOCATION	and Al - bert Museum at
South Kensington	LOCATION	, was at this time in fine shape for use , particularly upon the nebulas .

		The young man was both tutor and astronomer , and some of his happiest days were during these two years .

		The morning was spent with his pupils in the castle ; and aside from the games and recreation with them afterward , he devoted his afternoons and spare time to the workshops .

		Lord
Rosse	PERSON	gave him carte blanche , also , to borrow any book from his library .

		The use of the large tele - scope must have been very laborious , as it took four assistants to make observations .

		On fine evenings Ball would go to the observatory as soon as it was dark .

		It was here that he witnessed the display of
November	DATE	meteors of
1866	DATE	, a magnificent occasion brilliantly de - scribed by the author .

		The guest book at Par - sonstown
Observatory	ORGANIZATION	contains the names of many of the great astronomers .

		Ball speaks of visiting Sir
William Huggins	PERSON	, to whose house Lord
Rosse	PERSON	took him during some of their
London	LOCATION	trips , and to those of other scien - tific men .

		The seven years after Ball left Lord
Rosse	PERSON	were full of work and achievement .

		He took a position in the
Royal College of Science	ORGANIZATION	in
Dublin	LOCATION	, as professor of applied mathematics and mechanics .

		At
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	he had devoted much attention to these subjects , and his hours in Lord
Rosse	PERSON	's workshop had given him a deeper insight into mechanics , to which he devoted his first course of lectures .

		He con - tinued at the
Royal College	ORGANIZATION	until
1874	DATE	, when his friends urged him to apply for the position of Royal Astronomer of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		He was ap - pointed , finding himself Astronomer Royal of
Ireland	LOCATION	and
Andrews Professor of Astronomy	ORGANIZATION	in the
University of Dublin	ORGANIZATION	, a double assign - ment which he held for eighteen years .

		Al - ways happy in himself , his work , and his friends , Sir
Robert	PERSON	's sense of humor was kindly and never cynical , and this endeared him to all .

		At the
Dunsink Observatory	ORGANIZATION	some of his happiest hours were spent .

		He speaks of the magnificent prospect from this site .

		Indeed , we remember well the extraordinary view spread out on every side , the sea and the city of
Dublin	LOCATION	,
Phoenix Park	LOCATION	in front , and the beautiful range of mountains including Three Rock and Two Rock , and the Wicklow mountains behind .

		Sir
Robert	PERSON	speaks in appreciative terms of hisi predecessors , among them Sir
William Rowan Hamilton	PERSON	and Dr.
Briinnow	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Copeland	PERSON	was assistant astronomer , but he was absent when Ball first went to Dunsink , hav - ing accompanied the famous expedition of Lord
Lindsay	PERSON	-LRB- subsequently Earl of Craw - ford -RRB- to observe the transit of Venus at
Mau	ORGANIZATION	- ritius .

		The second of the pair of transits of Venus , in
December of 1882	DATE	, Sir
Robert	PERSON	ob - served himself .

		The sky was covered with clouds during the day , but in the late after - noon it lightened almost miraculously , the sun burst forth , and Sir
Robert	PERSON	beheld the globe of Venus standing out on the solar disc .

		It was extremely gratifying to him , and of the utmost importance to the astronomers of this and all other countries .

		Those who beheld this spectacle in all its beauty will have no other opportunity until
June , 2004	DATE	, although
Venus	PERSON	in her frequent journeys around the sun passes only a little above or a little below the disc each time .

		In
1892	DATE	, Sir
Robert	PERSON	was appointed
Lown	PERSON	- dean
Professor of Astronomy	ORGANIZATION	at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, in succession to
John Couch Adams	PERSON	.

		He was also appointed Director of the
Cambridge	LOCATION	Ob - servatory .

		There is less in his reminiscences concerning the life at
Cambridge	LOCATION	than of some other portions , but fortunately his many let - ters enable the chapter to Jbe written largely from his own point of view .

		There are numer - ous letters of congratulation on his appoint - ment , and his own letters are filled with his reasons for making the change , particularly the letter to Mrs.
Adams	PERSON	, the widow of his predecessor .

		In
July , 1892	DATE	, he was given a fellowship at
Kings College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		In
December	DATE	of the same year the degree of Master of Arts was conferred on him at the
Senate ' House	ORGANIZATION	at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		The account of his reception there , and the countless friends who made this occasion noteworthy , takes up a large part of the chapter on
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Sir
Joseph Lar	PERSON	- mor has written a fine account of Ball 's work 490 THE DIAL
Nov. 25	DATE	during the
Cambridge	LOCATION	years .

		Dr.
A. A. Com	PERSON	- mon , Sir
William	PERSON	and Lady Hugging , Sir
David Gill	PERSON	, and others of his friends give char - acteristic pictures of this great man who was nevertheless so delightfully human .

		In
1899	DATE
the Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	undertook the publication of his treatise on the Theory of Screws , the most abstract and purely mathe - matical of Sir
Robert	PERSON	's writings .

		His work on '' Spherical Astronomy '' is constantly referred to , and his '' Story of the Heavens '' is widely popular .

		Sir
Robert	PERSON	's mind appears to have been won - derfully versatile .

		His interest in botany was very great , and one of the constant compan - ions on his travels was a copy of
Bentham	PERSON	's `` British Flora . ''

		On his country walks of
spring	DATE	or early
summer	DATE	it was difficult to find a plant which he could not name in English or Latin .

		His copy of
Bentham	PERSON	was especially interleaved , and on the blank pages he re - corded the place in which he found any par - ticular plant .

		In wild animals , also , Sir
Robert	PERSON	was not less interested .

		He was a member of the Council of the
Dublin	LOCATION	Zoological So - ciety , and he always actively engaged in its affairs .

		Ball 's own account of the real beginning of his career as a lecturer is contained largely in some notes which he collected when planning to write his reminiscences .

		His first lecture on the public platform was in
February , 1869	DATE	, when at the
Belfast Athenaeum	LOCATION	he spoke on . ''

		Some Recent Astronomical Discoveries . ''

		He records triumphantly : `` I made 14 s .

		This is the first sum I ever made by this method . ''

		Later in the same year he gave other scientific lectures , exhibiting even in those early days that power of exposition which afterwards rendered him facile princeps among public lecturers .

		In
1881	DATE	he gave one of his most famous lectures , `` A Glimpse through the Corridors of Time . ''

		The vast reach of tides was appreciated by mathemati - cians ; but few in a large popular audience could have known the part played by tidal evolution in molding earth , moon , and planets millions of years ago .

		It was a singularly beautiful and instructive address .

		`` A Night with Lord
Rosse	PERSON	's Telescope , '' `` The Moon , '' and '' Krakatoa '' were some of the later sub - jects .

		His lectures became more and more popular .

		He went on numerous tours , and his accounts of his entertainment and the journeys in connection with these are espe - cially interesting to those of us who have done similar work on a smaller scale .

		Ball 's lectures at the Royal Institution were highly significant .

		Faraday had explained to a delighted audience the results of his investi - gations in magneto-electricity ; and Profes - sor
Tyndall	PERSON	's lectures had been subsequently published in book form .

		Faraday himself had given a famous Christmas course on '' The Chemistry of a Candle . ''

		With some diffi - dence Sir
Robert	PERSON	gave his first course of Christmas lectures , illustrating them by appa - ratus which he had made himself .

		It is hardly necessary to say that these lectures were very popular .

		The audience comprised persons of all ages , from a child of eight years to
Madame Antoinette Sterling	ORGANIZATION	and the Lord Chancellor . ''

		The Universe in Motion '' was another of his most popular lectures .

		Sir
Robert	PERSON	's personal notes and memoranda about his lectures were very exacting ; but when some one inquired if he did not weary of
speaking night after night	TIME	, his reply was : '' When you have some skill in your art , the exercise of it is delight - ful . ''

		He several times made lecture trips through the
United States	LOCATION	, and was every - where greeted with great affection and ac - corded the closest attention .

		At home he gave courses of lectures to his advanced students at
Cambridge	LOCATION	on Screws , the Planetary Theory , and other abstract subjects .

		In
1882	DATE	he was appointed Scientific Advisor to the
Irish Lights Board	ORGANIZATION	, in succession to the late Professor
Tyndall	PERSON	.

		For several years he enjoyed the annual cruise of the
Inspecting Committee	ORGANIZATION	around the island on their yacht , the '' Princess Alexandra . ''

		He went to Nor - way for the eclipse in
1896	DATE	.

		All expeditions of that year , save
Nova Zembla	LOCATION	, suffered de - feat from clouds .

		The present reviewer was in Yezo , and can testify that , as a spectacle , the eclipse will never be duplicated .

		The Astronomer Royal was on the south-east coast of Yezo , and we afterwards met and compared notes .

		Sir
Robert	PERSON	gives a very delightful de - scription of the north country .

		In this charming biography , or autobiog - raphy as it might almost be called , the interest of its subject in human nature , as well as in the wonders of the heavens , is all-pervasive .

		The pictures which it gives of Sir
Robert Ball	PERSON	's human and genial nature are beauti - fully sketched , and one reads every word of the memoir , from the first to the last .

		It is a delightful book about a delightful man whose hands and head were always busy with some abstruse yet popular subject .

		It was in
1913	DATE	that he died , when but seventy-three years old , having filled those years to the full with strenuous endeavor .

		The sentence from Car - lyle which just before his death Sir
Robert	PERSON	chose for a motto well expresses the spirit of his own life , '' Happy is the man who has found his work . ''

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 491 THE IRVING-BREVOORT LETTERS .

		*
Washington Irving	LOCATION	was frank and open in his relations with all men , yet it is doubtful if he ever revealed himself more fully than in the letters to his life-long friend
Henry Bre	ORGANIZATION	- voort .

		A considerable number of these letters were known to
Pierre M. Irving	PERSON	, who gave copious and on the whole well-chosen extracts from them in his '' Life and Letters of Wash - ington Irving , '' but it is a pleasure to have them in their completeness .

		They are now issued , as edited by Mr.
George S. Hellman	PERSON	, in an edition limited to 255 sets , beautifully printed at the
Knickerbocker Press	ORGANIZATION	, and taste - fully bound .

		In a prefatory note , the publish - ers speak of '' the relations of close sympathy and of personal friendship that existed through a long series of years between Wash - ington
Irving	PERSON	and the late
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	, '' and express their pleasure at being able to bring forth this work of
Irving 's	ORGANIZATION	, much of which has hitherto remained unpublished .

		The happy tone of this note and the attractive appear - ance of the volumes tend to make their appear - ance a formal festive occasion , on which tributes may be paid to the genial American author whose work is now rounding out a cen - tury of popularity , and congratulations offered to the publishers whose name has been so long and so honorably linked with his .

		This being the spirit in which the reader takes up Mr.
Hellman	PERSON	's edition of the letters , it may seem inappropriate to point out defects .

		But there are certain things which one has a right to demand of any work , be it textbook , standard edition , or volume de luxe ; and it must long be a cause of regret to students of American literature that the editor 's work in the present instance has not been better done .

		Intimate personal letters like these , full of references to friends and relatives designated by abbreviated and pet names , would be im - mensely more valuable if accompanied by explanatory notes .

		It may be that the task of annotation has been left for a later edition ; but surely such editorial work as has here been done should be reasonably accurate and intelligent .

		The letters are supposedly given in chrono - logical order .

		The first is printed with the date ''
Oct. 23d , 1807	DATE	, '' and of this the editor says : `` And now , following the path of these letters , let us accompany Irving down the stream of the years .

		We find him first a genial , light-hearted youth of twenty-four , preparing the publication of that book which is more intimately associated than any other with the name and traditions of our city * THE LETTERS OF
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	IRVING TO
HENRY BREVOORT	PERSON	.

		Edited , with an Introduction , by
George S. Hellman	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		Limited edition .


New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		the History of
New York	LOCATION	by
Diedrich Knicker	PERSON	- bocker . ''

		The testimony of Irving 's biographers is that in
1807	DATE	, when
Irving	PERSON	was a youth of twenty - four , the `` Knickerbocker History '' was not begun and probably not even thought of .

		The author himself says , in the '' Apology '' pre - fixed to later editions , that it was '' commenced in company with my brother , the late
Peter Irving	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	'' ; and according to the '' Life and Letters , '' ``
Peter	PERSON	had returned from a year 's absence in
Europe	LOCATION	just before the appearance of the last number -LSB- of '' Salmagundi , ''
Jan. 25 , 1808	DATE	-RSB- , and in conjunction .

		.

		the two broth - ers commenced the History of
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		There is no evidence that
Washington	LOCATION	Irving made any extended visit to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	in the
autumn of 1807	DATE	, and he surely published no important work there .

		But let the letter speak for itself : '' I have been delayed in putting my work to press by some minute & curious facts which I found in a
Mss	ORGANIZATION	.

		in the
Phila d Library &	ORGANIZATION	which has obliged me to make alterations in the first vol .

		but to-morrow I begin by God . ''

		I wish you would immediately forward me the inscription on old
P. Stuyvesant Tombstone	ORGANIZATION	and get
Jim	PERSON	as well as yourself to prepare some squibbs & c to attract attention to the work when it comes out . ''

		It would be interesting to know how the editor interprets all this in the light of the date he assigns .

		Certainly the paragraphs quoted seem to place the letter in the
autumn of 1809	DATE	, when Irving is known to have been in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	for the purpose of bringing out the History .

		In the absence of the MS. , it seems a reasonable conjecture that the editor mis-read
1807	DATE	for
1809	DATE	; that he failed utterly to consider the contents of the letter ; and that instead of being printed as number one , it should be number five .

		If the error is only in the year , the day of the month raises some interesting questions .

		The '' Life and Letters '' states that '' In the
November	DATE	succeeding , Mr.
Irving	PERSON	repaired to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	to superintend the publication of his History of
New York	LOCATION	... Though the author had carried the manuscript in a complete state to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, yet he afterward made some addi - tions , as was not unusual with him , as the work was going through the press .

		It was here that he wrote the voyage of
Peter Stuyvesant	PERSON	up the
Hudson	LOCATION	, and the enumeration of the army . ''

		But if this letter were dated
October 23 , 1809	DATE	, Irving went to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	before
November	DATE	, and we have another of the many instances in which the earlier biographer is not impec - cable in matters of detail .

		Moreover , the mock advertisement announcing the disap - pearance of Mr.
Knickerbocker	PERSON	from the 492 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 25	DATE
Columbian Hotel	ORGANIZATION	in Mulberry Street appeared in - the `` Evening Post '' of
October 26	DATE	-LRB- the `` Life and Letters '' seems to give the date incorrectly as
Oct. 25	DATE	-RRB- .

		Was this a prompt response on the part of
Brevoort	LOCATION	to the appeal for `` squibbs '' to call attention to the work ?

		And if so , is the credit for this in - genious advertising to be given not to
Irving	LOCATION	, but to his friends who remained in
New York	LOCATION	?

		It is , however , unsatisfactory to base specula - tions on printed data that are clearly wrong in one important point , and that may be wrong in others .

		Such looseness as this on the first page of a work casts doubt on the accuracy of any part .

		If the reader loses his tone of urbanity over the vagaries of the editor , he is helped to regain it when he comes to the writings of Irving himself .

		Irving is urbane , with the unfailing urbanity that comes from kindli - ness of heart .

		The earlier letters are not wholly without a certain affectation that is more representative of the time and the place than of Irving .

		The '' by God '' of the letter already quoted , the `` Damme '' with which another ends , and similar expressions , are strange oaths which seem somehow to be swaggered forth with an embarrassed air .

		Though there can be no doubt of Irving 's susceptibility , the references to women that fill so large a space in the early letters imply an attitude as man of the world that is not quite natural . ''

		The little
Taylor	PERSON	has been here and passed some time since your departure .

		She is a delightful little creature , but alas , my dear
Hal	PERSON	, she has not the pewter , as the sage
Peter	PERSON	says .

		As to beauty , what is it ' but a flower ! '

		Handsome is that hand - some has , is the modern maxim .

		Therefore , lit - tle
Taylor	PERSON	, ' though thy little finger be armed in a thimble , ' yet will I set thee at defiance .

		In a word , she is like an ortolan , too rare and costly a dainty for a poor man to afford , but were I a nabob , ` fore
George	PERSON	, ortolans should be my only food .

		`` As I rode into town the other day , I had nearly ran down the fair Maria M re .

		I immediately thought of your sudden admiration for her , which seemed to spring up rather late in the season , like strawberries in the fall when every other swain 's passion had died a natural & lingering death .

		The fair
Maria	PERSON	-LRB- for almighty truth will out -RRB- begins in my eyes to look , as that venerable Frenchman Todd would say D d stringy .

		She has been act - ing very much the part of the dog in the manger she can not enjoy her own chastity but seems un - willing to let anybody else do it .

		There certainly is a selfish pleasure in possessing a thing which is exclusively our own and which we see everybody around us coveting .

		And this may be the reason why we sometimes behold very beautiful women maintaining resolute possession of their charms and what makes me think this must be the reason is that in proportion as these women grow old , and the world ceases to long after their treasures , they seem the most ready to part with them , until they at length seem ready to sacrifice them to the first bidder , and even to importune you to take them off their hands .

		This however I hope and believe will never be the case with the fair
Maria	PERSON	, who , thanks to her cool temperament can still pass on ' in maiden meditation fancy free . ' ''

		-LRB-
July 8 , 1812	DATE	. -RRB-

		There is much of this sort of thing ; but , though it would be too strong to call it pose , it is not quite the real Irving .

		By far the greater number of the letters were written during Irving 's long stay abroad from
1815	DATE	to
1832	DATE	.

		A marked , almost an abrupt , change seems to come over the man as he finds himself at
Birmingham	LOCATION	and Liver - pool , oppressed by the perplexities of busi - ness , and anxious concerning the health of his brother
Peter	PERSON	.

		He never loses courage , and in all his letters there is no trace of bitter - ness or cynicism ; but he is never again the petted and somewhat irresponsible younger son , content only to enjoy life gaily .

		In
July , 1817	DATE	, when there was no hope of saving the family fortunes , he wrote in a letter part of which was quoted in the '' Life and Letters '' : '' I have weighed every thing pro and con on the subject of returning home and have for the present abandoned the idea .

		My affections would at once prompt me to return , but in doing so , would they insure me any happiness ?

		Would they not on the contrary be productive of misery ?

		I should find those I love & whom I had left prosperous strug - gling with adversity without my being able to yield them comfort or assistance .

		Every scene of past enjoyment would be a cause of regret and dis - content .

		I should have no immediate mode of sup - port & should be perhaps a bother to my friends who have claims enough on their sympathy & exer - tions .

		No no .

		If I must scuffle with poverty let me do it out of sight where I am but little known where I can not even contrast present penury with former affluence .

		In this country I have a plan for immediate support it may lead to some - thing better at any rate it places me for a time above the horrors of destitution or the more galling mortifications of dependence . ''

		To this same subject of returning to
America	LOCATION	, and to the pain caused by friends who mis - understood his motives for staying abroad , he frequently recurs .

		To a question by
Brevoort	PERSON	whether he intends to renounce his country he writes ,
March 10 , 1821	DATE	, a spirited reply the best parts of which are given in the `` Life and Letters , '' and need not be quoted here .

		The details of personal business affairs of embarrassments and drafts and loans which fill many pages are not in themselves edifying , but they show how beset the author long was by financial difficulties , how trou - bled he was by them , and how anxious he was not to burden ` others or even to blame them
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 493 when they were less considerate than they might have been .

		These volumes contain no great and strik - ing contribution to our knowledge of Irving 's life , and they are not especially rich in pic - turesque detail .

		It seems as if the author wrote more objective description of sights and scenes to other friends and relatives , and kept for
Brevoort	PERSON	his most intimate and per - sonal feelings .

		The letters do , therefore , help us to a closer view of the man , and they do nothing but add to the regard and respect which we already feel for him .

		Nor should this notice close without reference to
Henry Brevoort	PERSON	.

		Once a well known citizen of
New York	LOCATION	, a man of wealth and culture and public spirit , it is probably his fate henceforth to be remembered chiefly as the friend of Irving .

		So is literary fame , if it be really fame , greater and more lasting than that won in most fields of endeavor .

		Of his writing no word is given here ; but a man may be judged by the letters he receives as well as by those he writes .

		The friend to whom Irving could so express himself was a kindly and manly person , and worthy of at least passing remembrance .


WILLIAM B. CAIRNS	PERSON	.

		JjITERATTJRE AND HISTORY .

		* Mr.
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	's new volume , resplen - dent in red and gold , with its many attractive illustrations , its double-leaded pages with luxurious margins , its freedom from all scien - tific apparatus in the form of maps , foot - notes , and bibliographies , and above all its dramatic title , `` High Lights of the French Revolution , '' displays all the outward signs of history conceived in the literary vein , whose avowed purpose is to entertain .

		An examina - tion of the contents of the volume only serves to strengthen the inference drawn from its outward form .

		As the title suggests , Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	makes no serious effort to describe the revolution as a whole , but sketches in a light way a few of its dramatic episodes , and is far more concerned with literary effects than with historic truth .

		But it is not simply as a piece of literature that Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's volume would be judged ; it is history in the form of literature , the work , we are told , of '' the ablest living writer on these themes ... Pic - turesque , vivid , minutely circumstantial , rush - ing in interest .

		In literary qualities the episodes are comparable to those of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and they have the added advantage of a less prejudiced point of view , a greater precision * HIGH LIGHTS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION .

		By
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	.

		Illustrated in color .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		in matters of fact , and an easier , more gra - cious style . ''

		If we can believe this announce - ment , Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	has succeeded in reconciling the legitimate demands of both history and literature , has produced a book that is at the same time a work of science and a work of art .

		But has he succeeded ?

		Has he given us a sound piece of historical writing ?

		If not , whatever else his book may be , it is not his - tory .

		Now truth is the first test of the value of every historical work .

		If it be not true , it matters not how '' interesting '' or '' readable '' a work may be , it is not history .

		Even
Croce	PERSON	, who would classify history and litera - ture under art , defines literature as `` knowl - edge of the ideally possible , '' history as '' knowledge of what has actually happened . ''

		Literature appeals primarily to the emotions , history to the intellect .

		The task of the his - torian , the truthful restoration of man 's unique social evolution , is an arduous one , and has little in common with the work of the poet or of the novelist .

		To search labo - riously for evidence , to criticize the evidence when found , to reconstruct the facts of the past by a comparison of the affirmations of independent eye-witnesses , to combine these facts into a complex and changing whole , restraining the inclination of the imagination to go beyond the evidence and state more than the evidence would justify , this is work for a scientist , not for an artist .

		So true is this that a man with a decidedly artistic tempera - ment , with a strong subconscious imagination fitting him for creative literary work , may be utterly unfitted for scientific historical work .

		It was said of
Froude	PERSON	that he was '' constitu - tionally inaccurate . ''

		Everyone `` commits some errors .

		.

		the abnormal thing is to com - mit many , to commit them constantly , in spite of the most persevering efforts to be exact .

		.

		.

		The involuntary imagination , taking a part in the intellectual operations , produces bad results .

		It fills in by conjecture gaps in the memory , it magnifies or attenuates the real facts , it confounds them with its pure inven - tion . ''

		Like
Froude	PERSON	, Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	artistically brilliant is '' constitutionally inaccurate , '' the victim of a too powerful subconscious imagination that unfits him for scientific his - torical work .

		I made this observation some years ago in a review of his life of Robes - pierre .

		All of his later work has simply strengthened this first impression , most of all the present volume on `` High Lights of the French Revolution . ''

		This criticism , if well founded , is a serious one .

		It is the duty of the historian to pro- tect the public against unsound historical 494 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 25	DATE	work .

		And against no modern writer dealing with historical subjects does the public stand more in need of protection than against Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	.

		He literally invites confidence in his seemingly exact scholarship .

		In the preface to his life of
Robespierre	LOCATION	he wrote : '' It will be discovered by my reader that con - tinually throughout the following pages I have introduced that kind of description which is ex - pected rather in the evidence of an eye-witness or in the creations of fiction .

		I know that such an attempt at vivid presentation carries with it a cer - tain suspicion when it is applied to history .

		I can only assure my readers that the details I have admitted can be proved to be true from the witness of contemporaries or from the inference which their descriptions and the public records of the time permit one to draw . ''

		In the face of that statement , who of the many readers of Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's delightful vol - ume even suspected that it swarmed with errors from cover to cover ?

		And to how many of the readers of the present volume will he fail to communicate confidence in his scholarship when he writes : `` Necker would have it in his memoirs that he was overborne by Barentin and , as one may say , by the queen 's party ; that his original compro - mise was made a little stronger in favor of the crown .

		To this charge , like the weak and false man he was , he would ascribe all the breakdown that followed .

		I do not beliete him .

		I think he lied .

		We know how he made his fortune and we know how to contrast the whole being of a man like
Necker	ORGANIZATION	with the whole being of a man like
Barentin	PERSON	.

		Read Barentin 's notes on those same two days and you will have little doubt that
Necker	ORGANIZATION	lied . ''

		The inference Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	would have us draw from this passage is that he has carefully investigated the matter of his book , and that we may put the utmost confidence in the cor - rectness of his statements .

		To prove that this inference is unjustified is not difficult .

		The examples are numerous ; it is simply a ques - tion of choice .

		I shall limit myself to two .

		The first of Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's sketches deals with `` The Royal Seance '' of
June 23 , 1789	DATE	.

		Somewhat unusual familiarity with the sources of this period puts me in position to judge of Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's methods of work and of the trustworthiness of his results .

		The work impresses me as being of the most uncritical and superficial character .

		In his account of the events of
May 19	DATE	, Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	describes a midnight visit of
Talleyrand	LOCATION	to
Marly	LOCATION	, where a long interview took place between
Talley	PERSON	- rand and the Comte d'Artois .

		The only evi - dence bearing upon the matter is found , so far as I am able to discover , in the Memoires of
Talleyrand	LOCATION	.


Talleyrand	LOCATION	writes of going to
Marly	LOCATION	, but does not mention any dates .

		Bacourt , his editor , reports in a note what he had heard about a call of
Talleyrand	LOCATION	upon the Comte d'Artois on the
night	TIME	of
July 15-16	DATE	, and his account of that interview cor - responds exactly with Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's detailed account of the interview of
June 19	DATE	at
Marly	LOCATION	.

		How could Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	have made such a care - less blunder ?

		The probable explanation does not increase one 's confidence in his scholar - ship .

		In only one other secondary work have I ever found any reference to the presence of
Talleyrand	LOCATION	in
Marly	LOCATION	on the
night	TIME	of
June 19	DATE	; that work is Lord
Acton	PERSON	's `` Lectures on the French Revolution . ''

		He uses the incident in the same way , making the same blunder about the date that Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	makes .

		Lord
Acton	PERSON	undoubtedly used
Bacourt	ORGANIZATION	's note .

		A com - parison of the text of Lord
Acton	PERSON	's lectures with the text of Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's book makes clear that Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	got his information from Lord
Acton	PERSON	's work , reproducing part of it verbally without quotation marks .

		The two important things to note here are that the incident reported in detail by Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	is not history , and that he did not take ordinary pains to determine whether it was or not .

		The trained historian , encountering that inci - dent for the first time in Lord
Acton	PERSON	's pages , would '' run it down '' and discover that it was not true .

		It evidently never occurred to Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	that the matter should be investi - gated .

		Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	blunders again when he repeats after Lord
Acton	PERSON	that the delegation of the clergy that went to
Marly	PERSON	on the
night	TIME	of
June 19	DATE	consisted of the archbishops of
Paris	LOCATION	and of
Rouen	LOCATION	; the two sources I have before me say the Cardinal de la Rochefoucault and the Archbishop of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The second example of '' precision , '' and by far the worst bevue I have noticed , is found in the chapter on '' The Storming of the Tuile - ries . ''

		Every schoolboy knows that on the morning of
August	DATE	10
Louis XVI	PERSON	.

		left the chateau for the assembly before the chateau had been attacked by the people .

		Even Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	must know this when he is not writing literary history !

		And yet , after describing the murderous fire of the Swiss guards and the retreat of the besiegers , he discovers
Louis	PERSON	j `` at his window , overlooking the still empty ; inclosure beneath him '' !

		Roederer is by his j side . ''

		The Swiss guards still held the main | door of the Tuileries ; the fire from its long i tiers of windows was still well nourished ; the muskets in the hands of the half - trained popu - lace were still regularly recharged and held their own .

		It was in this moment of doubt that
Roederer	PERSON	, the politician who stood by
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL RECENT FICTION .

		* the king at his eastern window , said to
Louis	LOCATION	that it was the duty of a monarch not to risk the state . ''

		The king decided to leave the chateau and take refuge in the assembly .

		Then follows the description of the famous crossing of the garden through the fallen leaves .

		It was so difficult to believe that '' the ablest living writer on these themes '' could blunder like the veriest novice in recounting so well known an episode that I turned to the sources to assure myself that the traditional order of facts is correct .

		There was no mistake about it ; Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's subconscious imagina - tion was once more interfering with his intel - lectual operations and falsifying the results .

		It seems to me that examples like these and they are only specimens justify my statement that Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	is '' constitutionally inaccurate . ''

		How much confidence can be placed in the historical work of a writer whose method is so bad , and who blunders so unconsciously in dealing with well-known facts ?

		`` Would a cautious student venture to use any `` fact '' found in his work without j having first verified it ?

		Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	has not , ; then , succeeded in producing a book that is at the same time a work of science and a work of art ; he has not given us a sound piece of historical writing .

		FRED MORROW Along in the eighties there was a general arraignment of the fiction of the day .

		There was not so much fiction then as now , but j there was a good deal ; and a large part of it , j chiefly English , was widely circulated in the j paper-covered editions of the so-called '' libra - | ries . ''

		There are many houses to-day where in the attic or in some closet you may still find piles of novels by
William Black	PERSON	,
L. B. Walford	PERSON	,
W. E. Norris	PERSON	, and many others .

		These novels were undoubtedly interesting , but there arose a feeling that such stories they were likely to be stories of English so - ciety were rather tame .

		Then there set in a tide of tales of adventure , such as '' The Wreck of the Grosvener , '' ''
King Solomon	PERSON	's Mines , '' '' Treasure Island , '' and many more .

		People were delighted to read such things , and liked the feeling that they were literary .

		was also attacked as not being true enough to life .

		The last generation -LRB- like this -RRB- had many who became irritated , or angry , or dis - couraged , or perhaps merely disgusted or tired , at having life presented as attractive , sentimental , charming , and yet presented -LRB- so it was urged -RRB- in a superficial way that always avoided real truth .

		It might be true enough on the surface , it was said , but it did not get to the things that were important in the actual life people lived .

		Real life , many peo - ple felt , was so fine that anything in it , everything , in fact , had its beauty , and was at least better than the touched-up conven - tionalities that one could get at any after - noon tea or sewing-circle .

		So there came in a kind of realism -LRB- encouraged by foreign example -RRB- , of which Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's `` Jude the Obscure '' is a good specimen .

		Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	had made something of a sensation in select - ing Tess as his type of '' a good woman . ''

		He now made a more vigorous sensation by the pig-killing episode and other things in '' Jude the Obscure . ''

		This '' reaction , '' as the histories of litera - ture would call it , produced many '' realistic '' books .

		It did not , however , do away with the kind of book from which it differed .

		There are many conventional '' domestic '' novels to - day of no especial importance ; but there are also a good many books which , without being domestic , appear to take life according to its obvious , popular , external characteristics , and some of them are worth noting .

		The late
Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	's ''
Felix O'Day	PERSON	'' is a book similar to those which caused the wrath of many a realist generations ago .

		It is almost generations ago that Mr.
Smith	PERSON	told about Colonel
Carter	PERSON	of
Cartersville	LOCATION	.

		That book and a number of others `` Peter '' and `` Kennedy Square '' will be best remembered presented with great sympathy and skill a `` charming '' view of life .

		So does ``
Felix O'Day	PERSON	. ''

		The story is quite impossible .

		The characters amount to little save as they are quaint and eccentric .

		The real thing is the atmosphere , the general feeling of life .

		There in
New York	LOCATION	, along Fourth Avenue , was a phase of life now passed away which Mr.
Smith	PERSON	knew and loved .

		He liked to give pictures , sketches , impressions of places and people that he thought charming , sometimes in print , sometimes in paint .

		So he does here ; and just as people like his sketches of literary or artistic bits of
London	LOCATION	or
Venice	LOCATION	, so they will like his sketches of passing
New York	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Burnett	PERSON	goes in for more than does Mr.
Smith	PERSON	.

		She never is absolutely domestic any more than he , indeed , in `` The Lost Prince '' she is not domestic at all .

		But like 496 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 25	DATE	Mr.
Smith	PERSON	, she always gives us a view of life which the realist calls superficial , sentimental , conventional , and other such things .

		No one , however , would call her work tame .

		A lit - tle mountainous country somewhere beyond
Vienna	LOCATION	, a picturesque and turbulent people , a rightful dynasty lost for centuries , a secret party -LRB- the most wonderful in the world -RRB- devoted to the lost prince , a silent wanderer , a military servant , a crippled street waif , a noble-minded boy trained by hardship to ser - vice , all this would certainly make a novel by Mr.
E. Phillips Oppenheim	PERSON	, if there were only a few suppers at the
Hotel Milan	ORGANIZATION	.

		Cer - tainly it is not tame ; and yet to one who has read anything about Servia of late , or indeed to anyone else , how wholly different from real life !

		Mrs.
Burnett	PERSON	presumably would not for a moment urge that she has given an unvar - nished view of actuality in the
Balkans	LOCATION	or anywhere else .

		That has rarely been her way .

		But she has things to say : she thinks of characters , qualities , actions , that are real at bottom ; and if she presents them in a rather decorative manner , imaginative , somewhat conventionalized even , why , that is the way with many forms of art .

		Take the part about the Indian hermit .

		One may not be much impressed with the tale of the wanderings in the
Himalayas	LOCATION	; but if the Indian Doctrine is true , there you are !

		`` There are a myriad worlds .

		There is but One Thought out of which they grew .

		Its Law is Order which can not swerve . ''

		If that is so , and one gets the impression strongly in Mrs.
Burnett	PERSON	's ver - sion , so much the better .

		There you are : if there is a real idea at bottom , how much better than any number of other pictures of actual realities which all together give no idea of life , give nothing but a desultory series of impressions !

		Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	's '' The Money Master '' has an idea at bottom , too .

		One might imag - ine that at such a time as this , when a man is strained to the utmost to do as much for En - gland as man can do , one might imagine that a novel would be merely a sort of relief , an unbending in a way one can , when everything else is tense .

		But '' The Money Master '' is not merely a picture of old French life in
Canada	LOCATION	, though it is that too ; it has more to it .

		It will be admitted that the `` more '' is not at first obvious ; the general setting is of the '' charming '' order .

		The peace and plenty of the Manor Chartier , the whimsical extrava - gance and practical business of
Jean Jacques	PERSON	, the secret passion of his Spanish wife , all that seems as if we were to have little more than a romantic story which would hold our attention as we read , and then vanish , leav - ing a few pictures , one or two figures , which will be interesting or attractive but in their turn will vanish too .

		But as one goes on , the book takes more and more of a hold .

		Pic - tures of life or not , here is evidently some - thing worth having in mind and heart .

		The determination of the funny little philosopher - farmer or philosopher-financier is fine .

		He will be a philosopher , he will take the right view of life .

		At first , doubtless , he was wrong in thinking that one could get it from books , that one could pack it all in one 's head .

		But in spite of misfortune , he is still a philoso - pher , '' always , always , but in his heart , and not with his tongue . '' ''

		His philosophy was the bent of a mind with a capacity to feel things rather than to think them . ''

		He un - derstands what the old Judge had meant when he said : '' It is not vows that keep the world right , but the prayer of a man 's soul from day to day . ''

		So we read Sir
Gilbert	PERSON	's book , and so it seems a book worth reading .

		It has little to do with the war on the surface ; and yet who can fail to see that
England	LOCATION	now , and the whole world at any time , needs men and women who feel to the bone that life is more than opinions and resolves and arguments , that it is an affair of the soul ?

		And to press that point in one 's book as well as one 's life seems something worth doing ; realistic , ro - mantic , these are but pedantic words if the thing be actually done .

		Miss Gather 's `` The Song of the Lark '' is something different .

		On the face of it , it appears to be one of the biographies child - hood , education , love-affair or affairs , what - not else of which there are not a few nowadays .

		This time it is the story of a singer , as Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	's latest book is the story of a novelist , Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's of a `` genius '' at painting , Mr.
Maugham	PERSON	's of one who was not a genius .

		But the form is not much , in fact , here it is not even a form -LRB- not even , like Logic , is it a dodge -RRB- ; it is hardly more than an excuse .

		Why tell us so much and no more ?

		Why not tell everything ?

		Why ever stop ?

		Miss Gather or any other novelist would tell us that there must be just so much , no more , no less .

		The theory has been that such a book is to be the account of life -LRB- or a life -RRB- just as it is .

		That gives rea - son for anything .

		But here is a book where theories of form go for little . ''

		It was a wondrous storm that drove me on '' says the title-page , doubtless with truth .

		Miss Gather wants to give the soul of the artist , the sense of art , that something so impossible and so inevitable , which never explains itself , never
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 497 philosophizes , is perhaps never even conscious of what it is .

		Here we have a fine realization of the artist nature , a picture which stands for itself in its own way .

		Method and form are of little importance in so successful an achievement .

		So one need not say much about the realis - tic touch .

		To tell the truth , though there is much record of picture and event , there is much also that is not in that manner at all .

		Miss Gather explains a good deal .

		Often she shows us life and lets us get the impression ; but often for some reason she does not do that , but merely tells us what the impression should be .

		She not only analyses , as they used to say , but she explains , as , for in - stance , that Thea found faithful friends in these good women , and that no musician ever had a better wife than Mrs.
Harsanyi	PERSON	.

		There is much that is seen '' , but there is much that is not seen at all , and that with no apparent reason .

		Sometimes it is one way , sometimes another .

		One can not understand the method .

		Why sometimes tell the fact and sometimes explain ?

		Why sometimes skip and sometimes not ?

		In spite of all this , one must take the book on trust , as far as I can see .

		One might per - haps understand these matters with more study , or with more appreciation .

		But un - derstanding is likely to be the perfunctory task of the critic .

		The first thing to do is to get the experience ; and then understanding and criticism , and so on , may be left to them - selves .

		And for anyone who will have it , here is certainly an experience such as one has all too rarely , even though there be several hundred novels this year , and among them a number that are excellent .

		Is it -LRB- as hinted -RRB- the experience of an upland garden in the windy dawn when the world seems young ?

		I have never been in such a place , nor have I ever heard the song of the lark , at least not of the `` unbodied joy whose race is just begun . ''

		It is not so much the feeling of life that I get here , as the sense of some - thing much less common than life : namely , art as it exists in life , a very curious and elusive thing , but so beautiful , when one gets it , that one forgets all else .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	, The forthcoming '' Dictionary of Universal Biography '' compiled by Mr.
Albert M. Hyamson	PERSON	will , according to the statement of its publishers , Messrs. Button , '' not only include far more names than does any other in existence , but may claim without hesitation to deal with more individuals than the aggregate of any score of other works . ''

		HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS .

		I. ART AND ARCHITECTURE .

		Other poets before
Longfellow	PERSON	have felt the poetry of bridges , and other painters before Mr.
Frank Brangwyn	PERSON	have discerned their artistic pos - sibilities , though it has remained for the eminent Royal Academician to devote a whole volume of generous proportions to their picturesque qualities as caught by the brush and in the soberer medium of pen-and-ink .

		`` A Book of Bridges '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- contains thirty-five reproductions of paintings and thirty-six black-and-white sketches , all by Mr.
Brangwyn	PERSON	and all representing historic or other - wise notable bridges in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Shaw Spar	PERSON	- row , known for his appreciative book on Mr.
Brangwyn	PERSON	's art , supplies a descriptive and his - torical commentary to the pictures , a literary fea - ture that will appeal to many readers .

		Inevitably one looks for certain favorite bridges of one 's own in this rich collection , and fails to find them .

		Even the
Bridge of Sighs	ORGANIZATION	at
Venice	LOCATION	has failed to be favored with the artist 's attentions ; and the bridge spanning the Golden Horn and recently the object of a hostile assault that might have proved memorable does not appear .

		But the beautiful book has enough and more than enough to merit hearty commendation .

		Methods of illustration have a certain interest for everyone who reads or handles illustrated books or magazines ; therefore such a work as Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	's `` Lithography and Lithographers '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- must appeal to many besides artists and craftsmen .

		In its historical portion the book is based upon the similar work by Mr. and Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	published in
1898	DATE	and now long out of print , but this part has been entirely rewritten and corrected by Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	, while the technical parts are the work of Mr.
Pen	PERSON	- nell .

		Generous in its design and scope , this hand - some volume , quarto in size , is enriched with almost four-score notable examples of lithographic art , and that art itself is made the subject of eighteen carefully written chapters , tracing its development from its invention in
1798	DATE	by
Alois Senefelder	PERSON	to the present time .

		Concerning the '' Graphic Art Series , '' to which the book belongs , and which Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	edits , he says in a brief foreword : '' There are endless series of art books and endless schools of art , endless lectures on art and art criticism .

		But so far as I know there are no series of books on the graphic arts , written or edited by graphic artists .

		This series is in - tended to be a survey of the best work in the past the work that is admitted to be worth study - ing and a definite statement as to the best methods of making drawings , prints , and engrav - ings , written in every case by thos $ who have passed their lives in making them . ''

		Intelligibility , even to a layman , is a notable characteristic of the technical portions of the book .

		How many persons can accurately describe the various types of colonial architecture still repre - sented in old houses and other buildings along our 498 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 25	DATE	eastern seaboard ?

		Those who can not arid they ; are sufficiently numerous will find means to repair their ignorance in '' The Architecture of Colonial America '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Harold Donaldson Eberlein	PERSON	, with lavish illus - trations from photographs .

		First is considered the Dutch colonial type , then the
New England	LOCATION	colo - nial , the pre-Georgian of the middle colonies , the colonial architecture of the South , and so on through fourteen informing chapters .

		Like many other writers in this field , Mr.
Eberlein	PERSON	deplores the havoc wrought by modern '' improvers '' of antique architecture , also '' the relentless tide of mercantile progress , '' especially in
New York City	LOCATION	.

		Chapters on early American architects and their resources , and on the `` materials and textures '' that played so important a part in our early architecture , are added to the more customary topics of the book .

		It is a more scholarly , more systematic treatment of its theme than one often encounters .

		Melancholy associations necessarily link them - selves with Mr.
Ralphl Adams Cram	PERSON	's `` Heart of
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , a sympathetic review of the former architectural glories of that war-scarred zone of northern
Europe	LOCATION	where no one yet knows with accuracy what small portions of the artist 's and craftsman 's handiwork have been spared by Mars , and still less what will in the end be found to have been spared .

		The frontispiece of the book , showing the incomparable facade of the
Rheims	LOCATION	cathedral , and later views of the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of
Louvain	LOCATION	, the Cloth
Hall	PERSON	of
Ypres	LOCATION	, the
Hotel de Ville	ORGANIZATION	of
Arras	LOCATION	, and other masterpieces of the builder 's hand , present in their beauty of form and richness of detail the strongest possible con - trast to their present ruinous aspect .

		But the author 's reflections are not all sombre , by any means ; and , even while admitting the irremedia - ble consequences of the war , he prophesies a nobler , a more sincere , a more consecrated art for the future , with a new realization of the very nature and function of art .

		His book covers a far wider range than that within which the ordi - nary writer on the war or any of its aspects con - fines himself .

		The pictures , from photographs , are many and good .

		The splendid country places of
California	LOCATION	mil - lionaires a round dozen of them are pre - sented to the eye of imagination and to the eye of sense in Mr.
Porter Garnett	PERSON	's '' Stately Homes of
California	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the book itself being a stately quarto of luxurious appoint - ments , including twenty-five colored and uncolored plates , the product of the camera combined with various processes known to mechanical art .

		Exte - rior and occasional interior views are given of palatial mansions owned by Mr.
James L. Flood	PERSON	, Mr.
H. E. Huntington	PERSON	, Mrs.
Phoebe A. Hearst	PERSON	, Mr.
James D. Phelan	PERSON	, and others on whom for - tune has visibly smiled .

		Both the author and his sponsor -LRB- Mr.
Bruce Porter	PERSON	, who contributes an Introduction -RRB- reveal their passion for gardens , and there is much good garden-description in the book , with a grace of style rather unusual in lit - erature of this sort .

		The spacious plan of the volume , with its wide margins and its clear and uncrowded print , is entirely in harmony with its theme .

		Who that has ever attended or even heard about the old-fashioned quilting-bee , who that has ever slept under or seen an old-fashioned quilt , will refuse to cast a kindly eye on Miss
Marie D. Webster	PERSON	's '' Quilts : Their Story and How to Make Them '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- ?

		Back to ancient
Egypt	LOCATION	and its relics of patchwork in colored goat - skins she goes for the beginnings of quilt-making and for the first illustration -LRB- after the frontis - piece -RRB- in her elaborately illustrated book .

		Mu - seums and ancestral chests have evidently been ransacked for material with which to enrich her chapters , and it appears that she has gained unusual familiarity with her subject from dealing , in a business way , with the quilt-pattern-buying public .

		Similar in design to Mrs.
Eliza Calvert Hall	PERSON	's admirable work , `` A Book of Hand-woven Coverlets , '' this treatise will please many of the author 's sex , if not also a few mere men .

		The many handsome designs shown in color or in black - and-white are notably superior , in aesthetic qual - ity , to the stiffly geometrical patterns so common in the bed-coverings of our grandparents .

		Some conception of the possibilities of Miss
Webster	PERSON	's theme may be gained from the mere fact that her appended list of quilt names has nearly five hundred entries .

		Introducing '' The Art Treasures of Great Brit - ain '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr.
C. H. Collins Baker	PERSON	, editor of the handsome quarto , refers somewhat vaguely to a series , of which this work seems to form a part , though no number is assigned to it , and no series name appears on the title-page or else - where .

		Also , in saying that `` had circumstances permitted the extension if not completion of this publication other living masters would have been represented , '' Mr.
Baker	PERSON	implies in the same indefinite manner that his work is but a fragment and that no continuation is contemplated .

		Both public and private collections are represented in the fifty-six plates , mostly in '' rotogravure , '' con - stituting the bulk of the volume , and the excel - lence of these reproductions is beyond dispute ; but the arrangement seems to be without system , periods and schools and subjects mingling in care - less comradeship .

		A page of explanatory text accompanies each plate .

		The volume has much in it to delight an art-lover and to make him regret the non-completion of the series and the following out of a plan more intelligible than any that is discernible in the present work .

		Many persons of refined taste and peculiar force of character confess a fondness for f restoring and refurbishing the old , in preference to con - structing the new .

		The late
Jacob A. Riis	PERSON	had this passion , and frankly acknowledged it .

		How far it has been carried in the fashioning of more or less luxurious country residences may partly be gathered from turning the leaves of Miss
Mary H. Northend	PERSON	's richly illustrated volume , '' Remod - eled Farmhouses '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , wherein more than a score of these modernized relics of a ruder age are elaborately presented to our inspec -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 499 tion .

		As in her earlier books devoted to domestic architecture , it is
New England	LOCATION	with its wealth of interesting old houses that here claims the writer 's attention .

		Some of her restored farmhouses are wonders of up-to-date comfort and even luxury ; others retain more of their original simplicity ; but all are attractive .

		It is a valuable book for the home-maker of means and taste .

		As
Rome	LOCATION	has been called the most religious city in the world because of her many churches , so she might also be called the cleanest by reason of her numerous fountains .

		With this remark Mrs.
Charles MacVeagh	PERSON	opens her notable volume on '' Fountains of Papal Rome '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , in which are told the stories of a score or more of these acceptable and beautiful gifts to the people . ''

		Pagan emperors and Christian popes alike , '' she says , '' have found both profit and pleasure in add - ing another fountain or in making or repairing one more aqueduct to give a still greater supply of water to the Roman populace .

		No other peo - ple , with the possible exception of the Spanish Moors , have so appreciated the value and the beauty of abundant water . ''

		A pleasing departure from the usual order is found in the wood engrav - ings , by Mr.
Rudolph Ruzicka	PERSON	, of most of the fountains described in the book .

		Appended in - scriptions , chronological tables , and alphabetical index of architects , sculptors , painters , and engrav - ers mentioned by Mrs.
MacVeagh	PERSON	, add to the use - fulness of her carefully prepared work .

		Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	went to
Greece	LOCATION	in the
spring of 1913	DATE	for two reasons : first , to see the country and what remained of its ancient glory , to see whether '' the greatest work of the past '' would impress him '' as much as the greatest work of the present and to find out which was the greater '' ; and second , he says , '' I went because I was told by a
Boston	LOCATION	authority that I was noth - ing but a ragtime sketcher , could n't see Greek art and could n't draw it if I did . ''

		Whether the accusation was true or false the public is invited to judge after inspecting the handsome volume that resulted from that visit . ''


Joseph Pennell	PERSON	's Pictures in the Land of Temples '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- presents forty views of famous ruins , chiefly in
Greece	LOCATION	, with some Greek ruins in
Sicily	LOCATION	and south - ern
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Preliminary remarks and interspersed brief notes from the artist 's pen contribute to the interest of the book .

		It is made quite plain by Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	that one need not be a Greek scholar in order to appreciate Greek architecture and reproduce something of its charm with the pencil .

		In this country alone there are said to be thirty thousand paintings bearing the signature of
Corot	LOCATION	, real or forged ; and as he is believed to have pro- duced not more than eight thousand pictures -LRB- enough for one man , surely -RRB- in his half-century of activity , most of these thirty thousand alleged Corots must be imitations .

		But in any event there ought to be wide-spread interest in this country in
Corot	LOCATION	and his fellow-artists of the
Barbizon School	ORGANIZATION	.

		To this interest ministers Mr.
Arthur Hoeber	PERSON	, Associate of the
National Academy of Design	ORGANIZATION	, in his well-planned and well-executed work , `` The Barbizon Painters '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , which contains readable chapters on Millet ,
Corot	LOCATION	,
Diaz	PERSON	,
Dupre	PERSON	,
Troyon	ORGANIZATION	,
Rousseau	PERSON	,
Daubigny	PERSON	, and
Charles Jacque	PERSON	, with many examples of each artist 's style reproduced in sepia .

		Excepting Mr.
David C. Thomson	PERSON	's book on '' The Barbizon School of Painters , '' published twenty-five years ago and now out of print , there seems to be nothing in the field to rival Mr.
Hoeber	PERSON	's present volume , which is a delight to the eye as well as a satisfaction to the inquiring reader .

		A thirty-six years ' residence in
Mexico	LOCATION	has enabled Mrs.
John Wesley Butler	PERSON	to familiarize herself with the more famous of the historic cathe - drals and other church buildings in that land so rich in houses of worship and so poor in the condi - tion of most of the worshippers . ''

		Historic Churches in
Mexico	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Abingdon Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which is the fruit of some of these visits to various parts of the country , devotes four of its twelve chapters to churches of
Mexico City	LOCATION	, and the remaining eight to those of other cities .

		The faithful camera furnishes nearly fifty good illustrations to help out the descriptive matter .

		Noticeable in many of these pictures is the almost barbaric wealth of ornament characteristic of Mexican church archi - tecture .

		Present turbulent conditions beyond our southern border make such a book as Mrs.
Butler	PERSON	's more welcome than a free excursion ticket to the land of the Aztecs .

		Five books that gain their peculiar interest from the greater of the two
Panama	LOCATION	expositions come from the publishing house of
Messrs. Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		The pleasing pattern of their artistic design stamps them at once as products of that establishment .

		Brown-tinted paper , delicate illustrations in tint , beautiful though simple bindings protected by wrappers of corresponding hue , and , best of all , the clearest of well-proportioned type these are among the commendable features that attract the eye at the very outset . ''

		The Lure of
San Francisco	LOCATION	'' is a small volume by two sisters , Mrs.
Elizabeth Gray Potter	PERSON	and
Miss Mabel Thayer Gray	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its object is to '' aid in the general awaking of the dormant love of every Californian for his possessions and be a suggestion to the casual visitor that we are entitled to the dignity of age . ''

		From beginning to end it preserves the form of a dialogue between the narrator and a visiting Bostonian , who finds himself justly rebuked for saying ''
Frisco	LOCATION	'' by hearing his own beloved city called ''
Bost	PERSON	, '' and is in many other ways brought to a recognition of the dignity and historic importance of the scenes before him .

		The four chapters deal successively with '' The Mission and its Romance , '' '' The Prae - sidio , Past and Present , '' '' The Plaza and its Echoes , '' and '' Telegraph Hill of Unique Fame . ''

		Eight appropriate drawings are interspersed .

		In two somewhat larger volumes , well supplied with full-page plates from photographs , - the
Panama	LOCATION	-
Pacific Exposition	ORGANIZATION	's appeal to the eye of the art - lover is exemplified and commented upon . ''

		The Art of the Exposition '' presents '' personal im - pressions of the architecture , sculpture , mural decorations , color scheme , and other aesthetic aspects '' of the great exhibition ; while '' The 500 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 25	DATE	Galleries of the Exposition '' gives '' a critical review of the paintings , statuary , and the graphic arts in the Palace of Fine Axis '' at the same international show .

		Both books owe their being to Professor
Eugen Neuhaus	PERSON	, teacher of decora - tive design in the
University of California	ORGANIZATION	, mem - ber of the exposition 's jury of awards in the department of fine arts , and chairman of the
Western Advisory Committee	ORGANIZATION	.

		He speaks from fulness of knowledge , and has made a judicious selection of objects to be illustrated in his hand - some volumes .

		General and particular views of
Panama Exposition	ORGANIZATION	architecture and landscape gardening are presented in a volume prefaced by Mr.
Louis Christian Mullgardt	PERSON	, architect of the Court of Ages and member of the
Architectural Commission	ORGANIZATION	of the exposition , and briefly anno - tated by competent hands .

		The illustrations , nearly one hundred beautiful examples of photo - graphic art , occupy the right-hand pages , the descriptive notes the left-hand .

		The title is '' The Architecture and Landscape Gardening of the Exposition . ''

		An aesthetically satisfying little paper book , with stiff cover and wrapper , and calling itself '' Palace of Fine Arts and Lagoon , '' gives a short description , by Mr.
Bernard R. May	PERSON	- beck , of these two features of the exposition , with a three-page introduction by Mr.
Frank Morton Todd	PERSON	, and two illustrations .

		It is a pleasing souvenir of an unpretentious sort .

		TRAVEL AND DESCRIPTION .

		Mr.
H. G. Dwight	PERSON	has '' as little patience as possible with the Gladstonian theory of the un - speakable Turk , '' and is therefore in a frame of mind -LRB- and heart -RRB- to write with sympathetic understanding of the native inhabitants of Con - stantinople , where he has lived long enough to acquire an intimate knowledge of that strange and little-known city .

		``
Constantinople	LOCATION	, Old and New '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is , as its title indicates , both historical and descriptive , exhibiting the real , Turkish Stam - boul as few writers of western
Europe	LOCATION	are quali - fied to exhibit it , and bringing the narrative down to the eventful and , to the Turk , humiliating days of the late Balkan wars .

		A laudable desire to produce a book comparable with Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's '' Venetian Life '' has animated the author , though he modestly admits the difficulty of its attainment .

		As a matter of fact , his work is much more com - prehensive , much more imposing in its material aspects , with its broad pages and innumerable illustrations -LRB- from photographs -RRB- , and its equip - ment of bibliography and index and chronological table of rulers .

		It is a book of peculiar timeliness and also of enduring merits .

		Mr.
Francis E. Leupp	PERSON	has had every oppor - tunity to learn well the
Washington	LOCATION	that has been for many years his home and the scene of his offi - cial and journalistic activities .

		Hence he writes with ease and a chatty f amiliarity in his '' Walks about
Washington	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a book of historic and perhaps also fabulous anecdote , such as the well-known features of one 's own city would call forth from any communicative pedes - trian of the requisite powers of memory and nar - ration .

		It is not , however , personal experience and first-hand narrative that fills the bulk of the book .

		The historians and memoir-writers have been called to his aid , and he avails himself of their assistance with skill and grace .

		His readable chapters are generously and tastefully illustrated with line drawings by Mr.
Lester G. Hornby	PERSON	.

		Not the least of the book 's attractions is its inclusion of a goodly number of not too stale Lincoln anec - dotes and allusions .

		To visit with Mr.
Norman Douglas	PERSON	the birth - place of
Horace	PERSON	-LRB-
Venosa	LOCATION	, the ancient Venusia -RRB- , to stroll with him amid Italian scenes made especially notable by memories of
George Gissing	PERSON	, and to enjoy throughout these and other rambles in the toe of
Italy	LOCATION	the conductor 's rich fund of humorous or learned allusion and reminiscence this is the pleasure offered to readers of '' Old
Calabria	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The simplicity of the native Cala - brians , their childlike faith in matters of religion , is illustrated by anecdotes .

		One woman of the country took pains to explain to the benighted visitor that the saints in heaven take their food exactly as do mortals on earth , and at the same hours . ''

		The same food 1 '' was the incredulous rejoinder .

		`` Does the Madonna really eat beans ' ? ''

		`` Beans ' ?

		Not likely !

		But fried fish , and beef - steaks of veal . ''

		Unable to declare himself con - vinced , Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	suffered the humiliation of being considered a pagan .

		A notable chapter entitled ''
Milton	PERSON	in
Calabria	LOCATION	'' deserves more ex - tended mention than is here possible .

		The book is full of readable and often unusual matter .

		Illus - trations from photographs abound .

		Mrs.
Hugh Fraser	PERSON	, like her late brother ,
F. Marion Crawford	PERSON	, loves her adopted
Italy	LOCATION	and is steeped in its lore .

		`` Storied Italy '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , from her pen , is a collection of personal memories and historical retrospects relating chiefly to
Rome	LOCATION	and more or less noted Romans .

		These reminis - cences and studies are to her , she says , a refuge from the trouble and pain of the modern world .

		Accordingly she devotes four chapters of some length to the holy life and charitable labors of
St. Frances	LOCATION	of
Rome	LOCATION	, whom she styles a '' Romana di Roma , '' and the details of whose history are apparently drawn from the biography written with much fulness by her father confessor immediately after her death .

		Other parts of Mrs.
Fraser	PERSON	's book have more of her own vivid experiences , so that the volume is saved from the danger of too much mediaeval or other ancient lore .

		It is well illustrated , with colored frontispiece and half-tone plates on the whole a fitting supplement to the same writer 's '' Italian Yesterdays . ''

		Mr.
Stephen Gwynn	PERSON	, who has already testified in print to his love of his native
Ireland	LOCATION	, gives further vent to his enthusiasm for Old
Erin	PERSON	in a series of chapters , historic and descriptive , on `` The Famous Cities of
Ireland	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Eleven familiar names , rich in manifold associa - tions , head these chapters , videlicet : Waterford ,
Dundalk	LOCATION	,
Galway	LOCATION	,
Maynooth	LOCATION	,
Kilkenny	LOCATION	,
Derry	LOCATION	,
Limerick	LOCATION	,
Dublin	LOCATION	,
Wexford	LOCATION	,
Cork	ORGANIZATION	, and
Belfast	LOCATION	.

		It was
Galway	LOCATION	that sent Mr.
Gwynn	PERSON	to
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	in
1906	DATE	, and it is therefore fitting enough that to
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 501
Galway	LOCATION	should be accorded more space than to any of her sister cities except
Dublin	LOCATION	and Water - ford .

		Characteristic of this loyal Irishman is it that he should write of ''
Derry	LOCATION	, '' not of ''
London	LOCATION	- derry . ''

		A frivolous seeker for amusement might have wished that he had enlivened his
Kilkenny	PERSON	chapter with some allusion to the famous cats of that town .

		Mr.
Hugh Thomson	PERSON	vividly and humorously illustrates the book , partly in color , and even more enjoyably in his free and spirited pen-and-ink drawings .

		Vacation in
Europe	LOCATION	is becoming next to impossi - ble for travelling Americans , and so their attention is turned , more than ever before , to the vaca - tional possibilities at home . ''

		In Vacation Amer - ica '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Harrison Rhodes	PERSON	, with pleasing illustrations in color by Mr.
Howard Giles	PERSON	, is designed to furnish hints and useful information to the sort of vacationers that would in happier times seek to lighten the burden of existence by going to
Europe	LOCATION	, unmindful of the Horatian maxim that keeps the wise from chasing happiness in foreign lands .

		Not at all in guide - book style , but in familiar , chatty , anecdotal vein , the author touches on some of the delights await - ing the visitor to our coast and inland resorts , our
summer	DATE	and winter scenes of holiday-making .

		It is a small book , and good reading even for the stay-at-home .

		Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	's adventurous voyage in the Snark from
San Francisco	LOCATION	to
Hawaii	LOCATION	, and thence to the islands of the
South Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	, has already been related in his characteristic manner in '' The Cruise of the Snark . ''

		Now Mrs.
Jack London	PERSON	-LRB-
Charmian Kittredge London	PERSON	is the way she signs her name -RRB- tells the same story in her feminine and more voluble fashion under the sim - ilar title of `` The Log of the Snark '' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- , her narrative taking the form of a diary covering the eighteen months from
April , 1907	DATE	, to
October , 1908	DATE	.

		That the thrill of danger was not wanting to complete the charm of this eventful cruise is proved by concluding references to cer - tain cannibal incidents in islands visited by the Snark .

		`` And , believe it or not , '' are the writer 's closing words , '' ye of little faith in the joy that was ours on the voyage , our one ultimate hope of earthly bliss is to fit out another and larger boat , and do it all over again , and more and do it more leisurely , more wisely under the tropic sun . ''

		Thus does Mrs.
London	LOCATION	show herself a fit mate for her roving author-husband .

		The book is fully illustrated from photographs .


Australia	LOCATION	,
New Guinea	LOCATION	,
Thursday Island	LOCATION	, and sundry other regions , form the successive scenes of the incidents and conversations related by Mr.
Norman Duncan	PERSON	in his `` Australian Byways : The Narrative of a Sentimental Traveler '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Not the popular resorts , not the great cities or the things set down in the guide-books , have attracted this wanderer , but rather the remote and out-of - the-way places accessible only by the slower , more primitive modes of conveyance .

		Yet there is no lack of human intercourse in the narrated expe - riences ; in fact , the pages are enlivened with conversation from beginning to end .

		Among other wonders , the exploits of the native Australian trackers are described , and we have a glimpse of the Papuan tree-dwellers , while here and there we make the acquaintance of some exceptionally remarkable '' aborigine , '' as the author has the courage to call him .

		The '' sentimental '' element promised on the title-page is nowhere conspicuous , one is not sorry to note .

		It is a brisk and varied narrative , well illustrated with both colored and plain pictures by Mr.
George Harding	PERSON	.

		As the best teacher of a foreign language is often the outsider who appreciates from hard experience the peculiar difficulties of that lan - guage , so the most illuminating commentator on a foreign country and its institutions is likely to be the observer from without who has won his way with some effort to a true comprehension of his theme .

		Professor
Arthur Reade	PERSON	, Lecturer in English at the
University of Helsingfors	ORGANIZATION	, brings to the writing of his book , ''
Finland	LOCATION	and the Finns '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- the vivid impressions of a visitor and also the more accurate knowledge of a dweller in the land he undertakes to describe .

		His chapters , far from being descriptive of externalities , deal with such important topics as the national movement , the racial struggle , education , painting and music , literary landmarks , the rights of women , political parties , the first and second periods of Russianiza - tion , and
Finland	LOCATION	's position in the Russian Empire .

		The expected pictorial accompaniment , in color and in monotone , is not lacking .

		It is a timely book and , better still , a trustworthy one or so it impresses us .

		Long ago
Stevenson	PERSON	made it plain to a host of delighted readers that there are unexhausted and inexhaustible possibilities of pleasure in a small boat and a few accommodating rivers and canals .

		`` An Inland Voyage '' may have suggested to Mr. and Mrs.
Lewis	PERSON	Chase their recent adventure in `` A Vagabond Voyage through Brittany '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- , an aquatic saunter from
St. Malo to Rennes	ORGANIZATION	and thence to
Brest	LOCATION	, chiefly by canal , with two short stretches of river to complete the tour .

		Mrs.
Chase	PERSON	is the chronicler of the voyage , and she adorns her tale with sixty-four views from photo - graphs , all interesting and som.e unusually pleas - ing .

		One needs only to have read Blanche
Willis Howard	PERSON	's '' Guenn '' to become convinced of the quaint attraction of
Brittany	LOCATION	; and this attraction loses none of its force in Mrs.
Chase	PERSON	's handling of her theme .

		It is a book to make one wish to dupli - cate the author 's experiences when peace shall have settled once more over the fair face of
France	LOCATION	.

		A good map accompanying the narra - tive points the way for any such emulous reader .

		RECORDS OP THE PAST .

		How the
Concord	LOCATION	celebrities looked to their fellow-townsmen is entertainingly indicated in the '' retrospective '' portion of Mr.
Allen	PERSON	French 's `` Old Concord '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , an intelli - gently sympathetic treatment of a perennially interesting theme by a resident and lover of the historic town .

		To
Hawthorne	PERSON	's neighbors , we read , the modestly reserved author was a queer man who '' was becoming celebrated , so people heard , 502 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 25	DATE	from his book about a scarlet letter ; but he was so unsocial that he took to the woods when people came to visit him .

		Did n't he use to stand in his garden at the Manse and dream , in full sight of the road , instead of working ?

		The man lived in a dream ! ''

		When
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's little son showed him some pictures of the public square of his own town , the dreamer actually asked what place it was , though he had passed through it hundreds of times .

		The remaining chapters of the book are headed `` Military Affairs , '' `` Chiefly Literary , '' and '' The Burying Grounds . ''

		Thirty excellent drawings are supplied by Mr.
Lester G. Hornby	PERSON	.

		Useful as a guide , but without the guide-book 's lack of literary charm , '' Old Concord '' is a good book to own and , above all , to read .

		Zealous in promoting the good name and fame of his beloved State , Mr.
Sherman Williams	PERSON	prefaces his ``
New York	LOCATION	's Part in History '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- with some comparisons to prove that
Massachu	PERSON	- setts and Bunker Hill and the
Boston	LOCATION	Massacre do not necessarily stand for bigger things than
New York	LOCATION	and Oriskany -LRB- where , he affirms , Bur - goyne 's fate was really settled -RRB- and the so-called Battle of Golden Hill -LRB- in which American patriots and British soldiers came to blows nearly two months before the historic '' massacre '' in
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Other comparisons to the advantage of New Yor 1 : appear in the preface , and furnish matter for more extended treatment in the body of the book .

		In a word , the memorable achievements of this commonwealth in war and also in peace are ably and eloquently presented in seventeen stirring chapters , with abundant pictorial accompaniment and eight maps .

		Puritanical
Boston	LOCATION	's famous old theatre under another name -LRB- the
Boston Museum	LOCATION	and Gallery of Fine Arts -RRB- was for more than half a century a purveyor of innocent entertainment to good people who would have been shocked at the suggestion of going to a regular playhouse .

		No stock company in
America	LOCATION	has enjoyed for so long a period so enviable a repute .

		But it was too good to last , and comparatively few of the present century have any personal knowledge of the
Boston Museum	ORGANIZATION	and its wholesome delights .

		To those few , and we hope to many others , Miss
Kate Ryan	PERSON	's '' Old
Boston	LOCATION	Museum Days '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will be a treat .

		Miss
Ryan	PERSON	-LRB- we follow the lead of her title-page and give her the name by which she was known on the stage -RRB- joined the Museum company in
1872	DATE	and remained with it until its disbandment in
1893	DATE	, and thus is admirably quali - fied to write about the old playhouse in its well - matured prime .

		It is the personally reminiscent character of her book that makes it so enjoyable .

		Good stories , often amusing , as such anecdotes commonly are , abound ; and all the old favorites of the famous company live once more in her pages .

		They are also presented in photo-engrav - ings .

		Not to be able to find enjoyment in such a book is to be an object of pity .

		A volume of nearly five hundred closely printed pages is added to the '' Great Nations '' series in j evidence of the magnitude , historical if not geo - j graphical , of that rugged corner of
Great Britain	LOCATION	!

		known to the Romans as
Britannia Secunda	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Wales , her Origins , Struggles , and Later His - tory , Institutions , and Manners '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Gilbert Stone	PERSON	, presents the history of this romantic land of the Celts in a manner agreeably at variance with the conventional style of history - writing .

		Not the rulers and the wars they waged are made the prominent features of the narrative , but rather the people and their habits and institutions , with all that goes to make up the civilization -LRB- or to mark the lack of it -RRB- of a nation strongly defined in its distinguishing characteristics .

		Even more fully than
J. R. Green	PERSON	in his '' History of the English People , '' Mr.
Stone	PERSON	enters into the details of daily life , manners and customs and culture , of the folk about whom he writes .

		From the dim '' origins '' to the union with
England	LOCATION	the story of this gallant nation is traced , with many good illustrations to help out the text .

		How
America	LOCATION	impressed our French visitors in the
last quarter of the eighteenth century	DATE	, when
Lafayette	LOCATION	and other less illustrious Frenchmen ob - tained more than a bowing acquaintance with our ancestors of that period , may be agreeably learned from Mr.
Charles H. Sherrill	PERSON	's '' French Memories of Eighteenth-Century America '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		An old mahogany sofa treasured by the
Sherrill	PERSON	fam - ily , a piece of furniture on which the above - named general is said to have sat more than once , started the author on his study of French memoirs relating to early American life and manners ; and hence the present book .

		Nearly ninety names appear in his appended list of '' French authori - ties consulted and records examined , '' and a respec - table array of '' authorities in English '' follows .

		The book treats of such matters as costume , con - versation , cards , etiquette , dancing , courtship and marriage , food and drink , city life and country life , education , newspapers , professions and indus - tries , and , in fact , a remarkably wide range of further subjects .

		Many illustrations from con - temporary sources are inserted .


Wellesley	LOCATION	's memorable fire of last year awak - ened such an interest in the plucky little college -LRB- no longer so little , however -RRB- as had never before been felt .

		The rapid recovery from this disaster gave evidence of
Wellesley	LOCATION	's vigorous vitality the vitality of comparative youth , for the college is but forty years old .

		These forty years , how - ever , contain a wealth of notable history , a chapter of no little significance in the larger story of female education ; and this chapter is now written by a
Wellesley	LOCATION	graduate ,
Miss Florence Converse	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The Story of
Wellesley	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is embellished with graceful drawings by Mr.
Nor	PERSON	- man
Irving Black	ORGANIZATION	, which form a fit accompani - ment to Miss
Converse	ORGANIZATION	's careful narrative .

		But it is somewhat unexpected not to find in a work of this kind a single portrait of past president or beloved professor .

		Things , not persons build - ings , not the occupants of chairs in those buildings are chosen for illustration .

		Fitting enough is it that the present revival of the pageant should bring us books in which the attempt is made to present a pictorial and , as far as possible , a verbal pageant of the subjects
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 503 treated .

		Dr.
J. Edward Parrott	PERSON	's truly gorgeous volume , '' The Pageant of British History '' -LRB-
Sully & Kleinteich	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a rather conspicuous attraction of its sort this season .

		The narrative , covering the chief events in
England	LOCATION	's history from the earliest times to the close of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	's reign , is in the simple and attractive style of
Dickens	PERSON	's sim - ilar work for young readers ; and the numerous pictures are from famous artists , such as
Turner	ORGANIZATION	,
Alma-Tadema	PERSON	,
Orchardson	PERSON	, and
Maclise	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nothing short of splendid is the brilliant appearance of the colored plates ; the black-and-white , if not preferred by any large majority of readers , will at least serve as a grateful relief to the eyes .

		A scant two pages is devoted to '' Edward the Peace - maker , '' and the book closes with only the briefest mention of his successor 's accession .

		BIOGRAPHY AND MEMOIRS .

		`` My labor , like my life , is drawing toward a close .

		It has , from first to last , been devoted to one service , to the
Ministry of Beauty	ORGANIZATION	.

		That is the consummate agency of civilization , and that should be the supreme purpose of all art . ''

		Thus writes Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	, our dean of dramatic critics , our much loved poet and genial man of letters , in his latest volume of reminiscences , '' Vagrant Memories '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Naturally enough , and very acceptably to the reader , these memories are almost wholly of famous players , a baker 's dozen of them , with a chapter on
Augustin Daly	PERSON	, friend and patron of players , thrown in for good measure .

		A fine tribute to
William Warren	PERSON	, with the poem that Mr.
Winter	PERSON	wrote and recited in his honor on the occasion of his completing half a century on the stage , opens the book ; a char - acteristic and in every - way admirable discourse on '' The Theatre and Morality '' closes it ; while between the two stand notable personal recollec - tions and anecdotes of
Laura Keene	PERSON	,
Matilda Heron	LOCATION	,
Lester Wallack	PERSON	, the Booths ,
Irving	LOCATION	, and others , including three living representatives of the stage .

		Though the author admits that praise of the past and despondency over the present have always been indulged in by men of advanced years , he believes this present day of ours pecu - liarly and exceptionally bad in many respects , and especially in things theatrical as if the same lament had not been raised ever since the first theatre was built .

		But he regards the evil as a passing aberration only , and optimistically looks for better things in the future , which the typical croaker never does .

		Therefore his pages are to be heartily commended as almost equally cheering and entertaining ; they register the gold days , not the gray , of the writer .

		The usual rich accom - paniment of illustrations , chiefly portraits , is to be found in this welcome addition to Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's works .

		Unsparingly , withholding no sordid or distress - ing detail , Maxim Gorky -LRB- his real name is
Alexei Maximovitch Peshkof	PERSON	-RRB- tells the story of his early years in `` My Childhood '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and at the outset he defends his pitiless realism by say - ing : '' But truth is ' stronger than pity , and besides , I am writing not about myself but about that narrow , stifling environment of unpleasant impressions in which lived aye , and to this day lives the average Russian of this class . ''

		It is , however , about himself primarily that he writes , and he does so with astonishing frankness and with the vivid force of a born artist in narration .

		Revolting , though fascinating , many of his pages must in truth be styled .

		The following is a de - scription of the writer 's school costume : '' I went thither in mother 's shoes , with a coat made out of a bodice belonging to grandmother , a yellow shirt , and trousers which had been lengthened .

		My attire immediately became an object of ridicule , and for the yellow shirt I received ' The ace of diamonds . ' ''

		His great pity and tenderness for all suffering , and a sense of fellowship with the sufferers , were first awakened by a cruel flogging from his inhuman grandfather .

		The reminiscences end with the death of the writer 's mother and his own going forth into the world .

		The transla - tion , a vigorous performance , is from an unnamed hand , and an unnamed artist supplies illustrations .

		Facing the title-page is a portrait of the author , from a photograph .

		All who like Russian realism of an unflinching intensity will delight in this book . ''

		Court Life from Within '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- is made up of the chapters of bright and informal chat about royal and imperial personages and their surround - ings that have in the
last two years	DATE	entertained many magazine readers and inspired them with a decided liking for the frankly democratic royal writer , the
Infanta Eulalia	LOCATION	of
Spain	LOCATION	.

		That a member of the Bourbon and Hapsburg families , and one reared amid the strict formalities of the Spanish court , should display such an understand - ing and appreciation of democratic ideals and cus - toms , is something not to be passed over without remark even in the hastiest reading of her book .

		Again and again she holds up to good-natured ridicule the inane pomposities of court life , and in the heaven-anointed German Kaiser especially she finds food for her fun-making .

		His belief in his divine right as sovereign , and his very con - spicuous '' religiosity '' evoke her caustic comment , if one may apply so strong an adjective to her gracious and graceful manner of expression .

		The book is ornately bound and well illustrated .

		The Princess
Lazarovich Hrebelianovich	PERSON	known before her marriage to the Serbian states - man above-named as Miss
Eleanor Calhoun	PERSON	is not only the grand-niece of a famous man -LRB-
John C. Calhoun	PERSON	-RRB- but also famous in her own right .

		Both
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	applauded and feted her as an actress when she left her native
California	LOCATION	and devoted her talents to the stage , chiefly in Shakespearean parts and with Sir
Johnston Forbes-Robertson	PERSON	, Mounet-Sully , and
Coquelin	ORGANIZATION	.

		From the rich store of reminiscences that she has put into writing , and of which some foretaste has already been vouchsafed to the reading public , selected chapters now appear in book form under the title , `` Pleasures and Palaces '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , giving her memories of European society as she came to know it as a young American actress with keen perceptions and an eager desire to see as much as possible of the great world .

		Representa - 504 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 25	DATE	tives of royalty and nobility , of authorship and art , of statesmanship and diplomacy , crowd her pages , which seem to contain not a dull para - graph or line .

		A notable chapter describes the writer 's planning and execution of '' the first f or - rest production , '' as she calls it , of `` As You Like It , '' in
Coombe Wood Grove	LOCATION	,
Surrey	LOCATION	.

		Many pho - tographs and drawings , the latter by Mr.
John Wolcott Adams	PERSON	, adorn the book .

		After the death of the Rev.
Laurence Henry Schwab	PERSON	, who was to have been the authorized biographer of the late
Bishop Potter	PERSON	, the task was entrusted to
Dean Hodges	PERSON	, of the
Episcopal Theological School	ORGANIZATION	at
Cambridge	LOCATION	; and with Mr.
Schwab	PERSON	's accumulated material to help him , and his own peculiar fitness for the work , it was a virtual certainty that he would produce a worthy memorial of Dr.
Potter	PERSON	and a notable piece of biographical writing .

		In the case of one whose energies were so unreservedly devoted to the church as were
Henry Codman ^ Potter	ORGANIZATION	's , the biog - rapher 's labors must concern themselves largely with the history of the church as interwoven with the professional activities of the man .

		Thus we have in Dean
Hodges	PERSON	's book not so much a per - sonal portrait as a chapter from the annals of the
Protestant Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	, though it is a chap - ter in which the personality of
Bishop Potter	ORGANIZATION	stands conspicuously forth .

		In his record of biographical details a record not supremely important , it .

		is true the writer might have shown more scrupulous accuracy .

		For instance , on his second page he makes
Alonzo Potter	PERSON	-LRB- father of the subject of his book -RRB- marry
Sarah Maria Nott	PERSON	in
1823	DATE	; and on page ten he places this marriage in
1824	DATE	.

		Portraits accompany the text , and an index is appended .

		The book is entitled ``
Henry Codman Potter	PERSON	, Seventh Bishop of
New York	LOCATION	, '' and it is published by the Mac - millan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The frail objects of royalty 's errant affections have a strong attraction for Mr.
H. Noel Williams	PERSON	, who this season gives us some readable chapters on those court beauties of the Restoration ,
Nell Gwyn	PERSON	,
Louise de Kerouaille	PERSON	, and
Hortense Mancini	PERSON	`` Rival Sultanas , '' as the book 's title designates them .

		The Merry Monarch 's fair favorites played so conspicuous a part in the social and political life of their period as to invest them with a his - toric importance not always possessed by king 's mistresses .

		Hence the ease with which Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- liams spins out his tale to the extent of nearly four hundred pages .

		Ten of Sir
Peter Lely	PERSON	's sleekly graceful productions in portraiture , with fifteen similar works of art by Sir
Godfrey Kneller	PERSON	and others , have been made use of in illustrating the book , which is offered to the American public by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The romance and tragedy of
Camille Desmou	PERSON	- lins 's life and death , and the heroic bearing with which his young wife followed her adored husband to the guillotine , are the subject of Miss Violet Methley 's ''
Camille Desmoulins	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , a sub - stantial octavo divided into four parts bearing the somewhat fanciful headings , '' The North Wind , '' '' The West Wind , '' '' The East Wind , '' and '' The South Wind . ''

		The abundance of French memoirs and other published material relating to the event - ful period of
Desmoulins	PERSON	's public activity makes it no difficult undertaking to produce a readable account of the man , and authentic portraits of him by contemporary artists are not wanting for the suitable illustration of such a book .

		In its appeal to the reader 's sympathies this biography is skil - fully written ; it certainly catches and holds the attention .


David	PERSON	's painting of the young revolu - tionist , with his wife and infant boy , is reproduced in the frontispiece , and four other portraits of the man follow in the body of the book .

		Bibliog - raphy and index are added .

		MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS .

		Symptomatic of the western world 's increasing interest in the Japanese stage , as well as in other manifestations of Japanese culture , is the appear - ance of a collection of condensed epic dramas of that island kingdom , edited and translated by Professor
Asataro Miyamori	PERSON	, revised by Professor
Stanley Hughes	PERSON	, and furnished with a commen - datory foreword by the British Ambassador at Tokio . ''

		Tales from Old Japanese Dramas '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- contains eight masterpieces in English dress , necessarily much shortened for the play in
Japan	LOCATION	is an all-day performance and wisely turned into narrative style , with division into chapters instead of acts and scenes .

		To '' the Shakespeare of
Japan	LOCATION	, ''
Chikamatsu Monzayemon	PERSON	, is accorded the place of honor , at the end of the volume , while seven lesser lights precede him .

		Thirty pages of historical introduction prepare the way for the '' tales , '' and a profusion of stage scenes and characters is presented in illustrations from photographs .

		The male actor in female impersonation is notably present in these pictures , as actresses are not yet much more numerous in
Japan	LOCATION	than they were in ancient
Greece	LOCATION	.

		The English rendering throughout is highly creditable to the translator .

		In compendious form and in a style of narra - tion suited to its subject , the heroic exploits of the Antarctic explorer , Captain
Scott	PERSON	, of glorious memory , are '' retold '' by Mr.
Charles Turley	PERSON	in a well-illustrated volume entitled '' The Voyages of Captain Scott '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		As is indicated on the title-page , free use has been made of '' The Voyage of the ' Discovery ' '' and ''
Scott	PERSON	's Last Expedition , '' indispensable authorities to any later chronicler of the great adventures to which this intrepid explorer and true hero gave the best of his energies and , finally , his very life .

		Sir
James M. Barrie	PERSON	, from his intimate acquaintance with
Scott	PERSON	, contributes an introductory sketch of the man , showing him to have possessed a nobility of character and a heroism in the wear and tear of every-day life unsuspected by many a reader of his more conspicuous and dramatic achievements .

		Pathetic in the extreme are those last pencilled words of
Scott	PERSON	's to the world he was leaving , and the publishers have done well to insert a facsimile reproduction of that page from his diary .

		A good map is added .

		Four reproductions of water-color drawings are among the illustrations .

		1915 THE DIAL 505 From the collection of Serbian legends and bal - lads compiled by the self-taught Serbian peasant ,
Vouk Stephanovitch-Karadgitch	PERSON	, '' the father of modern Serbian literature , '' Mr.
Woislav M. Petrovitch	PERSON	has selected the specimens of folk-lore contained in his stout volume of '' Hero Tales and Legends of the Serbians '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		He is at present an attache to the Serbian Legation in
London	LOCATION	, and shows an excellent command of our language .

		A former Serbian Minister to
England	LOCATION	, Mr.
Chedo Miyatovich	PERSON	, supplies a preface of no perfunctory nature ; and Mr.
William Sewell	PERSON	and Mr.
Gilbert James	PERSON	enliven the book with colored illustrations in apparent harmony with the primi - tive legends that they accompany .

		The inevitable and always interesting merging of early pagan in later Christian myth and tradition is found here as in the folk-lore of other European countries .

		For example : '' Our pagan ancestors used to sacrifice a pig to their Sun-god , and in our day there is not a single house throughout
Serbia	LOCATION	in which ' roast pork ' is not served on Christmas Day as a matter of course . ''

		Three Serbian bal - lads , in Sir
John Bowring	PERSON	's version , to which is accorded high praise , help to give variety to the book , which of course has just now an obvious timeliness in addition to its other merits .

		Mrs.
T. P. O'Connor	PERSON	does not go so far as to say that a long acquaintance with both men and dogs has led her to prefer dogs , but she does open her book of dog stories which she calls '' Dog Stars : Three Luminaries in the Dog World '' -LRB- Doran -RRB- by quoting Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	' s lines on the one man who loves '' the pilgrim soul '' in a woman , and adding that '' there is more than one woman even a beautiful woman who has never found the man to love the pilgrim soul in her ; and , after passionate protestations and broken vows , old , disillusioned , sad , and deserted , she has re - gained faith in love and fidelity through the devo - tion of a dog . ''

		The three canine heroes of her book are most interesting and lovable creatures , and they could not have had a more sympathetic biographer .

		The artist , too , Mr.
Will Rannells	PERSON	, seems fairly to have been inspired in his excellent colored portraits of these intelligent animals .

		Without pretence to greatness as literature , the book is one of the very best of its kind .

		Together with the little , amusing , affectionate bickerings of intimate domesticity , Mrs.
Elisabeth Woodbridge Morris	PERSON	-LRB- whose pen-name omits the last element -RRB- gives us , in `` More Jonathan Papers '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , some further acceptable chapters of outdoor life and outdoor recreation such as made her ''
Jonathan	PERSON	Papers '' so breezy and refreshing to the reader .

		In this second volume are depicted the joys of amateur maple-sugar-making , the pleasures of gardening , the quiet delights of eve - nings on the farm , which did not always prove to be so quiet as expected , the satisfactions of row - ing and fishing , and other kindred matters ; and through it all it is the engaging manner and per - sonality of the chronicler that makes the unpreten - tious history so peculiarly enjoyable .

		Jonathan is made to exhibit himself not always to his best advantage , but as he thereby contributes no little to the general enjoyment he will doubtless forgive the mistress of the exhibition .

		The story of the
Bible	LOCATION	, how it came to be writ - ten and something about its subsequent history and the part it has played in the progress of the world , has an interest that with many readers exceeds that of the scriptures themselves .

		Mr.
Harold B. Hunting	PERSON	tells once more '' The Story of Our Bible '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- and `` how it grew to be what it is , '' in a richly illustrated volume of nearly three hundred pages .

		Rather oddly he begins with the New Testament , because , as he explains , '' it is easier to understand the conditions in which the New Testament arose , for the very reason that they are more like those of modern life . ''

		His attitude toward modern Bible inter - pretation is indicated by his concluding remarks , among which he says : '' On the other hand , many more accepted these new ideas , and suddenly dis - covered that to them the value of the Bible had been extraordinarily increased ... They have seen that it is no less a divine book for being so thor - oughly human . ''

		It is this human interest that especially appeals to the reader in Mr. Hunting 's pages .

		Animal stories , told with a sufficiently tight curb on the imagination , are likely to be both pleasant and profitable reading , provided always the narrator knows his subject and has a good command of language .

		These prerequisites are not wanting in Mr.
John Coulson Tregarthen	PERSON	, who also knows his
Cornwall	LOCATION	and its human types as well as the beasts of the field that play the chief part in his companion volumes , '' The Story of a Hare '' and `` The Life Story of an Otter '' -LRB-
Hearst	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The camera has been adroitly handled to supply pictures of the hare and otter in their native haunts , and one of the volumes contains a '' sketch-map of the scene of the story '' from the author 's own hand a bit of
Cornwall	LOCATION	to increase the verisimilitude of these Cornish animal tales .

		The books are welcome additions to an unfailingly popular branch of literature .

		Short stories , little tales or fables , so compressed sometimes as to be little more than epigrams , are peculiarly popular in
Russia	LOCATION	, where the long novel is no great favorite .

		Of these bits of sprightly fiction
Fedor Sologub	PERSON	is a most successful and prolific writer , and he has so commended himself by his work to Mr.
Stephen Graham	PERSON	that the lat - ter and his wife have collected , chiefly from Rus - sian newspapers , a score and a half -LRB- less one -RRB- of his best pieces and translated them under the title , '' The Sweet-Scented Name , and Other Fairy Tales , Fables , and Stories '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Ranging from half a page to thirty-three pages in length , these selections are very different from our con - ception of the short-story masterpiece as written by a
Poe	PERSON	or a Maupassant or an '' 0 .

		Henry , '' but they are all novel and hence of considerable inter - est. .

		Mr.
Graham	PERSON	's name is a sufficient voucher for the faithfulness of the translation .

		`` My Growing Garden '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has rather unusual individuality .

		The pleasures of amateur horticulture have seldom been so alluringly de - picted as by Mr.
J. Horace ' McFarland	PERSON	in this 506 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 25	DATE	chatty and familiar record of his own experience on a modest urban , or perhaps we should say suburban , estate at
Harrisburg	LOCATION	,
Pa.	LOCATION	.

		It is a natu - ral growth , this book of his , rather than a product of cold calculation . ''

		I have written it , '' he says , `` but my family have lived it with me , and the print-shop which bears my name and enjoys my garden has made of the book much more than a perfunctory item of work .

		The publishers , too , have let down the bars , so that in a very special sense the book has been lived , written , designed , illustrated , printed , and bound as the work of one man and those about him . ''

		Many pictures , four in color and thirty-two in sepia , accompany the reading matter .

		Mr.
FitzRoy Carrington	PERSON	, who has several times acquitted himself with credit in similar tasks of poetic taste and selection , compiles this year a small anthology which he calls '' The Quiet Hour '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , embracing choice bits of verse from English poets of the sixteenth and following cen - turies .

		These selections are grouped under the headings , Cradle Songs , Infancy , Childhood ,
Night	ORGANIZATION	, Sleep , Charms , and Dirges .

		An apt and graceful dedicatory sonnet to his wife proves the compiler to be a poet as well as a lover of poets .

		Eight portraits are scattered through the book , which in every aspect is a tasteful little production .

		This year 's pictorial re-interpretation of `` A Christmas Carol '' comes from the skilful hand of Mr.
Arthur Rackham	PERSON	.

		Twelve colored and eight - een uncolored drawings enliven the immortal tale .

		Master of the whimsical and grotesque , of the humorous , and of that which makes a direct appeal to the human nature in us all , the artist has done his work well ; and printer and binder have seconded his efforts .

		The book is brought out in this country by the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sound doctrine , expressed in homely terms , with a jingle to them , will be found in Mr.
Walt Mason	PERSON	's `` Horse Sense '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , an enter - taining collection of his popular pieces of rhymed prose .

		The whimsical regret that `` there 'll never be such days as those when people wore no under - clothes '' recalls , by its faulty rhyme , the Words - worth couplet introducing the Blind Highland Boy 's nautical adventures on
Loch Leven	PERSON	in '' a household Tub , like one of those which women use to wash their clothes . ''

		But it should be added that the poet , `` in deference to the opinion of a Friend , '' afterward substituted a turtle-shell for the tub .

		To have reminded one of
Wordsworth	PERSON	is no despicable achievement .

		The frontispiece shows '' the author as ' Zim ' sees him . ''

		Mr.
Ralph Henry Barbour	PERSON	's annual contribu - tion to the season 's fiction is this year entitled '' Heart 's Content '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , being , as the name indicates , a love story with a happy ending altogether a cheery little romance for Christ - mas or any other festive day .

		The hero ,
Allan Shortland	PERSON	, asks the heroine ,
Beryl Vernon	PERSON	, whom he has resolved to win , for congratulations on his approaching marriage before securing her con - sent to play a leading part in that ceremony .

		Of bright dialogue and clever invention there is no lack .

		Colored pictures and marginal sketches of a decorative character abound .

		It should be added that the story is not unknown to magazine-readers under the title , '' The Happy Man , '' but that fact is rather in its favor than otherwise .

		Advocates of woman suffrage , just now perhaps a little down-hearted from their recent setback at the polls , will find in Mr.
Orison Swett Marden	PERSON	's `` Woman and Home '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- a source of con - solation and encouragement .

		He is an enthusiastic admirer of the '' new woman '' and a vigorous defender of her rights .

		His chapters discuss woman 's opportunities and responsibilities , her education , her home , woman as voter and as wife , the divorce question , and many other topics of interest to women , and indeed to readers of both sexes . ''

		Woman has never taken a step forward , '' he believes , '' that has not benefited the whole human race .

		Everything she has touched she has improved , elevated , purified . ''

		This latest product of the writer 's pen is likely to be hailed by many readers as one of his best utterances .

		Mrs.
Florence Hobart Perin	PERSON	regrets that '' fam - ily devotions have largely gone out of fashion , '' but derives some consolation from the thought that '' f amilies do still come together at the breakfast table whether they live in country , village , or city , '' and believes that '' a pause of three minutes before starting the work of the day will give the spiritual uplift which will enable us to do better work and fight a braver battle '' provided this pause be put to the right use . ''

		Sunlit Days , '' a collection of passages of verse and of prayer selected by her , furnishes the material for thus wisely filling the three minutes each morning .

		A page is given to every day in the year , and the writers quoted range from the famous to the obscure .

		Good taste is shown by the compiler , whose two previous similar works have , she an - nounces in her preface , begotten a widespread desire for a third .

		-LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- `` The Shadow on the Dial '' -LRB-
Abingdon Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Orton H. Carmichael	PERSON	, is a book of mystical musings if one may attempt a brief characteri - zation of it strung together on the thread of Vera
Meldrum	PERSON	's life and death and personality .

		Devotion and nature-study and philosophy and poetry mingle throughout the successive chapters , while some notably clean-cut and beautiful half - tones from the great book of nature , as spread open at '' Elmwood '' in western
New York	LOCATION	, help in no small measure to emphasize the meaning of the reading matter .

		A new and enlarged edition of Mr.
J. Walker McSpadden	PERSON	's `` Opera Synopses '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- makes its appearance .

		Since its first issue , four years ago , there have been presented in this country a sufficient number of new operas and revivals of old ones to justify this extended reissue , which includes twenty-four operas not found in the ear - lier work , and among them the ten-thousand-dollar prize production brought out at the
Metropolitan Opera House	ORGANIZATION	in
1911-12	DATE	.

		Thus , although of about the same size and general plan as the familiar work by Mr.
George P. Upton	PERSON	in the same field , this later handbook has the advantage of being more nearly up to date .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 507 THE SEASON 'S BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG .

		The following is a list of all children 's books published during the present season and received at the office of THE DIAL up to the time of going to press with this issue .

		It is believed that this classified list will commend itself to intending pur - chasers as a convenient guide to the juvenile books for the
Holiday	ORGANIZATION	season of
1915	DATE	.

		Lodges in the Wilderness , '' by Mr.
W. C. Scully	PERSON	, which is announced for winter publication by Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	, is a record of impressions and reminiscences by one who was for several years a
British Rural Magistrate	ORGANIZATION	in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		A biography of Dostoieffsky , by Eugenii Solo - viev , is being translated into English and will be published shortly .

		In this study the author has aimed to correct some popular misconceptions of Dostoieffsky , and to supply a balanced view of his life and influence .

		Among the new volumes announced for publica - tion by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	before the end of the present month are : '' The Capture of De Wet : The South African Rebellion ,
1914	DATE	, '' by Mr.
Philip J. Sampson	PERSON	; ''
Cuba	LOCATION	Old and New , '' by Mr.
A. G. Robinson	PERSON	; and `` An American Garland : Being a Collection of Ballads Relating to
America	LOCATION	,
1563	DATE	-
1759	DATE	, '' edited , with Introduction and notes , by Professor
C. H. Firth	PERSON	.

		An illustrated monograph entitled '' Rudyard Kipling : A Literary Appreciation , '' by Mr.
R. Thurston Hopkins	PERSON	, who gives an anecdotal history of his hero 's career as well as a critical review of his works , will be published at once by Messrs.
Simpkin	PERSON	,

		A bibliog - raphy of criticisms and reviews is also included , as well as parodies and a list of various portraits , drawings , and caricatures .

		Five new volumes in the '' Oxford Garlands , '' edited by Mr.

Oxford Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity Press .

		Their subjects are '' Elegies and Epitaphs , '' '' Songs for Music , '' '' Poems on Ani - mals , '' '' Modern Lays and Ballads , '' and '' Epi - grams . ''

		The Press will also publish before long an anthology of Buddhist verse entitled '' The Heart of Buddhism , '' translated and edited by Mr.
K. T. Saunders	PERSON	; `` A Book of Sorrow : An Anthology of Poems , '' compiled by Mr.
Andrew Macphail	PERSON	; '' This
England	LOCATION	, '' an anthology of En - glish character and landscape , compiled by Mr.

H. A. Treble	PERSON	; and `` English Critical Essays -LRB- Nineteenth Century -RRB- , '' selected and edited by Mr.
Edmund D. Jones	PERSON	, the last two volumes being additions to the '' World 's Classics . ''

		The '' Covent Garden Journal , '' which
Henry Fielding	PERSON	, late in life , edited for about a year the last of the periodicals to be edited by the novelist has been ransacked for a volume under that title which is to be published by the
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume , which is edited by Dr.
Gerard E. Jensen	PERSON	, with notes and an Intro - duction dealing with Fielding 's varied activities , contains a reprint of all the leading articles seventy-two in number and other contributions clearly from
Fielding	ORGANIZATION	's own pen .

		Supplementing Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	's just - published ''
France	LOCATION	at War , '' which includes his memorable poem , ''
France	LOCATION	, '' there were to have come , it is said on good authority , further sketches from the front , which the author was preparing to visit again with special arrangements for seeing and recording things noteworthy in the war area .

		But this half - promised , half - projected book seems now , unfortunately , not likely to be forthcoming , as word has been received that Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's son is reported '' missing '' and it is feared that he has been killed in action ; Dr.
Walter Leaf	PERSON	's new work , on '' Homer and History , '' which Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	hope to have ready next month , is based in part on an undeliv - ered course of ` lectures on the
Norman Wait Harris	PERSON	foundation prepared by the author on the invita - tion of
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	,
Evanston	LOCATION	,
Illi	PERSON	- nois .

		Everything was arranged for Dr. Leaf 's journey to the
United States	LOCATION	when the outbreak of war and imperative duties of another kind left him no alternative but to cancel the engagements .

		The
Lecture Committee	ORGANIZATION	, however , has given its permission for the publication of the book as one of the series .

		The
National Council of the Independent Labour Party	ORGANIZATION	will be responsible for an official biography of the late Mr.
Keir Hardie	PERSON	.

		Some time since , Mr.
Hardie	PERSON	deposited at the head office of the party a mass of his private correspondence and other papers ; but , in order that the biography should be as complete as possible , an appeal is made for the loan of letters or other documents , which should be sent to the General Secretary of the
I. L. P.	PERSON	,
St. Bride 's House	ORGANIZATION	, Salisbury-square ,
London	LOCATION	,
E.G. Care	ORGANIZATION	will be taken of all papers sent , and they will be returned to the sender if desired .

		Reminiscences or accounts and impres - sions of personal contact with Mr.
Hardie	PERSON	would also be much appreciated .

		Having completed his epic of Dartmoor in some twenty-five volumes , Mr.
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	is con - templating a similar series of romances to be written round such English national industries as seem to lend themselves to the scheme .

		This is an old idea of Mr.
Phillpotts	PERSON	's , begun long ago with his early stories of the Cornish fisheries , but brushed aside by the Dartmoor series .

		It was revived by ''
Brunei	LOCATION	's Tower , '' the author 's recent story of the Devonshire potteries , and is continued by `` Old Delabole , '' a tale of the Cornish slate quarries , which has just appeared .

		This will be followed in due course by '' Song o ' the Hops , '' which has just been completed in manuscript .

		Mr.
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	is also collecting in a volume his series on '' The Human Boy and the War , '' many of which have appeared serially .

		Professor
Frederick Starr	PERSON	, of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, has recently left for a six-months ' expedi - tion to
Japan	LOCATION	and
Korea	LOCATION	, where he plans to finish studies already begun , leaving himself free for proposed labors in
Siam	LOCATION	and
Cambodia	LOCATION	.

		In
Japan	LOCATION	, particular attention will be given to photo - graphic work , the effort being made to finish out his already large series of negatives illustrating the life and culture of the Island Empire ; he will continue his study of Buddhist sects and will visit the more important Shinto shrines , so far as he has not seen them ; he hopes also to complete his investigation of Japanese symbolism , upon which he has been engaged for several years .

		In
Korea	LOCATION	he plans pilgrimages to the more famous old Buddhist monasteries , which abound in interesting and almost unknown works of art ; he hopes also to gather much material for a '' Manual of Korean Ethnography '' and to make the beginnings of an ethnographic collection along lines which he has long had in mind ; he will continue his collections of Korean riddles and proverbs , already of con - siderable extent ; finally , he desires to study fur - ther the administrative work of the Japanese in
Korea	LOCATION	, a work which he has watched with interest ever since
Japan	LOCATION	began to exercise preponderant influence in that land .

		The following note regarding the late Sir
James Murray	PERSON	appears in the latest section of the Oxford Dictionary : '' Sir
James Murray	PERSON	died on the
26th July , 1915	DATE	.

		His great wish that he should live to finish the Dictionary on his eightieth birth - day , in
1917	DATE	, has not been fulfilled ; the unceasing labour of three and thirty years has ended when less than a tenth part of the work remains to be done .

		Almost within a week of his death he was still hard at work , showing , as Dr.
Bradley	PERSON	wrote of a visit made to him , ' not a little of the zest and mental lucidity that I remembered of old . '

		In the preceding months , while barely convalescent from an illness that seemed to bring him to the gates of death , he had prepared , and at the appointed date of
July 1	DATE	published , his usual ' double section . ' '

		The words contained in it / Dr.
Bradley	PERSON	says , ' present an extraordinary number of difficult problems , which are handled with the editor 's char - acteristic sagacity and resource ; the section is a piece of his work of which he might be proud . '

		It has always been the rule that each of the editors should be exclusively responsible for the portions of the
Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	issued under his name .

		The sections in the hands of Dr.
Bradley	PERSON	, Dr.
Craigie	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Onions	PERSON	, and their staffs , will not be affected .

		But Sir
James Murray	PERSON	at the beginning laid the lines and drew the plan ; in the prosecution of the work , when it became clear that it must be shared , his amazing capacity for unremitting labour ena - bled him to take more than an equal part , and the 512 THE DIAL
Nov. 25	DATE	volumes produced by himself show characteristic excellences which can not be exactly matched , though they may be rivalled by merits of another kind .

		He will not write the last pages , but more than that of any other man his name will be asso - ciated with the long and efficient working of the great engine of research by which the Dictionary has been produced . ''

		The leader of his race in
America	LOCATION	, in all that makes for a better , richer , nobler , and more useful life , has passed away and left no one to take his place .

		So it seems , at any rate , in viewing the vacancy left by the death of
Booker T. Washing	ORGANIZATION	- ton , educator of colored youth , uplifter of his fellow-negroes , writer of notable books on his own chosen work and on the peculiar problems that he has wrestled with in his labors of five and thirty years , public speaker of eloquence and force , and loyal citizen of the country from which his people can hardly feel that they have received nothing but benefactions .

		fourteen years of scantily rewarded toil at Tuskegee preceded any general recognition of his rare quality as an educator .

		It was by his address at the opening of the
Cotton States Exposition	ORGANIZATION	at
Atlanta	LOCATION	, in
1895	DATE	, that he first attracted public attention .

		Since then his life has been a part of the history of the South , or at least of the colored race in the South .

		Our especial concern with his achievements must here be limited to his books , of which , in the midst of crowding duties and engagements , he somehow found time to write eleven , '' Sowing and Reaping , '' '' Up from Slavery , '' '' The Future of the American Negro , '' `` Character Building , '' `` The Story of My Life and Work , '' `` Working with Hands , '' '' Tuskegee and its People , '' '' Putting the Most into Life , '' `` Life of
Frederick Douglass	PERSON	, '' `` The Negro in Business , '' and '' The Story of the Negro . ''

		In his autobiographic writings he was , naturally enough , at his best ; but in all that he wrote there is directness and force that belong only to records based on personal experience .

		His published works form a worthy monument to his memory .

		By

University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		This volume differs from all other volumes on
London	LOCATION	in that it gives a consecutive illustrated account of
London	LOCATION	, not from the point of view of the antiquarian , but from that of the inquiring student of English literary history .

		It deals with ten consecutive periods , characterized in turn by the work and spirit of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Dryden	PERSON	,
Addison	PERSON	,
Johnson	PERSON	,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Dickens	PERSON	, and by the qualities of Victorian and contemporary

		The temper of each epoch is discussed , and then in particular those literary works which are intimately related to certain localities in

		A
Short History of Japan	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Ernest Wilson Clement	PERSON	.

		Because of the intense interest in the present political situation in the
Far East	LOCATION	this short history of
Japan	LOCATION	will make a strong appeal to readers and travelers who are asking for a better knowledge of the background of the struggle for supremacy in the
Orient	LOCATION	.

		The author ,
Ernest Wilson Clement	PERSON	, whose long residence in
Japan	LOCATION	as a teacher , interpreter for the
United States	ORGANIZATION	legation , correspondent , and editor has given him a wide familiarity with the country , has written a brief but discriminating account of both Old and
New Japan	LOCATION	; and for the many readers who do not care to go into the details of Japanese history the book will be found a highly interesting epitome of what has happened during the long course of Japanese development .

		As frequent references are made to fuller accounts , the book may well serve as an introduction to further study of the country and its institutions .

Japan	LOCATION	Gazette .

		This small volume is just the book that a traveler or one desiring the facts of

		By
Milo Milton Quaife	PERSON	, Superinten - dent of the
Wisconsin State Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		This book recounts , in a manner at once scholarly and dramatic , the early history of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Important as this subject is , it is not treated solely for its own sake .

		The author 's larger purpose has been to trace the evolution of the frontier from savagery to civilization .

		From the point of view of
Chicago	LOCATION	and the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	alone the work is local in character , although the locality concerned embraces five great states of the
Union	LOCATION	; in the larger sense its interest is as broad as
America	LOCATION	, for every foot of
America	LOCATION	has been at some time on the frontier of civilization .

		It is believed that this book will take rank as the standard history of
Chicago	LOCATION	in the early days .

		The Independent .

		At last we have an adequate history of the beginnings of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		It is certainly a remarkable circumstance that not until the lapse of one hundred and ten years after Captain
John Whistler	PERSON	erected
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	on the west bank of
Lake Michigan	LOCATION	should a trustworthy history appear of that wonderful western city of which he was the founder .

1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 543 II The Literary `` Find '' of the Year What It Is : ``
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	sat himself down before a company of keen , alert young Japa - nese how keen and alert nobody can fully understand who has not himself met such a company in a university lecture room and talked to them right out of his head , just as the fancy moved him .

		He had no text-book before him , and no notes .

		He just talked , in a simple , direct , intimate , colloquial fashion , about the authors and books that thronged the chambers and shelves of his own compendious mind .

		He talked discursively , after the style of a peripatetic philosopher , yet always coherently and logically .

		He talked slowly , too ; partly because he had to think out what he was to say as he went along , and partly because he was speaking in a language somewhat unfamiliar to his hearers , and he wanted them to comprehend his words .

		So de - liberately did he talk , indeed , that some of his hearers were able with nimble hands to write down verbatim what he said , and it is from these reports of his lectures , thus prepared , that these volumes -LRB- `` Interpretations of Literature , '' by
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	-RRB- have been compiled .

		There are in them , consequently , a spontaneity and a sympa - thetic charm which must have been compelling and convincing to his Japanese hearers , and which will prove no less triumphant among his American readers . ''


New York Herald	ORGANIZATION	.

		What Critics Say : ^ - `` The supreme value of the work for present consideration is the efficiency of its interpretations of English literature to English readers , who perhaps are as much in need of such service as were
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's pupils at the
Imperial University of Japan	ORGANIZATION	. ''


New York Herald	ORGANIZATION	. ' '

		For these remarkable documents there is probably no equivalent in any language ... Delivered in a Western tongue to Oriental hearers , one expected a certain simplicity of utterance , and yet no one could have anticipated such an amazing flow of elementary terms , perfect in their expression of the most complex thoughts . ''

		San
Francisco Chronicle	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` A body of the finest kind of criticism , so far as substance is concerned , almost meriting Professor
Erskine	PERSON	's sweeping claim that it is ` unmatched in English unless we return to

Coleridge	PERSON	' . ''

WILLIAM MORRIS	PERSON	AND THE WORLD TO-DAY . ''

		I have not been well , and there have been other troubles of which I wo n't speak , and the sum of all has rather made me break down .

		I hope I am not quite unhumble , or want to be the only person in the world untroubled ; but I have been ever loth to think that there were no people going through life , not without pain indeed , but with simplicity and free from blinding entangle - ments .

		Such an one I want to be , and my faith is that it is possible for most men to be no worse .

		Yet indeed I am older , and the year is evil ; the summerless season , and famine and war , and the folly of peoples come back again , as it were , and the more and more obvious death of art before it rises again , are heavy matters to a small crea - ture like me , who can not choose but think about them , and can mend them scarce a whit . ''

		Thus wrote
William Morris	PERSON	to Mrs.
Burne	PERSON	- Jones in
1882	DATE	.

		Thus could many of us write to-day .

		Whether we regard the European chaos , or our own poor success in dealing with labor of head or hand , or the present state of the arts , they are heavy matters for us , who , it seems , '' can mend them scarce a whit . ''

		Perhaps the dominant national feeling , the undercurrent which indicates the real flow of the river , is that of distress and incompetence .

		To escape it , we gyrate in the eddies , think and do the superficial things , and hope that God at least is looking after His work .

		Those who would criticize us , as indeed we criticize ourselves , may fairly be asked to consider whether , after all , they are not wit - nessing a necessary stage of our evolution .

		We feel that it must be so , and therein is one ray of hope .

		Some one has said that a man who had never reached the conclusion that he was an ass , was indeed one , with little chance of redemption .

		It may be so with nations .

		Out of all this came
Morris	PERSON	, as we also must come , with a programme of salvation .

		It was the present writer 's privilege to know him in the days of his active Socialistic propaganda , and to hear him read , when it was new , his stirring '' Message of the
March	DATE	Wind '' : '' Yet , love , as we wend , the wind bloweth behind us , And beareth the last tale it telleth tonight , How here in the spring-tide the message shall find us ; For the hope that none seeketh is coming to light .

		546 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 9	DATE	`` Like the seed of midwinter , unheeded , unperished , Like the autumn-sown wheat ` neath the snow lying green , Like the love that o'ertook us , unawares and uncherished , Like the babe ` neath thy girdle that groweth unseen ; '' So the hope of the people now buddeth and groweth , Rest fadeth before it , and blindness and fear ; It biddeth us learn all the wisdom it knoweth ; It hath found us and held us , and biddeth us hear . ''

		For it beareth the message : ' Rise up on the inorrow , And go on your ways toward the doubt and the strife ; Join hope to our hope and blend sorrow with sorrow , And seek for men 's love in the short days of life . ' ''

		And again , in his lecture on '' The Aims of Art , '' he says : '' The world 's roughness , falseness , and injus - tice , will bring about their natural consequences , and we and our lives are part of those conse - quences ; but since we inherit also the conse - quences of old resistance to those curses , let us each look to it to have our fair share of that in - heritance also , which , if nothing else come of it , will at least bring to us courage and hope ; that is eager life while we live , which is above all things the Aim of Art . ''

		So
Morris	PERSON	, in a blue suit , looking like some sea-captain , stood at street corners on
Sunday	DATE
mornings	TIME	, and tried to give his message to the public .

		Two or three of us , his comrades of the
Socialist League	ORGANIZATION	, would form the nucleus of a crowd ; miscellaneous passers-by would stop to see what was going on , and the indif - ferent little assemblages would be treated to lectures which many would now pay a good price to hear .


John Burns	PERSON	tells a good story of an occasion when he went out with
Morris	PERSON	on behalf of the propaganda .

		Burns , who has a voice like a fog-horn , started things , and the inhabitants of the little village began to as - semble .

		The crowd obtained ,
Burns	PERSON	gave way to
Morris	PERSON	, who was warming up to his subject , when
Burns	PERSON	plucked his sleeve and warned him to stop .

		Morris obeyed , but was visibly annoyed , and wanted to know what was the matter with his speech or with the crowd . ''

		Well , '' said
Burns	PERSON	, '' I had seen what Mor - ris had overlooked , that the adjacent ` pub ' had just opened , and I did n't think it fitting that the author of ' The Earthly Paradise ' should be left speaking , as he certainly would have been , to a baby in a ' pram ' ! ''

		So it seemed that all this wave of hope and enthusiasm surged against stone walls , rebounding upon itself .

		Even among the comrades , within the Socialist League , dissen - tion arose , and eventually active educational propaganda was abandoned by
Morris	PERSON	him - self , who took to new and wonderful forms of art , whereby we all profit greatly to this day .

		It would be logical to ask whether
Morris	PERSON	's earlier pessimism did not better express the reality of things ; whether we , in our doubt and hesitation , are not facing the real world with an understanding of its nature .

		It would be easy to defend ourselves with an intellectual cynicism , or to pacify our con - sciences with a programme presenting only the outward appearance of activity .

		To one who has lived through the last thirty years , observing the progress of events , it does in - deed appear ludicrous that some of us could have believed the '' industrial revolution '' would come before
the end of the century	DATE	; but it is none the less evident that the seed so passionately sown has brought its harvest .

		The gain was real and substantial , and his - tory will see , not poor little crowds of stupid people bearing witness , but the whole wide world .

		It was extremely characteristic of
Morris	PERSON	that he threw himself whole-heartedly into whatever he chose to do .

		He had no patience with half measures .

		I remember his scorn when the committee of the League had the posters announcing the meetings printed on pinkish paper , instead of full red .

		`` Why , '' he said , '' it looks like revolution and water ! ''

		He was essentially constructive in all his aims .

		The Socialistic propaganda took the form of an attack on existing society , and to super - ficial people it might seem only an effort to destroy ; but the mind of
Morris	PERSON	, if not of all his followers , was illumined by a vision of what might be .

		Must it not be the same with us ?

		If our present condition , nationally and individually , is but a stage , well and good .

		It remains , however , to see that something positive , genuine , and purposeful comes out of it all .

		The spirit of
America	LOCATION	must emerge as a real contribution to civilization .

		It can hardly be said to-day that our literature , our educational institutions , or our political or -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 547 ganizations are adequately dealing with the problems they confront ; they are instead seeking lines of the least resistance , trying to do what good they can without inconvenience .

		One is almost ready to believe that the Uni - versity , which seems to represent the high - water mark of our intellectual attainment , must suffer from the frailty of its weakest link ; gathering together the best the country affords , and then levelling downward .

		Such a statement is too extreme ; to express it is to fall in some measure into the pessimism we condemn ; yet it remains true that unless we can react to evil as
Morris	PERSON	did , rising on wings of seemingly quixotic hope , we must be written down as having failed when failure was most calamitous to the human race .

		Eecently I witnessed a curiously mixed programme in the local theatre .

		The first part of the evening saw the production of a long '' movie '' play , a tale of the wild west , dramatic , bloodthirsty , and highly moral .

		The second event was a drama with real actors , '' War Brides , '' done by members of the women 's club , and done extremely well .

		Little as these matters seemed to be related , the thoughts they initiated finally met each other on the cross-roads , and recognized a kinship .

		The combined result led back to the memory of
AVilliam Morris	PERSON	, and of his plans for human happiness .

		In '' The Roots of the Mountains '' we find a picture of peaceful activity , which for its beauty and eloquence , as well as its appro - priateness to the present time , is perhaps unsurpassed : '' ' Sweet friend / he said , ' what thou sayest is better than well ; for time shall be , if we come alive out of this pass of battle and bitter strife , when I shall lead thee into
Burgdale	LOCATION	to dwell there .

		And thou wottest of our people that there is little strife and grudging amongst them , and that they are merry , and fair to look oh , both men and women ; and no man there lacketh what the earth may give us , and it is a saying amongst us that there may a man have that which he desireth save the sun and moon in his hands to play with ; and of this gladness , which is made up of many little matters , what story may be told ?

		Yet amongst it I shall live and thou with me ; and ill indeed it were if it wearied thee and thou wert ever longing for some day of victorious strife , and to behold me coming back from battle high-raised on the shields of men and crowned with bay ; if thine ears must ever be tickled with the talk of men and their songs concerning my warrior deeds .

		For thus it shall not be .

		When I drive the herds it shall be at the neighbours ' bidding whereso they will ; not necks of men shall I smite , but the stalks of the tall wheat , and the boles of the timber-trees which the wood reeve hath marked for felling ; the stilts of the plough rather than the hilts of the sword shall harden my hands ; my shafts shall be for the deer , and my spears for the wood-boar , till war and sorrow fall upon us , and I fight for the ceas - ing of war and trouble .

		And though I be called a chief and of the blood of chiefs , yet shall I not be masterful to the goodmen of the
Dale	PERSON	, but rather to my hound ; for my chieftainship shall be that I shall be well beloved and trusted , and that no man shall grudge against me .

		Canst thou learn to love such a life , which to me seemeth lovely ? ' ''

		I should like to see this passage graven on a tablet , and set in one of the great railroad stations of this country , where the seething mass of humanity daily passing through might pause for a moment and read .

		Yet in reading , we must not let the musical charm of the language fill our minds to the exclusion of the deeper thought it conveys .

		The Mor - risian doctrine , here expressed , is that happi - ness lies in normal self - activity , in doing a multitude of little things to serve our needs and those of our fellows .

		The '' War Brides '' drama is first of all an exposure of the hideousness of war ; but it is hardly less pow - erful as a plea against unjust suppression , the denial of the right to be and do .

		Our sons and daughters shall live their proper useful lives , and shall not , at the command of some external authority , be fed into the jaws of the war machine .

		Nay , if they must come to that , there shall be no sons and daughters .

		All this is evident ; but what , in this con - nection , of the `` movies '' ?

		The outgoing !

		thought was this : that whereas we rebel , and must rebel , against forceful injustice and suppression , we may ourselves do what we will not permit others to compel , voluntarily abandoning our proper activities .

		Morris always rebelled against the tendency to allow machines to usurp the pleasurable work of man , '' labor saving '' devices , to save us from that which really makes life worth living .

		He hardly contemplated such degradation as the turning of our play also over to machines .

		The `` movies '' may be moral or instructive , or may be otherwise , but the '' movie '' mania , like that of athletic `` fans , '' means the ever greater extension of sloth , the replacement of the humble happy play of other years by the mere contemplation of things .


Morris	PERSON	did indeed recognize and insist upon the impor - tance of satisfying the `` period of idleness , '' 548 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 9	DATE	which was one of the great aims of art , but he dreaded the cheapening of endeavor by competition with devices intended to curtail the expenditure of human energy .

		It was for this reason that he wrote his `` News from Nowhere , '' to stand against the picture pre - sented by
Bellamy	PERSON	's `` Looking Backward . ''

		The moving picture , reasonably used , is a beneficial invention ; even
Morris	PERSON	would never have gone so far as to regret the existence of the printing press , in which machinery takes the place of hand-work on a vast scale .

		Argu - ing as a lawyer , we can make it appear that there is no logical basis for objecting to mod - ern methods of entertainment ; yet those who thoughtfully contemplate the facts have rea - son to be alarmed lest we , having won free - dom and peace , may sacrifice the due fruits of these blessings to the god of sloth .


T. D. A. COCKERELL	PERSON	.

		SOME AMERICAN NOVELISTS AND THE LAME ART .

		A very pretty quarrel seems to be going on in the pages of '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly . ''

		It is taking a somewhat leisurely course , as it began about a year ago .

		The opening shot was fired by a red-coat , Mr.
Edward Garnett	PERSON	, introduced in the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' -LRB- on the author - ity of a popular English novelist -RRB- as `` the most valuable of British critics . ''

		If he is that , there was little evidence of it in '' Some Remarks on American and British Fiction . ''

		No doubt conditions were unfavorable .

		The editor of the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' had asked him to say a little something ; and , without special in - clination or preparation , he did just that .

		It was only for American consumption , anyhow .

		The result was a casual and rather bungling attack upon American letters , and especially current American fiction .

		America -LRB- it is to be supposed -RRB- sat up .

		Clearly something must be said for our literary Stars and Stripes ; and the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' presently put a champion in the field .

		This , of course , was not a critic -LRB- since we have no critics -RRB- , but a popular novelist and man of the world .

		So Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	, entering the arena , proclaims in a clear voice that Mr.
Garnett	PERSON	is right , that we have no current fiction of value , and that this is due to the venality or impotence of our criticism , the slack ambitions of our novelists , and the hopeless stupidity of our `` reading public . ''

		America sat up again .

		It was plain enough that while Mr.
Wister	PERSON	had told some home truths he had also restated many ancient and lamentable fallacies , and had ignored the real issue .

		Here , if we had pos - sessed such a thing as a critic , would have been an appropriate moment to call upon him , so that we might at least stand a chance of discovering what we were talking about .

		In default of that , the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' did the best it could by calling upon a second popular American novelist , Mr.
Meredith Nicholson	PERSON	, to take up the cudgels in the cause , whatever that might be .

		Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	, in '' The Open Season for American Novelists , '' turned out a very graceful and amusing piece of writing , in the course of which he gently chaffed Mr.
Garnett	PERSON	, Mr.
Wister	PERSON	, and the rest of us , and came to the sound conclusion that , after all , there is nothing whatever to be gained for American literature by the habit of scolding .

		Well , some of us breathed easier after that .

		It was reassuring to feel that our literary estate was not so desperate that it could not still be smiled about .

		To be sure , Mr.
Nichol	PERSON	- son had not altogether cleared up the situa - tion , and there might still have been room , if we had had a critic .

		However , that being out of the question , the little exchange of more or less random shots seemed to be in some sense '' over '' ; when lo !

		in the current number of the `` Atlantic '' a new champion appears , far more fierce and determined than his predecessors .

		This , under the conditions , could be none other than a third popular American novelist , Mr.
Henry Sydnor	PERSON	Har - rison .

		Him , on the evidence of his bearing , I take to be a volunteer , zealous for the cause , and actually intent upon finding out what the cause is .

		What he believes he has found is suggested by his title , '' Conven - tional Critics and
Poor America	LOCATION	. ''

		The issue is between the novelists and the people of
America	LOCATION	on the one hand , and the '' genteel critics , '' as Mr.
Wister	PERSON	calls them , on the other .

		Those gentry , as far as we can make out , are damned from the cradle , since criti - cism -LRB- unless , we suppose , as practised by popular novelists -RRB- is , according to Mr.
Har	PERSON	- rison , `` the lamest of all arts . ''

		The sting in his title is that it includes Mr.
Wister	PERSON	!

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	announces with joy , which I for one have not the heart to grudge him , that in his ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' utterance the older novelist has shown himself no better than a critic , the hidebound timid genteel critic whom he has crushed beneath a passing heel .

		Of course the new champion has no difficulty in getting under his victim 's fifth -LRB- or critical -RRB- rib -LRB- even THE DIAL may be said to have done that ! -RRB-

		.

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	, taking him to repre - sent the best that `` authorised criticism '' in
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 549
America	LOCATION	can put forward , handles him ex - haustively .

		If there is anything left to be done to Mr.
Wister	PERSON	in connection with his article , '' Quack Novels and Democracy , '' it does not occur to us at the moment .

		After a slight attempt at the urbane ironical manner , Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	throws caution to the winds , and goes at his adversary with the bare knuckles .

		The result is not the less amusing by reason of Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's devout conviction that he is disposing of two adversaries by knocking their heads together .

		Mr.
Wister	PERSON	has said that critics are fools and weaklings .

		So they are .

		But Mr.
Wister	PERSON	himself is one of them : therefore by showing up Mr.
Wis	PERSON	- ter 's folly and feebleness you are polishing off the whole breed .

		For example : Mr.
Wister	PERSON	damns the Amer - ican '' reading public '' because some millions of persons read the works of one
Harold Bell Wright	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	makes the point that there are many distinct reading publics , and that most of them do , on the whole , respond to and support good work .

		These are excel - lent points .

		That they are frequently reit - erated by professional critics , and are , indeed , among the truisms of the trade , would no doubt have disabled them in Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's mind , if he had but known !

		All this kind of thing is delightful if incon - clusive : there appears to be no reason why it should not go on for some time , since there are doubtless other popular story-tellers among us , who might be induced to try their hands at the lame art of criticism .

		MR.
SHAW	PERSON	'S NEW PLAY .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The publishing season drags its slow length along without anything of much importance appearing .

		Of the few notable books that do appear , most are translations ; and among them there are some of old books of which we could well have done with English versions before .

		The firm of
Stanley Paul	ORGANIZATION	, for exam - ple , is issuing a six - volume edition of Saint
Simon	PERSON	's Memoirs , containing all one wants of them ; and
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	's have very enterprisingly brought out a much compressed but very well chosen translation of the Journal of the de Goncourts , a book which gives a better idea of nineteenth century literary
France	LOCATION	than any other work ever written .

		Another volume of the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	History of Modern Litera - ture '' has lumbered out , regardless of Arma - geddon ; a few small books of criticism , a few bad books of verse , and a good many so-so novels -LRB- mostly with a war-chapter at the end ! -RRB-

		have also been added to the year 's total .

		One of the volumes of '' poetry '' I really must men - tion : no amateur of the curious can afford to miss it .

		Its title is '' The Chronicles of Man '' ; its author 's name is
C. Fillingham Coxwell	PERSON	; the poem is written in of all things in the world rhymed Alexandrines ; and it chal - lenges the position of '' The Faerie Queene '' as the longest epic in the language .

		Modern England already possessed one highly ambi - tious epic poet in the person of Mr.
J. Row	PERSON	- botham , an elderly gentleman who describes himself in advertisements as '' The Modern Homer . ''

		He has written '' The Epic of Crea - tion , '' '' The Epic of the Devil , '' and so on ; and from time to time , clad in a bardic robe , he gives public recitations from them in
Lon	LOCATION	- don .

		But Mr.
Coxwell	PERSON	beats him hollow .

		All knowledge is his province : and almost all knowledge has gone into his epic .

		It contains the whole history of man , from the Javanese excursions of the pithecanthropus erectus to the sinking of the '' Falaba . ''

		Every religion , every civilization , every great movement in politics , art , and thought , the disputations of Duns Scotus , the conquests of Alexander and the Grand
Duke Nicholas	PERSON	, everything you can imagine passes across his screen , and he finally deposits the exhausted pilgrim of eter - nity upon the still-contested banks of the Bzura and the
Rawka	LOCATION	.

		It will take the minor versifiers of two hemispheres some time to go one better than this .

		The prospects of Christmas publishing are not bright .

		The organized publishers are now conducting a
National Book Fortnight	ORGANIZATION	of propaganda , in order to promote the con - sumption of their products ; but it is scarcely likely that a publicity campaign will induce people to read books who otherwise would be playing billiards , arguing about the war , or going to what are now called Cinedromes and , last abomination of all ,
Picturedromes	LOCATION	.

		A cer - tain number of expensive gift books have begun to appear ; one of the best actually breaks new ground , being a book on Bridges beautifully illustrated by Mr.
Frank Brang	PERSON	- wyn .

		But nobody can really say how far people will abstain from this kind of
Christ	LOCATION	- mas present ; a partner in one very promi - nent firm tells me that the only picture-book of the kind that is to come from his office is one which was originally to be priced at a 550 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 9	DATE	guinea , and which is now , owing to the econ - omical proclivities of the war-time public , to be priced at six shillings .

		Pessimism is not universal : a few publishers are doing well , and immense quantities of sevenpenny re - prints are being sold .

		But publishers as a body do not expect their Christmas to be as Merry as usual .

		Some people , perhaps , may be tempted into unintentional irony by the chance of giving their friends new War Books as Christmas presents .

		I need scarcely say that the war books are still pouring out , though few of them can be really profitable to their pro- ducers .

		The flood shrank a little in the sum - mer ; almost every person with a name in any sort of sphere had written a War Book , and we hoped for a rest .

		But no : they were merely pausing to return with reinvigorated lungs .

		Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	is about to pro- duce his third war book : and , needless to remark , what he has to say is epoch-making compared with what most of the others emit .

		A few intelligent and thoughtful works are buried in the mass ; but the vapidity , banality , and , above all , egoism of the great majority of them are indescribable .

		Why , merely be - cause there is a war on , should Professor Bilgewater write about
Nietzsche	PERSON	, of whom , two years ago , he had never heard ?

		Why , because
France	LOCATION	has been invaded , should Miss
Marianne Nokes	PERSON	, normally a purveyor of su - burban fiction , give us pictures of herself with
France	LOCATION	as a background ?

		Day after day they surge forth : '' Life in a German Grocer 's Family , '' `` Attila and the
Kaiser	PERSON	, '' ''
Krupp	ORGANIZATION	and Kultur , '' '' The Real
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, '' `` Ar - mageddon and After , '' `` My Week in a Hos - pital , '' '' What I Think of the War , '' `` A Short - Story Writer in
Tortured Belgium	LOCATION	, '' `` The Alsace-Lorraine Problem through Sussex Eyes , '' '' O God !

		Montreal ! ''

		as
Samuel Butler	PERSON	remarked when he met the man whose brother-in-law had been haberdasher to Mr.
Spurgeon	PERSON	.

		It is small consolation to feel that the civilian populations of our enemies ' coun - tries are going through a similar ordeal .

		The one mild literary sensation of the autumn has been the prosecution and confis - cation of Mr.
D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	's new novel , '' The Rainbow . ''

		The prosecution resulted from some exceedingly intemperate criticisms in the press ; one of our horrified mandarins even going so far as to say that Zola is '' child 's food '' to Lawrence which is asinine .

		Had it not been for the predominance of a somewhat more important subject of public interest , we should certainly have had a re - newal of newspaper discussion on the literary censorship , and , probably , manifestos by all our advanced litterateurs concerning the necessity of securing free speech for the artist .

		It is not that `` The Rainbow '' has many ad - mirers .

		It is a dull book , choppily written ; and there is a gloomy ferocity about its author 's insistence upon the physical phe - nomena of sex which you could scarcely find in any other English-speaking novelist .

		Parts of it are certainly repulsive ; and all of it is morbid .

		The grievance is , not that a great work of art has been lost to the world by what Americans , I believe , call Comstockery ; but that the book is no more offensive than many works which are not interfered with ; and that , in any case , it is desirable that the greatest possible amount of rope should , on principle , be allowed to writers whose bona fides is un - questionable .

		And Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's certainly is .

		His seriousness is so profound as to be almost painful to watch .

		He has undeniably a strain of genius in him , though '' The Rainbow '' itself is an exceed - ingly tedious affair .

		This strain comes out , to some extent , in his early novels -LRB- he is still only twenty-eight -RRB- , but still more in `` Sons and Lovers , '' in the volume of short stories called '' The Prussian Officer , '' and in his verse .

		He has written nothing perfect ; his is an achievement of flashes .

		But even those who are most repelled by his brutality and his obsession with the body he appears to be under the influence of
Freud	LOCATION	, and there is a good deal of
Strindberg	LOCATION	in him recognize the occasional wonderful exactitude of his observation and his phraseology .

		There are sentences in his writing which burn across the page like flames leaping into the smoky mid - night pall of a factory district .

		His gifts are gifts of sight ; his defects are defects of thought .

		Philosophizing is obscuring his spark of genius ; if he does not pull himself together his work will deteriorate .

		But he is one of the very few men amongst the younger English novelists who is worth a second look .

		He has a strong and compact body of ad - mirers ; and there has naturally been a good deal of indignation at his name being dragged through the mud in a police court and his novel being stigmatized by a shocked barrister as `` a bawdy volume . ''

		If they had let the book alone its dulness would have condemned it to an early oblivion ; as it is , one hears that such copies as have got about are changing hands privately at fabulous prices !

		No sooner had this case been heard than there was a rumor that the production of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's new play , ``
O'Flaherty V. C.	PERSON	, '' which is an -
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 551 nounced to be put on at the
Abbey Theatre	ORGANIZATION	,
Dublin	LOCATION	, shortly , had been forbidden by the authorities .

		The play has not been published but one knows roughly its drift .

		When the great
Michael O'Leary	PERSON	won his
Victoria Cross	PERSON	an evil story went round
London	LOCATION	.

		It was to the effect that , on hearing , in her remote Hibernian retreat of her son 's great feat , the hero 's mother observed , '' I always knew that
Michael	PERSON	was the broth of a bhoy , but I little thought that I would live to see the day when he would kill eight b y Englishmen . ''

		The complex relations of Irishmen towards each other , towards
England	LOCATION	, and towards the war naturally lured Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	; something of the spirit , and even of the letter , of the
O'Leary	PERSON	anecdote has got into the play ; and though the dramatist 's conclusions as to
Irishmen	ORGANIZATION	's course of action are , from an Englishman 's point of view , admirable , it is a perilous thing to make jests at a time like this .

		However , as I write , the report of the `` banning '' of the play is contradicted , and we may possibly see it after all .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's preoccupation with the top - ical in the last year has not been quite com - plete .

		He has written a preface for his forth - coming volume of plays -LRB- `` Androcles , '' etc. -RRB- , which is said to be the best preface he has ever done .

		It examines Christianity and the
Bible	LOCATION	de novo ; and it concludes , I understand , with the suggestion , Why not Try Christianity ?

		That is a very revolutionary proposal .

London	LOCATION	,
November 22 , 1915	DATE	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A GRACEFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF A LIT - ERARY HONOR comes from Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's pen on the occasion of the award to him , by the
National Institute of Arts and Letters	ORGANIZATION	, of its gold medal , the highest distinction bestowed by that body for achievement in any of the fine arts .

		Especially noteworthy is this award because he is the first novelist to be thus honored , and his words of acceptance were both worthy of the occasion and finely illustrative of his style as a master of English .

		It is an intellectual recreation to read such sentences as these from his letter of acknowl - edgment : `` A rumor of one of those good things which seem too good to be true has come to me with such insistence that I must take it for a fact , and I am asking the secre - tary of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	to acknowledge it for me .

		I know he will fitly account for my not doing this in person , and I will not hamper him with any expression of my preference as to how he shall convey to you my sense of the supreme honor which your award of the ' Medal for Fiction ' has done me .

		In the last analysis I find this sense a sort of dismay which it would be difficult to render .

		Yet I will not pretend that it is altogether the unexpected that has happened , or that , with whatever consciousness of demerit , I did not hope it might happen ... So far as pure criti - cism has governed your vote , I might say that the novelist to whom you have done the great - est honor that the world could do him has striven for excellence in his art with no divided motive , unless the constant endeavor for truth is want of fealty to fiction .

		The fashion of this world passes away , and I have seen it come and go in my art , or phases of it .

		The best novel of my day is not the best novel of yours in some of these . ''

		Finally , says Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, '' I prize your award more than all the words of my many books could say . ''

		EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE OF EASY WRITING AND HARD READING are probably , if the truth were known , not many .

		The man who with - out conscious effort masters the art of perfect literary expression is not born oftener than once in a century , though examples are not wanting of remarkable effectiveness in the use of the pen on the part of men given to action rather than to letters .

		We approve and admire the conscientious toil of a Flaubert agonizing for the one supremely appropriate word , and of a Pater with his little squares of paper on which he wrote and re-wrote his exquisite sentences , which he afterward re - vised and re-revised in the proof ; but we greet with a more spontaneous burst of applause him who dashes off his literary masterpiece with one rapid stroke of the pen .

		Lincoln 's
Gettysburg	LOCATION	address , hastily pencilled on the backs of old envelopes on the train that was carrying him to the place of delivery , is a classic , even though a somewhat mythical , instance ; and
Grant	PERSON	's facility of impromptu written expression as shown by his despatches from the field , and to some extent , one sus - pects , by his published memoirs , is another and more authentic example .

		A few days ago Senator Lodge , addressing the
Massachusetts Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, paid tribute to the mem - ory of its deceased president ,
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, and in enumerating the talents and achievements of that distinguished descendant of distinguished men took occasion to say : '' From the earliest beginnings in the days of the college and the law office he wrote easily and well .

		He seems never to have passed through the severe struggle necessary to most 552 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 9	DATE	men when learning to express themselves in writing with force and lucidity .

		Yet the old saying that easy writing makes hard reading does not apply in his ease .

		All that
Charles Adams	PERSON	wrote is eminently readable . ''

		Never - theless the old saying is one that very few can afford to forget .

		... AN EMBARGO ON LITERATURE WOuld Seem to mean a relapse into the dark ages .

		That a highly cultured nation of western
Europe	LOCATION	should adopt measures to prevent the export of printed matter , of any class not clearly obnoxious , would have seemed , a year and a half ago , a ludicrously absurd impossibility .

		Yet to-day we have an English correspondent of the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post '' writing thus to that journal : `` All our liberties are being taken from us one by one , and after to-morrow -LRB- or a few days later -RRB- we may send no more pamphlets to
America	LOCATION	.

		Militarism is daily more and more fastening itself upon us , and many of us can not see where the differ - ence lies between our militarism and the
Prus	PERSON	- sian form we are supposed to be out to kill ! ''

		Demoralizing to any country must be the effects of long-continued armed strife , and there is no cause for surprise in the further contents of the letter , which , with a few changes , might have been written from any one of half .

		a dozen or more European coun - tries . ''

		The degeneration of our own people , morally , intellectually , and spiritually , is the most serious result of the war .

		If I could give you the details of what is happening along these lines I do not think you would believe me , as it is almost impossible to believe it myself .

		The indirect evils of war are even greater than the direct ones . ''

		A number of pamphlets issued by the
Union of Democratic Control	ORGANIZATION	are sent by the writer , before the interdict goes into effect , and American aid is asked for the work engaged in by that society .

		No name is signed or address given , but inquiry of the above-mentioned newspaper would perhaps elicit details .

		BILL
PRATT	LOCATION	, SAW-BUCK PHILOSOPHER , whose memory is cherished in humorous affection by
Williams	ORGANIZATION	graduates of the middle and late nineteenth century , was one of those unlau - reated men of nondescript genius encountered from time to time on every college campus , and the source of untold entertainment and perhaps also some inspiration to the succes - sive classes that come and go , that wax and wane , while these uncatalogued stars in the academic firmament shine on , if not forever , yet often for as many decades as can be counted on the fingers of one hand .

		And now Bill 's life and labors have been made the sub - ject of a book , they have been preserved for all time in literary form , by two alumni who were in college with Bill , though not reciting from exactly the same textbook or pursuing the same courses with him .

		It was meet that he should have his history related by
Williams	PERSON	men , for he was himself first and foremost a
Williams	ORGANIZATION	man . ''

		He had wormed his way into college life , '' says his biography , '' far back in the homespun times when ` there war n't no buildin 's there but
East College	LOCATION	,
West College	LOCATION	, and the gable-end of a car - tridge-box , ' and he refused to be counted out .

		It troubled him little that he had no learning , for he had learned to love life and could teach even the students themselves something on that score . ''

		Through six decades Bill sawed wood , blacked stoves , sold apples and pop - corn , `` made music , '' practised oratory , and upheld the dignity and glory of his adopted college , as will be found duly recorded in his authorized biography , by Mr.
John Sheridan Zelie	PERSON	and Mr.
Carroll Perry	PERSON	.

		From this book , entitled `` Bill Pratt the Saw-buck Philoso - pher , '' and published by Mr.
Talcott M. Banks	PERSON	,
Williamstown	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, we quote , in closing , a passage illustrative of Bill the ora - tor .

		It is from `` A Funeral Address delivered in front of
West College	LOCATION	after the passage of a funeral procession . ''

		`` Murmur and mourn !

		The language of life is past .

		The grass of gullory is gone and the electricity of the bay-rum tree is decided with the laments of refuge .

		Oh , he was a good man .

		How the grasshoppers of his belief floundered with the winds of his whiffle-trees .

		What a burden he was !

		What a beautiful Pharisee !

		By the corduroy of his attainments and the melody of his magnificence he retired and the palms of his pussy-willows wave with the Rolling Ottaw . ''

		... A WORD ABOUT ACADEMY-MAKING , by One of the founders of the organization from which sprang the society which in turn gave birth to our
American Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Let - ters , may be of interest in connection with the recent annual meeting of that body and its bestowal of a gold medal on its absent president , Mr.
W. D. Howells	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Frank B. Sanborn	PERSON	writes in his weekly
Boston	LOCATION	liter - ary letter to the
Springfield	LOCATION	`` Republican '' : `` Another society , bearing the name of the
American Institute of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Letters , met here on
Thursday	DATE	... This institute was formed by the Social Science mother organi - zation in
1898	DATE	. ''

		Correcting some erroneous impressions prevalent in regard to this asso - ciation , he continues : `` Dr.
Charles W.	PERSON
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 553 Eliot was never the president of the Social Scientists , who had for presidents , in succes - sion , President
Rogers	PERSON	of the ' Tech ' -LSB-
Mass.	LOCATION	.

George William Cur	PERSON	- tis , President
Angell	PERSON	of

Gilman	PERSON	of
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	,
President White of Cornell	ORGANIZATION	,
Dean Wayland of Yale	ORGANIZATION	,
Oscar S. Straus	PERSON	,
F. J. Kingsbury	PERSON	, and others .

		It was a nephew of Mr.
Kingsbury	PERSON	, Dr.
Holbrook Curtis	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, who suggested the formation of this
Institute	ORGANIZATION	, to be made up partly from exist - ing members of the parent body and partly from artists and authors outside , and for sev - eral years the starred list of
Institute	ORGANIZATION	members was printed in the annual Journal of Social Science , which I edited for some thirty years .

		Out of these original
Institute	ORGANIZATION	brethren was developed a smaller body , an
American Academy	ORGANIZATION	, which seeks to hold a rank like that of the French Academy , and has advanced measurably in that direction . ''

		In conclusion the somewhat melancholy fact is noted that `` meanwhile the mother society of social science has gone into cold storage , and no longer holds meetings , having long outlived its parent , the
British Social Science Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion , formed , by Lord
Brougham	PERSON	and his friend ,
G. W. Hastings	PERSON	, before our Civil War . ''

		SIMPLE SIMONS OF THE CENSORSHIP have been provoking the mirth of
Great Britain	LOCATION	's leading comic paper , the sprightly sheet pub - lished weekly at 10 Bouverie Street , and it prints a few quasi-official regulations for the guidance of incautious ' persons addicted to careless quotation from the poets .

		Thus , one must no longer say , or sing , or write , '' Drink to me only with thine eyes , '' for fear of sug - gesting to the enemy a defective water sup - ply . ''

		Come into the garden , Maud '' should be `` Come into the basement , Maud '' -LRB- see official directions -RRB- .

		Fond memory ought until further notice to refrain from bringing the light of other days , or any light whatsoever , around one , for obvious reasons -LRB- see police regulations -RRB- .

		Even ``
Mary	PERSON	had a little lamb '' is objectionable , as suggesting a short - age in the food supply .

		All persons desirous of promoting the effectiveness of this censbr - ship are , we assume , at liberty to mention other instances of dangerously ambiguous lines or couplets or stanzas .

		For instance , one might point out the peril in the first line of Gray 's Pindaric ode , `` Ruin seize thee , ruthless King ! ''

		In place of this last word another , also beginning with K. should be substituted , lest in the present hair-trigger condition of the
Balkan States King Constan	LOCATION	- tine of
Greece	LOCATION	or Ferdinand of Roumania should think himself meant and take offense , to the serious detriment of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and her allies .

		Again , Pope 's `` Lend , lend your wings , I mount !

		I fly ! ''

		is obviously trea - sonable , as if the domestic supply of aircraft were inadequate !

		Those of us who have received in our foreign mail letters tampered with by the censor can heap coals of fire on his head by sending in valuable suggestions like the foregoing . ''

		THE GREATEST MENACE TO UNIVERSAL EDU - CATION , '' declares the editor of the `` Wiscon - sin Library Bulletin , '' though he qualifies the assertion with a '' possibly '' that might safely enough have been omitted , `` is the cessation of the educational processes immediately upon leaving school . ''

		It is then urged upon all concerned to teach the pupil the use of the public library , since if this is done he will be likely to make the library his continuation school .

		The school period is the time , par excellence , `` to beat a path to the public library '' and to become enamoured of its chaste delights .

		Apropos of this , or of any - thing you please , there conies to mind the enthusiastic vein in which the learned
Hein	PERSON	- sius , the classical philologist of
Leyden	PERSON	, sings the praises of the library there . ''

		I no sooner come into the library , '' said he , `` than I bolt the door to me -LSB- figuratively speaking -RSB- , ex - cluding Lust , Ambition , Avarice , and all such vices , whose nurse is Idleness , the mother of Ignorance and Melancholy .

		In the very lap of eternity , amongst so many divine souls , I take my seat with so lofty a spirit and sweet content , that I pity all our great ones and rich men that knew not this happiness . ''

		Heinsius made this resort his continuation school to the end of his life of scholarly industry ... SOME ANECDOTES OF THE LATE SlR
JAMES MURRAY	PERSON	, editor of the monumental
Oxford Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, are sent to us by our
Paris	LOCATION	corre - spondent , Mr.
Theodore Stanton	PERSON	.

		While one of the early letters of the alphabet was being dealt with , a Scotticism describing a certain part of the hoof of cattle puzzled the Oxford lexicographers .

		Finally Sir
James	PERSON	decided to consult the tenant on his Roxburghshire farm . ''

		He is very intelligent , and will tell us what is meant by this word . ''

		A few days later came by parcel post a package which carried with it a very strong odor , and by mail a letter from the farmer , who wrote : `` Not understanding just what part you referred to , I thought it best to send you the whole leg . ''

		A reader of
Stevenson	PERSON	's works for the
Dic	ORGANIZATION	- tionary sent in a word that could be found in 554 THE DIAL
Dec. 9	DATE	no other lexicon ; so Sir
James	PERSON	turned to the author himself for the definition , and by return of post received these lines written on a post card : '' For heaven 's sake do n't touch that word ; it is simply a typographical error ! ''

		A story characteristic of that other eccentric Oxfordian , Professor
Freeman	PERSON	, is the following : Sdr
James	PERSON	had six sons and five daughters , and to all of them he gave old Anglo-Saxon names , the boys taking those of the kings .

		Freeman dropped in one day to congratulate the Hurrays on an addition to the family , and asked : `` Well , what is the name this time ? ''

		`` Ethelbald , the seventh , '' was the reply .

		Whereupon , the historian , so particular in minutiae , forgetting all about th .

		real object of his visit , remarked rather quer - ulously , `` Why , Dr.
Murray	PERSON	, you ought to know that there was but one King Ethelbald . ''

		`` Yes , '' came the quiet reply , `` but this is my seventh . ''

		... A CONTRIBUTION TO THE CURIOSITIES OF LIT - ERATURE , however inconsiderable , is never out of order among the lovers of such odds and ends of unclassifiable lore .

		Not all the inter - esting things of this sort are gathered within the ample volumes of the industrious Disraeli the elder .

		For instance , he lived too early to note the following :
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	, as all FitzGeraldians will recall , used to pride himself on having constructed the worst line of poetry to be found in all literature , though
Thackeray	PERSON	-LRB- or was it
Spedding	LOCATION	, or some other of the
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	circle ? -RRB-

		obstinately con - tended with him for the honors of author - ship .

		It was a line in heroic metre , - but hardly heroic in any other respect , and ran thus : `` A Mr.
Wilkinson	PERSON	, a clergyman . ''

		The exact date of the composition of this masterpiece it would now be difficult if not impossible to ascertain , but it is safe to ascribe it to the poet 's earlier years , the period of life when such inspirations are far more frequent than in the sere and yellow leaf of senescence .

		Consequently it may be placed before
1865	DATE	, when there appeared a book in which we have discovered this identical line , buried in the prose of a fictitious narrative .

		It is enclosed in no quotation marks , and the plagiarism has every appearance of being unconscious .

		The book is
Anthony Trollope	PERSON	's `` Miss
Mackenzie	PERSON	, '' and the passage occurs in chapter ten , where
Miss Baker	ORGANIZATION	conveys an invitation to the hero - ine to attend a tea-party at
Miss Todd	ORGANIZATION	's , at which there is expected to be present , she says , '' a Mr.
Wilkinson	PERSON	, a clergyman . ''

		Has the world hitherto been conscious of the double fame of this clerical gentleman ?

		GEMS OF PUREST RAY SERENE from the depths of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	not the dark un - fathomed caves of the ocean , but the pages of the magazine are gathered and displayed attractively in that annual reminder of the swift passage of time , '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly Almanac . ''

		In its issue for
1916	DATE	are to be noted , in addition to zodiacal signs , moons in all phases , useful tidings respecting tides , and other like matters common to all almanacs , such bits of sifted wisdom as this by Mrs.
Katharine Fullerton Gerould	PERSON	in the
October	DATE	issue of the magazine : '' There are two argu - ments against teaching our children Greek : one , that it is too hard ; the other , that it is useless .

		No person who could be influenced by either has the remotest conception of the meaning or the value of culture . ''

		And here , for the month of
December	DATE	, are some brave words , peculiarly timely , but too little likely to be taken seriously in this year of -LSB- dis -RSB- grace : '' I believe that it is both possible and right to live like the lilies of the field and the birds of the air ; to sell all that one has and give to the poor , winning an unseen treasure ; to lend without expecting a return ; to allow all that one has to go from one unprotesting . ''

		Once more : `` Art for art 's sake if it ever meant what it said , which is doubtful was always a vain and silly cry .

		As well contend that an artist is not a man .

		Art was ever the servant as well as the mistress of men , and ever will be . ''

		So spake
John Galsworthy	PERSON	.

		There are worse books to read than almanacs some almanacs ... READING WITH THE EYES , but not with the mind , is a lamentably easy thing to do , as thousands have discovered to their sorrow .

		It is even possible and in fact not very diffi - cult to read aloud intelligibly and with some degree of appropriate expression while the mind is occupied with alien matters .

		No be - ginning reader could do this any more than a beginning piano pupil could render a Chopin nocturne while discussing the Har - vard-Yale football game ; but both are possi - ble with sufficient practice .

		Nevertheless it is a pernicious habit to get into , this scatter - ing of one 's mental energies ; and we learn with approval that Professor
Edward L. Thorndike	PERSON	, of
Teachers College	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, has invented a device for testing the child 's degree of mental concentration upon the read - ing matter placed before him for perusal .

		No repetition by rote is required of the reader , but the test is one of interpretation rather than of memory .

		As was to be expected of one versed in the laboratory methods of educational psychology , Dr.
Thorndike	PERSON	has
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 555 made his test severely accurate , even mathe - matically so , and there will be no rule-of - thumb rating of the young pupil 's ability to read intelligently .

		The subject is fully dis - cussed in the
November	DATE	issue of '' The Teach - ers College Record . ''

		A DEFENCE OF FINE LIBRARY BUILDINGS IS made by Mr.
Adam Strohm	PERSON	, head of the
Detroit Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, in his current yearly Report .

		As is well known , that city needs and is hoping soon to have a new library building , plans for which are now under dis - cussion .

		Some of the citizens advise the use of a cheap material for construction ; others desire a palace of marble .

		The proper re - joinder to the former class , Mr.
Strohm	PERSON	believes is this : `` Mean surroundings make mean people ; things of beauty cleanse our hearts .

		True architecture , as any other artis - tic expression of the human mind , has a social function to perform in the liberal education of mankind .

		A building should be a dignified and proper self-expression of its purpose and of the spirit within ; the revelation of one 's self is largely by the ` front ' we make ; our modes of expression , our taste revealed and good manners practised in public and in pri - vate .

		` Architecture is the work of nations . '

		Public statues , public buildings of charm and beauty are public assets not extravagances . ''

		This and more in the same vein can not but encourage hope that the advocates of marble may win the day over the advocates of con - crete .

		Ill fares the city where automobiles accumulate and architecture decays .

		FRENZIED FONETICS can scarcely hope to displace our present spelling , however irra - tional that spelling may be .

		Attention has occasionally been called in these columns to the amusing extravagances of the English periodical , '' The Pioneer of Simplified Spel - ing . ''

		Still more startling in its proposals for the reform of our written speech is the little publication .

		`` Fonetik Englic , '' put forth by Mr.
Edward P. Foster	PERSON	of
Marietta	ORGANIZATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Foster	PERSON	is already known to many as the inventor of `` Ro '' -LRB- a universal language -RRB- and editor of its monthly organ , '' World Speech . ''

		His conception of phonetic English is illus - trated by the subjoined paragraph from the little pamphlet explaining the merits of his system : '' Foloiq dhi kiy tu pronunsiecrt givn below wiy print paragrafs furst in ordi - nary Englic speliq , and dhen , for komparisn and praktis , in dhi propozd fonetik speliq .

		Dhis method iz dhi awtkom ov yiyrz ov study and diskucn , and korespondens widh speliq - ref ormerz . ''

		With all the schemes now ferment - ing for the reform of our spelling , a person might enjoy the privilege , if he chose to claim it , of writing his own name in as many different ways as it was the pleasure of Shake - speare and others of his time to write theirs .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		SOME FUETHEE EEMAEKS ABOUT BEY ANT .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB- ''

		Youth will be served , '' as Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	has reminded us ; and when it can not be , one of its favor - ite exclamations , a historic one , in fact , is , '' Go up , bald head ! ''

		In not these precise words , but in words to that effect , Miss
Harriet Monroe	PERSON	-LRB- who , as the editress of `` Poetry , '' the `` official organ '' of the '' new '' movement , in the beginning communi - cated to it the principal propulsive power neces - sary to its launching -RRB- addressed the venerable shade of
William Cullen Bryant	PERSON	at a notable literary gathering in the city of
Chicago	LOCATION	a few months ago .

		I chanced to be present , and the unexpectedness of the attack , as well as its unwarrantedness or what I felt to be such caused me to contribute to THE DIAL a communication in which I endeav - ored to show why
Bryant	PERSON	, seeing that he pleaded most eloquently for poetical freedom , should have been immune from such an onslaught .

		That
Miss Monroe	PERSON	has returned to the attack , the readers of THE DIAL also know and how .

		Not content with condemning
Bryant	PERSON	as a poet , she has stigmatized him as dishonest and '' double-dealing as a man .

		And when , in my turn , I have sought to refute these charges , she has returned yet again to her self - evidently so-congenial task , and endeavors to still further blacken his reputation .

		I do not propose categorically to examine and reply to the various '' points '' raised by
Miss Monroe	PERSON	in her communication of
November 15	DATE	.

		This is because the fresh '' evidence '' she presents is too flimsy in itself and too flimsily presented to call for such procedure .

		For instance , Miss Mon - roe 's original attack upon the integrity of
Bryant	PERSON	was made upon the authority of a ''
New York	LOCATION	publisher '' whom she did not name .

		When asked for his name , she confesses that he was not a publisher at all .

		He was the late
John Denisori Champlin	PERSON	, who was aforetime in the employ of the house of Scribner and did for them much mis - cellaneous editorial work .

		Now , for my part , I can not accept the late Mr.
Champlin	PERSON	as a court of last resort in such a case .

		Particularly , I can not because Mr.
Champlin	PERSON	should have been one of the last men to bring charges of editorial sins against
Bryant	PERSON	.

		Miss
Monroe	PERSON	quotes him as the '' chief author or compiler '' of those two reference works , '' Cyclopedia of Painters and Paintings '' and '' Cyclopedia of Music and Musicians , '' two works with which I happen to have long been familiar , and which I can testify are , in an edito - rial sense , not more shoddy than they are ram - shackle works honeycombed with errors alike of omission and of commission .

		The most pretentious 556 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 9	DATE	claims were made for these works upon their ap - pearance ; but how jerry-built they are can easily be ascertained by comparing them , critically , with
Bryan	PERSON	's and with
Grove	ORGANIZATION	's works in the same metiers .

		No , I want something besides the casual chat - ter of the late Mr.
Champlin	PERSON	as a basis of belief .

		But even if I did not , observe the sweet reasona - bleness of
Miss Monroe	PERSON	, who asks me to dismiss the printed assertions of
Bryant	PERSON	's publishers as examples of tergiversation and truth-stretching , and accept the garrulities of Mr.
Champlin	PERSON	as gos - pel !

		Observe it , furthermore , when , in her porten - tous list of publications to which
Bryant	PERSON	basely '' sold his name and venerable portrait '' for adver - tising purposes , we find two works that appeared in
1879	DATE	when
Bryant	PERSON	himself died in
June , 1878	DATE	.

		One of these works , it appears , was pub - lished by the house of
Appleton	LOCATION	and the other by the house of
Putnam	LOCATION	, two names which , as all lovers of good literature are aware , still appear in the pages of THE DIAL devoted to publishers ' announcements .

		Perhaps there are old members of these firms yet active who can relate how the
august	DATE	shade of
Bryant	PERSON	returned from the spirit land via the
Society for Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	, maybe !

		to seal with them the iniquitous bar - gains by which an unsuspecting public was yet again to be flim-flammed !

		I will , however , dwell for a moment upon this portentous , this so deeply damning , list of Miss
Monroe	PERSON	's because it brings out one thing which is , I think , worth passing mention .

		It contains eleven items , and with one exception these items are all books devoted to things which with
Bryant	PERSON	were passions .

		As all students of his life well know , he was a devoted lover of nature , of the American landscape , and of flower and plant-life ; he was a great lover of poetry ; and he was a deeply relig - ious man .

		-LRB- Miss
Monroe	PERSON	has referred pleasantly in one of her communications to his '' pious puerili - ties . ''


Bryant	PERSON	was not pious , he was strongly and reverently religious ; not in a puerile but in a thoroughly manly and unaffected way .

		Of course this would disfranchise him as a '' new '' poet for the only religion of which so far I have found any traces in the '' new '' poetry is that of self - worship .

		Bryant conceived himself as but the humble vessel of a Deity Omnipotent . -RRB-

		From time immemorial , illustrious writers have contributed prefaces or advised in the compilation or publica - tion of works upon subjects in which they were deeply interested ; and it has remained for a propagandist of the '' new '' poetry to first come forward with the unique charge that
Bryant	PERSON	in doing so was '' false to his vision '' as a poet .

		If the charge can be sustained , it occurs to me that we have had and still have an enormous number of false poets among us !

		Really , one scarce knows which ones may with propriety be read .

		Perhaps it were best , in order to feel perfectly safe , to restrict ourselves to '' Poetry '' alone .

		But even then will we be secure from contamination ?

		For disturbing recollection !

		did not '' Poetry '' itself award -LRB- Miss
Monroe	PERSON	being the deus ex machina , I believe -RRB- some time ago a Cash Prize , that rarest of all rare birds poetically pursued , to a poet who , if the biographies and bibliographies are to be trusted , has distinguished himself by many and divers editorial and journalistic labors , perpetra - tions of prefaces , etc. , etc. .

		If one asks , Can such things be ?

		I can only answer that they have been !

		The question of editorial ethics , upon which Miss
Monroe	PERSON	animadverts , both directly and indi - rectly , may be debated to infinity without ever getting anywhere , for the plain reason that no gov - erning canon has ever been established , nor can one ever be .

		The words '' edit '' and '' editor '' are of an elasticity indefinable alike in latitude of inter - pretation and of practice .

		The nature , however , of
Bryant	PERSON	's editorial labors upon the '' Library of Poetry and Song '' we have his own and his pub - lishers ' statements for .

		No uncertainty except for the purpose of clouding the issue exists regarding them .

		And if the writing of an histori - cal Introduction extending to some 7000 words did not , in connection with his general editorial oversight , up to the time of his death , of the body of the work -LRB- which , as has been shown , was the product of various pens -RRB- , qualify his name to appear upon the title-page of the '' Popular His - tory of the
United States	LOCATION	'' as one of its authors , I can imagine no '' reason why '' not entirely fan - tastical .

		I have been at some pains to trace out the '' Publishers ' Announcement '' of this work , and while it is a lengthy one it nowhere indicates just what portions were to be contributed by
Bryant	PERSON	or describes his share in the undertaking .

		And a peculiar thing remains to be noted in the prem - ises .

		This '' History '' was published by no less a house than that of Scribner the house with which Mr.
Champlin	PERSON	was so long allied and of which Miss
Monroe	PERSON	implies he was practically a part .

		Now , if this work was so absolute and unblushing a fraud as Miss
Monroe	PERSON	asserts and re-asserts , how was it that Mr.
Champlin	PERSON	could bring himself to remain in the employ of a firm given to such pernicious practices ?

		Why did he not revolt at the iniquity , and affiliate himself with more hon - orable people ?

		Let echo answer !

		The preface to the second volume of this work , as I have also previously shown , definitely stated that its composition had been carried on under the direct supervision of
Bryant	PERSON	, and that he had scrutinized '' every line '' in the proof as well .

		But Miss
Monroe	PERSON	alleges , on Mr.
Champlin	PERSON	's say - so , that
Bryant	PERSON	'' scarcely glanced '' at the proof - sheets .

		As one of the advisers of the publishers , one would think Mr.
Champlin	PERSON	would have seen to it that the preface was altered before it went out into the world .

		Why did n't he , or else hold his peace thereafter ?

		Speaking of proof-sheets reminds me , moreover , that Miss
Monroe	PERSON	must herself be somewhat negli - gent in her inspection of those of the publication which she is believed to edit .

		Else how could she ever have '' let past '' that thrilling '' new '' poem in a recent issue which , as has already been pointed out in THE DIAL , contains a surprisingly flagrant plagiarism from
George Meredith	PERSON	?

		We are obliged , in the first place , to feel sure that
Miss Monroe	PERSON	, as an experienced practitioner of the ars poetica not
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 557 only , but one deeply versed in its representative exponents , must be familiar with a poem so cele - brated as '' Lucifer in Starlight . ''

		In the second place , we must be not only sure , we must be absolutely certain '' hope to die '' '' cross my heart '' that so rigorous is her sense of editorial rectitude -LRB- as shown by her strictures upon
Bryant	PERSON	-RRB- that knowing the plagiarism to be present in the poem -LRB- let us call it one , for did it not appear in '' Poetry '' ? -RRB-

		she would have suspended publication before allowing it to appear as an original compo - sition .

		We are therefore left in an embarrassing dilemma , - from which we can only extricate our - selves by the inference that she was careless -LRB- as Mr.
Champlin	PERSON	says
Bryant	PERSON	was ! -RRB-

		about the proof - sheets !

		Yes , we feel that must be it !

		For , if
Miss Monroe	PERSON	had ever examined the proofs of this poem , must she not infallibly have forwarded them to the inspired -LRB- if somewhat at second-hand -RRB- author and requested a new , a truly '' new , '' climacteric line '' ?

		Assuredly !

		And at the same time she must have pointed out how grotesque was the mar - shalling , as '' The army of unalterable law '' of `` Matthew '' -LRB- Arnold -RRB- and `` Waldo '' -LRB-
Emerson	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		For she must be vividly aware of the fact that over half-a-century ago the former gave to the world two of the finest poems in free verse that any language can boast ; while the tetter 's entire influence -LRB- which was and still remains the most powerful ever exerted by an American writer -RRB- has ever been an incitement to revolt against '' art made tongue-tied by authority , '' and life as well .

		I would like to add a word regarding another accusation against
Bryant	PERSON	by Miss
Monroe	PERSON	which she made in a previous communication to THE DIAL , and repeats in her latest one , that he is in some manner most abysmally culpable because his two most famous poems , '' Thanatopsis '' and '' To a Waterfowl , '' were written , the one at the age of nineteen and the other at that of twenty-one , and he never afterward surpassed them .

		Poor
Bryant	PERSON	!

		Not only his faults -LRB- ? -RRB-

		but his misfortunes are thus made to condemn him !

		For it is the general misfortune that poetical inspiration , at its highest , can not be turned on and off like the stream from a faucet , to use the simile of George Sand re - garding the easy flow of her limpidly perfect prose and the absolute control of it that she possessed .

		As a poet himself has written : `` Alas !

		not always doth the breath of song Breathe on us .

		It is like the wind that bloweth At its own will , not ours , nor tarrieth long ; We hear the sound thereof , but no man knoweth From whence it comes , so sudden and swift and strong , Nor whither in its wayward course it goeth . ''

		If
Bryant	PERSON	lived long thereafter and never ex - celled the poems of his youth , he is merely in the same boat with a host of other poets of renown .

		Poe , for instance , claimed to have written '' To Helen '' at the age of fourteen , and '' Israfel '' at twenty .

		He lived on to forty , but they remain his high-water mark .

		Rossetti composed the one poem with which his fame is inseparably connected , '' The Blessed Damosel , '' at nineteen , and lived on to fifty-four .

		Swinburne published `` Atalanta in alydon '' and '' Poems and Ballads '' in his twen - ties , and they are the poems by which principally he will be remembered , though he died at seventy - two and his other productions fill many volumes .

		Lamartine 's Meditations -LRB- which include Le Lac -RRB- appeared in
1820	DATE	, and he continued to publish poetry for nearly a half-century afterward , but that volume is what he will live by .

		De Musset 's two masterpieces , the Nuits of
May	DATE	and of Decem - ber , he wrote in
1835	DATE	, at the age of twenty-five and failed to equal them during the twenty-two subsequent years of his career .

		So I might con - tinue , filling pages of THE DIAL with citations of names and dates , but it is , I conceive , quite un - necessary .

		To some poets it is given to write their most immortal verses at an early period , to others at a late one , to still others at an intermediate one , while there are some few cases in which the high - est point is touched or approximated at all these intervals .

		That this is or can be in any way con - strued as a reproach it has remained for
Miss Monroe	LOCATION	to assert in the case of
Bryant	PERSON	.

		JoHN L '' HERVEY '' ONCE IN A BLUE MOON .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		If the woman of to-day , and not
Henley	LOCATION	, had written '' Invictus , '' her version of the first stanza would have been : '' Out of the night that covers me , Black as the pit from pole to pole , I thank whatever gods may be For my uncomfortable soul . ''

		Though why go afield to find the gods ?

		Mr.
H. W. Boynton	PERSON	is closer at hand .

		For it does n't happen often just once in a blue moon that anyone presents so penetrating a diagnosis of a case as his article , '' Just a Nice Story , '' appearing in THE DIAL for
November 25	DATE	.

		To be sure , we had all known there was something wrong with our fiction the last century or two , but it is only recently that we have tried to find the cause .

		Mr.
Garnett	PERSON	began by pointing his finger at us and saying , You are to blame over there in Amer - ica ; and Mr.
Wister	PERSON	answered , No , not all of us only the critics and
Harold Bell Wright	PERSON	.

		Almost simultaneously , Mr.
Boynton	PERSON	and Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	stepped forward , the former making a strong defence of the critic , the latter declaring that there was almost hope for the rest of us , and both asserting rather triumphantly that they had never heard of
Harold Bell Wright	ORGANIZATION	.

		Now , just as Mr.
Henry Sydnor Harrison	PERSON	is ready to assure us that not only are matters not so dreadful as they seem but they are even much better than that , Mr.
Boynton	PERSON	, despite his broad tolerance of what he calls the silly and wonderful time of youth , insists that things are bad after all .

		And whose is the fault ?

		It 's woman 's .

		-LRB- Thus does history repeat itself . -RRB-

		And woman 's soul will surely be filled with a divine discomfort , for she must realize that what he says is unequivocally and unfalteringly true .

		To begin with , she did not know any better .

		As for the
last decade	DATE	, or decade and a half , she has been so busy trying to know better that she has not stopped long enough to give herself time to think .

		558 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 9	DATE	She took her first plunge into literature , or pseudo-literature , in her early years of pig-tails and freckles .

		She was not taught , as babes are now , to lisp glibly , '' The sea gives her shells to the shingle , The earth gives her streams to the sea '' ; instead , she had to discover things for her - self .

		In a big dusty attic she pulled an old trunk out of its forgotten corner , and there she stum - bled upon her first copy of '' Little Women . ''

		Not even in these later days , when she has specialized and gone in for thrills , has she found anything to equal that glorious moment when she gloated over the prospective feast in its pages , while imagina - tion ran riot and hope was young .

		She cried over the chapter where Beth had the scarlet fever , and would not read it to the end that day , thinking that if
Beth	PERSON	must die she could at least postpone knowing about it as long as she would .

		Once or twice she did wonder if this was the kind of tale that grown-ups read , but when she reached the part where Jo married Professor
Bhaer	PERSON	instead of
Laurie	PERSON	all her doubts vanished .

		For she knew that anything so grim as that could be nothing short of literature .

		And we warn Mr.
Boynton	PERSON	that it would have been a fatal hour indeed for him to have been on hand just then to tell her that what she was reading was only a sweet pretty story .

		In the trunk were old '' Youth 's Companions '' that were musty and yellow and ragged .

		She liked especially the picture of the Blind Brother from the file of
' 87	DATE	.

		The series was broken , so she never found out if he ever escaped from his prison in the mine .

		Another favorite was '' Bet and Her Family '' the ten commandments , poor Bet being the first and Ruth the eleventh and the obstreper - ous brothers the other nine .

		There was also a volume of
Keats	PERSON	's poems which she read a year or two later .

		By mishap or fine lack of discrimination she skipped completely his '' Ode on a Grecian Urn '' and '' La Belle Dame sans Merci , '' and consequently decided that on the whole he merely tried to soothe the cares of men by adjectives , ornaments , and sweets . ''

		The Pot of Basil '' seemed too wormy by half , and almost everything else of his she read she secretly thought was lush .

		But she never dreamed of confiding her opinions to anyone , for the school of criticism which dogmatically decries all poetry written north of
1890	DATE	-LRB- or is it 1910 ? -RRB-

		had not yet come into its own ; or , if it had , she was young and innocent and did not know of it .

		It was
Carlyle	PERSON	who did for her what poetry had failed to do .

		One day she heard some chapters read aloud from '' Past and Present . ''

		Those brief snatches of cursory reading led her to think of him as one of the great army of hewers of wood and drawers of water , rather than as an author ; it was a pick-axe that he held in his hand , and his shaggy head she knew it must be shaggy towered godlike above his fellow - workers while his Blesseds and Thrice-Blesseds were heaped lavishly upon even a Gurth , born thrall of Cedric .

		She herself grew three inches while she listened to the words .

		Literature with power had cast its spell over her , and she could never be the same after that .

		She longed to read , or even write , arti - cles where she could say , within parentheses , '' the italics are mine / ' or use expressions like Kultur or elan vital .

		Now she was ready to sit up to the table with her elders , and share the game course and the cheese .

		As a sign that youth and senti - ment and romance were left forever behind , she stole up to the attic and locked the trunk and shoved it back against the wall of the alcove .

		The key is still on the nail in the second rafter from the window .

		It may be rusty now .

		And that brings her to the stage where she is at present .

		So much happened while she was still reading -LRB- dare we say it ? -RRB-

		the
Elsie Books	ORGANIZATION	, that she would never have caught up at all if she had not decided to jump the middle ground .

		Even at that she does n't think .

		There is n't time .

		Miss
Ida Tarbell	PERSON	knows her , and in her new book , '' The Ways of Woman , '' she calls her a culture-chaser .

		It is she and her sisters , according to
Miss Tarbell	PERSON	, '' who can be depended upon to fill a theatre at ten or eleven in the morning to listen to a lecture on Peace or the Cancer Cure , Suffrage or Tagore , Radium or the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal .

		It is they who are the instant ally of any cause which is new and it is they who will stay by as long as the campaign is exciting or until something more exciting looms in sight . ''

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	must have met her last year , for , even far more effectively , he describes her thus : '' There was in her blood that which bade her hasten , lest there should be some - thing still new to her when she died ... What with travelling in new countries , listening to new preachers , lunching new novelists , discovering new dancers , taking lessons in Spanish ; what with new dishes for dinner , new religions , new dogs , new dresses , new duties to new neighbours , and newer charities life was so full that the moment it stood still and was simply old ' life , ' it seemed to be no life at all . ''

		And in writing of her , no doubt Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	and
Miss Tarbell	PERSON	, like Mr.
Boynton	PERSON	, had in mind all ladylike gentlemen as well .

		Perhaps some day she will tire of looking at things as they are , just as she tired of looking at them as they are not .

		Perhaps some day she will crawl under Mr.
Boynton	PERSON	's barbed-wire fence and discover the world of true idealism and know '' the stuff of which manly life and manly imagination are made . ''

		Perhaps she will want to come back to hear more about things as they were .

		Think of the transformation there will be , as a result , in fiction and literature and life !

		But why be opti - mistic about it ?

		Things like that seldom happen out of books only once in a blue moon .

		MORE ABOUT DIPHTHONGS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Will you permit me to say , in reply to your cor - respondent , Mr.
Wallace Rice	PERSON	, that the remarks which he quotes from my '' Essentials of English Speech and Literature '' were written to bring out the fact that , in the view of the
National Education Association 's Committee on Phonetics	ORGANIZATION	, the diph - thongal characters of the digraphs ch , ng , sh , th ,
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 559 and zh , would be better indicated by ligatured sym - bols than by the plain letters .

		Mr.
Rice	PERSON	asks : '' What can Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	mean when he calls sh , ng , th , and zh diphthongal ?

		.

		.

		The four sounds mentioned -LRB- really five , since th stands for two different consonants -RRB- are monoph - thongs . ''

		Perhaps Mr.
Rice	PERSON	has overlooked the fact that one of the meanings of the word '' diphthong '' is a combination of two consonants in one syllable , espe - cially such intimate unions as those of ch and dg or j -LRB- dz -RRB- , in '' church , '' '' judge , '' etc. .

		And as for calling the symbols monophthongs , has not Mr.
Rice	PERSON	forgotten that a monophthong is a single vowel sound , a vowel digraph , or two written vowels pronounced as one ?

		As this is the meaning which the word has had for nearly three centuries , it would ill befit me to misuse it as Mr.
Rice	PERSON	has done .

		Mr.
Rice	PERSON	asks what can I mean when I call the symbols referred to diphthongal .

		He will find the answer in a standard work issued under the editor - ship of the late Dr.
William T. Harris	PERSON	: '' CH .

		This digraph has three sounds as follows : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The more frequent sound is diphthongal .

		.

		as in chin . '' ''

		NG .

		The ng at the end of a word is really diph - thongal . '' ''

		SH .

		The description by Briicke seems more accu - rate , which makes it to be a composite element , con - sisting of an s sound .

		.

		and a breath sound .

		.

		like the German ch in ich . '' ''

		TH .

		This digraph is used to represent two lingua - dental fricative sounds : a surd and a sonant . '' ''

		ZH .

		In some words , z takes a sound -LRB- zh -RRB- which is the sopant correlative of the surd sh ; as in azure .

		.

		developed `` by ` fusion of a proper z with a following y sound . ''

		In addition to this , the work referred to , before discussing these symbols , which it classifies as '' Diphthongal Consonants , '' says : '' Certain con - sonant sounds are composed of more simple con - sonant elements so blended that the product is property described as diphthongal . ''

		No one regrets more than I that Mr.
Rice	PERSON	disa - grees with me that is his privilege , and far be it from me not to wish him all the comfort and satis - faction that he may get out of it .

		FRANK H. VIZETELLY .


New York City	LOCATION	,
Nov. 26 , 1915	DATE	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		After stating that '' every one of the great dic - tionaries has decided that the sound of these letters -LSB- ng , sh , the two sounds of th , and zh -RSB- is diph - thongal , '' it is interesting to find Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	mentioning as sole authority for his statement a book which remains anonymous , except for the fact that it is '' a standard work issued under the editorship of the late Dr.
William T. Harris	PERSON	. ''

		who was not a phonetician .

		Since his declaration was a portion of a passionate apology for the Scientific Alphabet of the
National Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Standard Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	is not only the chief exponent of the use of that signary in English but also a lexicon with which Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	was inti - mately connected , it would have been natural to find him turning first of all to the official exposi - tion of that alphabet on pages 2195-2197 of this important work .

		I turned to these pages , and the reason was immediately evident why the good Doctor pre - ferred to quote from other sources .

		Here , where the inventors and demonstrators of the Scientific Alphabet are engaged in its official exposition , one may find it said of ng , '' the elementary palatal nasal sound in sing , sang , sung '' ; of sh , '' the ele - mentary sound closing in rush , opening in she '' ; of the sonant sound of th , '' the elementary sound of th in that '' ; of the surd sound of th , '' the ele - mentary sound closing in myth , pith , opening in thin , think '' ; of zh , '' the elementary sonant cor - responding with sh . ''

		In other words , the highest exponents of the characteristics of the alphabet upon which Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	is expatiating contradict him absolutely on every point of his contention .

		But why did he not take their word for it ?

		They know .

		But I was at a loss to understand why , when I had said in my original communication that ch is usually a consonantal diphthong , Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	should have felt it necessary to quote further authority upon it , until I realized that it was for the purpose of self-refutation ; of course , if , as he says in his book , '' most phonetists analyze this sound as a combination of t and sh , '' sh must itself be a simple sound had it diphthongal quality a consonantal triphthong would result .

		The quotation citing Briicke is quite beside the question ; as '' a standard work issued under the editorship of the late Dr.
William T. Harris	PERSON	, '' -
Webster	PERSON	's New International Dictionary , ob - serves , '' it is regarded as a simple element , '' nor does it require much phonetic knowledge to know that composite consonants and consonantal diph - thongs are not the same things , as where the authority just quoted states of ng , '' the sound is composite , but not compound . ''

		On page xlvi of the same work may be found the statement : `` A consonantal digraph is a combination of two con - sonants representing a single sound , as sh in she , zh in azure , ng in sing , '' while the New English Dictionary -LRB- Vol .

		VIII , p. i -RRB- speaks of '' the simple consonants , sh , zh . ''

		Where Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	obtained his remarkable statement that '' the ng at the end of a word is really diphthongal , '' I can not surmise , and I should like to have the citation in full .

		It is perhaps permissible here to say that ng was recognized as a simple sound by our Teutonic ancestors several centuries before

		It is rather pitiful to find Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	quoting in support of his position such a statement as that the digraph TH '' is used to represent two lingua-dental fricative sounds : a surd and a sonant , '' and italicizing words to mislead his read - ers further ; it is as if he had said , ''

		The quotation regarding zh is also beside the question .

		Dr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	chooses to be unaware that sounds developed by fusion may nevertheless be simple sounds , though nothing is more common in phonetic history .

		Instances in English abound , and in nearly all other languages which have engaged the attention of scholars .

		Of the sound in question it may be sufficient to quote the Cen - tury Dictionary again , which says : '' SH .

		He has done me the honor to look the former up in the dictionary ; if he will do himself the justice of also looking up the latter he will promptly withdraw his statement that '' one of the meanings of the word ' diphthong ' is a combination of two consonants in one syllable '' at least , no such meaning attaches to the word in the

		IMAGISM AND PLAGIAEISM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Surely you do not mean to accuse Mr.
T. S. Eliot	PERSON	of trying to '' put something over '' when , in your issue of
November 25	DATE	, you use the unfortu - nate word '' plagiarism '' in connection with your discussion of his recent contribution to '' Poetry . ''

		I read the poem in question when it appeared ; and , in common with you , I recognized the line , '' The army of unalterable law , '' as the last line of Meredith 's '' Lucifer '' sonnet .

		It seemed to me then , and seems to me now , a rather neat trans - position .

		The ' thought never entered my naive brain that Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	-LRB- who is , by the way , entirely unknown to me personally -RRB- could have supposed that the line would be regarded as anything but a quotation .

		I could as easily fancy a man trying to palm off as his own such phrases as '' justify the ways of God to men , '' '' I shall not look upon his like again , '' or '' To be , or not to he : that is the question . ''

		Plagiarism is the corrupt at - tempt to pass off as one 's own the work of another writer ; there is no possible relation between it and Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	's employment of a great and world - famous phrase in a position where the reader 's recognition of it as a quotation is precisely the effect aimed at .

		Genuine plagiarism is a rare vice ; it generally occurs in regions where the reward for successful stealing is considerably higher than any reward that the poet is likely to get .

		Of course exception is commonly made in the case of such phrases as those mentioned by Mr.
Ficke	PERSON	, which have become counters of our literary currency , worn thin by universal daily use .

		That Mere - dith 's line is not of this class is sufficiently proved , if proof were needed , by the fact that it does not even appear among the ten or fifteen thousand `` familiar quotations '' com - prised in the latest -LRB-

		VIEWS OF STEVENSOX .

		* It has been lately held by some writers that interest in
Stevenson	PERSON	is waning .

		The number of books and articles relating to him still constantly issuing from the press , however , seems to indicate that the reverse is true .

		In addition to the volumes named below , another biography of
Stevenson	PERSON	for the young and a reprint of Mr.
Clayton Hamilton	PERSON	's articles on Stevensonian localities from '' The Book - man '' are among the recent announcements .

		All of these together lead us to infer the wide range of readers who continue to find enter - tainment in
Stevenson	PERSON	's works .

		To genuine lovers of
Stevenson	PERSON	, Mr.
Frank Swinnerton	PERSON	's well written book will come as a great shock .

		It seems that their faith has been misplaced , that
Stevenson	PERSON	was not , after all , what they took him to be .

		Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	's opinion is disparaging at almost every point .

		According to him ,
Steven	PERSON	- son 's only enduring book of travel is '' In the South Seas '' ; his essays are merely specimens of style , with finesse but without vigor ; his poems will not endure because they are lack - ing in passion ; his plays are shallow , '' it never occurred to him to put a real figure in a play : he never supposed that a character in a play had any end but to be put back into the box with the other playthings '' ; of his short stories only five are really artistic ; of his novels and romances only '' Treasure Island '' and '' Kidnapped '' are worth while .

		To so little do the thirty-two volumes of the collected works -LRB- as arranged in the `` Bio - graphical Edition '' -RRB- come when
Stevenson	PERSON	's work is sifted by the coldly critical Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	!

		As for the rest , our critic gives
Stevenson	PERSON	credit '' for most admirable clarity '' ; his romances '' include occasional pieces of distin - guished imagination , a frequent exuberance of fancy , and a great freshness of incident which conceals lack of central or unifying idea and poverty of imagined character . ''

		He has great versatility of talent , and one can - not contemplate the record of his writings '' without great admiration . ''

		That is all .

		He was a Scot and an invalid .

		tune left him without the capacity for emotion required of the poet -LRB- p. 92 -RRB- .

		The other caused him to lack the real courage needed for great adventures in literature as in life : '' with all his writing he took the road of least resistance , the road of limited horizons ; be - cause with all his desire for romance , his desire for the splendour of the great life of action , he was by physical delicacy made intellectually timid and spiritually cautious . ''

		This , then , is the theory we are asked to accept with regard to one whom we had been accustomed to think of as having earned his niche , though not a lofty one , in the temple of fame .

		Is it true ?

		Is oblivion for
Steven	PERSON	- son , after all , inevitable ?

		`` Was so much of his work , after all , mere craftsmanship ?

		To answer these questions fully would perhaps require a volume ; here we can only set down our dissenting opinion .

		It seems to us that this book well illus - trates
Arnold	LOCATION	's remark that the critic requires a very delicate poise .

		The least obstruction between him and his object may tend to throw him out of balance and distort his view of distant objects , as in
Poe	PERSON	's story of `` The Sphinx . ''

		We do not question Mr.
Swinner	PERSON	- ton 's full knowledge of
Stevenson	PERSON	's works ; we do question , however , his attitude of mind toward his author .

		He finds
Stevenson	PERSON	tire - some , and that very fact arouses suspicion as to his temperamental qualifications for this particular task .

		When one is tempted to write a book upon a tiresome writer , one should perhaps stop and consider if one be `` called . ''

		That Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	was not called is amply demonstrated , it seems to us , by his last paragraph .

		One thing would seem certain : if there be so little art in
Stevenson	PERSON	's work , if he be so entirely a decadent , if the unspeakable and canny Scot and the timid invalid have so completely dominated his work , then he is bound very quickly to disappear from the horizon .

		For we can never get away from the fundamental canon that art is social : it takes two to paint a picture , the artist and his observer ; two to make a book , the author and his reader ; two to fashion a statue , the sculptor and he who will behold with sympa - thetic insight ; and though the artist may be unconscious of it , the critic is present before and during , as well as after , the execution of the work .

		We may be fearful 6f Demos ' qualifications for anything else than a place in a mob ; but in the end it is Demos -LRB- at his best , of course -RRB- who rules us all .

		And after all , has not Demos given us -LRB- or restored to us -RRB- Chaucer , and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and
Scott	PERSON	, and
Thackeray	PERSON	, and many another ?

		There are 562 THE DIAL
Dec. 9	DATE	imperfections in the work of all of these ; yet in spite of their imperfections they survive and continue to give us refreshment and even inspiration .

		They are men like ourselves ; they were not always at their best ; they grew as we all grow .

		Time has sifted their work : the less valuable part , though still included in complete editions , is no longer known to the great body of readers ; but the best is every - where known and read and loved .

		So it will be with
Stevenson	PERSON	; and may it not be that a somewhat larger body of his writing will endure than five short stories and two boys ' books ?

		We can only record our confident belief that such will be the case .

		A century from now some curious antiquarian may smile at these lines and wonder who
Stevenson	PERSON	was .

		If so , he is welcome ; it will not be the first time a prophet has gone astray .

		The characteristics of
Stevenson	PERSON	's essays , Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	finds , are those `` of manner rather than of matter . ''

		They '' owe their charm to the fact that
Stevenson	PERSON	was often writing about himself , for he always wrote en - tertainingly about himself .

		He was charmed by himself , in a way that the common egoist has not the courage or possibly the imagina - tion to be . ''

		Yet where will one find a super - abundance of the author 's self in `` Pulvis et Umbra , '' in `` Talk and Talkers , '' in `` Beg - gars , '' in `` JEs Triplex '' ?

		In these essays , at least ,
Stevenson	PERSON	rarely talks about himself .

		Is it true that these essays give pleasure merely because of their '' knots , '' as Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- nerton implies , or merely because they are full of a commonplace moralizing which is received with delight by the bulk of us com - monplace readers ?

		We must confess to hon - est doubts .

		We do not insist that an essayist 's every idea shall be absolutely new or original ; we do insist that he shall express it in a fresh and stimulating manner , and that he shall be neither prosy nor narrow in his sympathies .

		And
Stevenson	PERSON	generally meets these require - ments .

		The poems Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	pronounces to be failures because they were the work of a Protestant Scot .

		This would also prove Burns a failure .

		Surely , however ,
Stevenson	PERSON	was not invariably the cautious , canny , theologizing Scot .

		As a matter of fact , with the possible exception of '' Our Lady of the Snows , '' the poems reveal no traces of Protestant any more than of Catholic '' theology '' ; and ex - cept for the second book of `` Underwoods '' and a few
Scotticisms	PERSON	here and there in his other verse , they might have been written by an Englishman or an Irishman .

		In certain respects we should pronounce many of them distinctly successful .

		They are not long and ambitious ; they never attempt too much ; and they easily and naturally portray many various moods .

		That
Stevenson	PERSON	was not a great poet may be freely granted ; yet he had the soul of a poet ; he has enshrined the child heart in verse which will live , we believe , for generations ; throughout even his prose will be found beautiful poetical passages , as for example where
Kirstie	ORGANIZATION	says to
Archie Weir	PERSON	: '' Weel , Mr.
Archie	PERSON	, there was a lad cam r courtin ' me , as was but naetural .

		Mony had come before , and I would nane o ' them .

		But this yin had a tongue to wile the birds frae the lift and the bees frae the fox-glove bells .

		Deary me , but it 's lang syne .

		Folk have deed sinsyne and been bur - ied , and are forgotten , and bairns been horn and got merrit and got bairns o ' their ain .

		Sinsyne woods have been plantit , and have grawn up and are bonny trees , and the joes sit in their shadow , , and sinsyne auld estates have changed hands , and there have been wars and rumours of wars on the face of the earth ... And do ye no think that I have mind of the bonny simmer days , the lang miles , o ' the bluid-red heather , the cryin ' o ' the whaups , and the lad and the lassie that was trysted ?

		Do ye no think that I mind how the hilly sweetness ran about my hairt ? ''

		That
Stevenson	PERSON	was not a dramatist we are also quite willing to concede .

		While he had a superb command of conversational style , he was most at home in more leisurely narrative of the third person , in which he could intro - duce description when it pleased him .

		But surely he and
Henley	PERSON	were on the wrong track .

		It is not fair , of course , to impute to him either faults or merits for which
Henley	ORGANIZATION	may have been partly responsible .

		We can only say that the plays do not convince us .

		The two phases of '' Deacon Brodie '' are not sufficiently distinguished : and while the vil - lain of the play could hardly be hanged on the stage -LRB- it will be remembered that the real
Brodie	PERSON	was hanged -RRB- , yet the manner of his taking off comes as an unwarranted surprise .

		Beau
Austin	LOCATION	is too quickly convinced of the errors of his ways to seem wholly natural .

		`` Admiral Guinea '' is too pious ; the one excel - lent character in this play is the villainous Pew .

		Sir
Arthur Pinero	PERSON	, in his address on
Stevenson	PERSON	's dramatic work , has probably said the last word on this phase of the matter .

		Of the short stories , there are doubtless many opinions as to which are the best .

		Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	thinks that '' The Bottle Imp '' '' and ''
Thrawn Janet	PERSON	'' are '' the two most suc - cessful examples of
Stevenson	PERSON	's art as a short - story writer '' ; and with this view we have no special quarrel .

		As for the others , to our mind Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	does not do justice either to '' The Sire de Maletroit 's Door '' or to `` A Lodging for the Night . ''

		The former
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 563 seems to us the better , because fuller of inci - dent and more climactic .

		Yet the latter , far from being '' a piece of labored artifice , '' is to us true and convincing .

		Perhaps Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- nerton fails most conspicuously in his treat - ment of `` The Pavilion on the Links , '' which he thinks
Stevenson	PERSON	did not first imagine , but planned in cold blood . ''

		If I look for emo - tion in the story , '' he says , '' I find none .

		If I look for an aesthetic idea I find none . ''

		Can it be that he is incapable of perceiving either ?

		For both are there .

		Every one of the chief characters is full of emotional stimulus ; one might almost say , even , that every character furnishes an aesthetic idea . ''

		The Beach of Falesa '' is likewise a captivating tale .

		The author has admirably succeeded in the imper - sonation of his hero ; the form seems to us well adapted to the content ; and not without reason have some called this story his best .

		With regard to the novels and romances , Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	's complaint is that
Steven	PERSON	- son 's constructive power weakens .

		This can hardly be said , however , of '' Prince
Otto	PERSON	, '' in which there is no flaw .

		There is plenty of incident ; the unexpected is constantly hap - pening ; and the characters are sufficiently well motivated to pass muster .

		Our critic thinks the theme too slight ; we should be inclined to say that the result proves that it is not .

		The theme is adequate .

		To call it a '' doleful failure '' and a '' lackadaisical gim - crack '' is to put oneself outside the pale of serious criticism . ''

		The Master of
Ballantrae	LOCATION	, '' which has been pronounced by not a few to be among
Stevenson	PERSON	's best , Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	, on the whole , condemns .

		How the introduction of
Secundra Dass	ORGANIZATION	`` ruins the book as a work of art , '' however , passes our comprehension .

		Secundra is obviously essential for the work - ing out of the plot , and moreover himself adds legitimately to the interest by the mystery which he brings to the story .

		The critic fur - ther objects to the rambling course of the story , '' its wilful attempts to follow the wan - derings of a central figure so fascinating .

		.

		as the
Master	ORGANIZATION	, its lack of framework and true body of character '' ; he finds Lord
Durris	PERSON	- deer and
Alison	PERSON	`` truly no more than pup - pets , '' while '' even the Master sometimes is no more than a collection of traits . ''

		As for the first point , we had supposed that , given a plot of this sort , the central figure of which wanders over the world ,
Stevenson	PERSON	introduced proper devices for enabling us to follow him .

		As for the other too sweeping criticisms , we can only express dissent .

		No puppet could fight such a duel as
Henry	LOCATION	fights ; the fault is that at the end he plays too minor a part .

		Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	comes nearer to doing jus - tice to `` Weir of
Hermiston	LOCATION	, '' in which he rightly thinks that ''
Stevenson	PERSON	reached the height of his powers as a realistic novelist . ''

		Nor does he need to except from his praise
Frank Innes	PERSON	, `` the novelists ' hireling profes - sional seducer . ''

		The mere fact that such characters occur elsewhere should not prevent us from recognizing the naturalness of
Innes	LOCATION	.

		True , `` continuity of narrative there is none '' ; but is there much more in `` Adam Bede '' or ''
Henry Esmond	PERSON	'' ?

		The outline of the projected conclusion , however terrifying to Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	, would seem to \ varrant the opinion that had
Stevenson	PERSON	finished the story , probably in a somewhat modified form , it would have taken rank among the few great , novels of the nineteenth century .

		In short , Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	's book is to a considerable degree disappointing .

		It pre - sents the extreme views of a hostile critic , which are quite as wide of the mark , it seems to us , as was the indiscriminate praise we used to hear .

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	's life of
Stevenson	PERSON	, issued in
1901	DATE	, and reviewed in THE DIAL for
Nov. 16	DATE	of that year , has now been republished in an abridged form .

		The 548 pages of the original two-volume edition have been cut down to 372 , partly by omitting foot-notes , appen - dices , the
South Sea	LOCATION	map , and the index , partly by a skilful cutting down of the text .

		The only important addition we have noted in the text is a paragraph at the end of Chapter VI , in which the author refers to the fact that
Stevenson	PERSON	's canoe trip in
1876	DATE	lay through scenes now memorable for the battles lately fought there , and quotes
Stevenson	PERSON	's remark that Landrecies `` was a point in the great warfaring system of
Europe	LOCATION	, and might on some future day be ringed about with cannon smoke and thunder , and make itself a name among small towns . ''

		The chief addi - tions , however , are the thirteen illustrations , all of which are new .

		To what w r as said of the former edition little need now be added .

		The book has worn well , and has taken its place among the worthiest biographies of the
last two decades	DATE	.

		Miss
Amy Cruse	PERSON	's biography is included in the series of '' Heroes of All Time '' ; here
Stevenson	PERSON	rubs elbows with
Alexander	PERSON	,
King Alfred	PERSON	,
Joan	PERSON	of Arc ,
Mohammed	LOCATION	, Sir
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	, and William the Silent .

		That
Stevenson	PERSON	was a brave man and a hero , none will deny ; but that he deserves such distinc - tion as this is perhaps more than most even of his ardent admirers would claim for him .

		The book is especially written for the young , 564 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 9	DATE	and on the whole not badly written .

		It is well illustrated .

		On p. 60 , ``
Leslie Stevenson	PERSON	'' should be
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	.

		Some interesting views of
Stevenson	PERSON	are given in `` Sailor and Beachcomber , '' from the pen of Mr.
A. Safroni-Middleton	PERSON	.

		It is a curious book , abounding - in ungrammatical ex - pressions and with an occasional misspelling ; yet the author has the poet 's eye , and despite the hardships through which he has passed , has never lost the feeling for nature pos - sessed by the true seer .

		At fourteen he ran away from home and shipped before the mast for
Australia	LOCATION	.

		Thence , after various adven - tures , he drifted to
Samoa	LOCATION	.

		His skill witii the violin gave him unusual opportunities to see all kinds of life .

		When he first met
Stevenson	PERSON	, the latter was deeply interested in birds ' eggs .

		`` He had intellectual keen eyes and a sad emotional-looking face , and looked a bit of a dreamer . ''

		Later , on shipboard ,
Middleton	PERSON	taught
Stevenson	PERSON	something of violin-playing .

		Perhaps the most interesting glimpse we get of
Stevenson	PERSON	is at the bedside of a little ill Samoan girl ; he '' tenderly bent over the little patient , as concerned as though it were his own child , as he chuckled with his lips , and touched it softly on the chin with his finger playfully , till it actually looked up at him and gave a wan smile . ''

		No wonder
Tusitala	LOCATION	was venerated .

		Mr.
Middleton	PERSON	's account of the missionaries , we regret to say , is sadly at variance with the views of them expressed by
Stevenson	PERSON	himself ; yet the later writer gives the impression of trying to be fair , and expressly admits that '' some of the best men are missionaries and sacrifice years of their lives in a hopeless quest . ''

March 4 , 1915	DATE	-RRB- that `` here is both solid shot and canis - ter with which to rout the ardent enthusiasts whose self-imposed task is to ` uplift ' the drama . ''

		With equal truth it may be said of the four illuminating papers on acting w r hich constitute the second series of the publications * PAPERS ON ACTING .

New York City	LOCATION	: Dramatic Museum of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		issued by Professor
Matthews	PERSON	in the name of the museum of which he is both creator and suzerain , that here is shot with which to anni - hilate the amateur actor .

		However , since only three hundred and thirty-three copies of these booklets are printed , it is doubtful if either the '' uplifters '' or the amateur actors ever place themselves within range of the sound common sense regarding both play writ - ing and play acting which is here presented .

		The '' papers on acting '' comprising the new series of these publications are written with a single exception by notable actors .

		The exception is the paper on Mrs.
Siddons	PERSON	by
H. C. Fleeming Jenkin	PERSON	.

		Although it suf - fers by comparison w T ith its fellows , it never - theless contains the surprising statement that an actor must be a creator rather than an interpreter , the humble author of the play doing less for the actor than nature for the painter .

		This is certainly the apotheosis of the art of acting .

		Lest the vanity of the actor who may chance to read these words become even more inordinate than is its wont , it is well to administer as an antidote the following quotation from Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	Vs scintillating essay on `` Mummer Worship '' published some twenty-five years ago in a volume entitled '' Impressions and Opinions '' : '' An actor is one who repeats a portion of a story invented by another .

		You can teach a child to act , but you can teach no child to paint pic - tures , or to write poetry , prose or music ; acting is therefore the lowest of the arts , if it is an art at all , and makes slender demands upon the intelli - gence of the individual exercising it ; but this age , being one mainly concerned with facile amusement and parade , reverences the actor above all beings , and has by some prodigy that can not be explained by us , succeeded , or almost succeeded in abstracting him from the playwright , upon whom he should feed in the manner of a parasite , and endowing him with a separate existence of necessity ephem - eral , but which by dint of gaudy upholstery and various millinery has been prolonged beyond due limits and still continues . ''

		There is more truth in Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's ani - madversion than in Mr.
Fleeming Jenkin	PERSON	's eulogium .

		Children do act tolerably well , and acting does make slender demands upon the intelligence in comparison with the other arts .

		Not only do children act tolerably well , but also some amateurs ; yet where is the ama - teur , unprepared for his task by years of preparation , who paints , carves statues , com - poses music , or even writes tolerably well ?

		Mozart and
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	composed in child - hood , it is true , but modern children can not do any of these things acceptably ; hence it is easy to accept Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's contention that acting is a knack rather than an art .

		Mr.
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 565
Moore	PERSON	is a literary man , however , and jealous of the adulation bestowed upon the actor .

		Like most literary men , he feels that after all the play is the thing , and that the actor , with the help of his salaried press-agent , gobbles more than his share of the public 's approval .

		But the actor has a distinct advantage in that he makes a personal and nightly bid for favor , whereas his rival may appear trembling and halting for a moment only in answer to cries for the author uttered at a single perform - ance .

		Seeing an actor in a part , the public thinks of him as constituting the part ; yet without the words someone else has written , there would be no part at all .

		Thus the actor receives the lion 's share of the applause ; and because the public knows and loves him , his name appears on the playbills in letters ten times as large as those which herald the name of the poor author .

		Acting is an art , however , although like singing and playing an instrument it is in - terpretive , not creative , and therefore on a lower plane than painting , sculpture , creative writing , and the composition of music .

		In order to discover the true relation of acting to play writing , it is necessary to accept the testimony of an unbiased witness .

		This is to be found in the paper entitled , '' The Illusion of the
First Time in Acting	ORGANIZATION	, '' contributed by Mr.
William Gillette	PERSON	.

		The most entertaining , l > y far , of the four papers which constitute the series , it is at the same time the most illuminating ; for although it sparkles with humor , it is replete with common sense , and free from the grandiose acclaim of acting found in the late Constant Coquelin 's `` Art and the Actor . ''

		The '' illusion '' which forms the subject of Mr.
Gillette	PERSON	's paper he explains as the art of knowing exactly what you are going to say and behaving as though you did not .

		`` Al - though , '' as he states , '' every single item in a play from the most important to the least important be successfully safeguarded , there yet remains the Spirit of the Presentation as a whole .

		Each successive audience before which it is given must feel that it is wit - nessing , not one of a thousand weary repeti - tions , but a life episode which is being lived just across the magic barrier of the footlights .

		That is to say , the Whole must have that indescribable Life-Spirit or Effect which pro- duces the Illusion of Happening for the
First Time	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It is the creation of this illusion of the first time , the imbuing of a play with '' that inde - scribable Life-Spirit , '' which makes acting a fine art .

		Yet this is no answer to the late Mr.
Fleeming Jenkin	PERSON	's appalling contention that the actor is the creator , and the author a mere element of less value to him than nature to the painter .

		Unless the ether ealizing ap - plause which he has received as an actor has anaesthetized his literary sense , Mr.
Gillette	PERSON	notable both as actor and playwright is in a position to judge impartially the relative importance of the actor and the dramatist .

		These are his views : '' Incredible as it may seem , there are people in existence who believe that they can read a Play ... The feat is impossible .

		No one on earth can read a Play .

		You may read the Directions for a Play and from these Directions imagine as best you can what the Play would be like ; but you could no more read the Play than you could read a Fire or an Automobile Accident or a Base-Ball Game .

		The Play if it is Drama does not exist until it appeals in the form of simulated life ... So far as painted , manufactured , and mechanical elements are concerned there is comparatively little trouble .

		To keep these things as much in the background as they would appear in a simple episode in actual life under observation and no more is the most pronounced difficulty .

		But when it comes to the Human Beings required to assume the Char - acters which the Directions indicate , and not only to assume them but also to breathe into them the Breath of Life and not the Breath of Life alone but all other details a.nd elements and items of Life as far as they can be simulated , many and serious discouragements arise . ''

		This view makes of the dramatist something more than an element , since it at least credits him with inventing the directions from which a play is created .

		Moreover , a third factor is admitted by Mr.
Gillette	PERSON	to exist in the shape of the manager , who selects and guides the human beings required to assume the characters which the directions indicate .

		Another element in the making of a play is the audience , which Mr.
George Arliss	PERSON	, in his delightful Introduction to Mr.
Gillette	PERSON	's paper , calls the '' great stimulant . ''

		Without an audience to view it , the author , the manager , and the actors are still obliged to imagine as best they can what the play will be like .

		It is the author , however , in spite of all the con - tentions actors may make to the contrary , who conceives the play , and by his directions indi - cates the way in which it shall be interpreted .

		Moreover , good acting can not redeem a bad play , and bad acting can not wholly destroy the dramatic power of a good play .

		If a play is truly dramatic , its performance by a com - pany of tyros will hold an audience , and if it is undramatic even an '' all star '' cast will not prevent it from boring those who witness it .

		The author , therefore , is surely the creator , the actors being merely the interpreters . ''

		It is easier to detect a flaw in the actor 's impersonation , '' the late Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	566 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 9	DATE	maintains in his Introduction to
Talma	PERSON	's `` Reflexions on Acting , '' `` than an improba - bility in a book . ''

		If the noted English his - trion means to suggest that an audience will accept improbability in a story , provided the story holds its interest , his statement is true , dulness being the one flaw in a play an audi - ence will not tolerate .

		The true relation of the actor to the author is best set forth , how - ever , by
Talma	PERSON	.

		`` Associated with great authors , '' he says , `` actors are to them more than translators .

		A translator adds nothing to the ideas of the author he translates .

		The actor , putting himself faithfully in the place of the personage he represents , should perfect the ideas of the author of whom he is the interpreter . ''

		The italics are not
Talma 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are intended to accentuate the fine dis - tinction he draws between the translator and the interpreter .

		The one merely conveys a meaning , while the other explains and ex - pounds it .

		Whether an actor should experience emotion while acting or merely present his studied impressions is a question answered differently by actors differing temperamentally .

		`` An actor needs not to be actually moved , '' says the late Constant Coquelin .

		`` It is as un - necessary as it is for a pianist to be in the depths of despair to play the funeral march of Chopin or of Beethoven aright . ''

		A con - trary view is held by the great
Talma	PERSON	. ''

		The inspired actor , '' he holds , `` will so associate you with the emotions he feels that he will not leave you even the liberty of judgment ; the other , by his prudent and irreproachable acting , will leave your faculties at liberty to reason on the matter at your ease .

		The former will be the personage himself , the lat - ter only an actor who represents that per - sonage . ''

		In a word , the one interprets , the other merely translates .

		Talma upholds the emotional rather than the intellectual actor .

		Yet all inspired artists , whether they be painters , musicians , authors , or actors , possess the '' extreme sensibility '' he prefers to `` profound intelligence . ''

		In - deed , it is the various means used by artists to express their emotions which differentiate one kind of art from another .

		Even acting is something finer than the mere repeating , as Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	would have it , of a por - tion of a story invented by another ; though like singing it is an interpretive art .

		One is inclined , however , to hold with Mr.
Moore	PERSON	that this age unduly reverences the actor at the expense of the dramatist , who , being a creator , should in justice stand higher in the esteem of the public than his interpreter .

		TRIUMPHS OF GERMAN STATE SOCIALISM .

		* It was to be expected that the most sat - isfying of the many `` interpretations '' of
Germany	LOCATION	which have been thrust upon the reading public of late would be contained in a book written not only in large part before the war began , but `` as though there were no war . ''

		Mr.
Frederic C. Howe	PERSON	, the author of the volume in mind , has been for a quarter of a century a student of , and for a decade an occasional writer upon , German affairs .

		He has explained for American readers the in - tricacies of German municipal government , and has called attention forcefully to Ger - man principles of taxation , education , and social insurance .

		He has even written a book on the
Germany	LOCATION	of
America	LOCATION	, the state of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	!

		In `` Socialized
Germany	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Howe	PERSON	has attempted a somewhat searching analysis of German social statecraft in the many phases which it has presented since the establish - ment of the Empire .

		At the outset he con - fesses to a strong affection for the German people , a pronounced liking for the cities of
Germany	LOCATION	, unbounded respect for the German educational system , and admiration for the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	's unmatched social legislation .

		It is his conviction that , at least until the war began , the German was better off than any other man in
Europe	LOCATION	, if not in the world .

		His country was more intelligently organized than were other countries , while he himself was better protected in his daily life , better prepared for work , more efficient , and more happy than anybody else .

		The conviction is expressed , further , that at the outbreak of the war
Germany	LOCATION	had just reached the beginning of her greatest achievements , and that had not the war intervened , '' the next generation would have seen her competitors in industry , trade , and commerce out-distanced at an accelerated speed that would soon have left them far and possibly permanently in the rear . ''

		Finally , it is affirmed that
Germany	LOCATION	may be expected to come off from the war , whatever the immediate outcome , relatively quite as advantageously situated as she was when she went into it .

		She will turn from war to peace with much of the preparedness with which she turned from peace to war ; and even now she is planning far in advance for the one , even as formerly she planned far in advance for the - other .

		And this brings the author to his principal theses , namely , that
Germany	LOCATION	is what she is to-day by rea - son of a new kind of social statesmanship , and * SOCIALIZED
GERMANY	LOCATION	.

		By
Frederic C. Howe	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 567 that it is the features of this new statesman - ship that the
United States	LOCATION	and other coun - tries must take into consideration if they are to be prepared to meet the
Germany	LOCATION	which , in victory or defeat , shall emerge from the present conflict .

		In a series of some twenty chapters , Mr.
Howe	PERSON	describes this new social statesmanship to which he attaches such extreme impor - tance .

		He discusses succinctly the characteris - tics of the German constitution , the economic foundations of class rule , the essential lines of recent economic progress , the theory and extent of State Socialism , the state-owned railways , the operation of canals and water - ways , the treatment of unemployment , social insurance , education , sanitation , the govern - ment and building 1 of cities , municipal land - ownership , housing projects , and a multitude of other matters .

		In all of the activities which he describes , the measure of efficiency attained is , by the common testimony of observers , substantial ; in some it is fairly phenomenal .

		The unrelieved record of skilled achievement in public affairs which Mr.
Howe	PERSON	sets down is likely , however , to pall somewhat ; and the reader may be pardoned if he occasionally wonders whether , after all , the author has been as keen to detect shortcomings and fail - ures -LRB- there must be some such ! -RRB-

		as to gather up statistics and other evidences of success .

		It must be admitted that the German social and industrial system can easily be portrayed in a manner to make it appear very attrac - tive , if not well-nigh ideal .

		The fatal flaw in it , however , to the English and American way of thinking , is the fact that the system is a product of , and is continually sustained by , a species of political absolutism .

		The advan - tages possessed by the Germans have been gained at a cost which English-speaking peo - ples would refuse to pay , a cost taken out of individual initiative and liberty .

		All of this Mr.
Howe	PERSON	recognizes .

		Indeed , he frankly declares for a badly managed democracy in preference to an efficient state of absolutism .

		None the less , it may be questioned whether the vitiating effects of German autocracy and bureaucracy have been adequately esti - mated , and whether the industrial democracy of the country is really quite so splendid a thing as it is represented to be .

		What Mr.
Howe	PERSON	means by `` taking into consideration '' the new , German type of statesmanship is made plain by a paragraph in his preface .

		He means that other peoples , including Americans , will be obliged to aban - don the old conception that the only business of organized society is to protect the indi - vidual from domestic and foreign aggression . ''

		There must be a wide extension of public ownership , a greater control of the aggres - sions of privilege and property , a big pro- gramme of social legislation , a change in our system of education , and the exclusion of privileged and business interests from the long ascendancy which they have enjoyed in our political life . ''

		The observation is offered that it required the war to make this clear to
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and the hope is expressed that the
United States	LOCATION	may now be shaken from her complacency as well .

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	is not a Socialist , and , granted that special privilege can be abolished and industrial freedom attained in other ways , he would have society continue to be organized upon an essentially non-Socialistic basis .

		But he would see an extension of state activity far beyond the limits yet attained in English - speaking countries .

		Again , he perhaps takes hardly sufficient account of the noteworthy extensions that have been , made , even in our own land , in the past ten or fifteen years .

		BACONIZESTG SHAKESPEARE .

		* `` A history , review and critical study of both sides of the Bacon-Shakespeare Ques - tion . ''

		Such is the wording of the advertise - ment that induced me , notwithstanding a firm resolution never again to waste a moment 's time on this '' question , '' to take up the peru - sal of Mr.
James Phinney Baxter	PERSON	's large and forbidding , though handsome , volume enti - tled `` The Greatest of Literary Problems . ''

		A more thoroughly misleading advertisement was never penned .

		The book is neither a history nor a review of the subject it deals with , and anything more uncritical can not be imagined .

		In reality it is an undisguised and vicious attack upon
William Shakespeare	PERSON	and everything even in the remotest way con - nected with him -LRB- e.g. , his birthplace , ances - try , home , education , character , biographers , commentators , etc. -RRB- , and a deification of Sir
Francis Bacon	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	's book may be divided into two parts .

		In the first part he attempts to prove that
William	LOCATION	'' Shakspere '' of
Stratford	LOCATION	, an indifferent actor in a
London	LOCATION	theatrical company , did not write the '' Shake - speare '' works and , because of his illiteracy , could not have written them ; in the second he proves , to his own satisfaction , that
Bacon	PERSON	was the hidden author not only of the Shake - speare works but also of all the writings that scholars and historians attribute to
Marlowe	PERSON	.

		* THE GREATEST OF LITERARY PROBLEMS .

Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		568 THE DIAL
Dec. 9 Kyd	DATE	,
Greene	PERSON	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Peele	PERSON	, B.urton , '' and others . ''

		In what follows I shall consider only a few points in the first part of Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	's book , for it is obvious that unless he can prove the first half of his thesis there is no reason for giving the other even a thought .

		Shakespeare is in possession , and he must be ousted rightfully and unequivocally before we can consider another claimant for the title of '' Prince of Poets . ''

		Besides , the latter por - tion of Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	's book deals with crypto - grams , anagrams , symbolisms , cyphers , and other mystical things , and that way mad - ness lies .

		In his attempt to dethrone
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	like every other Baconian proceeds in accordance with a definite rule , which may be formulated somewhat as fol - lows : Traduce the actor-poet and his ances - tors ; harp on the filthiness of his birthplace and his neighbors ; run down the
Stratford Grammar School	ORGANIZATION	; reject as unworthy of belief every tradition favorable to the ''
Strat	PERSON	- fordian '' ; accept as incontrovertible fact every tale that tends to besmirch his char - acter ; put the worst possible construction on every unexplained circumstance in his life ; suppress all documentary evidence that will not fit into your theory ; sneer at the com - mentators and call them '' pedants '' ; pit one biographer 's conjectures against another 's ; harp on the lawsuits in which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	figured as the plaintiff ; exasperate the ortho - dox Shakespearean by spelling the
Strat	PERSON	- f ordian 's name '' Shakspere '' ; and this above all : exaggerate Olympus-high the knowledge of law , medicine , scripture , music , linguistics , ornithology , botany , philosophy , psychiatry , angling , soldiership , astronomy , astrology , horticulture , etc. , possessed by the author of the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	works .

		Before we have read many pages of Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	's book , we are assumed to be convinced that '' Shakespeare the poet '' was a high-bred gentleman , an aristocrat , a courtier , lawyer , scholar , and philosopher of the first magnitude , and that '' Shakspere the actor '' was a '' close-fisted , shrewd , unscrupulous , avaricious '' boor , a coarse , ignorant , rude , unpolished , low - minded , boisterous , mean , litigious , lascivious , lecherous , and adulterous yokel , a frequenter of taverns and a professional gambler .

		-LRB- This caricature of a man was chosen by
Bacon	PERSON	as his mask ! -RRB-

		Every now and then we are re - minded that while so-and-so was going on in
London	LOCATION	the Stratfordian was plying his '' petty trade and overreaching his neighbors . ''

		Let us examine a few of Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	's argu - ments and facts .

		On page 67 he says , quite correctly , while speaking of the licenses granted to certain publishers to print some of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's productions : '' It was not necessary for the author 's name to appear on the Stationer 's register . ''

		Yet on page 105 he speaks of it as '' a striking fact that this name is not found in the Stationer 's Regis - ters . ''

		But
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's name does appear in the Stationer 's Register .

		On
August 23 , 1600	DATE	, the
Stationer	ORGANIZATION	's guild issued a license to print '' Two bookes .

		.

		Muche a Doo about Nothinge .

		.

		Kinge Henry the iiijth .

		.

		Wryt - ten by master Shakespere '' : on
Nov. 26 , 1607	DATE	, `` A booke called .

		Master
William Shakspeare	PERSON	his historye of Kinge Lear '' ; and on
May 20 , 1609	DATE	, `` A booke called Shakespeares Son - nettes . ''

		The license to print the first Folio is too well known to be reproduced here .

		Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	devotes a considerable portion of his book to proving that Shakespeare '' the actor was unknown to contemporary au - thors , '' that very '' little personal notice was taken of him , '' that '' what was said did not identify him with the works which bear his name , '' and that '' not one identifies the actor with the author of the plays or poems . ''

		We shall prove every one of these assertions false .

		Shakespeare was very frequently spoken of by his contemporaries , some of whom even wrote adulatory poems to him .

		The evidence as to this , most of which is to be found in Ingleby 's '' Centurie of Prayse , '' Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	suppresses or distorts .

		He selects for quotation only such allusions and refer - ences to the poet-dramatist about which there can be some doubt , such as
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's refer - ence to `` Action '' and to '' pleasant Willy . ''

		The testimony of
Chettle	ORGANIZATION	, in which , too ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is not named , he rejects -LRB- p. 80 -RRB- on the ground that
Chettle	PERSON	was fat ;
Greene	PERSON	's testimony is rejected -LRB- p. 79 -RRB- because '' he died after a debauch of pickled herrings and Rhenish '' ; and
Heywood	PERSON	is disqualified as a witness on the ground that '' we have no rea - son to assume that he knew anything about the actor 's real connection with the works which bear his name . ''


Jonson	PERSON	's testimony , which identifies Shakespeare the poet with
Shakespeare of Stratford	ORGANIZATION	to a certainty , is rejected because he w r as envious , got drunk , bragged about himself , fought a duel , and employed invectives freely .

		The testimony of Heminge and
Condell	PERSON	, the poet 's friends , theatrical associates , and `` editors , '' is got rid of by some hocus-pocus that is unintelligi - ble to us .

		The inscription on the
Stratford	LOCATION	monument is not mentioned .

		The following brief references , not one of which is even so much as hinted at by Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	, although they are all unequivocal references to Shakespeare as a poet , are here
1915	DATE	569 introduced as an indication of our author 's disregard for the truth .

		In
1598	DATE	,
Francis Meres	PERSON	accorded unstinted praise to '' melliflu - ous and hony-tongued Shakespeare '' for his poems , sonnets , comedies , arid tragedies , some of which he named .

		Webster , in
1612	DATE	, eulo - gized '' the right happy and copious industry of Master Shake-speare . ''

		In
1614	DATE	,
Thomas Freeman	PERSON	wrote an extremely eulogistic son - net '' to Master W. Shakespeare '' in praise of his `` plaies and poems . ''

		The year after
Meres	ORGANIZATION	's `` Palladis Tamia '' was published .


John Weever	PERSON	wrote a sonnet praising ''
Honie	PERSON	- tongu 'd Shakespeare . ''

		and five years later -LRB- 1604 -RRB- `` An -LRB- tony -RRB- Sc -LRB- olloker -RRB- , gentleman , '' spoke of `` friendly Shakespeares tragedies . ''

		In
1605	DATE	,
Camden	ORGANIZATION	included
William Shake	PERSON	- speare in a list of the '' most pregnant wits '' -LRB- i.e. , intellects -RRB- of the time .

		Barnfield .

		too , wrote the praises of Shakespeare 's '' hony - flowing Vaine , '' and in
1615	DATE	`` Mr.
Willi	PERSON	.

		Shakspeare '' was included in Stow 's `` An - nals '' in a list of '' our modern and present excellent poets . ''

		The dramatist is unequivo - cally spoken of as an actor by
John Davies	PERSON	in a poem `` To our English Terence , Mr.
Will	PERSON	: Shakespeare '' who '' plaid some kingly parts in sport . ''

		Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	's silence as to these important references is the more remarkable when we consider the fact that he does not fail to apply to Shakespeare a large number of unsavory and uncomplimentary allusions to unidentified and unidentifiable persons in the literature of the period , and to identify Shakespeare with ridiculous characters -LRB- e.g. Crispinus , Sogliardo -RRB- in the dramas of his contemporaries , although some of these have been almost certainly identified with others -LRB- e. g. , Crispinus =
Marston	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Let us next give the reader an illustration of how much or little Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	knows of the facts of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		Regarding the poet 's coat-of-arms -LRB- p. 34 -RRB- a subject to which he delights to refer on all occasions because some have said that the coat was ob - tained `` fraudulently '' and that the transac - tion was `` discreditable to all concerned '' he says : '' In
1596	DATE	, another application -LSB- for armorial insignia -RSB- was made , coupled with a request for permission to impale the arms of
Mary Arden	PERSON	, his wife .

		In this case a false statement of her ancestry was made , and so it was held up Toy the heralds for three years .

		In
1599	DATE	another applica - tion was made requesting the recognition of the coat of arms of
1596	DATE	, and the right of the grantee to impale .

		.

		the coat of arms of the
Ardens of Wilmecote	ORGANIZATION	.

		At this the heralds again balked , realizing that this influential family would protest against it ; and , finally , an
Arden	PERSON	family residing in
Cheshire	LOCATION	was found bearing no relation to the
Wilmecote Ardens	ORGANIZATION	.

		The remoteness of this fam - ily rendered interference improbable , but it might prove troublesome , and so the question of an Arden impalement was dropped .

		The request , however , for recognition was granted .

		This ir - regular procedure aroused criticism , and objec - tions were raised against it on the ground of legalizing an infringement , but nothing was done . ''

		The italics single out the more important errors in this passage .

		Had Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	pos - sessed the scholar 's spirit , and read the origi - nal documents pertaining to this matter , he would have known that the
1596	DATE	application said absolutely nothing , directly or indirectly , about impaling
Mary Arden	PERSON	's arms .

		The applicants made no false statement about her ancestry .

		The allegation in the drafts that she was the daughter of
Robert Arden	PERSON	, `` Esquire , '' contains no falsehood .

		After very careful study of this question , I can say that the poet 's maternal grandfather was a descendant of the Ardens of
Warwickshire	LOCATION	, being the son of
Thomas Arden	PERSON	who was the second son of Sir
Walter Arden	PERSON	, and was therefore a `` gentleman '' and entitled to arms .

		Shakespeare 's application for heraldic distinction in
1596	DATE	was not held up by the College of Arms , as I have proved elsewhere .

		After
1596	DATE	the poet and his father are almost always given the appellation `` Master . ''

		In
1599	DATE	the Shakespeares made no request for a recognition of the arms assigned in
1596	DATE	, as there was no need for doing so .

		What they asked for was the right to impale and quarter with their own the arms of
Robert Arden of Wilmecote	ORGANIZATION	.

		The heralds did not describe these arms in the draft , but in a marginal sketch they show the following shield : Argent , a fess checquy Or and Azure .

		On the unas - sailable authority of
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	,
Camden	LOCATION	, etc. , I can say that this escutcheon was prop - erly borne only by the descendants of the elder sons of the Warwickshire or Park
Hall	PERSON	-LRB- not `` Wilmecote '' -RRB- Ardens .

		As soon as the heralds discovered this technical error , they erased these arms and substituted for them the following : Gules , three cross-crosslets fitchee and a chief Or , with a martlet of the first for a difference .

		This has been called by Baconians , and others who have not given the subject the study it deserves , the ''
Cheshire Arden	PERSON	arms , '' on the assumption that it was the coat peculiar to this family .

		As a matter of fact it is absolutely certain that it was the appropriate escutcheon for younger branches of the Park
Hall Ardens	PERSON	, just as the fesse checquy was for the older branch .

		At least two
Warwickshire Ardens	ORGANIZATION	, Sir
Herald de Arden	ORGANIZATION	and
William	PERSON	, the youngest son of Sir
Walter	PERSON	, bore the very arms sketched for
Mary	ORGANIZATION	570 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 9	DATE	Shakespeare in
1599	DATE	.

		The arms of the
Cheshire Ardens	PERSON	were like those of the younger branch of the Park
Hall Ardens	PERSON	because the two families were related , notwithstanding Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	's statement to the contrary .

		The action of the heralds was determined by a desire for correctness , not by a venal motive .

		No recognition was granted in
1599	DATE	because none had been asked for .

		The statement that any irregular procedure in connection with the
Arden	PERSON	impalement had given rise to criticism and objections is not true .

		It was because of the
1596	DATE	grant that the malicious and envious
Ralph Brooke	PERSON	preferred charges against his superiors .

		Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	's statement that nothing was done in the matter is not true either .

		Something was done .

		A special commission was appointed to investigate the charges against the
College	ORGANIZATION	, and in
1602	DATE	the commission reported that the Shakespeare coat-of-arms had been rightly granted because
John	PERSON	`` hath borne magestracy and was Jus - tice of peace at
Stratford	LOCATION	upon Avon , he maried the daughter and heire of Arderne and was able to maintaine that estate . ''

		Under the heading , `` A Crucial Question , '' Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	devotes a chapter of his book to proving that the Stratfordian was so illiterate that he could barely write his name and that therefore it was impossible for him to have written the Shakespeare works .

		To accom - plish this marvel , our learned author pours out the vials of his sarcasm on Mrs.
Thumm	PERSON	-
Kintzel	PERSON	-LRB- who is a graphologist and not a handwriting expert -RRB- for her analysis of the characters of
Bacon	LOCATION	and of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	from their handwritings , and for her attempted proof that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's will is a holograph , exposes the shallowness of Mr.
Gervais	PERSON	and of Mr.
Pym	PERSON	-LRB- not `` Pyne '' -RRB-
Yeatman	PERSON	as hand - writing experts , damns all handwriting ex - perts and then sets himself up as one !

		I concede at once that Mr.
Gervais	PERSON	was wholly in error when he identified the MS. notes in a certain volume of Montaigne 's Essays as being in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's hand , that Mr.
Yeat	PERSON	- man has not proved his case , and that Mrs.
Kintzel	PERSON	is not to be taken seriously .

		I also concede that Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	and Professor ``
Wallace	PERSON	are not handwriting experts , but then , they never posed as such .

		Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	's assertion that the Shakespeare signatures on the deed in the
Guildhall Library	ORGANIZATION	, on the mortgage in the British Museum , on the first page of the will , and on the
Mountjoy	PERSON	affida - vit are the labored writings of a person who had been taught to write only his signature is utterly disproved by his own admissions that young
William	PERSON	attended the
Stratford	LOCATION	school -LRB- knowing how to write was a requisite for admission -RRB- , that he was an actor -LRB- and there - fore had to have the knowledge requisite to reading the script of his parts there were no typewriters then -RRB- , and that these four sig - natures differ so much from one another that -LRB- to ordinary observation -RRB- they hardly look like the writings of the same individual , and by his showing -LRB- in a Table on p. 270 -RRB- that in these signatures alone
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	wrote three kinds of * , of a , of K , of p , etc. .

		An illit - erate person such as Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	depicts writes his name always the same , does not omit the connecting strokes between the letters -LRB- be - cause he does not know their importance -RRB- , introduces no innovations , abbreviations , signs of contraction , or fancy touches , and does not know several forms for each letter .

		He writes always one and the same .

		Inci - dentally , it may be remarked that Mr.
Bax	PERSON	- ter 's facsimiles are very bad , crudely traced , blurred , blotted , the letters broken up , and are of no value whatever for the purpose for which they are ostensibly intended .

		It is also worthy of comment that though Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	professes the greatest contempt for handwrit - ing experts -LRB- he is evidently not acquainted with the admirably scientific work in this field done by such men as
A. S. Osborn	PERSON	and the German graphiographers -RRB- , he has absolutely no hesitation in calling as his witnesses such men as
Wellstood	LOCATION	, the secretary of the Birth - place , Mr.
Smedley	PERSON	, a Baconian , and others , if their testimony is favorable to his side of the case .

		But it is really unreasonable to expect a Baconian or anti- Shakespearean to be logical or consistent .

		In this matter of calligraphy , Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	does not scruple to go even fur - ther .

		Speaking of the Guildhall signature -LRB- he means the British Museum signature -RRB- , he says -LRB- p. 278 -RRB- , on the authority of
Malone	PERSON	, ''
Steevens	PERSON	acknowledged that he placed the a over the signature which has appeared in most -LSB- ?

		some -RSB- reproductions since .

		It was the introduction of this spurious a which caused him to triumphantly declare that it was the trap which caught
Ireland	LOCATION	in his forgeries . ''

		Taught by previous experience we refer to
Malone	PERSON	's '' Inquiry , '' the edition of
1796	DATE	, and find that he has been misquoted .

		On page 118
Malone	PERSON	says : `` My engraver -LSB- sic not
Steevens	PERSON	-RSB- had made a mistake in placing an a over the name . ''

		and on p. 121 he says : `` Your Lordship sees that if Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	and I had maliciously intended to lay a trap for this fabricator -LSB-
Ireland	LOCATION	-RSB- to fall into , we could not have done the business more adroitly .

		But you will readily acquit us of any such intention . ''

		Speaking of the autograph lately discov - ered by Professor
Wallace	PERSON	, an autograph
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 571 whose freedom from conventionality and whose extremely original terminal abbrevia - tion irrefutably demonstrate its owner to have been a rapid and facile penman , Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	makes the false statement that according to Professor
Wallace	PERSON	the body of the affidavit and the deponent 's signature are in one hand and that we therefore now have `` an entire page of his handwriting , '' an opinion that that distinguished scholar never expressed and that no sensible person ever could express .

		* The autographs on the last two -LRB- not `` two last '' -RRB- pages of the poet 's will , and the words '' By me , '' are rejected by Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	as evi - dence of the testator 's skill in penmanship by assuming and pretending to be able to prove that in writing them the writer 's `` blunder - ing hand '' was guided by his attorney .

		In this way Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	'' accounts for the strong resemblance of these signatures to the hand - writing of the will '' a resemblance which , in fact , does not exist .

		Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	finds in these signatures '' all the earmarks '' of having been written in the manner he suggests , but he does not inform us what these earmarks are .

		Anyone who has ever given this sub - ject any scientific consideration knows that a signature written by a guided hand does really have certain definite characteristics -LRB- e.g. absence of curves , abrupt breaks in the strokes , sudden changes in the direction of the strokes , variations in the size and in the shading of the letters , irregularities in align - ment , misplaced shading , variations in pen pressure , evidences of hesitation and con - straint , zigzag lines , etc. ;
cf. Osborn	PERSON	's '' Ques - tioned Documents '' -RRB- of which these signatures show not a trace .

		Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	vents his spleen on all those who have done most to bring
Shakespeare	PERSON	and his writings home to us .

		Thus the late Dr.
Furness	PERSON	, as gentle and lovable and accom - plished a scholar as ever drew breath , is con - stantly spoken of as a pedant , a '' monumental scholar , '' a chauvinist , a man who immortal - ized himself by his folly , etc. .

		Our author is not even above such jejune puerilities as this : ''
Furness	PERSON	, who for nearly forty years dis - turbed the black-lead market by his demand for pencils to write his multitudinous notes . ''

		-LRB- Wonderful pencils to have been able to do that ! -RRB-

		Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	has as little regard for the * While writing the above , I wrote to Mr.
Baxter	PERSON	for his authority for the opinion he attributed to Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	, and received the following reply : '' I conclude that I have done an injustice to Prof.
Wallace	PERSON	, for I find that he has expressed an opinion that does not warrant my strictures , and that it was the late Durning-Lawrence who declared them -LSB- the depo - sition and the signature -RSB- to be holographic .

		How I could have been so misled is explainable only on the hypothesis that it was by some one of the many reviewers who quoted the opin - ion of Lawrence and misapplied it . ''


S. A. T.	PERSON	rules of grammar and composition as he has for persons or for facts .

		The book is execra - bly written .

		A few illustrations will not be amiss : '' One of the studies to which I de - voted much labor and research , and prepared it for the press . ''

		`` We will consider the biography by Knight , which forms an entire volume of his edition of the
Shakespeare Works	ORGANIZATION	, who , to lend importance to his sub - ject , which he realizes we know little about , devotes ample space at the outset to prove that he was of heroic extraction . ''

		`` A biog - rapher may -LRB- with facility -RRB- dispose of impor - tant questions .

		.

		and readers confused by a plethora of verbiage . ''

		`` When visited on one occasion by

SAMUEL A. TANNENBAUM	PERSON	.

		A CURIOSITY IN LITERARY HISTORY .

		* When a woman does anything amazing , prov - erbial wisdom tells us : ''
Cherchez Fhomme	PERSON	. ''

		In the case of her '' History of Italian Litera - ture , ''
Miss Florence Trail	ORGANIZATION	has herself gener - ously supplied the missing link .

		One of the last chapters of her book is an eight-page eulogy of the clerical polygraph ,
Cesare Cantu	PERSON	.

		This author , whose bulky literary - baggage usually receives a scant paragraph in histories of literature , wrote too much to be accurate in anything : Like Margites of old , `` he knew all things , but he knew them all badly . ''

		He was , moreover , blinded by relig - ious prejudice .

		His '' History of Italian Lit - erature , '' drawn from his `` Universal History , '' appears to be the vade mecum of the present author .

		The following is
Miss Trail	ORGANIZATION	's plan for her work : '' To those -LSB- writers -RSB- of the first impor - tance I have devoted a biographical sketch and an analysis .

		Those of the second class are * A HISTORY OF ITALIAN LITERATURE .

		By
Florence Trail	ORGANIZATION	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
Richard G. Badger	PERSON	.

		572
Dec. 9	DATE	represented by a biographical sketch and a translation .

		The third class have only the sketch ; and the fourth are mentioned in pass - ing , or in foot-notes . ''

		Thus it appears that to Miss Trail 's mind biography is of primary consequence in literary history .

		Unfortu - nately , her '' sketches '' are by no means always accurate , and rarely show any effort to estab - lish the relation between biographical details and literary production .

		Following Cantu , by whom '' never in a single instance is an author 's work separated from his character '' she is at great pains to tell us that this man 's life was blameless , this one 's stained with immorality .

		She is rather too generous in distributing the orange-blossom wreath of purity .

		Suffice it to say that castae mores were not as common in the Renaissance , for instance , as her account of certain authors would imply .

		This mania for shielding her heroes leads her into some strange interpreta - tions .

		Thus she tells us that
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's private life was wholly immaculate .

		-LRB-
Cantu	PERSON	gave his unqualified approval to only two writers ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Manzoni	PERSON	. -RRB-

		Hence she is at a loss to understand the bitter reproaches of Beatrice at the summit of the mountain of Purgatory .

		She interprets the '' dark wood '' at the begin - ning of the poem as '' the moral and political disorder of
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		For her the three beasts who obstruct the poet 's passage are '' envious
Florence	LOCATION	, '' '' proud
France	LOCATION	, '' and '' the Roman curia , whose supreme characteristic is ava - rice . ''

		The usual interpretation would give these lines a direct bearing on the poet 's per - sonal experience , the dark wood represents worldliness , and the beasts bad habits that prevent his reform .

		The old commentators interpreted the latter as luxury , pride , and avarice ; but the most modern view , which w f ould make
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's meaning still more per - sonal , is that the beasts represent incontinence , violence , and fraud .

		It will be remembered that the wolf of incontinence proved the great - est obstacle to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's progress .

		However it may be , few scholars contend to-day that the poet 's errors were all intellectual .

		Cantu and
Miss Trail	ORGANIZATION	forget that to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's mind unchas - tity was a venial sin compared to heresy .

		Per - haps they would exonerate him from both .

		A serious error in the interpretation of the poem is Miss Trail 's statement that Dante '' had not been guilty of the crimes of the Inferno , .

		.

		but he has committed -LRB- as who has not ? -RRB-

		the sins of the Purgatorio . ''

		Once more she for - gets that the sins punished are the same ; only failure to repent condemns souls to hell .

		Another exasperating trait of
Miss Trail	ORGANIZATION	's is the unreserved statement as fact of hypo - theses which please her .

		For instance , she declares that
Petrarch	PERSON	's lady-love was
Madame Laura de Sade	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This object of his -LSB- Pe - trarch 's -RSB- life-long affection was not only a married woman , but continued to live in peace and happiness with her husband , and became the mother of eleven children . ''

		And
Madame Laura de Sade	ORGANIZATION	receives the well-earned eulogy for her virtue .

		As for the analyses , they deal with well known works , and are rarely used to bring out the distinctive features of the author 's thought .

		The translations are fair , sometimes happy ; but , with the analyses , they seem meant to take the place of any general esti - mate of the author 's contribution to the thought of his time or of his relations to others .

		A large number of writers are '' mentioned in passing . ''

		It would have been better to omit them altogether , for the information given is scarcely more than could be found in a pocket encyclopaedia .

		It will be noted that
Miss Trail	ORGANIZATION	says nothing about critical estimates in her plan .

		This would seem to be the least important part of a history of literature .

		As a matter of fact , such criticism as one finds is thrown out in the form of obiter dicta .

		The two examples which follow will perhaps spare the reader vain re - grets .

		The first deals with
Boccaccio	PERSON	-LRB- ana - thema to Cantu -RRB- , who is accorded a '' sketch '' and a brief statement of the subjects of his works . ''

		It is most deplorable that the subject matter of these ' Tales ' has made it necessary for the literary world to relegate them to an ignominious obscurity .

		Boccaccio is now known simply as the author of a book which can not be read : too immoral to be fairly criticised ; too offensive for vituperation .

		The only endurable ' Tales ' are those of '
Lisa	PERSON	's love for
King Alphonso /	ORGANIZATION	and ' The Marquis of
Saluzzo	PERSON	and Griselda . ' ''

		The second judgment is like unto the first .

		The writer has just summarized a story of Ban - dello 's in which a woman 's virtue stands the test .

		She concludes : '' This story of the complete triumph of a brave , high-spirited woman sets the ball in motion which is to produce the modern novel .

		It will not stop until it has completely annihilated all the
Tom Joneses	PERSON	and the
Roderick Randoms	PERSON	. ''

		On finishing
Miss Trail	ORGANIZATION	's book , we have but one regret : if only she had simply translated
Cantu	PERSON	's '' History , '' she would have amused us still more .

		BENJ .

		M. WOODBRIDGE .

		The first volume of an ''
Oxford Treasury	ORGANIZATION	of French Literature , '' compiled by Mr.
A. G. Latham	PERSON	, and extending from the '' Song of Ro - land '' to the '' Memoirs '' of
St. Simon	LOCATION	, is soon to appear from the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 573 RECENT FICTION .

		* With '' These Twain '' Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	emerges from his occupation with other mat - ters and finishes , for the time being at least , his great achievement , the '' Clayhanger '' series .

		The completed work now stands up in contemporary fiction something as a great cathedral stands up above a crowded town .

		It is unlike a cathedral in that it has very little that is religious about it , but it is like it in that it is a great monument of popular life with one definite purpose and a thousand details .

		One can spend an hour here or there in looking at this or that piece of carving , bit of sculpture , problem of architecture ; or one can take in the unity of the whole .

		Mr.
Ben	PERSON	- nett has already given us a book about
Edwin Clayhanger	PERSON	and another about
Hilda Less	PERSON	- ways ; this third gives us the union of the two .

		The book has a unity in itself , and anyone may read it with pleasure and comprehension by itself .

		But of course it begins with what has been given before .

		It is the same
Edwin	PERSON	, grown to manhood and still a boy in some ways -LRB- just as
Hilda	LOCATION	is in some ways still a girl -RRB- ; he is , as before , cautious and hesitating yet managing to be successful , longing for ro - mance yet resigned to an ordinary existence , grandiose in conception and slip-shod in exe - cution , making everything do while it would and waiting for things to turn up , timid and proud , meditative and judicial , and yet gener - ally saying , '' What does it matter ? ''

		- a rebel against authority yet outwardly apologetic , vowing he would never again do what he was about to do the next day , wishing for adven - ture yet devoted to his home and dependent on its hundred minor comforts , undecided for months and acting on the spur of a moment 's impulse , altogether a very inconsistent and human person .

		So , also , is it the same
Hilda	PERSON	.

		Not beautiful apparently , originally an '' ugly young woman '' and still with the same olive complexion and black hair and thick eye - brows , but always attractive , full of vitality , of a passionate vibrating voice , with sparkling eyes , making cheerily the most outrageous remarks that ever woman had made in the Five Towns , hating
Edwin	PERSON	for opposing her and understanding in a flash that he loved her , a woman of most tantalizing psychology , only part woman in fact and part child , part sibyl , yet always tingling with life , bent on having her OAvn way because she knew better than he what was best , over-valuing what she had not and depreciating what was hers , pos - * THESE TWAIN .

		By
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	,
New York	LOCATION	:
George H. Doran Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		sessed by irresistible desires and acquiescing in a commonplace round of affairs , on the whole , quite as inconsistent and human as her husband .

		Being married , and settled down in Bur - sley , these two were , like many other mar - ried people , intent on their own particular business and their own particular desires , as well as on the life in common which is the necessity of married life .

		Edwin is the clearer figure in fact the story is chiefly told from his standpoint , and his position is plain : he is comfortably situated and wishes to remain so .

		The excitements and enthusiasms and revolts of youth have passed , and he has settled down into a prosperous business man who has few desires beyond business success and home comfort .

		Hilda is not so obvious , but whatever she is she is something altogether different from that .

		She is continually reaching out , and always seeing things that she wants more than the things she has got .

		The two are in love even , it would seem , when they passed Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's three-year limit , but neither is so much in love as to sympathize deeply with the other 's desires or habits or ways of doing or looking at things .

		We might easily enough suppose that there is no more definite idea controlling the devel - opment of this book than the conception of these very interesting characters in the given situation , and the willingness to have them act in a natural and characteristic way .

		That is enough for many a novelist .

		Tourguenieff used to say , we are told by Mr.
James	PERSON	, that his idea was to think of interesting people , being sure that they would behave in an inter - esting way .

		That is an ultra-realistic view , it says , Whatever happens is a story .

		There are people who seem to have some such idea to-day , especially those writers who devote themselves to telling the life-story of one or another .

		On the other hand , however , there are those whose handling of their action is controlled in some way or other .

		Some are interested in the working out of some definite course of events bound up in a mystery , or an adventure , or an achievement .

		Some develop their course of events so as to present some definite idea or theory .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	has not of late been one of those who cared much for a definite course of action ; nor is he , so in this his latest book .

		Nor does he as a rule use his action as the form of an idea .

		In this case , it is true , the action is definitely modelled by a clear conception , and that conception a fundamental proposition -LRB- it might seem -RRB- to married life .

		The first announcement of the book , and its title , show that it deals with 574 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 9	DATE	marriage .

		Incidents in the story , so far as they have anything to do with each other , are illustrations or developments of this idea .

		The end of the book is a discovery -LRB- by
Edwin	PERSON	-RRB- of the controlling principle which has so far enabled him to be successful in married life .

		It might be added that the publishers tell us that '' Readers new to
Bennett	PERSON	.

		.

		will find here their own married lives interpreted to themselves . ''

		It is not clear whether those who have read
Bennett	PERSON	before will know bet - ter than to look for an interpretation of mar - riage or anything else ; but the idea of the publishers seems clearly to be that this recital of the married life of
Edwin	PERSON	and
Hilda	PERSON	was modified and formed by a desire on the part of the author to present the fundamentals of the marriage state .

		It is true that he deals with one marriage only , and that he alludes to two other marriages as being in
Edwin	LOCATION	's mind very different affairs .

		But the thing he presents with most conviction is
Edwin	PERSON	's discovery at the end of the book .

		These books begin with
Clayhanger	PERSON	at the bridge , and they end there ; they begin with Clayhanger looking forward in life , and they end twenty -
five years later	DATE	with his looking back on it .

		What he thinks at the beginning is very indefinite , but Avhat he thinks at the end is very definite .

		At the beginning he wants to get out and be himself ; at the end he sees that there is much that is wrong in the world and that '' right living '' means the acceptance of injustice and the excusing of the inexcusa - ble .

		He sees that people who are married must often yield to what seems obviously great injustice or unreason on the part of others merely because whether they be unjust , unreasonable , or whatever else , they are the loved ones .

		This was no novelty . ''

		It was banal ; it was commonplace ; it was what everyone knew . ''

		Clayhanger had known it before , but not until now did he fully real - ize it .

		This seems to give the idea that marriage is a great and passionate war ; its bed-rock foundation being the idea of each for himself .

		Love and hate seem not only consistent but undistinguishable .

		Its partners are indis - pensable to each other and intolerable .

		They are irrational , and they think each other so ; yet when they kiss each other they are recon - ciled to what in the abstract they can not bear .

		Such a view of marriage , thoroughly realized , made a part of one , felt in one 's bones , become a dominant factor in one 's domestic cosmos , would it seems make life much easier for persons of incompatible tempers who had got into the habit of living together .

		But if anyone is inclined to see in the expe - rience of
Hilda and Edwin	PERSON	an interpretation of his own marriage -LRB- or possibly hers , though the book seems written from the masculine standpoint -RRB- , it will be well to remember that in older days Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	'' took a malicious and frigid pleasure , as I always do , -LSB- he adds -RSB- in setting down facts which are opposed to accepted sentimental falsities . ''

		The facts of '' These Twain '' are certainly opposed to some accepted sentimental falsities ; but it may be that , fact or no fact , they do not constitute a generalization .

		Seekers after light on the dark river will probably find this interpreta - tion of the problem of marriage as serious and profound as Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's interpretation of the problem of evil in the world .

		Many people can not see reason or justice in hus - band or wife and yet still love and like to please each other .

		In like manner , people who do wrong incomprehensibly are yet driven to do so by an irresistible force , namely , they like to please themselves .

		In both cases they do what they want to do .

		This comes very near to `` A is A , '' the princi - ple of identity which is the foundation of logical thought .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	would probably disclaim teach - ing .

		When he wishes to teach he writes a `` pocket philosophy . ''

		In his novels he tells of people who lived and acted thus and thus .

		His telling is always interesting .

		Sometimes he is objective , as they say , and tells how everything and everybody looked .

		He always seems to know , though it does not always occur to him to say much about it .

		Some - times he is satirical , indeed , he always seems a little outside the people he tells us of , never quite to sympathize with them ; and in such a position one can hardly help being a little satirical now and then .

		Sometimes he is ex - travagant , like the
Bennett	PERSON	of old times , the
Bennett	PERSON	of `` Hugo '' or `` The Grand Babylon Hotel '' ; and that , after all , is only another way of being satirical .

		Most often , however , he is telling us of the inner life of one or another .

		It is because he knows these things that he can tell the story .

		He knows what
Edwin Clayhanger	PERSON	thought and wanted , and why he did things : and he knows also about
Hilda	PERSON	, though not quite so well ; and he knows about the others , for of course the book is full of living real people .

		How he knows these mysteries of the human heart no one can tell ; but that he does know is clear from the con - sistency , the firmness , of the general view .

		He does not say , '' Life is like this , '' but we admit that that life must have been like that .

		There is possibly one thing more to say .

		We can imagine that a novelist should know
1915	DATE	-RSB- 575 precisely how his people looked , and how their surroundings looked , and what every - body did .

		We can imagine , too , that a nov - elist should know everything that his people felt , thought , wished , and so on , in fact , that is part of the game .

		But given the sec - ond supposition , does a novelist do the fair thing by us if he withholds information con - cerning certain very large elements in the lives he is presenting to us ?

		In this book we are told much , but much is withheld .

		We have very slight knowledge of how
Edwin	PERSON	conducted his business ; we are told that he prospered and became well off , but it seems astonishing that such should be the case .

		We also have the very slightest notion of what this couple thought of religious matters ; it is evident that they thought something , and we should say from general principles and pre - vious knowledge that they thought the matter of some importance .

		But we know little of it .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	presumably feels that he has told all that is necessary for normally informed peo - ple about their relations as man and wife ; but in that matter people are so unexpected that common inference is easily at fault .

		So there are considerable gaps in our acquaintance with the situation .

		Business , religion , sex , these are likely to be dominant forces in the personal life ; it may be that the result Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	presents was caused by reasons of which he does not tell us .

		But in spite of all such things , the book , as well as the completed trilogy , is a great achievement .

		It gives us a sense of reality , of life as we find it , difficult to get elsewhere .

		And it gives that strange sense of satisfaction with life and approval of it that is a result of great art .

		BIOGRAPHY AND HISTORY .

		Excellent for its presentation of the real
Clara Barton	PERSON	, as portrayed by her own pen , is Dr.
Percy H. Epler	PERSON	's biography of that famous woman the authorized biography and a work bearing every mark of faithful industry on the part of its author . ''

		The Life of Clara Barton '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is not unlike Sir
Edward Cook	PERSON	's recent account of Flor - ence
Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	, being largely autobiographic in method , and nearly as substantial in bulk , though brought within the limits of a single volume .

		But the resemblance is not confined to externals ; the same keen observation and gift of humorous ex - pression appear in the quoted letters and diaries of each .

		Laughter must have been a necessity to both , else the strain of the horrors they forced themselves to face would have been unendurable .


Clarissa Harlowe Barton	PERSON	it is amusing to think of her having been christened ''
Clarissa Har	PERSON	- lowe '' died three years ago , and this interval her biographer has put to good use in making as complete and as accurate as possible his record of the great work done by the founder of the Amer - ican branch of the
Red Cross Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		Many por - traits of `` the Angel of the Battle Field ' '' are given , with numerous other illustrations . ''

		The Passing of the Armies '' is not a pacifist tract , but '' an account of the final campaign of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the
Potomac	LOCATION	, based upon personal reminiscences of the
Fifth Army Corps	ORGANIZATION	, '' and its , author is General
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain	PERSON	, , whose death as the book was about to go to the printer made necessary its final revision by his children .

		The extraordinary range of the author 's talents adds to the interest of this his last work as a writer .

		Perhaps he is best remembered as president of
Bowdoin College	ORGANIZATION	from
1876	DATE	to
1883	DATE	> where also he had distinguished himself as teacher and lecturer .

		Theology , languages , literature , law - all these he seems to have taught with success ; and in the larger world he won fame as a military commander , filled a position of some importance in the civil service , visited
Italy	LOCATION	and
Egypt	LOCATION	in later life , and from time to time acquitted hinb - self most creditably as a public speaker .

		Thus , - his contribution to our Civil War history is more than the record of a mere soldier ; it is a schol - arly and readable book , with the fresh interest belonging to personal recollections of great events .

		Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	writes a short bio - graphical introduction , and the book is published - , with portraits and maps , by the firm of which ha is head .

		Life is felt by many to be too short to admit of even a single rapid reading of
Gibbon	PERSON	's great his - torical work , and to these a book like Mr.
H. B. Cotterill	PERSON	's '' Medieval Italy '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- offers a welcome epitome of later Roman history , with much additional matter to illustrate and make more interesting the chronicle of the thousand years -LRB- 305-1313 -RRB- covered by the survey .

		As its title-page announces , the book contains not only '' a brief historical narrative , '' but also '' chapters on great episodes and personalities and on sub - jects connected with religion , art , and literature . '' ''

		To each of the five parts into which the subject naturally divides itself is prefixed '' a brief account of the political events of the period in question , '' '' and these summaries , the author hopes , `` will enable the reader to frame , or perhaps I should ' say to arrange in chronological order and per - spective , the contents of those chapters in which ' with a freer hand I sketch certain interesting episodes and personalities , endeavouring by means : of quotation and description to add a little in the - way of local colour and portraiture . ''

		x Thus the j drum-and-trumpet part of the story is made not to intrude upon the more richly significant and far more readable portions of the work .

		A profu - sion of illustrations , some in photogravure , with tables , maps , footnotes , and index , contribute iir their several ways to the usefulness and : interest of the book .

		576 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 9	DATE	TRAVEL AND DESCRIPTION .

		A devoted Meredithian , designated on the title - page with no superfluity of printer 's ink as ''
F. E. Green	PERSON	, '' gives us an excellent descriptive volume on
Meredith	PERSON	's country , with frequent quo - tations from the novelist 's letters and a fine series of illustrations -LRB- photogravures and line draw - ings -RRB- , including a '' view from
George Meredith	PERSON	's window , '' ''
George Meredith	PERSON	's chalet , '' and '' the Crossways , '' by Mr.
Elliott Seabrooke	PERSON	. ''

		The Sur - rey Hills , '' as the book is called , is not exclusively or even chiefly devoted to
Meredith	LOCATION	, but certain chapters , as '' On Box Hill with
Meredith	PERSON	, '' and '' Over Ranmore to
Diana	PERSON	's
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' take their note from
Diana	ORGANIZATION	's creator .

		Elsewhere there is an abundance of wide-ranging allusion and miscel - laneous dialogue to diversify the description , which itself is generously interlarded with local history .

		On an early page a misprint that will vex the author , and that he will be glad to have corrected in later editions , gives us '' the dramatic extension of the old peasant stock , as its vitality was low - ered by the successive general Enclosure Acts , '' where '' extension '' should undoubtedly be '' ex - tinction . ''

		As an informal and attractive guide to some of the more interesting parts of
Surrey	LOCATION	, the book could hardly be better .

		-LRB-
Frederick Warne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- '' It ai n't much trouble for me to take care of my family , '' said the
New England	LOCATION	farmer 's hired man ; '' I git 'em all under cover every time I put on my hat . ''

		With such characteristic bits of shrewdly humorous Yankee talk does Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	enliven the pages of his latest '' High - ways and Byways '' book , being the seventh in the series and devoted to
New England	LOCATION	.

		Not a sys - tematic and consequently unentertaining guide - book have we here , any more than in the preceding volumes of the set ; but rather a collection of sketches , full of character and not seldom redolent of the soil .

		The chapters on ``
Artemus Ward	PERSON	's Town , '' `` Old Put 's Country , '' ``
August	DATE	in the
Berkshire Hills	LOCATION	, '' and '' Nantucket Days '' are not half bad , to put it mildly .

		As is his custom , the author profusely illustrates his book with camera glimpses of life , both still and of a less reposeful sort , all admirably typical of the region and people concerned .

		It is cheering to find so much of rural
New England	LOCATION	still unspoiled , uncorrupted , un - sophisticated . ''

		Highways and Byways of
New England	LOCATION	'' is published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Luckily there are no such melancholy associa - tions connected with the many beautiful illustra - tions that go to the making of ''
Paris	LOCATION	, Past and Present '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- as link themselves to-day with similar representations of many French cities not a hundred miles from
Paris	LOCATION	.

		This notable collec - tion of colored and uncolored drawings , etchings , lithographs , and other products of artistic skill , not far from two hundred in number , is edited by Mr.
Charles Holme	PERSON	, with text by Mr.
E. A. Tay	PERSON	- lor , and constitutes a special autumn number of '' The Intel-national Studio . ''

		Old prints and a great number of later artists have been drawn upon , so that we have glimpses of the French capital from
1539	DATE	to the present time , grouped under three headings : '' The Rivers , Bridges and Quays , '' '' Old Streets , Houses and Markets , '' and '' Public Buildings , Monuments and Gardens . ''

		Brief preliminary surveys from Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's pen introduce the several sections , and a general intro - duction follows the table of contents .

		Issued in paper covers , the work offers opportunity to exercise judgment and taste in giving it a suitable binding .

		Travel and adventure , hunting and sight-seeing , in all latitudes and longitudes , are brought within the covers of a good-sized volume edited by Mr.
A. G. Lewis	PERSON	and entitled '' Sport , Travel , and Adventure '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	:
T. Fisher Unwin	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Fifty - four books by writers of wanderlustig propensi - ties have been drawn upon for suitable selections and illustrations , and the whole is a lively collec - tion of travellers ' tales .

		Satisfactory though the editor 's selections are in the main , it is somewhat surprising to find many topics represented by writers that are by no means the ones first sug - gesting themselves as the likeliest to be quoted from .

		Arctic exploration , for instance , gives us not a line from Captain
Peary	PERSON	's books ; African adventure calls forth nothing from
Livingstone	PERSON	's or
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's noted chronicles ; Swiss mountain - climbing is unillustrated by anything from Whym - per ; and though forbidden
Tibet	LOCATION	is opened to our view , it is not by Mr.
Henry Savage Landor	PERSON	.

		But we have passages from
Colonel Roosevelt	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	and Miss
Annie S. Peck	PERSON	, and many other hardy adventurers , and we must not complain .

		Mr.
Albert G. Robinson	PERSON	, who has both visited and written about
the Philippines	LOCATION	and
Cuba	LOCATION	and
Porto Rico	LOCATION	, adds another book to his list in ``
Cuba	LOCATION	, Old and New '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , a survey of the salient points in the island 's history , with chap - ters of a descriptive and otherwise instructive character , including information useful to the tour - ist who at this season is tempted to escape the northern rigors by a sojourn in the Pearl of the Antilles .


Cuba	LOCATION	's needs and imperfections are not overlooked by the author , whose twenty years of more or less immediate contact with its affairs enti - tle him to speak understandingly . ''

		Full assur - ance of peace and order , '' he believes . ''

		will come cnly when the people of the island , whether plant - ers or peasants , see clearly the difference between a government conducted in their interest and a government conducted by Cubans along Spanish lines . ''

		Photographs by Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	illustrate the volume .


New Mexico	LOCATION	's old mission churches are disap - pearing with alarming rapidity , far more from the ravages of man than from those of nature ; and hence Dr.
L. Bradford	PERSON	Prince does well to issue at this time his long-contemplated volume on '' Spanish Mission Churches of
New Mexico	LOCATION	'' -LRB- The Torch Press -RRB- .

		Much more interesting he believes these churches to be than the similar structures of
California	LOCATION	, about which so many books have been written , while the riches of the
Sunshine State	ORGANIZATION	in this particular remain practi - callv unknown .

		Half a hundred or more of these
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 577 relics of a romantic past are pictured by the camera and described by the pen in his book , which has also an abundance of historical infor - mation such as few besides the author could have supplied .

		But he adds no index to this rich store of material .

		Otherwise the work makes a most favorable impression .

		NATURE AND OUT-DOOR LIFE .

		No one having any knowledge of birdless
Italy	LOCATION	will refuse to commend the purpose of Mr.
Ernest Harold Baynes	PERSON	's `` Wild Bird Guests : How to Entertain Them '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		It has long been the author 's belief that '' the final solution of the prob - lem of wild bird conservation lay , not in the enact - ing of more or better laws , necessary as those laws are , but in the creation of such an interest in , and love for birds , that a very large majority of peo - ple will have not only no desire to destroy them , but will actually fight to prevent their destruc - tion ; and that the birds themselves will become as safe as valuable private property . ''

		Well - informed chapters on our feathered friends , their habits , their enemies , their value in more senses than one , and how to promote their well-being , follow the hortatory foreword ; and numerous photogravure illustrations , many from the author 's own camera , are interspersed .


Meriden	LOCATION	,
N. H.	PERSON	, '' the Bird Village '' and the author 's home , plays a prominent part in the book , which ends with useful instructions how to f onn bird clubs and thus add to the bird villages throughout the coun - try .

		Mr.
Baynes	PERSON	evidently knows how to make friends of the birds , and he seems likely also to make friends of his readers .

		No extraordinary experiences of a wild-fowler , no record-breaking `` bags '' of mallard , widgeon , teal , pochard , pintail , and their kind , no freezing nights in an open boat , heroically survived by this same hardy fowler in his valorous campaigns against the feathered tribes that sweep over the waters of estuaries and marshes - nothing what - ever of this sort will be found in Mr.
W. H. Hud	PERSON	- son 's `` Adventures among Birds '' -LRB- Kennerley -RRB- , tlte ornithographic record of a bird-lover , not the san - guinary chronicle of a bird-killer .

		He regards birds as '' vertebrates and relations , with knowing , emotional , thinking orains like ours , and with senses like ours , only brighter . ''

		Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	's literary style has been warmly praised by others besides Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	, who says of him , furthermore , that '' he is the finest living observer , and the greatest living lover of bird and animal life , and of Nature in her moods . ''

		A few of his chapter-headings , such as '' Bird Music . '' ''

		In a
Green Country	ORGANIZATION	in Quest of Rare Songsters , '' `` Ava - lon and a Blackbird , '' and '' The Marsh AVarbler 's Music , '' will here sufficiently indicate the char - acter of his book .

		A word of perhaps not super - fluous caution from the publishers admonishes the reader not to confuse the author with that other writer of note , Mr.
William Henry Hudson	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Emerson Hough	PERSON	, the author of '' Out of Doors '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , seems to have hunted and camped and communed with nature from
Mexico	LOCATION	's troubled border to
Alaska	LOCATION	's icy strand , and in his new book he communicates in racy and pictur - esque language the ripe results of his varied expe - riences in the wild .

		Both the broad fundamentals of successful camping and the superstructure of minute details are to be found in his useful and entertaining manual .

		Among other notable chap - ters mention should be made of his dissertations on '' The Woman in Camp , '' '' Getting Lost and What to Do about it , '' and '' The Faculty of Observa - tion . ''

		Here are his concluding remarks upon the properly constructed camp stew : ''
Fed	ORGANIZATION	upon this manner of manna or manna of manner , as they would say in
New York	LOCATION	you shall go forth and prevail mightily in the land .

		As to what such a stew as this would mean to a party of tired coon hunters at
midnight	TIME	's holy hour hush , man , let us not speak of sacred matters ! ''

		Both novel and practical in its scheme is Mr.
Leicester Bodine Holland	PERSON	's horticultural manual , `` The Garden Bluebook '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- .

		Peren - nials only , as is indicated in a subtitle , are consid - ered by the author ; but as nearly two hundred of these are included in the book the proposed garden need not lack for richness and variety .

		A folding , linen-backed , colored chart begins the volume and shows with much ingenuity in disposition of hues and scale-markings how and when and where to expend your horticultural energies in order to pro- duce the most striking and picturesque effects .

		Other charts and plans follow , and the body of the book is devoted to ' descriptions and illustrations of the principal perennials , in alphabetic order on the right-hand pages , with blank forms , on the left-hand , to be filled in with observations and additions by the gardener owning the book .

		A many-hued perennial garden almost exhales its fragrance on the cover , and the more subdued half - tone lavishly illustrates the pages of the book .

		The Christmas holidays might be given to less profitable and also less pleasant uses than the planning of one 's garden of perennials with the help of '' The Garden Bluebook . ''

		MISCELLANEOUS .

		Not as an argument for military preparedness , we are glad to note , does Mr.
John Martin Ham	PERSON	- mond offer to view the dismantled and crumbling condition of our older fortresses , but as a study in what is historic and often picturesque . ''

		Quaint and Historic Forts of
North America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lippin	PERSON	- cott -RRB- he entitles his splendid volume , a work simi - lar in wealth of descriptive and illustrative matter to his '' Colonial Mansions of
Maryland	LOCATION	and Dela - ware . ''

		It is on the
Atlantic	LOCATION	seaboard , naturally , that he finds the greater number of our weather - worn fortifications , though the
Alamo	LOCATION	,
Fort Lara	LOCATION	- mie ,
Fort Vancouver	LOCATION	, and other storied redoubts in the South ,
West	LOCATION	, and North , claim their meas - ure of attention .

		Of our `` most important En - glish military work of early Colonial days , '' Fort Independence , in
Boston	LOCATION	harbor , he writes , with an eye for the picturesque rather than for the bare reality , that '' on any bright and cheering day throngs can be found at the old fort , of various classes and of widely sundered poles of thought . ''

		On some holidays this may be true , but 578 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 9	DATE	many a bright and cheering day of labor finds the fort not at all thronged with visitors of any class or of any pole of thought whatsoever .

		Good illus - trations in abundance adorn the book .

		Very wisely has it been decided to issue in book - form and with additions Miss
Lilian D. Wald	PERSON	's recent ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' articles on '' The
House	ORGANIZATION	in Henry Street '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , the story of a vocation or mission promptly and gladly accepted some five and twenty years ago by a young graduate of a
New York	LOCATION	training school for nurses , and leading to more beneficent , more wide-reaching results than could have been dreamed of at the outset .

		In a straightforward manner that devoted friend of suffering and unfortunate humanity , as it toils and struggles on the East Side of our cosmopoli - tan metropolis , tells the story of her labors amid that grimy and often cheerless environment ; and the story divides itself into chapters on srfch varied though related themes as the establishment of visiting nurses , the relations between the nurse and the community , children and play , children who work , the handicapped child , youth and trades unions , weddings and social halls , friends of Rus - sian freedom , social forces , and new Americans in their relation to our institutions and policies .

		A number of noted philanthropists , such as
Madame Breshkovsky	ORGANIZATION	, Prince
Kropotkin	PERSON	, Mr.
Ernest Crosby	PERSON	, and
Father McGlynn	PERSON	, pass across the pages of the book and add to its interest .

		Its message of good will to all mankind is one espe - cially suited to the season .

		Mr.
Abraham Phil	PERSON	- lips 's etchings and drawings , often of an appealing nature in their representations of the joys and sorrows of the poor , supplement very fittingly the photographic illustrations that help to convey the book 's message and lesson .

		Near the end of
July of last year	DATE	, with no slight - est foreboding of the troubled days so soon to follow , Miss
Anne Hollingsworth Wharton	PERSON	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	landed at
Plymouth	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, to pur - sue the studies that have now resulted in a pleasing volume entitled '' English Ancestral Homes of Noted Americans '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The Washing - tons , the Franklins , the
Penns	LOCATION	, with other families of lesser note , are here traced back to their trans - atlantic cradles , and the faithful camera has been put to good use in conveying a vivid impression of these remote origins .

		The book is , as the author had hoped it would be , an interesting reminder of '' the rock from whence we were hewn and the pit from whence we were digged . ''

		A wealth of his - torical and genealogical lore is contained between the book 's covers , and especial mention may be made of certain fresh material concerning Frank - lin 's visit to
Ecton	LOCATION	, the home of his ancestors . '

		Mr.
Lewis Spence	PERSON	says he has endeavored so to arrange his '' Hero Tales and Legends of the Rhine '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- that they may `` illustrate a Rhine journey from sea to source the manner in which the majority of visitors to
Germany	LOCATION	will make the voyage and to this end the tales have been marshalled in such form that a reader sitting on the deck of a Rhine steamer may be able to peruse the legends relating to the various locali - ties in their proper order as he passes them . ''

		Why , then does he place the story of the Lorelei at the very beginning and not later when the high - lands , where the Loreleiberg may be supposed to stand , have been reached by the Rhine-ascending traveller ?

		Diligence in collecting and narrative skill in relating these legends are shown by the compiler , who claims for his book more critical a , nd selective acumen and more of the romantic Rhine atmosphere than are to be found in other similar compilations .

		The very places concerned have been visited in quest of the most authentic form of each tale , '' and only the most character - istic and original versions and variants .

		.

		have gained admittance to the collection . ''

		It is cer - tainly a rich and readable volume , and it has a map of the Rhine country , a combined index and glossary , and many illustrations -LRB- in color and otherwise -RRB- by an artist in evident sympathy with the purpose of the book .

		Not the least part of the burden of the present war is borne by the
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	, and its sendees have never before been offered so generously or to so vast a body of sufferers .

		Timely , therefore , is the appearance of a book giving a more compre - hensive account of this organization and its labors for humanity than has hitherto been available in English . ''

		Under the
Red Cross Flag	ORGANIZATION	at Home and Abroad '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is written by Miss
Mabel T. Boardman	PERSON	,
Chairman National	ORGANIZATION	.


Relief Board	ORGANIZATION	,
American Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	, and naturally con - cerns itself especially with the American branch of the society , dating from
1881	DATE	and claiming
Clara Barton	PERSON	as its first leader and presiding offi - cer .

		The record of its beneficent labors in fire and flood , tornado and earthquake , war and pesti - lence , is traced with considerable detail down to and including its activities in the war now devas - tating
Europe	LOCATION	and extending even beyond its borders .

		The revised Treaty of
Geneva	LOCATION	is ap - pended , and illustrations from photographs show the varied nature of the demands made upon Red Qross workers .

		With Dr.
Epler	PERSON	's life of
Clara Barton	PERSON	and
Miss Boardman	PERSON	's history of the
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	, both books of the present season , we have small excuse if we remain ignorant of what this charitable association has done in the past and is doing in the present . ''

		It is commonly charged against philosophers that they have little patriotism .

		It does not occur to those who prefer the charge that philosophers may have something better about which to concern themselves . ''

		Thus writes Dr.
Frederic Rowland Marvin	PERSON	on an early page of his '' Fireside Papers '' -LRB-
Sherman	PERSON	-RRB- , and the passage well illustrates the tone and temper of the book .

		Here , as in the same author 's '' Excursions of a Book-Lover , '' high thinking and ripened wisdom mingle en joy ably with quaint and curious lore of various kinds , with criticism of books and men , and with quotation and translation of poetry from divers sources .

		Of Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	he well says that '' he has writ - ten too much for the years of his literary pil - qrimage thus far .

		We have from his pen some good things , more that are poor , and none yet that take commanding place and give promise of
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 579 enduring . ''

		With such themes as the loneliness of genius , the philosophic temper , human derelicts , Maupassant and
Poe	PERSON	, and the River of Oblivion , the book holds our willing attention .

		In these days when the bottom seems to be fall - ing out of everything , it is no work of supereroga - tion to endeavor to fasten with certainty upon those things that are firm and imperishable .

		Such an attempt is made by Dr.
Hugh Black	PERSON	in his con - tribution to this season 's books , a modest volume entitled `` The New World '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- , four chap - ters of which have already found favor with magazine-readers . ''

		The purpose of this book , '' he explains , '' is to understand the causes of unrest in the religion of our time , and to enforce the need of restatement , and if possible to indicate the lines of the probable statement ... The most I seek to do is to suggest for a transition time like this a point of view that may enable some to hold their footing . ''

		Accordingly , the discussion has to do with the spirit of the age , the changing order , the things that remain , and other kindred and fruitful themes , all handled with the author 's cus - tomary insight and helpful suggestiveness .

		Miss
Lilian Bell	PERSON	tells the story of a happy thought and its beneficent results in '' The Story of the Christmas Ship '' -LRB- Rand ,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a generous octavo filled with details of the great charitable enterprise started by her last year in behalf of the hosts of children made fatherless by the war in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Seven million gifts from American children went across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	in the
U. S. S.	PERSON	`` Jason '' and into the Christmas stockings of the unfortunate little folk of the warring coun - tries .

		Miss Bell writes with her usual vivacity , and the very aspect of her pages , with their innumer - able short paragraphs , their thick sprinkling of exclamation points , their frequent dashes , and other appeals to the eye , is hardly characteristic and perhaps not ineffective .

		Her portrait is the only illustrative feature of the book , which might well have been enlivened with camera views of incidents narrated , if such visual records had been available .

		A brilliant binding and wrapper make up the exterior equipment of this notable
Christ	LOCATION	- mas book .

		From
Philip Freneau	PERSON	to
Paul Lawrence Dun	PERSON	- bar , the better-known nineteenth-century American poets , to the number of nearly a hundred and fifty , are represented in Miss
Jessie B. Ritten	PERSON	- house 's pocket anthology , '' The Little Book of American Poets '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a companion vol - ume to '' The Little Book of Modern Verse '' com - piled by the same hand .

		A few overlappings in the two lists of verse-writers inevitably occur , since the
end of the nineteenth century	DATE	did not , fortunately , bring an end to all our songsters of that period ; and where inadequate space may seem to have been allotted to a contemporary poet in the later volume , he will be found to be more fully represented in the earlier .

		In its professed purpose '' to present in compact form some of the finer and more enduring things in our poetic lit - erature '' this handy volume has attained a good measure of success .

		The name of
Etienne de la Boetie	ORGANIZATION	, if known only by the poem of
Emerson	LOCATION	at the head of which it stands , helps no little to quicken interest in Mon - taigne 's short essay on friendship which was ad - dressed to this best friend of the writer .

		In a limited edition , with rubricated initials and head - pieces , and with other attributes of excellence , there are published both '' Montaigne 's Essay on Friendship '' and '' XXIX Sonnets by
Estienne	PERSON	de la Boetie , '' translated by Mr.
Louis	PERSON	How .

		Love and friendship are the themes of the sonnets , which thus appropriately supplement the prose treatise similarly inspired .

		Evident care and skill have been bestowed upon the rendering of both prose and verse , the obvious difficulties in each case , and especially in the latter , being a spur to best endeavor .

		-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Not unworthy of its splendid theme is the title chosen by Dr.
J. Edward Parrott	PERSON	for his book , `` The Pageant of English Literature '' -LRB-
Sully & Klein	ORGANIZATION	teich -RRB- , a companion volume to his similarly named work on English history .

		From the rude beginnings of his country 's literature down to the death of Tennyson he sketches in popular style the main facts in that literary history , with brief outlines or descriptions of the more famous works and with occasional illustrative quotations .

		The biographical element , too , is not wanting , and a rich pageantry of color meets the eye in half the numerous illustrations , chiefly from famous paint - ings .

		Ample pages , wide margins , and large print contribute to the book 's sumptuous appearance , and in its reading matter it betters expectation by devoting its first five chapters to the beginnings of literature in general something not promised in the title .

		As giving a bird 's - eye view of its field , and as a useful and attractive work for young readers , the book is to be commended .

		All is certainly not right with the world as viewed by Mr.
Seymour Deming	PERSON	in his '' profane baccalaureate , '' `` The Pillar of Fire '' -LRB- Small ,
May	DATE	- nard
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Let us have done , he urges , with the smoothly conventional baccalaureate sermon and tell our graduating classes the plain , unvarnished truth .

		`` Are you content , '' he asks , with exuberance of rhetoric , '' to scan sonorous Sophoclean odes which bewail a fate-begotten plague in seven-gated
Thebes	LOCATION	whilst there are , on the island of Manhat - tan , fifty-one blocks huddling 3,000 people to each , through which creeps the icy contagion of tubercu - losis ? ''

		Again : '' How shall the college be brought back to its rightful task , the teaching of revolu - tionism ?

		By the likes of you .

		Seek and ye shall find . ''

		In this vehement vein , enlivened in one place by a '' Socratic scherzo , '' and in another by a list of '' dishonorary degrees , '' the author val - iantly strives to set right a world that is all wrong . ''

		We are not loved as a nation , '' says Professor
Edward A. Steiner	PERSON	, '' largely because * we are not understood , and we are not understood because we do not understand ourselves , and we do not under - stand ourselves because we have not studied our - selves in the light of the spirit of other nations . ''

		Something of this detached view of ourselves is offered in Mr.
Steiner	PERSON	's latest book , '' Introducing 580 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 9	DATE	the American Spirit '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- , in which he de - scribes with vivacity and humor his experience as host and cicerone to a visiting German of some note , whom he calls '' the Herr Director , '' and who , it should be added , is accompanied by '' the
Frau Directorin	PERSON	. ''

		Enthusiastic in his devotion to his adopted country , and with no hyphen disfiguring his Americanism , the host played his part so well as almost to overcome some of the prejudices of his guests from
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		At any rate , his effort , as described by himself , was most creditable to him and is very enjoyable in the reading . ''

		If laughing hurts you , let this book alone ! ''

		is the caution displayed on the wrapper of '' The Log of the Ark , by
Noah	ORGANIZATION	; Hieroglyphics by Ham ; Excavated by
I. L. Gordon	PERSON	and
A. J. Frueh	PERSON	'' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		It belongs , of course , to that class of might-have-been ancient humor in which Mr.
Maurice Baring	PERSON	and others have in recent years exercised their wits with much nimbleness and to the augmentation of the mirth of the world .

		Here is a specimen of Noah 's facetious manner : '' I had everybody guessing at the supper table .

		I asked them where
Moses	PERSON	is going to be when the light goes out .

		The officers and their wives are trying to guess . ''

		The drawings that enliven this logbook are undeniably amusing .

		All interested in the personalities and idiosyncrasies of
Noah	ORGANIZATION	,
Shem	ORGANIZATION	, Ham ,
Japheth	LOCATION	, and their respective wives , will find the book entertaining .

		Hawaiian legends have a quality of their own , even though they show many of the characteristics of folklore in general , and the noting of these points of difference and of resemblance adds to the enjoyment of reading such a collection as that edited and translated by Mr.
William Drake Wes	PERSON	- tervelt under the title , `` Legends of Old Hono - lulu . ''

		Mr.
Westervelt	PERSON	is a resident of
Honolulu	LOCATION	and has had experience in the re-telling of
Polyne	LOCATION	- sian stories for English-speaking readers ; there - fore it is with more than the average folklore - student 's familiarity with his subject that he puts into literary form the twenty-five or more local legends which he has gathered from Hawaiian sources .

		The book is of pleasing design , with tinted leaves , tinted print , and tinted half-tone illustrations and line drawings .

		It is published by
George H. Ellis Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	.

		How the popular lecture , `` Acres of Diamonds , '' came into being , and many significant facts about its author , the Rev.
Russell H. Conwell	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, President of
Temple University	ORGANIZATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, are readably set forth by Mr.
Robert Shackleton	PERSON	in a volume bearing the same title as the lecture and published by the Harpers .

		The marks of a force - ful personality are on everything done and every word spoken by the man introduced to us by his I present biographer , and a further tribute to his | striking qualities is rendered by his neighbor and intimate friend for thirty years , Mr.
John Wana	PERSON	- maker , in a brief '' appreciation '' prefixed to the lecture itself for this , too , is included in the book .

		Two portraits of Dr.
Conwell	PERSON	and other illustrations are inserted , and a brief autobio - graphic note , '' Fifty Years on the Lecture Plat - form , '' closes the book .

		NOTES .

		A new edition of Mr.
Louis C. Elson	PERSON	's '' History of American Music , '' revised and brought down to date , is promised for early issue by the Mac - millan Co. . ''

		How Diplomats Make War '' is the promising title of an anonymous volume which Mr.
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	will publish at once .

		The author is described as '' a British statesman . '' ''

		Old Familiar Faces '' was the title chosen by the late
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	for his volume of recollections of the many famous men and women with whom he had been on terms of friendship .

		It has just appeared in
London	LOCATION	, and will undoubt - edly find American publication also .

		The editor contributes an Introduction dealing with life at '' The Pines . ''

		Hon.

last summer	DATE	in a hospital back of the firing lines in

autumn of 1870	DATE	, during his tour of the European capitals in the hope of winning help among neu - tral nations in the war with
Prussia	LOCATION	.

		The memoirs close with
M. Thiers	PERSON	's Presidency and the days of the Commune .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 581 Readers of the Introduction to Professor
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	's verse translation of the `` Alcestis '' of Euripides -LRB- recently published -RRB- will remember his reference to an illuminating monograph written by Mr.
J. A. K. Thomson	PERSON	.

		This is now to be pub - lished by
Messrs. George Allen & Unwin , Ltd.	ORGANIZATION	, of
London	LOCATION	, under the title of '' The Greek Tradition : Essays in the Reconstruction of Ancient Thought . ''

		The volume includes essays on '' Greek Country Life , '' '' The Springs of Poetry , '' `` Alcestis and Her Hero , '' '' Greek Simplicity , '' etc. .

		Still another magazine devoted entirely to verse is soon to make its appearance .

		This latest comer is called '' Contemporary Verse , '' and will be pub - lished at 203
Chestnut Ave.	ORGANIZATION	,
Chestnut Hill	ORGANIZATION	,
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia .

		Its first number , to appear in
January	DATE	, will contain contributions by Messrs.
Hermann Hagedorn	PERSON	,
Louis Untermeyer	PERSON	,
Don Marquis	PERSON	,
Rob	PERSON	- ert Haven Sehauffler ,
Joyce Kilmer	PERSON	,
T. A. Daly	PERSON	,
Leonard Bacon	PERSON	,
William Rose Benet	PERSON	,
Max East	LOCATION	- man , and several others .

		The editors of '' Contem - porary Verse '' are Messrs.
Howard S. Graham	PERSON	, Jr. ,
Devereux C. Josephs	PERSON	, and
Samuel McCoy	PERSON	.

		A fund of
$ 50,000	MONEY	for the purpose of maintain - ing in
Throop College of Technology the Holder Chair of Biology	ORGANIZATION	has been established by friends of the late
Charles Frederick Holder	PERSON	, who in this manner wish '' to express their appreciation for his long labors in the realm of natural history , his steadfast devotion to sports in their most dignified and elevating sense , and his efforts to protect the wild game and fish of
California	LOCATION	. ''

		The knowledge that this tribute had been paid to him by his friends was a source of much satisfaction to Dr. Holder for several weeks before his death -LRB- which occurred on
October 10	DATE	-RRB- .

		Had Dr. Holder lived he would have held the chair during the remainder of his life as Professor Emeritus .

		For a considerable time Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	have had in preparation , and will shortly publish , their new and final edition of the '' Short History of the English People , '' by
J. R. Green	PERSON	.

		The original edition , which appeared in
1874	DATE	, in which there had been inaccuracies of detail , was revised accord - ing to Mr.
Green	PERSON	's special directions .

		In this work Mrs.
Green	PERSON	had the advantage of Mr.
Green	PERSON	's own corrections , and also in difficult questions the advice of the leading historians in their several departments , such as , for - example , Professor Gar - diner , Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	,
Lord Bryce	PERSON	,
Bishop Stubbs	PERSON	,
Bishop Creighton	PERSON	, and others .

		This final edition , now about to be published , includes an epilogue which continues the history to the present day .

		Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's rewritten and enlarged
Life of Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	will be published this month , - just seventeen years after the publication of the origi - nal work .

		The biography in its new form embod - ies much fresh information and illustrates from contemporary evidence the place that Shakespeare filled in both the literary and social life of his day .

		The organization of the theatres with which Shake - speare was associated is described in the light of recent research , and much space is devoted to the experiences of
Shakespeare	PERSON	and his colleagues at the
Courts of Queen Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	and
King James	LOCATION	I. : Sir
Sidney	PERSON	has consulted for the first time the wills of several of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's
Stratford	LOCATION	friends , and has some new matter on the monument in
Strat	LOCATION	- ford Church . ''

		The Blinded Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Gift Book , '' to which we referred at some length in our issue of
Nov. 11	DATE	, will be published on this side the water by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		The editor is Mr.
George Goodchild	PERSON	, and the work will contain con - tributions from such prominent English writers as Messrs.
Robert Hichens	PERSON	,
John Galsworthy	PERSON	, Ed -
mund Gosse	PERSON	,
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	,
H. G. Wells	PERSON	,
Austin Dobson	PERSON	,
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	,
Anthony Hope	PERSON	,
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	, and others .

		The contributions , in both prose and verse , were written especially for this book , and a number of artists have contributed the illustrations .

		The purpose of the volume , which is arranged as a gift book , is to add to the funds for the helping of English '' soldiers and sailors who have been blinded in the war .

		Our
Paris	LOCATION	correspondent , Mr.
Theodore Stanton	PERSON	, sends us the following letter which he lately re - ceived from Dr.
W. A. Craigie	PERSON	, one of the editors of the great Oxford Dictionary : '' The principal change in the Dictionary work caused by the death of Sir
James Murray	PERSON	will be the loss of the sections done by himself and his staff , an impor - tant difference , naturally .

		The other editors and staffs have worked independently , and so are not directly affected .

		In fact the loss will partly be made up by the assistance to be obtained from Sir
James Murray	PERSON	's staff , which will be all the more valuable as our num - bers have been somewhat reduced of late by the war and other causes .

		It is probable that attention will first be concentrated on finishing S , but either II or V will be in progress at the same time .

		`` As Dr.
Bradley	PERSON	is much older than either Mr.
Onions	PERSON	and myself , and has been an editor since
1889	DATE	, he will naturally be regarded as the chief representa - tive of the Dictionary .

		It is unlikely , however , that any formal statement on the question will be made . ''

		Our chief American contributors in recent years have been Mr.
Albert Matthews	PERSON	and Mr.
C. W. Ernst	PERSON	, both of
Boston	LOCATION	, the former helping with American words , the latter chiefly with mediaeval Latin words and uses .

		I have also had some useful communica - tions from Mr.
A. Bowski	PERSON	, of
New York City	LOCATION	, while Mr.
C. O. S. Mawson	PERSON	,
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, has helped with Anglo-Indian words .

		The new ` American
Glos	PERSON	- sary ' by Professor
R. H. Thornton	PERSON	is also of great service in tracing the history of special words and phrases , as he has carried many of these much further than any previous collector .

		Many indeed are those who , after using Sanatogen , can say with

		625 ON THE EATING OF FERNSEED .

		Probably most of us have speculated on the advantages of being invisible .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has written a novel around the idea -LRB- around what odd idea has he not written a novel ? -RRB-

		, in which the blessedness of the state is not very apparent .

		To people of literary or artistic turn , however , a twilight condition of life seems almost a necessity .

		The butterfly 's emblazoning dust brushes off against the hard hand of reality .

		Authors and artists have almost always preluded on some
Magic Flute	ORGANIZATION	, even if afterwards they took up the ear-shat - tering trumpet that calls to strife .

		And their days of obscurity were probably their hap - piest , though they did not know it at the time .

		A king who goes about incognito is perhaps more pleased with himself than when he is glittering in his court ; and he is cer - tainly a more potent figure to the imagina - tion .

		It is not necessary to go back `` where Homer and where Orpheus are '' to find great writers who passed their whole lives or a great part of their days in eclipse .

		What is now known about
Virgil ?	PERSON

		A few scraps of biography we have , and one or two incidents touched with human interest , the reading of the passage about
Marcellus	PERSON	to
Augustus	PERSON	and the wish he expressed to have his epic burned , but otherwise the man is unilluminated .

		He moves majestic and mysterious , remote from the world in which he lived .

		Horace , that merry gossip , about whom we know everything , was his friend .

		There is no as - sumption of superiority or unlikeness to his fellows in
Virgil	LOCATION	; he was simply an eater of fernseed , and could not become visible to them .

		Perhaps that is why the Middle Ages accounted him a magician , and why
Dante	ORGANIZATION	chose him as a guide to the other worlds .

		But we have a nearer and greater instance of the eclipse of personality in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The odiously incredulous have denied that there was any such personality , or have sought to transfer it to another .

		On the other hand , critics have tried to piece out
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's character from the plays .

		It is probable that all creative artists do use 592 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 23	DATE	themselves as a model .

		Like Rembrandt , they keep a wardrobe of costumes and accesso - ries , helmets , swords , robes , and what not .

		When they wish to paint a certain sort of person , they don his habiliments and think themselves into his skin .

		But such vicarious enacting does not deeply dye their own be - ings .

		From the largeness of thought , vivid - ness of emotion , and generosity of feeling throughout
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's works , one may believe that he was a noble gentleman .

		Be - yond this it would hardly be safe to go .

		But , it may be said , have we not the record of an episode of his life in the Sonnets ' ?

		Perhaps !

		Personally , I should as soon think of going to market with the pieces of silver which the moon shining through a poplar tree coins upon the path at my feet , as to take literally and prosaically the words that any lyric poet utters in the whirl of his emotion and imagi - nation .

		He is like a Dancing Dervish who loses his own consciousness in the eternal .

		Doubtless he gets his start from some par - ticular experience , but it is his business to forget himself and reveal the universal .

		But , at any rate ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's individuality is obscure ; yet he , too , like
Virgil	PERSON	, lived in a gossiping and malicious age .

		There is nothing uncertain about
Milton	PERSON	.

		With ^ Eschylus ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and
Byron	PERSON	, he is one of the leaders of that other army of genius , whose personalities dazzle the world and dominate their times .

		But unlike most of these , he did not leap to the forefront of the struggle at once .

		For a good many years , in
Italy	LOCATION	or in
Buckinghamshire	LOCATION	, im - mersed in study and the strenuous idleness of dreams , he passed through a quiet paradise before emerging into his inferno .

		Doubtless the energy in him even then .

		struggled against the obscurity that smothered up his godship from surmise .

		Doubtless to his classic thought he was Apollo among the servants of
King Admetus	ORGANIZATION	.

		But he was happy ; at least , the poems of that period , the '' Comus , '' the portraits of the bright and pensive Muses , the odes , though grave , are happy .

		It may be questioned if he ever knew happiness again .

		Of course the heroic struggler , scarred and defaced by intellectual battle , is the greater figure ; of course the heroic epics and drama of his later life are the greater poetry ; but nevertheless , we do not like him or them half as well .

		Keats 's apprenticeship to obscurity lasted until death gave him his freedom papers .

		And toward the close of his life this obscurity was darkened by a perfect cloud of arrows directed against him , arrows of disease , of unfortunate love , of critical imbecility .

		Yet from it all he emerges the very image of youth and g * enius .

		Hardly any literary figure sym - bolizes these things as he does .

		His was the ecstacy of the fernseed life .

		He could live undisturbed with the visions of his own mind , fairies , nymphs , goddesses ; he could con - sort with gay and irresponsible companions ; he could be confident of the future and care - less of the day .

		His jaunts and junketings , his middle-class life in suburban parlors , struck
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	as undignified .

		Hor - ace 's poet who could go singing through a wood filled with robbers was probably undig - nified in comparison with a Roman Senator travelling with the impedimenta of place and riches , but he is more attractive .

		Keats 's mantle , slipping off , fell at once upon
Tennyson	LOCATION	; and for many years , twenty at least , the latter lived much the same sort of life as his predecessor .

		His education was better , and his family and friends were , ac - cording to English ideas , of a higher class than those of
Keats	PERSON	.

		But
Tennyson	PERSON	was apparently quite poor , often in real straits .


Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	reports on
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's authority that
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	allowed him three hundred pounds a year for many years .

		But there is certainly no trace of such incredible riches during his Wanderjahre .

		However , the record of this has never been fully drawn out .

		Apparently he wandered over the most of
England	LOCATION	, living in lodgings or in country inns or in friends ' houses ; settling now and then with his mother and sisters in retired places .

		His removed and solitary ways , his '' grumpi - ness , '' his carelessness about dress , his absent - mindedness about other affairs of life , are all up to the best traditions of the fernseed world .

		Once the fate of '' In Memoriam '' hung upon
Coventry Patmore	PERSON	's rescue of the manuscript from a lodging-house where Ten - nyson had left it .

		It was a rich twilight region of romance that the poet inhabited , where Marianas could really look from moated granges and Millers ' Daughters rise out of the misty atmosphere of their homes .

		When
Tennyson	PERSON	comes out into the common light of day , when he grows famous and rich , when
1915	DATE	' THE DIAL 593 princes and statesmen and bishops are his friends , the charm departs from his life , as it did to a large extent from his poetry .

		Yet to the last he remained the soldier of art , encamped amid his army of dreams , apart from the world .

		Could he have had his own way , we should know as little about his life or personality as we do about
Shakespeare 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		But I think the most signal instance of the fernseed life of which we have record is that of the
Bronte	PERSON	girls in their
Yorkshire	LOCATION	par - sonage .

		A pillar of cloud hung over their home ; they Avere almost as much isolated as if shipwrecked on a desert island .

		But what spiritual joys , what quiet exultations , must have been experienced in that household !

		The whole genesis of creative art is in those imaginative '' plays '' which they worked out together or each one secretly by herself .

		One of the sisters got out a little into the world , met with disappointment and sorrow which she bravely overlived and made into art .

		The greatest of them remained alone and aloof , kept tryst only with the phantoms of her mind .

		She is the priestess of imagination , a Sibyl transported from
Dodona	LOCATION	to her
Yorkshire	LOCATION	moors .

		Remarkable or great as the work of these two is , it is less regarded by the world than the record of their lives .

		And rightly , for this latter brings out in the most intense and extreme degree the truth of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's saying that '' talent is nurtured best in solitude . ''

		There are some men of genius who , do w y hat they will , can never make themselves explica - ble or plain to the world .

		They are born invisibilities who may knock and flutter at the windows of our souls without gaining admit - tance .

		De Quincey , for example , lived among a set of men who were continually writing about themselves or each other .

		He was per - haps the greatest gossip of the group .

		He made '' copy '' about everything that hap - pened to him or everyone he came in contact with .

		His opium-eating confessions made him for a time the most stared-at person in En - gland .

		Yet with all this , there is an inviolable secrecy about him .

		We never seem to get at the real man .

		Perhaps he was a changeling , some elf-child may have been imposed into the human baby 's cradle .

		Hawthorne is another of the mysterious ones .

		He , too , by means of diaries , note-books , records of travel , novels written around incidents in his life sought to explicate himself to mankind .

		But at most he only shows clear by flashes , like those twin stars , dark and bright , which revolve about one another .

		Keats suggests in one of his letters that genius ought not to have any personality at all , that it ought to be merely a medium through which the world exhibits itself .

		But the dazzling ones , the men of action and art together , the
Angelos	LOCATION	,
Kubenses	PERSON	,
Goethes	LOCATION	, and Byrons , are geniuses too , so that law will hardly hold .

		Probably , though , the balance of great work is with the fernseed eaters , the creators who exist only in their art .

		Perhaps in the future genius may push the invisibility idea farther than it has done in the past .

		It may disguise itself by being like everybody else .

		It may be a burgess , may vote and be voted for .

		Meanwhile , in secrecy , in uncriticized seclusion , it may work out the documents of its fate , the title-deeds of its fame .

		These it may hide as though they were offences against mankind , until it dies , when it may leave them to be given posthumously to the world .

		Thus the artist will have all the fun of creation , and will not be hampered and hounded by the stupidity , hatred , and malice of his fellows .

		It is a fair ideal ; and , if it had been put into execution in the past , would have saved very many of the greatest of human beings the larger part of their pain and suffering .

		LITERARY AFFAIRS IN
PARIS	LOCATION	.

		THE HOLIDAY BOOK SEASON .

		LITERATURE 'S LOSS - ES IN THE GREAT WAR .

		PERIODICALS IN THE TRENCHES .

		M. PAUL FORT , THE '' PRINCE OF POETS . ''

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The holiday season for the publishing and bookselling world of
Paris	LOCATION	will be very dif - ferent this year , as it was also
last year	DATE	, from what is ordinarily the case .

		As a rule , fine new gift-books are issued by many of the leading houses , and old but favorite authors are given the place of honor in show-windows .

		The principal dailies and reviews contain not only conspicuous book advertisements but also columns and sometimes whole broadsides of critical and descriptive notices , in disguised form , really written by some member of the firm and paid for at so much the line .

		In the
holiday season of 1914-15	DATE	there was a great falling off in all these things .

		Some of the smaller houses publishers , booksellers , 594 THE DIAL
Dec. 23	DATE	and printers actually closed their doors , and not a few of these are still shut .

		But the situation this year is not quite so bad as it was last year , though it is far from being normal .

		These facts are well brought out by the special catalogue devoted to gift-books which the
Paris	LOCATION	Publishers ' Club issues each winter at about this time .

		That for 1913-14 the holiday season before the war contained 356 pages ; 4600 copies were printed ;
1500	DATE	francs ' worth of copies were sold ; over 13,000 francs ' worth of advertisements were inserted ; seventy-three publishing houses were represented , and thirty-three periodicals printed therein their paid prospectuses .

		In
1914-15	DATE	that is , four months after the breaking out of the war the number of pages of the catalogue had fallen to 119 , only twenty-nine publishers participated , and but three periodicals felt able to advertise their existence .

		As I write this letter , the edition for this year is still in press ; so I have not been able to continue this interesting com - parison .

		But the secretary of the club in - forms me that it will contain some forty pages more than last year , which , however , will leave it nearly two hundred pages short of what it was before the war .

		Of course this falling off is due in a measure to the fact that the public is spending its money now almost wholly on the necessities of life , and is not indulging in the buying of books .

		It is also to be partly accounted for by the effects of mobilization and the wounding and killing of so many of the younger generation .

		I have been struck by the number of printers seen in the hospitals .

		The head of the
Hachette	ORGANIZATION	pub - lishing house said to me a month ago : '' One of the things that seems to characterize the present struggle is the terrible mortality on the battle field .

		So far we have had fifty - four killed among our employes .

		In the war of
1870	DATE	we did not lose one .

		A friend of mine also in the publishing business has nine em - ployes in the army .

		Five have been killed and four wounded .

		You see me back in har - ness again , though I retired
several years ago	DATE	. ''

		A sign , however , of returning pros - perity is seen in the renewed activity among the bouquinistes along the parapet of the
Quai Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	.

		At the moment of the battle of the Marne all their little boxes had the lids down and the contents removed to safer quarters .

		But the other afternoon when I passed that way , I noticed that almost all of them are now open again , and the same old habitues once more loitering over possible `` finds . ''

		But a more permanent cause of the crip - pling of the publishing activities of
France	LOCATION	will be the cruel destruction which this war has occasioned among the young writers in every field of authorship , cut down often on the very threshold of their promise .

		This fact was brought home in a most touching way on All-Saints ' -
Day	DATE	, at the beginning of this month , by the action of writers who form the society known as the Souvenir Litteraire , whose aim , the constitution reads , is '' to ren - der homage to the memory of men of letters and especially to those who have been un - justly neglected . ''

		Artistic
Paris	LOCATION	always lends itself wonderfully to the artistic French tem - perament , if the word '' art '' may be used in connection with the subject which I am now treating ; and never was this more so than on this occasion .


M. Olivier de Gour	PERSON	- cuff , the talented founder of this admirable organization , was most happily inspired when he chose as the spot where the gray-haired living authors of
Paris	LOCATION	should honor their youthful confreres fallen in the defence of this same
Paris	LOCATION	, the head of the grand central alley of Pere Lachaise cemetery , where , with Bartholomews powerful funeral allegories the `` Monument aux Morts '' forming the immediate background , a solemn , patriotic tribute was paid to the more than one hun - dred and fifty rising writers now lost forever to literature .

		How fitting indeed was the frame for such a ceremony !

		As one walked up this avenue to the rendezvous , one re - marked on either hand brilliant reminders of the intellectual grandeur of
France	LOCATION	, for there are the tombs of Visconti the architect ,
Sainte	ORGANIZATION	- Beuve and Francisque Sarcey the critics , Cou - ture and
Paul Baudry	PERSON	the painters ,
Victor Cousin	PERSON	and
Barthelemy	PERSON	Saint-Hilaire the philosophers , Arago the astronomer ,
Ledni	PERSON	- Rollin the orator ,
Arsene Houssaye	PERSON	the typi - cal litterateur , and his son
Henri Houssaye	PERSON	the historian , and last but of course not least ,
Alfred de Musset	PERSON	, the leaves of whose weep - ing-willow were still green , I noted , notwith - standing the sharp night air and the day mists of autumn .

		The spirit which pervaded the spot was so well expressed the next day by the poet
Robert Lestrange	PERSON	, one of the actors in the scene his wife delivered in his name with marked talent a poem written for the occasion that I can not give a better description than by quoting here what he said to me : `` It is certain that this hecatomb will cause a terrible gap in the heart , of our young literature , for many a youthful and brilliant hope is thus blasted in its very flower .

		But we mourn them with a grief in which a certain feeling of pride is mingled , for they have written with their blood a most beautiful page of glory and they have shown
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 595 themselves pure heroes .

		Yet it must not be con - cluded that French letters are in consequence irremediably impaired .

		For my own part , I be - lieve that after the war will rise up among those who are left a pleiad of writers strongly tempered in the virile school of adversity , those who , whether young or old , will have lived through these never - to-be-forgotten hours and who will surely be pre - pared to produce the finest works which can be conceived and executed .

		Iliads have inspired Homers , and ^ Eschylus was a soldier at
Marathon	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is the ransom of the fearful holocaust which the young literature of
France	LOCATION	must sacrifice to the ferocious German Moloch . ''

		And here are the names of some of these vic - tims which I select almost at hazard in the long sad list , led in my selection more by the family name than by the fame or the number of the dead author 's writings .

		Here I meet again with
Ernest Psichari	PERSON	, whom I first met , not so many years ago , as a bright young boy of scarcely eighteen , the grandson of Renan ;
Pierre Leroy-Beaulieu	PERSON	, whose father and uncle , now dead , were both members of the
Institute ; Guy de Cassagnac	ORGANIZATION	, son of the once famous Bonapartist deputy ;
Claude Casimir - Perier	PERSON	, son of the former President of
France	LOCATION	;
Jacques Rambaud	PERSON	, son of the historian of
Russia	LOCATION	;
Jean Maspero	PERSON	, related to the great Egyptologist ,
Georges Latapie	PERSON	, son of the di - rector of `` La Liberte , '' and
Robert d'Hu	PERSON	- mieres , descended from the marshal of that name , one of the favorites of Louis XIV .

		Most of these names appear in the little four-page `` Bulletin des Ecrivains '' which
M. Fernand Divoire	PERSON	, of the '' Intransigeant '' editorial staff , has been editing for the past year .

		The aim of this diminutive monthly is excellent .

		A copy is sent gratis to all writers at the front ; it keeps standing at the head of its first page a list of all those who are killed in battle or who die of wounds or sick - ness , it gives prominence to any military honors which they may have received , it pro- vides a list of authors in the enemies ' prisons , and is useful in many other ways to the man of letters on the firing-line .

		In the latest number sent me by M. Divoire I read this notice : `` As printed matter is no longer allowed to circulate postage free to the front , and as there is a constant demand for copies of our periodical , our expenses have consider - ably increased .

		We are now disposed , there - fore , to accept financial aid from writers in civil life , several of whom have already helped us .

		But we repeat once more that we will not accept money from writers in the army . ''

		`` Would it not be a handsome thing if some of our American literary men and authors ' clubs were to contribute to this admirable work , whose issues , I should add , are not on sale ?

		If any of your readers wish to aid , they may send their contributions through me or direct to
M. Divoire	PERSON	, 16 rue Bertin-Poiree ,
Paris	LOCATION	.

		That there is a strong literary element in the French trenches is shown in still another way , and one that is not tragic but is even touched with a note of Gallic gaiety .

		A few months ago it was estimated that over sixty `` newspapers '' were issued by soldiers at the front .

		In fact , an energetic publisher , whose name M. Berger-Levrault I have already had occasion to mention in connection with this war literature , has just issued a curious volume , '' Tous les Journaux du Front , '' -LRB- 3 frs . -RRB-

		, in which he gives facsimile extracts from twenty of these papers , which are some - times printed back of the firing-line but are often hand-made in the very trenches them - selves .

		The publisher announces that other volumes will follow .

		This one is interesting in many ways , and is a worthy example of native French wit , which if sometimes broad is always pointed .

		The names of two or three of these sheets will suffice to illustrate this fact .

		`` Rigolboche , '' `` Le Tourne-Boche , '' `` La Voix du 75 , '' and `` L'Echo des Mannites , '' are not too bad .

		Nor should we overlook the more serious tone which pervades the mind of all these military journalists , and which is well exemplified by this extract from a letter which I have just received from Lieutenant
Stephane Lauzanne	PERSON	, editor-in-chief of the
Paris	LOCATION	'' Matin '' and nephew of de Blowitz perhaps I may also add , whose wife is an American which he writes in English from the front : `` We are quite prepared to pass the winter and the
spring	DATE	, and another winter and other springs if necessary ' pour avoir les
Boches	PERSON	. '

		In fact , we have never been as de - termined as we are now .

		There is no doubt about the issue .

		We will gain at last , and civilization will gain with us . ''

		Another literary enterprise which should recommend itself to our men of letters is M.
Paul Fort	PERSON	's '' Poemes de
France	LOCATION	, '' a neat little four-page sheet issued twice a month and sent gratis to the intellectuals at the front and in the hospitals .

		Each number is made up of a series of patriotic poems written in the best style of the `` Prince of Poets , '' and which
Guitry	PERSON	and
Suzanne Despres	PERSON	have been recit - ing everywhere in
France	LOCATION	, the latter carrying the good word even into distant
Finland	LOCATION	.

		But perhaps I should open a parenthesis here and say a few words about
M. Paul Fort	PERSON	and his rather peculiar literary title .

		Those of your readers who would know more thoroughly the work of this original and brilliant poet should consult the article by Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	in `` The
Edinburgh	LOCATION	Re - 596 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 23	DATE	view '' for
last July	DATE	, on `` War Poetry in
France	LOCATION	, '' wherein the writer devotes special attention to these '' Poemes de
France	LOCATION	, '' which he places first among the verse in this coun - try called forth by the present conflict .

		But a more complete article , which is wholly Driven up to
M. Fort	ORGANIZATION	's poetry , if we except these `` Poemes de
France	LOCATION	, '' came out in the Janu - ary number of '' The Nineteenth Century and After , '' ''
Paul Fort	PERSON	, the ' Prince of Poets , ' '' by
James Elroy Flecker	PERSON	.

		And this brings me to the explanation of a title which seems somewhat incongruous in the republic of letters in republican
France	LOCATION	.

		Some years ago '' La Plume '' and the '' Echo de
Paris	LOCATION	'' took the initiative in inviting the writers of
France	LOCATION	to designate their favorite poet .

		Some acted on the suggestion , and the poet thus specified was called the '' Prince of Poets . ''

		He held office for life .

		The first incumbent was
Paul Verlaine	PERSON	, who was fol - lowed by
Stephane Mallarme	PERSON	, who in turn was succeeded by
Leon Dierx	PERSON	, who died in
1912	DATE	.

		The last named I knew .

		He had the head of
Leconte de Lisle	LOCATION	as represented in the bust in the
Luxembourg	LOCATION	garden .

		He led a most austere life , his food being almost exclu - sively milk in the closing years of his ex - istence .

		His plain little flat in the region of
Montmartre	LOCATION	seemed chill even in
summer	DATE	, and he himself was exceedingly reserved .

		But perhaps the oddest thing in
Leon Dierx	LOCATION	's career was that , as `` Prince of Poets , '' he should have been sandwiched in between two such eccentrics as
Verlaine	PERSON	and Mallarme on the one hand and , on the other , by
Paul Fort	PERSON	, who enjoys breaking over all the conventional rules governing poetry approved by this earn - est advocate of classic forms .

		But the election which designated
Paul Fort	ORGANIZATION	had a broader basis perhaps than any of its predecessors .

		Some two thousand or more writers from all parts of
France	LOCATION	took part in the choice , which was conducted by such
Paris	LOCATION	papers as ''
Gil Bias	PERSON	, '' `` Comoedia , '' ` TIntransigeant , '' and the ''
Paris	LOCATION	- Journal , '' each one of which was rep - resented in the office of the first-named jour - nal when the votes were counted . ''

		So while I do not at all over-estimate the importance of the office , ''
M. Fort	PERSON	says very modestly , '' I do feel that the electorate which designated me was fairly representative . ''

		I would like to try and depict the person - ality and the intellectual methods and quali - ties of

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		ONE OF WAR 'S UGLIEST BY-PRODUCTS , as has often been noted , is the submersion of reason and intellect in the flood-tide of popular pas - sions .

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	employed this theme to fine dramatic purpose in his tragedy entitled '' The Mob , '' based on English feeling during the South African war .

		But in no conflict of the past has this sinister phenomenon ever attained the force and ascendancy that it has reached to-day in every belligerent country .

		The military rowdies who lately broke up a
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 597 meeting of the
Union for Democratic Control	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	merely typify the present spirit of
Europe	LOCATION	as manifested toward every individual who refuses to surrender his intellectual birth - right and join the general hue and cry .

		Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	has remarked of his war writ - ings that '' the British merely spit and gibe at me when they read the first sentence and find that it does not flatter the intolerable self - righteousness which has been our bane from the first day of this war . ''

		The same attitude is apparent in the German treatment of Dr.
Liebknecht	PERSON	, and the French treatment of
M. Holland	ORGANIZATION	.

		The latter , driven to
Switzerland	LOCATION	by the insults and abuse of his fellow-country - men , recently collected into a volume entitled '' Au-dessus de la Melee '' the papers published during the past year and a half in which he has nobly but vainly pleaded for the highest ideals of humanity .

		To this volume M. Hol - land has prefixed an Introduction which can - not be too widely quoted , and which will be its own excuse for the space we give it here .

		-LRB- For the translation , we are indebted to the
New York	LOCATION	'' Times . '' -RRB- ''

		A great people assailed by war has not only its frontiers to defend ; it has its reason and con - science .

		It is imperative to save them from the hallucinations and the unjust and foolish notions that the plague of war lets loose .

		To each his office !

		Let the armies protect the soil of the country ; let thinking men watch over her thoughts .

		If these last place themselves at the service of the passions of their people , possibly they may be useful instruments ; but they risk betraying the soul , which is not the smallest part of the national patrimony .

		Some day history will cast up the account of each of the nations in this war ; she will weigh the sum of their mistakes , illusions , malignant folly .

		Let us do our utmost to insure that when we come before her our score may be small . ''

		We teach a child the Gospel of Jesus and the Christian ideal .

		All the instruction he receives at school tends to stimulate in him the intellectual conception of the great human family .

		Classical education makes him observe , together with the differences of races , the common roots and trunk of our civilization .

		Art causes him to love the deep sources of the genius of the nations .

		Science imposes upon him faith in the unity of the intel - lectual life .

		The great social movement which is making the world over shows him around himself the organized effort of the working classes to unite in the hopes and in the struggles which are break - ing national barriers down .

		The most luminous geniuses of the world sing , as
Walt Whitman	PERSON	and Tolstoy do , universal fraternity in joy or sorrow , or , like our Latin intellects , riddle with their criti - cism the prejudices of hate and ignorance which separate individuals and nations . ''

		Like all the men of my time , I have been nour - ished on these ideals ; I have tried in my turn to share the bread of life with my younger and less fortunate brethren .

		When war came I did not believe it my duty to renounce them because the hour for putting them in practice had arrived .

		I have been treated outrageously .

		I knew that I should be ; but I did not know that I should be treated so without even being listened to . ''

		I place before the eyes of every one the utter - ances which have been attacked .

		I do not defend them .

		Let them be their own defense . ''

		I will add only one word .

		Within the last year I have found myself very rich in enemies .

		I have this to say to them : they may hate me ; they will not succeed in making me hate them .

		My business is not with them .

		My task is to speak the words which I see to be just and humane .

		Whether that pleases or irritates is no concern of mine .

		I know that the words once spoken will make their own way .

		I sow them in a soil drenched with blood .

		I have full confidence in the harvest . ''

		THE FATE OF `` NOTES AND QUERIES '' still hangs in the balance .

		Suffering like many other periodicals from the withering blight now afflicting all the world , and
Europe	LOCATION	especially , this variously useful and curiously enter - taining publication has found itself strait - ened so seriously as to render its continued existence a matter of doubt , though the latest tidings from its editor give hope of continu - ance , but perhaps under other and it may be less favorable auspices .

		That is , it may be forced to migrate from its familiar haunts at the
Athenaeum Press	ORGANIZATION	to new and less con - genial surroundings .

		Of course it desires to remain where it is .

		`` Whether this shall prove possible , '' writes its editor to the Lon - don '' Times , '' '' depends upon the amount of practical financial aid which can be brought together for the purpose .

		`` We can but com - mend the case to the literary men and general readers to whose service as its title sets forth ` Notes and Queries ' was originally dedicated . ''

		From the same authoritative source we learn that the periodical was started on the
third day of November , 1849	DATE	, by ``
William John Thorns	PERSON	, who a few months be - fore had written to '' The Athenaeum '' a letter asking the editor to open his columns for the collecting of miscellaneous items of the sort now known as `` folklore , '' a word in - vented by Mr.
Thorns	PERSON	and there used for the first time .

		It was largely the cordial response to this suggestion that decided its author to launch his now famous publication upon the stormy sea that makes shipwreck of so many similar ventures .

		But this craft rode the waves triumphantly from the first ; it engaged at once the interest and aid of some of the foremost scholars of the time , and for sixty - six years its good fortune has not deserted it .

		598 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 23	DATE	Its plan and scope made it appeal to both the serious-minded and the frivolous , to the scholar interested in the genuineness of the signatures to Charles the
First	ORGANIZATION	's death war - rant , and to the casual inquirer into the origin of the term `` pot-walloper . ''

		It has contrib - uted notably to the making of `` The English Dialect Dictionary , '' '' The Dictionary of Na - tional Biography , '' and the still uncompleted `` Oxford Historical Dictionary . ''

		With so honorable a record behind it , and so fair a field of usefulness before it , '' Notes and Queries '' should have all the support it now asks for in its time of distress .

		PERPLEXING PROBLEMS FOR THE CATALOGUER are of every-day occurrence in any large li - brary , and among them is the recurrent ques - tion whether a given volume often it may be a gift to the library , and it may take the form of a musty collection of pamphlets un - systematically bound together is worth the careful analytical cataloguing imposed by modern rules .

		To leave the volume uncata - logued is practically to discard it from the library , which would grievously offend the donor , if it be a gift , and in any case would seem to the cataloguer an unpardonable dere - liction ; but to catalogue it properly and no slipshod work is to be tolerated in the modern American library might require a day 's work , or even two days ' work , and the writing of a hundred or more cards .

		It is the special library , oftener than the ordinary public li - brary , that has to confront situations of this sort .

		Mr.
Frederick Warren Jenkins	PERSON	, of the
Russell Sage Foundation Library	ORGANIZATION	, gives us in his current Report a hint of what it means to catalogue such a collection .

		He says : '' Even on a conservative basis , fine analytics and many cards are necessary in the catalogue of the special library .

		As example : the number of cards made for four small sets may illus - trate : For the United States Report on Con - dition of Woman and Child Wage-Earners in 19 volumes , 82 cards were made ; for 4 vol - umes of the
National Child Labor Committee	ORGANIZATION	publications , 375 cards ; for 8 volumes of the
Russell Sage Foundation	ORGANIZATION	pamphlet publica - tions , 396 cards ; and for 9 volumes of the
New York State Charities Aid Association	ORGANIZATION	publications , 514 cards .

		A single book occa - sionally requires many cards to bring out its contents properly in the catalogue .

		The ' Child in the
City	LOCATION	/ published under the aus - pices of the
Chicago Child Welfare Exhibit	ORGANIZATION	, required 88 cards , while for
Kelynack	ORGANIZATION	's ` De - fective Children ' 82 cards were made .

		The number of analytics to be made is a difficult question to decide , and suggestions are always welcome . ''

		It would be of some interest and perhaps also of some practical value to have reports from cataloguers on their highest rec - ord for cards required by single volumes and by series or sets .

		Useful suggestions might accompany these reports .

		.

		THE SHAKESPEARE TERCENTENARY , planned for next
April	DATE	, when three hundred years will have passed since the poet 's death , should be a nation-wide if not a world-wide success , unless the energies of the
Drama League of America	ORGANIZATION	to that end have been misdirected .

		Shakespeare 's own country seems likely to be engaged at that time in a sterner business than the presentation of pageants and the glorification of the Elizabethan age the more 's the pity !

		and there is hence the greater reason why our people should exert themselves to signalize the occasion .

		In '' Bul - letin No. 2 '' issued by the
Drama League	ORGANIZATION	are given all sorts of helpful suggestions for those planning Shakespeare celebrations ; and gen - erous offers of further aid and advice are made to all interested .

		Inquiries may be ad - dressed to 736 Marquette Building ,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		On the subject of cooperation on the part of libraries , the Bulletin says that an extensive annotated bibliography and a similar smaller list are being prepared by the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	for the assistance of schools and clubs and societies planning celebrations , and continues : '' In this connection the part to be played by libraries -LRB- to which many librarians are much alive -RRB- may be touched upon .

		Many will make a special feature of Shakespeare shelves and collections , providing in particu - lar for the use of schools the collections recom - mended in the bibliographies referred to .

		Some -LRB- e. g. ,
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- will have courses of lec - tures by specialists ; some , exhibits of Shake - speareana . ''

		A national committee and a national memorial are among the interesting probabilities and possibilities touched upon in this notable Bulletin .

		THE HISTORY OP A LINCOLN MANUSCRIPT is made public for the first time in the preface to a small book containing the lecture on `` Discoveries and Inventions '' which Lincoln delivered in a number of
Illinois	LOCATION	towns , in - cluding
Springfield	LOCATION	, a short time before his election to the presidency .

		Mr.
John Howell	PERSON	of
San Francisco	LOCATION	now puts this interesting address between the covers of a book , and publishes a `` memorandum '' concerning it from the late Dr.
Samuel H. Melvin	PERSON	, into whose possession the autograph manuscript had come in the following manner : '' In the
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 599 month of
February , 1861	DATE	, being at that time a resident of
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, I called one evening at the residence of my friend , Dr.
John Todd	PERSON	.

		The doctor was an uncle of Mrs.
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	.

		While there Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	came in , bringing with him a well-filled satchel , remarking as he set it down that it contained his literary bureau .

		Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	remained some fifteen or twenty minutes , con - versing mainly about the details of his pros - pective trip to
Washington	LOCATION	the following week , and told us of the arrangements agreed upon for the family to follow him a few days later .

		When about to leave he handed the grip above referred to to Mrs.
Grimsley	PERSON	, the only daughter of Dr.
Todd	PERSON	, who was then a widow but who subsequently became the wife of Rev. Dr.
John H. Brown	PERSON	, a Presbyterian minister located in
Springfield	LOCATION	, remarking as he did so that he would leave the bureau in her charge ; that if he ever returned to
Springfield	LOCATION	he would claim it , but if not she might make such disposition of its contents as she deemed proper .

		A tone of indescriba - ble sadness was noted in the latter part of the sentence . ''

		Five years later , after Dr.
Melvin	PERSON	had taken part in escorting the dead Presi - dent 's body to his old home , he called again at Dr.
Todd	PERSON	's , was reminded of what seemed to have been a presentiment on
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's part that he should not return alive to
Springfield	LOCATION	, and was invited by Mrs.
Grimsley	PERSON	to select any manuscript he liked from the satchel above mentioned .

		His choice was the lecture now published by permission of his son , Judge
Henry A. Melvin	PERSON	of the
California Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, who is the present owner of the manuscript .

		ROMANCE OUTDONE BY REALITY is no new thing .

		An instance of inventive ingenuity that may make commonplace and wearisome the once amazing creations of
Jules Verne	PERSON	's imagination is now claiming public attention perhaps more attention than it will pres - ently be found to have deserved .

		Mr.
Nikola Tesla	PERSON	's alleged contrivance for projecting enormous volumes of electrical energy to a great distance without wires , and with un - paralleled destructive effect , eclipses the won - ders conceived by Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	in his earlier works of fiction , and makes tame that marvellous romance by Bulwer-Lytton , '' The Coming Race , '' an astonishing piece of work in its day .

		Readers of
F. Marion Crawford	PERSON	will recall the astounding things done with electricity by the hero of `` With the Immor - tals . ''

		There , however , the vague and safe indefiniteness of fiction-writers ' science left something to be desired in the way of con - vincing verisimilitude , whereas if the above - named invention is anything more than a newspaper fiction we shall ere long have some authentic facts and figures ; and if the tre - mendous effectiveness of this new scheme for coast-defence be all that is rumored , the toils and troubles of those now so busy with plans for military preparedness will have been , for - tunately enough , so much misdirected energy .

		The command of a force so powerful as to make war an impossibility has long been the dream not only of romancers , but also of sober scientists and it may still continue to be a dream , or on the other hand some such happy consummation as that depicted in the late
Simon Newcomb	PERSON	's remarkable romance , `` His Wisdom the Defender , '' is not entirely inconceivable or impossible .

		STAIRCASE WIT , I ' esprit de Vescalier , the apt repartee that comes to us too late , as we are going down the stairs , is possessed or may be acquired by almost everybody , whereas the flashing quickness of appropriate rejoinder that all would like to be masters of is some - thing born with one and impossible to acquire later .

		Nevertheless , education can do some - thing toward making a person fluent and graceful in conversation , and it can perhaps do still more toward giving him the mastery of a ready and skilful pen .

		Such , at least , seems to be the opinion of the writer of a rather curious little book that has just come to our attention .

		It is called `` The Happy Phrase '' and is further designated as `` A Hand-Book of Expression for the Enrich - ment of Conversation , Writing , and Public Speaking . ''

		It is `` compiled and arranged by
Edwin Hamlin Carr	PERSON	, '' and further com - mends itself by bearing the imprint of the Putnam publishing house .

		A generous sup - ply of short phrases for the three purposes indicated on the title-page is to be found in the compact little volume , though the advisa - bility of their inclusion is not always beyond dispute .

		For instance , among the conversa - tional phrases , `` It is a beautiful piece of industrial accomplishment '' may well be out - side the unaided reach of the average person , but '' Is n't that jolly ? ''

		and `` A capital idea ! ''

		might safely be left to unassisted endeavor .

		For '' Speech and Writing '' the eye hits upon `` An age crammed with war , '' '' The policy of military unpreparedness , '' and '' The patriot - ism of the common people , '' which have a certain timeliness ; and among '' Happy Com - binations '' we find `` Exorbitant prices , '' '' Rigid economy , '' '' Hard facts , '' and '' Shat - tered hopes , '' which also strike a responsive 600 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 23	DATE	chord .

		Mr.
Carr	PERSON	believes his book to be a pioneer in its way , and in truth the volume does fill a niche that has hitherto been un - occupied .

		A '' NATIONAL BOOK FORTNIGHT , '' described as '' a national campaign to widen the circle of book-buyers , '' was recently engineered with considerable success by the English Publish - ers ' Association .

		During the two weeks from
November 22	DATE	to
December 4	DATE	, the eve of the great book-buying season of the year , the Lon - don and provincial press printed daily columns of special book matter supplied by the Asso - ciation and consisting of original articles by Mr.
H. G. `` Wells	PERSON	, Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	, Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	, and other well known writers ; and classified lists of the season 's books were included .

		An elaborate and imposing Christ - mas catalogue , specially prepared for this purpose , was distributed by the local book - sellers .

		`` Although the war has not affected the book market so disastrously as many people anticipated , '' says the
London	LOCATION	`` Times , '' `` it has nevertheless added heavily to the handicap of an ancient trade which has been struggling against adverse circumstances for many years past .

		It has served also to emphasize the truth of the familiar words of
Felix Dahn	PERSON	, who said : ' To write a book is a task needing only pen , ink , and paper ; to print a book is rather more difficult , because genius often expresses itself illegibly ; to read a book is more difficult still , for one has to struggle with sleep .

		But to sell a book is the most difficult task of all . ' ''

		CARNEGIE INSTITUTION PUBLICATIONS are properly valued and made good use of at most of the three hundred and twenty larger libraries where they are regularly received as gifts , twenty or thirty substantial volumes being thus sent yearly to each beneficiary .

		But now and then a library thus favored is found to be remiss either in promoting the usefulness of these gifts or in acknowledging them , or in both particulars ; and such negli - gence brings its proper penalty in the drop - ping of that library 's name from the list .

		The current Report of the President of the Institution devotes some space to this subject and to the general method observed in the sending out of its publications .

		With justice it is maintained that no such indiscriminate free distribution as is often requested by the unthinking is financially possible even to so well-endowed an association . ''

		Its entire income would be insufficient to meet '' such demands , declares the President .

		But , he adds a little later , `` to meet the needs of special societies and of individuals , as well as of certain establishments , like the British Museum , which quite rationally prefer to purchase publications instead of receiving them gratuitously , all of the Institution 's pub - lications are offered for sale at nominal prices , which are only just sufficient to cover the cost of bookmaking and transportation to purchasers . ''

		At present the Institution has on hand about 126,000 volumes of its publica - tions , and the collection is valued at nearly
$ 237,000	MONEY	.

		THE AUSTRIAN INDEX LIBRORUM PROHIBITO - RUM , one of the by-products of the great war , has been steadily increasing from the begin - ning , seventeen months ago , and is said now to include several hundred works , large and small .

		As samples of what is considered per - nicious literature by the authorities at
Vienna	LOCATION	we quote the following titles from a late num - ber of the `` Amtsblatt , '' the official journal of the government : ``
Berlin	LOCATION	to
Bagdad	LOCATION	: New Aims of Central European Politics , '' by Dr. von Wirdstettin : '' My Adventures as Spy , '' by Lieutenant-General Sir
Robert Baden	PERSON	-
Powell	PERSON	; `` The Life of Jean Jaures '' -LRB- author not given -RRB- ; `` Para Pacem '' -LRB- anonymous -RRB- ; `` The Awakening , '' published by a patriotic
Czech Association	ORGANIZATION	in
Vienna	LOCATION	; a postcard with the Pope 's '' Call to Peace '' printed on the back .

		One of these books at least , Sir
Robert Baden-Powell	PERSON	's spy adventures , is ex - tremely interesting reading , as we chance to know ; if the others are equal to it , the list is worth keeping for future use when an anti- dote to ennui is desired .

		`` OLD NASSAU , '' Princeton 's famous song , comes into passing public notice at this time by reason of the death of its composer , Pro- fessor
Karl A. Langlotz	PERSON	, of
Trenton	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, at the age of eighty-two .

		He had in his day been professionally associated with many of the world 's leading musicians and composers , and had formed one of the orchestra led by
Wagner	PERSON	when '' Lohengrin '' was for the first time presented at
Weimar	LOCATION	.

		He held his famous Princeton melody in but light esteem , though fifty-four successive classes of Prince - tonians have sung it with enthusiasm and paid due tribute of honor to its composer .

		The words of the song were the inspiration of
Harlan Page Peck	PERSON	, of the class of
1862	DATE	, and there are few American college songs written by undergraduates that equal it in fame and age .

		Dr.
Washington Gladden	PERSON	's well-known
Williams	PERSON	song , `` The Mountains '' both
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 601 words and music being his work antedates '' Old Nassau , '' as Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	is a '59 man and the song was a student performance , as he has pleasantly related in his autobiography .

		BIBLES AND BOMBS , linked in ironical part - nership , are at present conspicuous among the products manufactured in and exported from this country , to the no inconsiderable profit of the manufacturers and exporters .

		That danger and death should create a demand for books of devotion is easy to understand ; and that the countries now involved in war should be unable to supply this demand is not to be wondered at ; but that the abnormal activity of the munitions-factories should tend to speed up the printing presses of the B \ ble - houses , with resultant profits of a magnitude not unwelcome to the latter , is a curious devel - opment out of the terrible tangle in which the whole world moral , industrial , commercial , financial , social , and even religious has be - come so inextricably involved .

		The sailing ships that used to clear from the port of
Boston	LOCATION	for heathen lands , with missionaries in the cabin and Bibles and
Medford	LOCATION	rum in the hold , were freighted incongruously enough ; but a cargo of scriptures and shells is worse .

		A NEW SUGGESTION IN LIBRARY-BUILDING comes from
California	LOCATION	, the pioneer State in more than one library movement .

		In the cur - rent quarterly issue of '' News Notes of
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia Libraries '' is printed a brief paragraph from a
San Francisco	LOCATION	journal , as follows : `` As the city has decided to use the municipal railway earnings to buy the library bonds , work on the building has been resumed .

		The sale of the library bonds has been slow because of the low interest . ''

		Thus the San
Francis	PERSON	- can who boards a street-car to take him to the library in quest of a book both gets his ride for his nickel and at the same time helps to provide funds for completing the library building accomplishing two worthy objects with one coin , which is infinitely more praise - worthy than killing two birds with one stone .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		SHAKESPEAEE AND THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		There has always been considerable fascination for me in the following brief passage from one of the less popular of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's great tragedies -LRB- '' Coriolanus , '' 1.9,79-92 -RRB- : '' Mar. .

		The gods begin to mock me .

		I , that now Eefus 'd most princely gifts , am bound to beg Of my lord general . ''

		Com , Take ' t ; ' t is yours .

		What is ' t ? ''

		Mar. .

		I sometime lay here in Corioles At a poor man 's house ; he us 'd me kindly .

		He cry 'd to me ; I saw him prisoner , But then
Aufidius	PERSON	was within my view And wrath o'erwhelm 'd my pity .

		I request you To give my poor host freedom . ''

		Com .

		Oh , well begg * d !

		Were he the butcher of my son , he should Be free as is the wind .

		Deliver him , Titus ! ''

		Lar .


Marcius	PERSON	, his name ?

		`` Mar. .

		By
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	, forgot !

		I 'm weary ; yea , my memory is tir 'd .

		Have we no wine here ? ''

		Why did Shakespeare introduce into one of the longest of his plays such an apparently trivial incident as his hero 's begging for the life of a prisoner whose name he had forgotten ?

		Most of the editors and commentators point out the fact that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	found this incident in his origi - nal , in
North	LOCATION	's translation of
Plutarch	LOCATION	.

		Deighton regards the occurrence as an indication of
Corio	PERSON	- lanus 's '' tenderness of heart . ''

		Gervinus refers to it as an indication of one of the '' good '' traits in the hero 's character , a '' fit of feeling in a god of stone . ''

		As far as I can find , only one editor
F. A. Marshall	PERSON	, in the ''
Henry Irving	PERSON	edition '' of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, has noted the fact that the drama - tist departed from `` his original '' in making Coriolanus forget the name of one who had for - merly shown him hospitality .

		Reference to
Plu	ORGANIZATION	- tarch 's Life of Coriolanus shows that the poet did depart from history in the matter referred to .

		Plutarch does not , it is true , give us the name of the Volsce whom Coriolanus recognized in the heat of battle , and whose liberation he would have demanded had not at that moment his pity been overwhelmed by wrath at the sight of his great enemy Aufidius .

		But neither is there anything in
Plutarch	LOCATION	to lead one to infer that Coriolanus did not remember the name of his benefactor .

		Assuming and it is an assumption that we have every right to make that so skilful an artist as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	knew what he was about when he adopted anything from his sources and that he did not reject or retain anything hap-hazard , it be - comes an interesting question why he departed from
Plutarch	LOCATION	in this particular incident .

		It will be noted that
Marcius	PERSON	attributes his defect of memory to fatigue -LRB- '' I 'm weary ; yea , my memory is tir 'd '' -RRB- .

		But it can hardly be believed that Shakespeare meant to tell us no more than that his hero was tired after the exploits of the day .

		The stirring speech that Coriolanus delivers before his General , and his demeanor throughout the scene after the battle , contradict his theory of mental fatigue .

		Besides , fatigue can not obliterate the names of our friends and benefactors from our memory .

		Why , then , does Shakespeare , while following his original so closely as to expose him - self to the charge of plagiarism , depart from it in such an apparently trivial matter as the remem - bering of the name of an insignificant Volscian ?

		That
Shakespeare	PERSON	did so is sufficient proof that the matter is not trivial , is not insignificant .

		To me whatever is in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's great works is 602 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 23	DATE	right , poetically , dramatically , and psychologi - cally .

		I am convinced that there is no more inter - esting or instructive way of studying a great artist than to see him at work , in the act of crea - tion , as he is remolding his crude original and giving it the breath of life .

		The little episode we are now considering affords us an opportunity to see
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	at work .

		The question we have to consider is why does Coriolanus forget the name of his sometime b > st ?

		It is evident that he expected to remember the name and that he is chagrined at having forgotten it -LRB- `` By
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	, forgot ! '' -RRB-

		.

		Can we explain this occurrence ?

		and what , if any , is its significance ?

		Thanks to the '' new psychology '' of Professor
Sigmund Freud	PERSON	, these questions can be answered without much difficulty .

		It is one of the fundamental principles of this new psychology , the only psychology deserving the name , that nothing in the domain of mental phenomena happens '' by chance , '' that all our thoughts and actions even the most apparently insignificant ones are determined by complex psychic processes .

		Just as there is no effect with - out an adequate cause in the physical world , so there is no '' accident '' in the psychic world .

		I illus - trated this principle -LRB- the law of psychic determin - ism -RRB- some time ago in a short essay dealing with Dr.
Rank	PERSON	's discovery of what he believed to be a slip of the tongue in '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	. ''

		It was there shown that every so-called '' slip '' of the tongue has a meaning .

		Such a slip is really only a slip of the attention , of the person 's ability to keep to himself what is going on in his mind .

		The censor or guardian that watches over the unconscious ego and stands between it and the conscious personality has been caught napping , and one of our secrets has escaped from its cell and broken through the lines into the realm of consciousness .

		The person guilty of the slip may not be aware -LRB- i. e. , may not be conscious -RRB- of the intruding idea and may not know the meaning of the slip , but that it has a definite meaning is cer - tain and may be discovered by the process known as psychoanalysis , or soul analysis .

		Now , the failure to recollect a name or word that one ought to remember and expects to remember is nothing but a slip of the memory , and is not accidental .

		It is due to some unconscious motive , i. e. , to a motive of which the individual is not at the time conscious .

		Our unconscious personality is always true to us ; it is franker , sincerer , and honester than our conscious ego , alas !

		our `` normal '' selves .

		It is true that our unconscious personality is selfish , without a touch of altruism , and un - moral ; but it is always true to us and to our interests .

		The unconscious ego seeks , above all , to avoid every unpleasantness , to exclude from con - sciousness any idea that may give the individual displeasure .

		It is only when the censor is asleep or napping that our selfish or wicked desires slip their leash and force an entry into the forbidden domain presided over by culture and civilization and hypocrisy .

		In most instances , however , they do not pass the censor in their true shape , but enter consciousness in some disguise .

		Conse - quently , the individual , the conscious ego , the host , is but rarely aware of the true character of his uninvited guests .

		That is why it is such a difficult task to know oneself .

		The ancientest philosopher of whom we have any record spoke wiselier than he knew when he formulated the fundamental maxim of his philosophy in the words : Know thyself !

		How difficult a task this is can be appreciated only now since the revela - tions of the new psychology are showing us what a filmy veneer over the true personality is the part of ourselves that we present to the view of the work-a-day world .

		To see ourselves as others see us would indeed bring us a little nearer to self - knowledge , but only a little .

		The poet would per - haps have sung truer had he prayed for the gift to see ourselves with the eyes with which we see others .

		But we can not know others until we know the inmost part of ourselves , our unconscious selves .

		But let us return to the consideration of lapses of memory .

		It must be borne in mind , however , that we are dealing only with the forgetting of those names which the individual ought to remem - ber and expects to remember , and the forgetting of which is accompanied with disappointment .

		Such a forgetting is really a failure on the part of the function of memory ; it is not a passive dropping from the memory , but an active expul - sion from the memory .

		It is now well established that just as we can concentrate our mental ener - gies to recollect something so we can concentrate those energies in the effort to forget what is pain - ful and disagreeable .

		This voluntary and pur - posed forgetting of our painful experiences , ideas , and desires , is called '' Repression . ''

		But , alas !

		the repressed matter is not always content to lie dormant ; it takes advantage of every oppor - tunity to escape from confinement , to enter into association with the rest of our psychic life , to influence our conscious life and to give vent to the emotion associated with it .

		It is this partial fail - ure of repression that is responsible for what the Germans call Fehlhandlungen , an expression for which the English language has no equivalent .

		By
Fehlhandlungen	PERSON	we mean such acts as slips of the tongue , slips of the pen -LRB- miswriting -RRB- , certain printer 's errors , mislaying objects , lapses of mem - ory , mishearing , misreading , misrecognition , and many still more complicated mental and physical acts , e. g. , accidentally letting something fall , for - getting to carry out resolutions , throwing a stone and '' accidentally '' hitting someone with it , etc. , etc. .

		To the uninitiated these assertions may seem ridiculous ; but let any skeptic submit himself to a psychoanalysis and their truth will be demon - strated beyond the shadow of a doubt .

		We all feel flattered when an eminent personage remembers our name , especially if he had met us only once or twice and not under peculiarly favor - able conditions .

		It is as though the great man said to us : '' You are of sufficient importance to have me remember your name . ''

		On the other hand , we all feel some resentment and humiliation when we find that our name has been forgotten by a person of some importance or by one who we
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 603 think ought to remember us .

		This explains , too , the comic effect produced on the stage and in books when the name of one of the characters , usually the '' villain , '' is distorted every time it is spoken .

		Shakespeare has noted , in `` King
John	PERSON	, '' that '' new-made honour doth forget men 's names . ''

		From what Coriolanus says '' he used me kindly , '' and from what we know of him , his profession , his valor , and his hostility to Aufidius , it seems that at some time he found himself hemmed - in in
Corioli	LOCATION	and that he owed his escape to the friendly shelter of the resident whose name he had forgotten .

		It might occur to someone to ask at this point : '' If Shakespeare followed Plutarch so accurately in this matter why should there be any doubt about this ?

		Was Coriolanus indebted to the Volscian and for what ? ''

		The answer to these questions not only contains the answer to our main query -LRB- why Coriolanus forgot the name -RRB- but furnishes a striking and extremely interesting illustration of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's method of work .

		Let us say at once that , notwithstanding the assertions of the editors and commentators ,
Shakespeare	PERSON	did not slavishly follow Plutarch , but changed what he found in accordance with his insight into the souls of men and the requirements of his stage .

		That the reader may judge for himself , I transcribe the following from Plutarch : '' Only , this grace -LRB- said he -RRB- I crave and beseech you to grant me .

		Among the Volsces there is an old friend and host of mine , an honest wealthy man , and now a prisoner ; who , living before in great wealth in his own country , liveth now a poor prisoner , in the hands of his enemies . ''

		Be it noted that in Plutarch the Volscian is '' an honest -LSB- honorable -RSB- , wealthy man '' and '' an old friend '' of Coriolanus .

		Shakespeare makes him '' a poor man '' who had befriended Coriolanus in a time of need .

		It now becomes apparent , if we bear the character of Coriolanus in mind , why the
Volscian	ORGANIZATION	's name was forgotten .

		He was a poor man , a plebeian , and it galled Coriolanus to think that he the haughtiest and the valiantest of the aristocrats of
Rome	LOCATION	was beholden to one of the common people .

		The poor
Volscian	ORGANIZATION	's name would have suggested his plebeian origin , and would have awakened Coriolanus 's inveterate resentment for the many-headed and rank-scented multitude against whom he can never cease railing .


Corio	PERSON	- lanus 's contempt and prejudice are so deep-rooted that he is blind to every spark of goodness in the common people .

		The introduction of Coriolanus 's failure to recall the
Volscian	PERSON	's name is one of those subtle and magical touches of which none but
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	was capable .

		The common soldiers , the aristoc - racy and the generals are , for the time being , enamored of the hero of Corioli ; his weaknesses are forgotten ; his titanic pride , his egoism , his impetuosity , and his contempt for the people are overlooked .

		Instead of these , they and we see only his valor , his honor , his dignity , his physical prowess , his fearlessness , his filial love , his domes - tic virtues , his lofty mind , his brilliant leader - ship .

		To crown all these , the poet shows us his hero 's freedom from avarice -LRB- in refusing princely gifts -RRB- , his gratitude for benefits received and bis gracious condescension in remembering a com - moner .

		Coriolanus 's renunciation of more booty than what he considers his just share , his generous tribute to the many '' without note , '' his modesty , etc. , as shown in Act I , and especially in this scene , are well calculated to make us even the spectators forget the hero 's weaknesses .

		To guard against this the dramatist ends the scene the act , we may say with a subtle reminder of the protagonist 's tragic failing his hatred and scorn of the people .

		Even at the climax of the portraiture of Coriolanus 's better parts , the poet gives those who have the eyes to see a glimpse of his one great weakness .

		The little slip of the mem - ory is psychologically and dramatically determined .

New York City	LOCATION	,

		A STRANGE VISITOR IN '' THE CITY OF DREADFUL NIGHT . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It may be a matter of surprise to your readers , as it dumfounded me , to learn that
James Thom	PERSON	- son -LRB- `` B. V. '' -RRB- is the author of an interesting tribute to
Frangois Rabelais	PERSON	.

		The essay , reprinted in '' Biographical and Critical Studies , '' was writ - ten , perhaps as a pot-boiler , for Cope 's '' Tobacco Plant . ''

		We get a hint of this origin in the author 's regret that the great abstractor of quin - tessence died before making the acquaintance of the '' herb of herbs , which is tobacco .

		Had time and fortune but made him acquainted with it , '' con - tinues
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	, `` we may be sure that tobacco and not vile hemp , would have been recognised by him as the herb Pantagruelion . ''

		The first , biographical part of the essay is of no value .

		It is based too much on the Rabelaisian legend which modern research has destroyed , but the second part is an amazingly sympathetic ap - preciation of the work of Rabelais .

		We may or may not regret that the sombre poet of '' The City of Dreadful Night '' did not imbibe more deeply of the Pantagruelian philosophy , '' cer - taine gayete d'esprit conficte en mespris des choses fortuites , '' but at least it is pleasant to find good evidence that the reading of Rabelais brought him some hours of gaiety .

		We think of
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	as one continually wrapped in gloom , who had left behind all hope and joy at the gates of the nocturnal city which for him was life .

		Yet he could see more than one side of the shield .

		`` Profound thought and crea - tive genius may wear a riant not less than a tragic face , or , in some instances , the one and the other in alternation ; and there are even instances in which one-half the mask has been of Thalia and the other of
Melpomene	LOCATION	; for wisdom and genius are not necessarily , though they are more fre - quently , grave .

		Democritus the laugher seems to have been a philosopher yet more subtle than Heraclitus the weeper .

		.

		and Aristophanes ^ I suppose , had at least as much imaginative genius as Euripides . ''

		As bits of well-phrased and effective criticism , I may cite the following .

		Contrasting the satire of 604 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 23	DATE	Swift and Rabelais ,
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	says : '' Both see with a vision that can not be muffled through all the hypocrisies and falsehoods , all the faults and follies of mankind ; but the scorn of Rabelais rolls out in jolly laughter , while the scorn of Swift is a saeva indignatio the one is vented in wine , the other in vitriol . ''

		Again , speaking of the inex - haustible exuberance of the Frenchman 's vocabu - lary , he says : '' I remember reading somewhere of two
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	or
Cambridge	LOCATION	professors discussing whether Shakespeare or
Milton	PERSON	had the greater command of language , when one remarked con - clusively : ` Why , in half-an-hour
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	would have slanged
Milton	PERSON	into a ditch ! '

		I take it that Rabelais would have slanged
Racine	LOCATION	into a ditch in about five minutes . ''

		I have rarely seen a more Gargantuan blow dealt to French classi - cism , which , when it deigned to speak of Rabelais at all , treated his book as an inexplicable enigma .

		Possibly
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	was thinking of Rabelais when he wrote in his '' Proem '' : '' O antique fables !

		beautiful and bright , And joyous with the joyous youth of yore ; O antique fables !

		for a little light Of that which shineth in you evermore , To cleanse the dimness from our weary eyes , And bathe our old world with a new surprise Of golden dawn entrancing sea and shore . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The following paragraphs from the ``
Japan	LOCATION	Times '' of
October 13	DATE	will serve to give an idea of what
Japan	LOCATION	reads .

		The '' publication market '' mentioned therein is a yearly affair . ''

		The result of the publication market in autumn is the barometer as to what books are favoured by the people in this country .

		This season at the
Tokiwa	LOCATION	- kadan Restaurant ,
Uyeno	LOCATION	, for four days between the 7th and llth inst , 184 publishers of the
Tokyo	LOCATION	Pub - lishers ' Guild placed their publications on the market .

		Over 300 booksellers are reported to have come up from
Formosa	ORGANIZATION	,
Korea	LOCATION	,
Manchuria	LOCATION	, and the
Loochoo	LOCATION	islands as well as from various parts of
Japan	LOCATION	proper to enjoy the benefits offered by the market .

		The sale for four days totalled some
170,000 yen	MONEY	-LSB-
$ 85,000	MONEY	-RSB- , of which such leading publishers as the
Maruzen	ORGANIZATION	, Hakubun-kan ,
Okura	LOCATION	, Eikugo-kan , and Fuzanbo se - cured each more than ten thousand yen -LSB-
$ 5,000	MONEY	-RSB- . ''

		Publications dealing with popular science have enjoyed the keenest demand ; next come those relating to popular history and geography ; and the linguistic literature and dictionaries , especially the German - Japanese Dictionary by Prof.
Tobari	PERSON	, have expe - rienced a warm welcome .

		That the
German-Japanese Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	has increased in favour may be due to the European war . ''

		So-called small series editions and detective sto - ries have seen their day and are now not found even on the auction list .

		Novels and romances are quite unpopular .

		As for the works of Mr.
Eabindranath Tagore	PERSON	, the keen demand for them ceased with the confirmation of the rumour that he would give up his intended visit to this country . ''

		I should also like to call attention to a monu - mental work now approaching publication , as described in the ''
Japan	LOCATION	Times '' of
October 21	DATE	.

		`` Every country in
Europe	LOCATION	has a trustworthy , exhaustive dictionary of its language , but it is a matter of great regret that
Japan	LOCATION	has not been bene - fited by such an acquisition .

		This inconvenience will be removed by the ' Japanese Lexicon ' which has passed all stages of compilation , thanks to the 15 .

		years ' assiduous application of Prof.
Uyeda	PERSON	of the
Tokyo Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	and Prof.
Matsui	PERSON	of the
Tokyo Higher Normal School	ORGANIZATION	.

		This invaluable work will be published in four volumes , the first having already passed the last proof-reading , while the other three volumes will be issued within three years from next year .

		`` Last

		The function was attended by

		Minister
Takata	PERSON	paid a glowing tribute to the guests of honour , emphasising the fact that there has been hitherto no reliable dictionary of the Japanese language , especially for foreign students , but that the new dictionary by the two scholars will efficiently fill up the gap . ''

		Then followed the Premier 's address , in which he recounted that the first dictionary compiled in the Orient was that completed in the reign of the
Chinese Emperor Shih	ORGANIZATION	, its vocabulary , however , containing only 1,200 words .

		The
Kanghsi Lexicon	ORGANIZATION	, an authori - tative Chinese dictionary , was compiled in the early stages of the Ching dynasty and comprised some 70,000 words .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Among those of your readers as keenly inter - ested as I in Professor
Showerman	PERSON	's delightful I am tempted to say , delicious review of '' Modern Painting , '' by Mr.
Willard Huntington Wright	PERSON	, in your issue of
Nov. 25	DATE	, there may be some who are unacquainted with , or who have forgotten , the sentences with which Mr.
Birge Harrison	PERSON	closes the fifth chapter of his book on '' Landscape Painting '' : '' When I try to draw aside the veil , and peer into the mists of the future , I seem to see another art , less material , more akin to the pure spirit of music ; an art stripped of all that is gross and material ; an art in which abstract beauty alone shall rule .

		In this new art values may very possibly be unnecessary , and all will be stated in terms of beautiful color . ''

		This is not yet , however ; and any art which is to endure must be true to the spirit of its own age . ''

		This prophecy was uttered five years ago .

		There - are few , Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's '' Modern Painting '' to the contrary , who believe the prophecy realized at this time .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 605 EXEGI MONUMENTTJM : RUPERT BROOKE .

		* `` The real artist , who knew what he was imitating , would be interested in realities and not in imitations ; and would leave , as memo - rials of himself , works many and fair ; and , instead of being the author of encomiums , he would prefer to be the theme of them . ''

		These words of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, true at all times , were never more evidently true than now .

		To write poetry , to think about poetry when half the world is in the agony of dissolution ; when men to whom life looks as fair and tastes as sweet as to us face death hourly with a smile ; when what we have known as civilization seems to be reeling back to the barbarism whence it sprang , and we know not what new earth may at last emerge from the chaos over which the powers of darkness and not the Spirit of God are moving ; to deal with poetry at a time like this , we feel and justly feel , requires an apology .

		It will evidently be no `` idle singer of an empty day '' that can engage us at such an hour .

		It will be poetry that is sincere and profound , that expresses what our life veritably is poetry , in a word , that is real .

		And even such poetry may be postponed to happier days , days less urgent , less solemn , on whose fortune hang less vital issues .

		But if , in our search for something that will distract our minds for an instant from the horrors that obsess them , we should come upon noble poetry which has been translated into heroic deed , upon this we may dwell without accusing thoughts .

		`` This , '' we say , `` is suited to the hour . ''

		And such poetry we find in the verse of
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here is a monument not of song only , but of glorious act , and not of act only , but of sacred song .

		Here is an artist who was '' in - terested in realities , not in imitations , '' and has left behind him , as memorials of himself , works , not indeed many , but very fair .

		The brief record of the poet 's life is by this time well known .

		Born into a cultivated family , endowed with unusual physical beauty and charm , trained in the best English schools , loved and admired by hosts of friends , recog - nized as a poet of great promise , he offered himself at the outbreak of the war for the defence of the land to which he owed the gifts that made life dear to him .

		He saw active service in the trenches during the futile
Antwerp	LOCATION	expedition , and sailed in

New York	LOCATION	:
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		of this year on the still more futile expedition to the Dardanelles .

		There is a certain pain - ful appropriateness in the fact that one who perceived so plainly the irony of life , the eternal disproportion between effort and achievement , should be associated with two such tragic blunders .

		He died of blood - poisoning in the ^ Egean on the twenty-third of
April	DATE	, at the age of twenty-seven , and was buried in the island of Scyros .

		One may apply to him Pater 's exquisite words concern - ing
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Claudio : '' Called upon suddenly to encounter his fate , looking with keen and resolute profile straight before him , he gives utterance to some of the central truths of human feeling , '' though in Brooke that utterance is far from being '' the sincere , concentrated expression of the recoiling flesh . ''

		For it is perfectly evident from his verse that he felt , without shrinking , the shadow of ap - proaching death .

		The group of sonnets pub - lished in
1914	DATE	after the outbreak of the war deals almost exclusively with this theme .

		Among them are the lines , now famous : '' If I should die , think only this of me : That there 's some corner of a foreign field That is for ever
England	LOCATION	.

		There shall be In that rich earth a richer dust concealed ; A dust whom
England	LOCATION	bore , shaped , made aware , Gave , once , her flowers to love , her ways to roam , A body of
England	LOCATION	's , breathing English air , Washed by the rivers , blest by suns of home . ''

		And think , this heart , all evil shed away , A pulse in the eternal mind , no less Gives somewhere back the thoughts by
England	LOCATION	given ; Her sights and sounds ; dreams happy as her day ; And laughter , learnt of friends ; and gentleness , In hearts at peace , under an English heaven . ''

		It is natural to allow our judgment of Brooke 's poetry to be swayed by the romance of his fate ; natural , too , to estimate all his work in the light of a single triumphant utterance like this sonnet .

		One approaches his collected poems , therefore , with a certain misgiving .

		Can one retain one 's critical judg - ment in the face of so strong a temptation to surrender it ?

		But repeated readings of the volume only confirm one 's first impression .

		Here is verse of great distinction , modern in method and feeling , but almost wholly free from the excess which blights the newer schools of poetry ; verse that is in no sense academic , and that yet belongs , on the whole , to the ancient , sound English tradition .

		There is , no doubt , an occasional grossness of image , an undue emphasis upon unpleasant odors and upon certain ugly facts of the body , 606 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 23	DATE	but this is the only evidence that the evil communications of our day have in any wise corrupted his excellent poetic manners .

		There are few metrical experiments , and those most successful .

		This poet has no need of license ; he has fulfilled the first duty of the artist , to confess the limitations of the medium in which he works .

		And in that medium he has achieved effects of extreme beauty : a delicate and varied music , an exquisite management of pause and quantity , an unobtrusive inven - tiveness of rhyme , happy verbal `` finds '' or revivals yet without a touch of pedantry , rich and vivid imagery .

		It is not , on the whole , simple poetry , though simplicity , too , was within the range of the poet 's gift ; but certainly the comparison with
Donne	PERSON	that has been suggested is quite unwarranted .

		There is nothing in him of the tortuosity of the metaphysical school and its modern imitators .

		There is , indeed , no point in trying to place the poet , to evaluate him by comparison with others .

		It is enough to determine whether his voice , now silent , was indeed an authentic voice of poetry .

		Yet I can not forbear to re - mark that in his best and most serious verse there is a grave stateliness that is all but Shakespearean .

		Such a sonnet as '' The Busy Heart '' would not be wholly out of place in the immortal series that deals with the golden youth and the Dark Lady .

		Nor am I afraid to say that it is a better sonnet , because a nobler and profounder , than the famous '' Since there 's no help , come let us kiss and part '' of Drayton . ''

		Now that we 've done our best and worst , and parted , I would fill my mind with thoughts that will not rend .

		-LRB- 0 heart , I do not dare go empty-hearted -RRB- I 'll think of Love in books , Love without end ; Women with child , content ; and old men sleeping ; And wet strong ploughlands , scarred for certain grain ; And babes that weep , and so forget their weeping ; And the young heavens , forgetful after rain ; And evening hush , broken by homing wings ; And Song 's nobility , and Wisdom holy , That live , we dead .

		I would think of a thousand things , Lovely and durable , and taste them slowly , One after one , like tasting a sweet food .

		I have need to busy my heart with quietude . ''

		There are , indeed , several of the sonnets that seem to echo the rich Elizabethan music .

		They have often the same motif , - the illusion and the futility of passion .

		But they are not echoes , they are voices , gravely uttering the poet 's own experience of life , his sorrows , his consolations , his shadowy but quenchless hope , his ecstasies flawed with the sense of their own impermanence .

		They have always a charac - teristic touch , a delightful difference , that marks them as the poet 's own , and they are always ended with a felicity that not even the greatest Elizabethans invariably achieve .

		Take , for instance ,
Campion	ORGANIZATION	's stanzas begin - ning , `` When thou must home to shades of underground , '' with its half-dozen lines of pure and faultless loveliness , and its impo - tent conclusion , and compare it with
Brooke	PERSON	's sonnet , '' Oh !

		Death will find me , long before I tire . ''

		The younger poet is here handling a theme on which it is difficult not to be remi - niscent of the elder , but the individuality of the treatment , the lightness of touch , the breadth and suavity , above all , the inimitable grace of the closing couplet make the sonnet issue triumphantly even from so perilous a testing . ''

		Oh !

		Death will find me , long before I tire Of watching you ; and swing me suddenly Into the shade and loneliness and mire Of the last land !

		There , waiting patiently , '' One day , I think , I 'll feel a cool wind blowing , See a slow light across the Stygian tide , And hear the Dead about me stir , unknowing , And tremble .

		And I shall know that you have died , '' And watch you , a broad-browed and smiling dream , Pass , light as ever , through the lightless host , Quietly ponder , start , and sway , and gleam Most individual and bewildering ghost ! ''

		And turn , and toss your brown delightful head Amusedly , among the ancient Dead . ''

		So much , though a good deal more might be said , for the poet 's manner .

		But what is after all the most vital aspect of the work of any poet who is worthy of the name is the ideas and emotions that it expresses , the revelation that it gives us of the man behind it .

		In the case of a young poet , nothing is so character - istic and revealing as his treatment of the passion of love , and here our poet is at his best .

		There is in much of his love-poetry a refreshing and unexpected note , a recognition of the truth that love and life are not quite identical , that those other minor `` loves '' upon which he dilates , the humble and fleeting joys of earth , may `` impart a gusto '' even to the grand passion , and that they may almost console for the lack or the loss of it .

		This is clearly not due to any want of virility or incapacity for intense feeling in the poet 's nature ; for there are poems in this volume that sing the ecstasies of love in a fashion
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 607 that would '' create a soul under the ribs of death . ''

		It is due rather to two qualities that are sufficiently rare in men of so ardent a temperament as his , a certain clear-eyed sense of the limitations of the great passion , and a kind of mystical reticence or remote - ness , a withholding of himself , a recognition of the finiteness of man 's heart ; and these two qualities save him from being a mere harp for the winds of passion to work their lawless will upon , and make him the master of his music .

		He knows that , Shakespeare notwithstanding , love is
Time	ORGANIZATION	's fool , that with the fading of beauty , fades also the pas - sion that it inspired and that idealized it . ''

		Oh , I 'll remember !

		but ... each crawling day Will pale a little your scarlet lips , each mile Dull the dear pain of your remembered face . ''

		In the height of his ardors , he can still antici - pate the coming of the inevitable day when kindliness shall take the place of love , when '' .

		.

		the best that cither 's known Will change and wither and be less , At last , than comfort , or its own Remembrance . ''

		He recognizes also within himself and regis - ters a certain incapacity to rise to the highest levels of passion , the sudden chilling impo - tence that falls upon a temperament too reflective to yield itself to the enthralling moment . ''

		There are wanderers in the middle mist , Who cry for shadows , clutch , and can not tell Whether they love at all , or , loving , whom .

		... Of these am I. '' It will not do , of course , to interpret such admissions too literally .

		They may be partly dramatic , or the effect of a fleeting mood of self-reproach .

		Yet they recur too often to be ignored , and they are moreover quite in char - acter .

		But if any reader is inclined , because of these Hamlet-like misgivings , to think of the poet as a lover without ardor , he has only to turn to such a poem as `` Mummia '' in order to be persuaded that the lady to whom these verses were addressed would be exacting in - deed if she were not content with such a poet - lover .

		`` Love 's for completeness , '' he insists , and since completeness is unattainable in this fragmentary and distracting world , it is necessary to postpone the highest raptures and rewards of love to another life , where love is bodiless .

		Like the romantic poets of every age , he recognizes the human limitation ; but unlike the less wise of them , he acquiesces in it , and this acquiescence gives to his work , despite its intense modernity , a touch of the antique repose , the Platonic mysticism .

		The sonnet that begins '' Not with vain tears , when we 're beyond the sun '' is an admirable exam - ple of that blending of poetic graces and felicities , half humorous , half sober , with a wholly profound and sincere idea , which gives his verse its rare distinction .

		And in this case , the underlying idea is unmistakably Platonic . ''

		Not with vain tears , when we 're beyond the sun .

		We 'll beat on the substantial doors , nor tread Those dusty high-roads of the aimless dead Plaintive for Earth ; but rather turn and run Down some close-covered by-way of the air , Some low sweet alley between wind and wind , Stoop under faint gleams , thread the shadows , find Some whispering ghost-forgotten nook , and there '' Spend in pure converse our eternal day ; Think each in each , immediately wise ; Learn all we lacked before ; hear , know , and say What this tumultuous body now denies ; And feel , who have laid our groping hands away ; And see , no longer blinded by our eyes . ''

		Touches of Platonism , indeed , are frequent .

		The delightful lyric , ''
Tiare Tahiti	PERSON	, '' devoted to one of his wandering loves , embodies a charming and whimsical application of the doctrine of the Symposium .

		Life is soon over , love is fleeting , all fair and earthly things end , not in the grave that were too commonplace a conclusion but in the world of Types of which the poet-philosopher tells us , the world of '' the divine beauty , pure and clear and unalloyed , not clogged with the pol - lutions of mortality and all the colours and vanities of human life . '' ''

		And my laughter , and my pain , Shall home to the Eternal Brain .

		And all lovely things , they say , Meet in Loveliness again .

		And there 'll no more be one who dreams Under the ferns , of crumbling stuff , Eyes of illusion , mouth that seems , All time-entangled human love . ''

		But alas , it is precisely `` the colours and vanities '' that are dear to us and make our fleeting life so dear .

		The world of Types is something chilly and remote to warm-blooded earth-dwellers , and hence the poet draws the practical and inevitable conclusion : '' Hasten , hand in human hand , Down the dark , the flowered way . ''

		It is the old cry of the poets , but touched in these verses with a mysticism , that half re - deems it from the charge of mere earthliness .

		`` Heaven 's Heaven , '' the poet knows , though '' we 'll be missing The palms , the sunlight , and the south . ''

		It is this oscillation between the keenest , most poignant enjoyment of the things of 608 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 23	DATE	sense and a realization of their transiency in relation to a world where they are transmuted into ideas that gives the poet 's verse its char - acteristic note , a note that is neither sensuous nor reflective , but a subtle blending of both .

		`` I have been so great a lover , '' he cries , so great a lover that his love embraces well-nigh all the things of earth .

		In the poem from which this phrase is taken , he enumerates the objects of his love , and a motley assemblage they are : '' wet roofs beneath the lamplight , '' `` the strong crust of friendly bread , '' `` the cool kindliness of sheets that soon smooth away trouble , '' `` Sleep ; and high places ; footprints in the dew . ''

		These things , too , must pass , like greater things ; but before they end , he desires to record his love of them .

		He loves them simply , humanly , with - out reference to their poetic value .

		He is capable of homely as well as of extraordinary joys .

		Not being a product of over-sophistica - tion , he has no inclination to treat '' the mere drift or debris of our days '' as if it were not .

		And yet there is often a lurking symbolism in his treatment of the most commonplace and objective themes , which is all the more effec - tive for being implicit .

		The dining-room at tea-time and the examination-room are filled for an instant with
august	DATE	presences , `` im - mote , immortal , '' beside the everyday or the grotesque beings who are visible and audible there .

		A night-journey by train is an image of that other mysterious journey of which the end is appointed , in which , '' Lost into God , as lights in light , we fly . ''

		The fish in his cool , crystalline world feels dimly `` the intricate impulse '' that disturbs man , in his no less limited being , with long - ings from beyond the element that engulfs him .

		Thus the poet 's homely loves verge upon , tend to unite with , his more exalted ones , as both are absorbed in the
Idea	LOCATION	.

		But it must not be inferred that all this high thinking and poetic feeling are un - touched by gaiety .

		Everywhere , even in the most incongruous situations , though with no effect of incongruity , the poet 's humor plays over the high themes with which he deals , and thus redeems them from the portentous seriousness which is the bane of the young artist .

		His most eloquent verse is sane and cool , never over-fervid or grandiloquent , and his lighter verse is altogether charming .

		It is difficult to imagine a more successful thing of its kind than `` The Old Vicarage , Grant - chester , '' with its blending of gaiety and gravity , beauty and burlesque ; and the poem called '' Heaven '' is a little triumph of satiri - cal felicity . ''

		Caliban upon Setebos '' is a profounder satire upon the incorrigible ma - terialism of man , but it is not more essentially humorous than our poet 's conception of meta - physics as imaged in the fishy mind . ''

		One may not doubt that , somehow , Good Shall come of Water and of Mud ; And , sure , the reverent eye must see A purpose in Liquidity .

		We darkly know , by Faith we cry , The future is not Wholly Dry . ''

		Yet the poet , despite his youthful gaiety and his rapturous delight in life , is profoundly serious .

		The transiency of beauty and love , the eternal antimony of the relative and the absolute , these are his themes .

		And it is diffi - cult not to connect them with the thought of early death which runs like a subsidiary motif through all the intricate harmonies of his verse .

		It is not the mere morbidness of youth , the shadow cast by its brilliant sun - shine .

		It is a part of the great adventure of living .

		He looks forward with curiosity un - assuaged to the freedom , the wisdom , the unknown joys , the taintless love of that ampler , that diviner world . ''

		There the sure suns of these pale shadows move ; There stand the immortal ensigns of our war ; Our melting flesh fixed Beauty there , a star , And perishing hearts , imperishable Love . ''

		Nor does this obsession of the brevity of life for it is no less issue in lethargy or in quietism ; but rather in the felt need of '' re - deeming the time , '' not because the days are evil , for they are a procession of beauty and opportunity , but because they are few .

		And so the poet , with the pathetic human craving for immortality , hastens to give what perma - nence he can to the crowding , evanescent loves , '' the scented store Of song and flower and sky and face '' which his spirit has acquired .

		There is no hoarding of joys , no `` stern , spiritual frugal - ity '' here .

		Nor , on the other hand , is there unbridled lavishness .

		All the manifold ele - ments of his vivid and eager life are in their place , and `` compose '' at last in an ordered picture .

		There is , moreover , little of the groping , tentative manner of young poets who have a lifetime in which to elaborate their image of the world .

		There is little of the youthful awkwardness that disfigures the early work even of a Keats .

		This is young poetry to be sure , with all the charm and vivacity of youth ; but it is ripe poetry , too .

		The Fates that denied him length of days gave him in compensation an early and a rich maturity .

		One can hardly regret the work of which his death has deprived us , for what he has left us is so admirably complete .

		The
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 609 monument that he has built for himself has the finality , the freedom from effort , the serenity of an Attic grave-stone .

		One may even rejoice that such gifts as his are en - shrined henceforth beyond the reach of change . ''

		We have found safety with all things undying , The winds and morning , tears of men and mirth , The deep night , and birds singing , and clouds flying , And sleep , and freedom , and the autumnal earth . ''

		Like the actors in the carven pastoral of
Keats	PERSON	's Ode , he remains immortally young , beautiful , heroic , flinging out his songs in the face of Death , never to be touched by the decay and squalor that overtake , too often , the loveliness of earth .


CHARLES H. A. WAGER	PERSON	.

		THE FEDERATION OF THE WORLD .

		* After the war , what next ?

		Shall we settle down to get ready for other and more dread - ful wars , or will it be possible to develop an internationalism that will render all wars impossible ?

		Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	does not underesti - mate the magnitude of the step which he advo - cates in his book , '' Towards International Government , '' but he tries to show that it is the only practical alternative to a condition which he hopes and believes mankind will no longer tolerate .

		In the first place , it will by no means suffice to '' crush German militarism , '' as the phrase goes , and then expect all to be well .

		As the author rightly insists , the thing to be crushed in
Germany	LOCATION	is not primarily an army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	, but a state of mind , `` a spirit of na - tional aggression , proud , brutal and unscru - pulous , the outcome of certain intellectual and moral tendencies . ''

		This condition of mind is not peculiar to
Germany	LOCATION	, but exists more or less in all countries , founded as it is on the baser instincts of mankind .

		Its manifesta - tions in private life are discouraged by every means possessed by society and the
State	ORGANIZATION	, but in national affairs it is made respectable un - der the cloak of patriotism .

		It is a long step forward to do away with this colossal vice ; but as Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	remarks , we are not enter - ing upon any new policy , but only extending to larger affairs that which we have long relied upon in lesser .

		Within the memory of those living , many ancient idols of respecta - bility have been shattered , and many estab - lished customs called into question ; many others are visibly doomed , and it needs only * TOWARDS INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT .

		By
J. A. Hobson	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		the courage and determination which the pres - ent crisis should arouse , to attack the greatest of all evils .

		It is not supposed that the world will live in amity as the result of a general increase of personal righteousness .

		Something more than this , something dynamic , is required .

		The machinery must be created for the devel - opment of international activities .

		Already much machinery of this kind exists , for cer - tain limited purposes .

		Thus we have the
International Postal Union	ORGANIZATION	, and numerous international societies of various kinds , some of which legislate for their members in regard to certain matters .

		Science is completely in - ternational .

		The fact is , that militaristic governments represent the survival of the ideals of a past age , and are out of joint with the progressive elements in modern civiliza - tion .

		The methods of diplomacy , no matter how able the diplomats , are doomed to failure .

		They are wholly undemocratic , and are left in the hands of men who belong to the ruling classes , `` a caste strongly entrenched in eco - nomic and social privileges and with few opportunities for gaining knowledge of or sympathy with the life of the general body of the nation . ''

		Thus the fate of millions is decided as the outcome of a game , in which both sides are ignorant of the consequences of their actions , and indifferent to the broader considerations of justice and humanity .

		This may be true , in spite of the fact that the par - ticipants are highly trained , extremely able , and anxious to do their duty .

		It is especially important to appreciate this point , because an apparently formidable argument against in - ternationalism lies in the lamentable failure of negotiations between the picked men of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Where these have failed , how shall others succeed ?

		The answer is , that we need for this work a quite different type of mind ; we need men who will study the problems involved , weigh the consequences , and decide upon the merits of each case with due regard to all the peoples concerned .

		Such men exist in sufficient numbers to make a beginning ; and when the Federation of the World is an established fact , men will be trained for this kind of service .

		It will no longer occur to anyone that he who strives for the welfare of humanity is in any degree injuring his own country .

		In all of this , there is no spirit of amor - phous '' neutrality . ''

		Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	's attitude is as far as possible from that of the academic jellyfish who believes that all opinions were born free and equal , and are equally entitled to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happi - 610 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 23	DATE	ness .

		The reviewer will suggest the phrase '' Dynamic Neutrality '' to express the status of those who are neutral in the sense of keenly desiring the welfare of the peoples of all warring nations , but who also desire to do everything in their power to bring about a just solution of the matters in dispute .

		This is the neutrality of a good police officer , who uses force only when other means fail .

		It seems to Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	that it will be necessary for the united nations to at least be in a posi - tion to use force against any group which refuses to accept the established sanctions , but in the course of time this type of settlement will be less important . ''

		Social , moral and economic pressure , '' as recommended by the
International Congress of Women	ORGANIZATION	at the
Hague	LOCATION	, would ultimately bring any civilized country to terms .

		To the military minded , this sounds like a weak remedy ; but imagine the consequences to a nation `` if all diplo - matic intercourse were withdrawn , ; if the in - ternational postal and telegraphic systems were closed to a public law-breaker ; if all inter-State railway trains stopped at his fron - tiers ; if no foreign ships entered his ports , and ships carrying his flag were excluded from every foreign port ; if all coaling sta - tions were closed to him ; if no acts of sale or purchase were permitted to him in the outside world . ''

		This implies a unanimity of world-opinion which has never yet been ap - proached , but it would come perhaps as the result of full and accurate information , gath - ered and circulated by an international body commanding general respect .

		Long before any such extreme measures were adopted , the questions involved would have been discussed from every angle , and their bearing accu - rately estimated .

		Knowledge and responsi - bility may be expected to bring clarity of vision : '' the agitator and the yellow journal - ist who work by spreading fears , suspicions and jealousies , and by imputing false motives to foreigners , owe all their power to the atmos - phere of ignorance in which they work . ''

		It appears to the reviewer that it is high time to organize a council or unofficial parlia - ment for the consideration of international questions in this country .

		Such a group might do much to clarify public opinion , by ascertaining and making known the facts re - lating to public affairs , and exposing the out - rageous misrepresentations with which the press is filled .

		It might also serve as a mouth - piece for the latent international good will which is at present almost inarticulate .

		Pro- posals for an international council of this type , to sit in
Europe	LOCATION	, are now before the public , and certainly deserve support ; but it is desirable , indeed it is perhaps necessary , to organize the forces of internationalism sepa - rately in each country , to furnish as it were roots for the tree which we hope will eventu - ally bear the fruits of peace .


T. D. A. COCKERELL	PERSON	, .

		MAGIC CHARMS AND JEWELS .

		* Since
Spencer	PERSON	and
Gillen	PERSON	made their ex - haustive study of the manners and customs of the aboriginal Australians , and Dr.
James G. Frazer	PERSON	showed in his invaluable work on Totemism the relations between the ideas of this most primitive of peoples and those of later phases of barbarism , one instinctively expects to find the origin of most supersti - tions in the customs of the Australian
Bush	PERSON	- men .

		In whatever direction this dusky origi - nator of ideas may be found lacking , it is certainly not in that of a universal belief in sympathetic magic , with its accompanying developments in the working of charms by the wise men of the tribe , and through talis - manic objects .

		Dr.
George Frederick Kunz	PERSON	, in his new book , '' The Magic of Jewels and Charms , '' has collected an immense amount of valuable material , which some future anthropologist with a connected theory on the subject of the relationship of magic to the development of human thought will be able to use illustra - tively to great advantage .

		This material is made doubly valuable by an indication at the foot of each page of the sources whence the data are derived .

		One looks in vain , how - ever , for any constructive plan in the work .

		The author has strung his facts together in an almost totally unrelated fashion , like a colossal necklace of every variety of stone , precious and otherwise , held together by a thread of narrative so weak that it breaks at times .

		A person of encyclopaedic memory may enjoy packing facts , so presented , away in the pigeonholes of his brain ; but a thinker demands an arrangement of data into some harmonious whole , which will stimulate his powers of thought .

		It is true that Dr.
Kunz	PERSON	often offers interesting observations , but these are sandwiched in like another sort of bead on the string , and are so frequently pre - fixed by a `` perhaps '' or a `` probably '' that their authoritativeness is greatly diminished .

Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 611 to magic charms and stones , an absorbing ave - nue of study is opened up by his labors .

		Some day , no doubt , not only the material here brought together but the researches of others will be drawn upon for a scientific synthesis as complete as Dr.
Joseph E. Pogue	PERSON	has furnished for a single stone in his elaborate study of the `` History , Mineralogy , Geology , Ethnology , Archaeology , Mythology , Folklore , and Tech - nology of the Turquoise . ''

		In the meantime , anyone familiar with the work of such men as Tylor and
Frazer	PERSON	will find many an inter - esting comparison suggested to him as he browses in this rich field of facts .

		When we read in Dr.
Kunz	PERSON	's book that
St. Apollonia of Alexandria	LOCATION	is said to cure tooth - ache and all diseases of the teeth , the reason for this being that at her martyrdom all her beautiful teeth were pulled out , we are re - minded that the primitive Australian was in the habit of knocking out a tooth or two upon the ceremonies at the initiation into man - hood , and that this queer practice was by no means a meaningless ritual , but was founded upon the belief that a part of the soul was in this way preserved for re-incarnation in the future .

		At least , so many similar customs and their evident relationship with totems and totemism seem to indicate .

		In this way human teeth , and also the teeth of totem ani - mals , became magical objects .

		Another link in the chain is supplied by Dr.
Kunz	PERSON	when he relates that in southern
Russia	LOCATION	a favorite amulet , especially valued for the protection of children and the cure of their diseases , is a wolf 's tooth , or an imitation of a wolf 's tooth made of bone and set in a ring .

		An - other phase of the mythology of teeth is shown in the custom of the Indians of
Equador	LOCATION	,
Mexico	LOCATION	, and
Central America	LOCATION	of decorating the teeth with precious stones , burial remains having been discovered with the teeth so decorated .

		`` Among the Mayans here jadeite seems to have been the stone principally favored for this purpose ; while in
Mexico	LOCATION	hematite has been met with in
Oaxaca	LOCATION	, tur - quoise in
Vera Cruz	PERSON	, and at other places in the land rock-crystal and obsidian . ''

		Thus from a point of view where the teeth were considered so valuable as the magic reposi - tory of the soul that they were knocked out for safe keeping , we come to the stage where their value must be preserved by magic talis - mans ; with intermediary phases , where an animal 's tooth or an imitation of it takes the place of human teeth , or where a saint whose teeth had been sacrificed was especially gifted in curing the toothache .

		These are only a few facts , yet how much they reveal of the processes by which a primi - tive superstition becomes modified as time goes on , until its original significance is alto - gether forgotten , and the attributing of magic properties to an infinite variety of objects seems merely an arbitrary fancy !

		This mul - tiplication of magic objects began in the most primitive times .

		Every animal , every tree , every stone , might be a totem .

		Sometimes the totem was itself the ancestor of the tribe , sometimes it was a personal guardian spirit , and then again it was merely the repository of such ancestral or guardian spirits .

		Another primitive idea , that of producing desired effects by sympathetic magic , i. e. , by some action which was thought to be imitative of the desired result , is , in the end , combined with the use of magic stones .

		Rain-making stones are among the most interesting of this sort , several examples of which are given by Dr.
Kunz	PERSON	.

		The Dieri tribes of
Central Africa	LOCATION	believe that rain can only be produced by magic ceremonies through the intercession of ancestral spirits .

		In one of these ceremonies two large stones are used . ''

		After a ceremonial in the course of which the blood drawn from the two chief sorcerers is smeared over the bodies of the others , the stones are borne away by these two sorcerers for a dis - tance of about twenty miles , and there put up upon the highest tree that can be found , the object evidently being to bring them as near to the clouds as possible . ''

		In another ceremony , rock-crystal as a rain compeller finds honor .

		To bring down rain from the sky , the wizards of the Ta-ta-thi tribe in
New South Wales	LOCATION	`` break off a fragment of a crystal and cast it heavenward , enwrapping the rest of the crystal in feathers .

		After immersing these with their enclo - sure in water and leaving them to soak for a while , the whole is removed and buried in the earth , or hidden away in some safe place .

		The widely spread fancy that rock-crystal is simply congealed water may have something to do with the choosing of this stone as a rain maker . ''

		Another ceremony shows the primitive rain stone as influenced by Christian dogma . ''

		Stone crosses have sometimes been used as rain-bringers , as in the case of one belonging to
St. Mary 's Church	ORGANIZATION	in
the Island of Uist	LOCATION	, one of the Outer Hebrides off the
Scottish Coast	ORGANIZATION	.

		When drought prevailed here , the peasants would set up this cross , which usually lay flat on the ground , in the confident belief that rain would ensue .

		Of course , sooner or later , it was sure to come , and then the cross , having done its duty , was quietly placed in its former horizontal position . ''

		While the mysteries connected with such magic charms as teeth , ordinary stones , and many other quite unromantic objects , can not be explained without delving into primitive -612 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 23	DATE	origins , it is quite comprehensible that an electric gem such as the tourmaline for exam - ple should impress a primitive mind , as it does our own , with the strangeness of its proper - ties .

		Here is an inorganic body in which the spirit can actually be awakened and made to do things before our very eyes .

		What Dr.
Kunz	PERSON	has to say of the tourmaline comes under the head of fact rather than of magic .

		He tells us that the electrical quality of this stone was first noticed by some Dutch chil - dren , who were puzzled to see bits of straw and ash attracted by some crystals of tourma - line that had been brought from the
Orient	LOCATION	.

		A belief in the magic properties of amber , not only as a curative agent , but as a gener - ally helpful sort of object to have around , especially in the form of a necklace , goes back at least to the days of
Thales	ORGANIZATION	.

		Much interesting lore in regard to this stone , as well as to another magnetic stone , the load - stone , has been collected by Dr.
Kunz	PERSON	.

		The part played by precious stones in magic lore is an infinitely varied one .

		Here , beauty furnishes the mystery , a beauty which `` flashes its laugh at Time . ''

		A spirit locked up in a diamond might be expected never to escape .


Volmar	PERSON	, in his '' Steinbuch , '' ufter enumerating all the well known pre - cious stones , proceeds to relate that '' There is one which produces blindness , another that enables the wearer to understand the lan - guage of birds , still another that saves people from drowning , and , finally , one of such sovereign power that it brings back the dead to life .

		How - ever , we are told that because of the miraculous virtues of these stones God hides them so well that no man can obtain them . ''

		To this may be added the witness of Saint
Hildegard	PERSON	of
Bingen	LOCATION	, who wrote that `` just as a poisonous herb placed on a man 's skin will produce ulceration , '' by an analogous though contrary effect , `` certain precious stones , if placed on the skin , confer health and sanity by their virtue . ''

		As Dr.
Kunz	PERSON	observes , since the discovery of radium and its effect upon disease , it is quite believable that the numberless stories about the cura - tive properties of stones , especially magnetic stones , are based upon scientific fact .

		The chapter about meteorites contains a melange of science and myth , not in the least welded together , but nevertheless full of in - teresting information .

		Other chapters deal with `` Fabulous Stones , '' `` Snake Stones and Bezoars , '' and '' The Religious Use of Stones . ''

		In these chapters we may wander through a labyrinthine museum of stones and gems , among - which we shall find stones that are purely figments of the imagination ; stones which sometimes were , sometimes were imag - ined to have been , formed inside of human beings or animals , and all having magic sig - nificance ; stones which were sacred to the gods of various peoples , gems upon which angel figures are engraved , until the reader feels as if wandering in some magnificent treasure vault of ancient story , with freedom to take all he can carry away with him .

		Only a tiny handful has been carried away and brought to notice by the present reviewer .

		Every reader is therefore advised to go and gather for himself in this treasure house of a virtuoso who , though he has not furnished a clue to the labyrinth , has surrounded every one of his gems with a halo of scientific and imaginative interest .

		The book is a large-sized quarto , beautifully printed on heavy paper , and is enriched with a generous supply of unusually satisfying illustrations , some of them in color .

		HISTORY AS IT Is POPULARIZED .

		* Between the professional historian and the irresponsible hack writer a great gulf is fixed , and rightly so .

		But occasionally from opposite sides of the chasm each attempts to hurl a missile at his supposititious rival , as does the author of '' The Road to Glory . ''

		The effort seems to call for a rejoinder ; although , in the interchange , the provocative champion is likely to go unscathed .

		Let us hope that the innocent bystander , totally unconscious or mildly curious , may be equally fortunate .

		Mr.
Powell	PERSON	complains that the highway of history is altogether too dusty .

		Consequently his `` road '' must be liberally sprinkled with blood .

		This remark is prompted by one of his recent letters from the war front .

		Evi - dently he dotes on gory scenes , but his reader is likely to become wearied with the excessive carnage through which he is forced to wade .

		The stone wall with its firing squad ; the deadly `` storm of lead , '' spitting forth pro- miscuously on the parched plains of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- possibly in default of more wel - come showers , but varied occasionally by a rain of arrows , javelins , and less familiar weapons -RRB- ; the miasmatic swamp , tropical jungle , savage-infested forest , and snow-clad mountains , all of these afford an interest - ing setting for Mr.

		His chief characters are indeed but pup - pets , faintly suggesting the best creations of Kipling or
Stevenson	PERSON	, but more familiar in the old time ten-cent '' thriller . ''

		Witness his `` two gun men , '' with bowie knives in their teeth , exhibiting the filibuster in proper aureole .

		But Mr.
Powell	PERSON	would have us believe that such men won `` three-fourths of the territory of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		They did win for themselves and their countrymen a hatred and fear , mingled with contempt , that the Latin - American does not yet wholly con - ceal in his intercourse with their more cul - tured successors .

		They paved the way for the later settlers of
Texas	LOCATION	much as the pesti - lence that preceded the coming of the Pil - grims providentially favored the planting of
New England	LOCATION	by ridding it of inharmonious natives .

		We do not deny that the era of the filibuster needs a more adequate treatment than any reputable historian has yet accorded it ; but it also demands a more restrained judgment than the present work reveals .

		The same over-emphasis characterizes the whole volume , and mingled with it is a prac - tice even less praiseworthy .

		In the bath-tub interview between
Napoleon	PERSON	and his brothers , Mr.
Powell	PERSON	introduces
Joseph	PERSON	's clenched fist , although
Henry Adams	PERSON	-LRB- his unnamed author - ity -RRB- does not confirm this little by-play .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's pages , however , abundantly attest the '' Roadster 's '' diligence as a copyist , espe - cially when describing the Indians of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		His propensity to exaggerate again appears in the assertion that
Harrison	PERSON	's encounter with the Indians on the
Tippe	PERSON	- canoe `` started an avalanche which ended by crushing Napoleon . ''

		The avalanche , really a tidal wave , was already started ; but it would be difficult to prove that our entire second struggle with
Great Britain	LOCATION	greatly affected its course , not to mention this minor frontier skirmish .

		Again
Jackson	PERSON	, almost unaided , achieves -LRB- in these pages -RRB- the `` conquest '' of the Floridas .

		We will not quarrel with Mr.
Powell	PERSON	's use of the term to describe this acquisition , but a more judicious view of the events leading up to it would include
Jeffer	PERSON	- son ,
Madison	PERSON	,
Monroe	PERSON	, and , above all ,
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	.

		Our guide does not greatly fancy `` suave frock-coated diplomats , '' and rightly assigns them the lesser part in winning our national domain ; but he ignores these gentlemen in '' high black stocks '' altogether too much .

		On the other hand , he errs as grievously in bring - ing his frontiersman into the diplomatic cir - cle .


Marcus Whitman	PERSON	, '' in his worn and torn garments of fur and leather , '' coonskin cap and all , is an heroic figure ; but he does not need a fanciful interview with President
Tyler	PERSON	and Secretary
Webster	PERSON	to establish this fact .

		Of course , such an interview affords a more dramatic climax to `` the greatest ride '' than a mere appearance before a missionary board .

		Accordingly our reporter , with a headline in mind , undeterred by an absolute lack of competent authorities , makes his story correspond with his wishes .

		How difficult to bury an historical legend , when it lies so con - veniently near the pseudo-militant highway !

		One hesitates to pursue `` The Road to Glory '' farther , although our guide promises strangely lurid stretches in
Africa	LOCATION	,
Sumatra	LOCATION	, and
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The failure to maintain a proper perspective nearer home casts doubt upon all his journeyings .

		With equal distrust we note that time and place mean little to him .

		Louisi - ana , the steamboat , and
Texas	LOCATION	are hopelessly confused in chronology , and so are
Nolan	PERSON	,
Hidalgo	PERSON	, and their contemporaries of the first chapter .

		The American people are noted for their rapid migrations , but two years is too short a time to introduce twenty thousand of them into
Texas	LOCATION	, even with the schooner on the
Gulf	ORGANIZATION	assisting the `` prairie schooner '' in the process .

		Winter crops may concern the present residents of that commonwealth , but in
1835	DATE	they influenced the volunteers that captured Bexar less than the Mexican consti - tution of
1824	DATE	.

		It was in behalf of that docu - ment , rather than for '' the flag with a single star , '' that the defenders of the Alamo died .

		One can excuse Mr.
Powell	PERSON	for not know - ing the Salcedoes apart ; but he ought at least to master the career of the
Kempers	PERSON	, and not put
Calhoun	PERSON	, perforce , into
Jackson	PERSON	's cabinet .

		Some years ago , indeed , a well known and fairly constant Democratic candi - date for the presidency urged the wisdom of inviting the vice-president to confer with the cabinet .

		But the American people did not then empower him to form one , and his stormy patron saint of the earlier day cer - tainly cherished no such intention to honor his running mate .

		Incidentally we might suggest to our chronicler that their estrange - ment affords a good story ; but in view of the present performance , we have no desire that he should undertake it .

		Avoiding diplomats on principle , we can not expect him to be accu - rate in regard to our affairs with
Spain	LOCATION	; but he should do better in respect to his filibuster - ing favorites .

		We can also , with reason , ask our con - ductor to pay more attention to his geogra - phy .

		He should not , even for a '' joy ride , '' assemble `` the Spanish Cortes in

		THE STORIED BUILDINGS OF
VIRGINIA	LOCATION	.

		* The colonial mansions of
Virginia	LOCATION	- have fig - ured in many books and have been the object of more than one special treatment , that of Mrs. Sale being hitherto the most complete .

		All of these yield in elaborateness and inter - est to Mr.
Robert A. Lancaster	PERSON	's `` Historic
Virginia	LOCATION	Homes and Churches , '' now pub - lished in a limited edition .

		The author 's statement that his book includes '' practically all the principal Colonial homes of historic interest '' is scarcely an exaggeration , and there are even many relatively obscure houses from times considerably later than the colonial period .

		With its three hundred fine illustrations from photographs , many of them showing buildings now destroyed or altered , it forms a veritable corpus of Virginian archi - tecture .

		Among the many buildings here illustrated practically for the first time , one may note especially Long Branch ,
Dover	LOCATION	, and , above all ,
Bremo	LOCATION	, as superb examples of the Vir - ginia mansion .

		The last especially , a joint product of the architectural genius of
Jeffer	PERSON	- son and the solicitude of its owner ,
General Cocke	ORGANIZATION	, deserves to be ranked with
Westover	PERSON	,
Mount Airy	ORGANIZATION	,
Mount Vernon	LOCATION	, and
Monticello	LOCATION	in skilful composition and beauty of aspect .

		A single very desirable addition to the list occurs to the reviewer ,
Jefferson	PERSON	's own sec - ond house at
Poplar Forest	ORGANIZATION	, still standing , unique in its octagonal form .

		Since Mr.
Lancaster	PERSON	is an officer of the
Virginia Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, and has had the assistance of many of the foremost historical workers in the state , his text might well be expected to clear up many of the doubtful questions regarding the times when the houses were built .

		There is in his pages , to be sure , a wealth of family history , the descent of the estates is accurately traced , the names of the builders are given , and there is much new material regarding the younger and smaller places .

		Of thorough-going research into the origins of the older and greater places , however , there is little .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 615 rowed word for word from earlier local works , even though the author has often neglected quotation marks and references .

		Mr.
Lancas	PERSON	- ter makes no attempt to give any sketch of the general development of Virginian archi - tecture , for which he has furnished such rich material .

		Indeed , throughout the text , he is less concerned with the buildings themselves than with their occupants and associations .

		It would have been interesting to trace the gradual transformation of
Virginia	LOCATION	houses and churches from the half - mediaeval character of the earliest examples to the neo-classic splen - dors of
Berry Hill	ORGANIZATION	and the
Monumental Church	ORGANIZATION	at
Richmond	LOCATION	.

		English styles had here their reflections , clearly , as in the florid Georgian of
Westover	LOCATION	, the strictly Palladian of Mount Airy ; more dimly in the delicate vernacular of
Mount Vernon	LOCATION	.

		With the inter - vention of
Jefferson	LOCATION	, above all in the design of the Capitol in
Richmond	LOCATION	, however , began a striving for something more universal , based directly on the scheme of the classic temple .

		In its literalness , as well as in its relation to the Roman cast of our early republicanism , this movement had aspects specifically Amer - ican , and gave us , for more than a generation , a distinctively national architecture .

		The amateur and traveller , however , will perhaps think that its very lacks are recom - mendations of the book , and will prefer it for its bountiful garner of myths and anecdotes and its ante bellum flavor .

		The beauties , the cavaliers , the ghosts of the old mansions are duly chronicled , and the reader is left to believe that
Jefferson	PERSON	wrote the Declaration at
Rosewell	PERSON	or at
Gunston Hall	ORGANIZATION	according to which he is visiting .

		Text and pictures alike are pleasant to look over , and luxurious make - up renders the volume an ideal possession for any lover of colonial days in the Old F!SKE KlMBALL .

		but the first masterpiece of a long succession of books which began with the birth of some - body and ended at one place or another , usually marriage .

		Among them have been some of the best English novels , ``
David Copperfield	PERSON	, '' '' Pendennis , '' '' The Mill on the Floss '' ; and there are plenty more in other literatures as well as English .

		But until lately it has hardly been a favorite form with us .

		It certainly has some disadvantages for the reader , in spite of what must be advan - tage to the writer .

		It lacks the definite impression that may be made by an abler han - dling of plot , although it does give one a wide range of opportunity and call for correspond - ing abilities .

		Mrs.
Norris	PERSON	's `` The Story of Julia Page '' begins with
Julia	PERSON	's very early days , indeed it begins with her mother before there was any
Julia	LOCATION	.

		It goes on , not until
Julia	PERSON	had become as old as
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, but to the point where she seemed to have got over the main struggles of existence .

		For all this , there may be very good reasons .

		Mrs.
Norris	PERSON	may have wished to show how a girl of poor begin - nings , who wanted to conquer , could conquer , and that in a fine way , a fine place in Amer - ican life .

		Or she may have wished to deal with one of the curious phases of married life , the effects of things done before mar - riage .

		Or she may have thought it interest - ing to present an example of the different standards by which people are likely to esti - mate certain of the shortcomings of men and women .

		All these things she does , and to do them she needed no narrower field than she has taken .

		It may be thought that she would have not only hit the nail on the head but would have driven it home more effectively had she con - fined her attention -LRB- and ours -RRB- to one matter , and not have diffused both over so broad a field .

		But it is likely to be the way of the artist to get more interested in people than in problems , and it is likely enough to have been so with Mrs.
Norris	PERSON	.

		At any rate , she has written an excellent book , full of very natural people of all sorts and also one rather un - natural one who by his eccentricity supplies the possibility for what is presumably the main thing in the book .

		Julia 's husband suddenly deserts her .

		We take the liberty to believe that his leaving his wife is as much a matter of convention as his coming back to her .

		But it takes all sorts of people to make up a world , and one need not deny the possibility of either .

		And if a young doctor was so emotional a person as to do the one thing , he would doubtless be quite emo - 616 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 23	DATE	tional enough to do the other .

		Only he prob - ably did more things of the same kind , so that the story of Julia Page was not really over when Mrs.
Norris	PERSON	ceased to write .

		What we do have of it , however , is throughout good .

		There are plenty of phases of life in it , some crude or slovenly , some refined and easy , some a curious mixture , but all confidently and not too minutely descriptive , giving an excellent environment for many real people who do this and that , have their own pleasure and busi - ness , and now and then touch on what are called the deeper phases of life .

		Miss
Canfield	PERSON	, in '' The Bent Twig , '' has as broad a view , but is more original .

		Mrs.
Norris	PERSON	deals with matters one has heard of before , rising in life , the double standard , life before marriage , and so on , and deals with them sincerely and truly .

		Miss
Canfield	ORGANIZATION	presents new and unexpected ideas as she goes along , and as a rule something that she has got out of life for herself .

		It is perhaps rather conventional to pass from a State Uni - versity town in the middle west to country life in the `` cultured '' east , and it certainly was daring -LRB- even late Victorian -RRB- to go on to dear
Paris	LOCATION	.

		But even the most original themes come from the same old notes ; and after all , people have to be somewhere .

		`` We are sorry she could not have left out
Botti	PERSON	- celli , but that 's a detail .

		Miss
Canfield	PERSON	has written a very fine book .

		At the beginning she appears particularly as a very clear observer , if sometimes a bit cold and even aloof and satirical .

		Her account of the democracy of the common schools would teach more concerning that interesting topic than many textbooks .

		Her explanation of why
Sylvia	PERSON	was not elected to a fraternity is a more incisive arraignment of college life than one often hears in public .

		But these notes and much more in the earlier chapters are preliminary to the actual work of the novelist , the work of following people here and there in life and showing how it stirs them .

		The book is called `` The Bent Twig '' be - cause it tells how
Sylvia	PERSON	's education was the result of her earlier life .

		She was born and brought up in what she subsequently called an unworldly home , adding mistakenly that it was artificial and a hothouse .

		Whatever it was , she would not allow herself to be hypno - tized into looking at things through their eyes ; so she had to get her own education in her own way , and she did .

		But she turned out much as her mother would have prophe - sied , had she been given to prophecy .

		In such a book one sees and feels the attrac - tion of the biography .

		It allows , it demands so much .

		Just as one of
Smollett	ORGANIZATION	's heroes ,
Peregrine Pickle	ORGANIZATION	say , peregrinates through a thousand pickles , so
Miss Canfield	LOCATION	can convey
Sylvia	PERSON	through a perfect Odyssey of possi - bilities , only whereas
Smollett	PERSON	had merely to allow his imagination to play about the recollection of the violent practical jokes de - lightful to the eighteenth century , Miss Can - field has to conceive the possible blind alleys in an easy luxurious life of to-day .

		She does it , too ; and if she does have a little of the aloofness just mentioned , it is not wonderful .

		There is something about '' culture '' in Amer - ica , whether real or imaginary , that makes it impossible for people to take it quite seri - ously ; it ought indeed to be worn lightly and humorously rather as a garment , with appre - ciation of its quality as a pose .

		Miss
Canfield	PERSON	understands the whole thing ; she is a little unpitying with the art she does not love , but allows herself to be indulgent toward the one she does .

		That gives variety and charm to what is otherwise immensely able and living .

		We will add no more encomiums , but they may readily be found in the advertisements , which -LRB- for this occasion only -RRB- are quite dependable .

		``
Peter Paragon	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
John Palmer	PERSON	, is not much like these two save in that it is the story of a life .

		It is lighter in touch , for one tiling .

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	is content to sketch his background rather lightly , and gives no care - ful pictures of the different phases of life through which
Peter	PERSON	makes his way , or rather , meanders about .

		He summarizes a good deal , and is content to tell on in a general way how things were without insisting on much detail .

		It is all done in a few touches , the family , the garden , school ,
Oxford	LOCATION	, the farm , the country house ,
London	LOCATION	life politics , theatre , and so on , but of course a fine sketch is something worth while .

		And after all , it is only the background that is sketched , doubtless of pur - pose .

		Peter is more substantial , and so is his mother .

		Nobody is very real , but they are real enough .

		Still , it is not a very adequate account of
Peter	PERSON	's life .

		There must have been a great deal that went to the making of him that we know nothing about , and that Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	does not care to tell us .

		He is intent on the man only in the way he felt about woman .


Peter	PERSON	was curiously fortunate in this respect , after all , the thing is a love story , curiously conceived , with the two chief people seeing nothing of each other most of the time .


Peter	PERSON	learned the theory of this very important , delightful , and mysterious side of life in a very happy way .

		`` At an age when the secrets of life are the subject of uneasy curiosity at
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 617 best , and at worst of thoughtless defamation ,
Peter	PERSON	and
Miranda	PERSON	talked of them as they talked of their bees . ''

		That seems nice , if somewhat unusual .

		The practical part came otherwise ,
Peter	PERSON	had to learn that by him - self , some of it at least , at
Oxford	LOCATION	, in the country , in
London	LOCATION	.

		Such learning might have been accomplished in various ways :
Peter	PERSON	was again fortunate in having a very strong desire for nothing but the very best .

		He might have been satisfied with that enemy of the very best , the good , or what seemed so , or even with the bad .

		But he was not ; he would have only the very best .

		It is a bit of idealism , after all .

		Not that there are no such men .

		There are , and it is well to hear of one of them .

		Some people take the easier course , and tell of more ordinary men .


Peter	PERSON	was an idealist ; he wanted to put his whole soul into his life , and that he could n't do , until he could .

		To make that matter clear , Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	gives up everything else ; there is not more plot than background , and what there is the return of
Miranda	LOCATION	is about as natural and probable as the end of `` The Vicar of Wakefield . ''

		Still , these matters -LRB- though proper to note -RRB- one can accept in such a book .

		For myself , I can not but feel how much more powerful the book would be if we had the whole thing fully developed , as Mrs.
Norris	PERSON	and
Miss Canfield	PERSON	have developed their ideas , all the people and places , all the detail , or rather not all but more than we have , a fuller and richer picture .

		But that was not Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	's way ; he is more delicate .

		What variety of phases and forms of human life and character such books give us !

		There is no experience so strange and out of the way or so common and well-known as not to find a place somewhere .

		Our earlier novelists put into such books all kinds of things that would amuse , or charm , or please , or excite , or per - haps merely relieve the tedium of labor or existence .

		Our own writers use it also to enlarge the sympathy and knowledge , to arouse our thoughts in life , to suggest ways out of hard places , and for the hundred other things that have come into fiction as its field has grown .

		These books we have been speak - ing of are examples : they give not only the difficulties and adventures of manhood and womanhood , but the griefs and joys and diffi - culties of childhood and of youth ; they give not only life in one place but in different places , not only in one social surrounding but in others , for few lives are so monotonous as to pass always in the same surroundings , so that the enlarging variety possible in other novels is necessary in this .

		Such novels give us the true form for this particular age of ours , certainly the great majority of the best novels of recent years come to mind as we think of the matter .

		Perhaps the form calls for the greatest skill ; certainly it gets it .

		Yet one must acknowledge , too , that there are dangers as well as opportunities .

		There is the temptation to lose all thought of what the academic mind calls a plot .

		`` Real life has no beginning and no end , '' says Mr.
Patrick MacGill	PERSON	, who cuts off '' slices of life '' -LRB- or something very like it ; I quote from memory -RRB- and whether that be so or not , such books as these are often mere collections of human experience , moulded only in a very general way by any preconceived plan .

		The books we have been speaking of are undoubt - edly modelled with care ;
Miss Canfield	PERSON	's espe - cially carries us on and on with a sense of necessity that tells finely .

		But a good many of the novels of this kind that come readily to mind are by no means so definite .

		Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's `` Sons and Lovers '' is a book of real beauty , but I can not easily see why it begins where it does or ends where it does , or why it has in it just what it has .

		Mr.
Law	PERSON	- rence probably feels that it should have ex - actly what it has ; but I -LRB- the average reader -RRB- do not .

		So with Mr.
Coningsby Dawson	PERSON	's `` Garden without `` Walls , '' which also had much that was beautiful in it .

		Why did it have just what it had and nothing else ?

		And the same thing may be asked of a hundred other books of later years .

		But such talk of plot or story may seem idle if the book be interesting .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	says that `` the assumption that the novel , like the story , aims at a single , concentrated impression '' is a `` fallacy . ''

		I think not .

		I think that a novel can make a great and last - ing impression , and sometimes does ; and that in making such an impression construction plays a great part .

		Hence we have from ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	, '' for example , or '' The
House of Mirth	ORGANIZATION	, '' a certain intense experience of the emotions that has few equals in the life of art .

		But this is no place to discuss such matters ; even , lacking that fine impression , and the story of a life generally does lack it , there is certainly much else that many people like just as well .

		BIOGRAPHY AND REMINISCENCES .

		On the eighteenth of this month Dr.
Lyman Abbott	PERSON	attained the age of eighty , and he looks back upon sixty years ' activity as preacher , editor , author , and lecturer .

		That period , rich in expe - rience and teeming with associations of mary kinds , furnishes matter for a goodly volume of five hundred pages , with the little distinctive but always alluring title , `` Reminiscences '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- .

		The son of
Jacob Abbott	PERSON	, familiar to our childhood by reason of his '' Rollo Books '' and his `` Lucy Books , '' and the nephew of
John S. C. Abbott	PERSON	, dear to our somewhat later years because of his entrancing '' History of
Napoleon Bona	PERSON	- parte , '' the author of these retrospections can not fail to appeal to our interest , and his chapters are indeed of that anecdotal , genially personal , ripely reflective , and , not least of all , moralizing and ser - monizing quality which was looked for with confi - dent expectation .

		Men and events of importance are introduced in every chapter , and the whole is a thesaurus of variously interesting reading .

		Por - traits and other illustrations abound , and an un - usually full index closes the book .

		In a '' foreword '' to his '' Memories of
India	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
David McKay	PERSON	-RRB- , Sir
Robert Baden-Powell	PERSON	, dis - tinguished military officer and head of the Boy Scout Movement , says : '' Perhaps the only re - deeming point about these ' Memories ' is that they are largely extracted from diaries and letters which were not written with the idea of anyone ever see - ing them except my mother .

		To some extent they tell directly against me , since they show me to have been just the ordinary silly young ass who enjoyed senseless ragging , was fond of dogs and horses , and thought very little as he went through the ordinary every-day experience of a subaltern in
India	LOCATION	.

		There is nothing very romantic or very exciting about them , and there is much that is silly , but at the same time such things have , I think , seldom been set down in writing just as they occurred to one at the time . ''

		But one must not be led astray by this English air of ostentatious irresponsibility ; for the young officer was evi - dently doing a lot of hard working and clear thinking all the time .

		The topics treated range from `` The Afghan War '' to `` Lemon Pudding and Mustard , '' through every conceivable inter - mediary subject .

		The author has a vivacious pen , and the ubiquitous black-and-white illustrations bear witness to a ready and gifted pencil , as do the eighteen colored plates also .

		In her eighty-fifth year Mrs.
Amelia E. Barr	PERSON	publishes the reflections and counsels and placid retrospections of her serene old age , under the title , `` Three Score and Ten '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Why she did not make it '' Four Score and Five '' she does not explain , but the book supplements her recent autobiography in a manner very acceptable to those interested in her spiritual experiences as distinguished from the more stirring outward events of her busy and fruitful life .

		That her faith in the things unseen shows itself here and there in her pages as something akin to spiritual - ism , need trouble only the carnally minded ; it is all beautiful and significant as she puts it before us with a sort of noble unreserve .

		Should any harsh critic of her book as a whole object that she had given us her best wine first , in her autobiog - raphy , and that here we have little more than the rinsings of the bottle , her admirers might fitly retort , '' Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer ? ''

		The `` Heroes of the Nations '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , a venture which for some time has provided an ever-growing collection of scholarly and readable biographies of the more prominent characters of history , seems to have come to a close .

		Two recent biographical studies , `` Alfred the Truthteller '' by Miss
Bertha Lees	PERSON	, and '' Isabel of
Castile	LOCATION	'' by Miss lerne
Plunket	PERSON	, which seem to have been origi - nally planned for this series , have been published in a somewhat different form and without the serial title .

		The new volumes are larger and more attractive , and have no footnotes ; otherwise the contents are of the same general type as in the earlier volumes .

		Miss
Plunket	PERSON	's biography of
Queen Isabel	LOCATION	is in every way worthy of a place in any series that aims to record the achievements of great men and women .

		Isabel of
Castile	LOCATION	is a per - son of great importance not only for the history of
Spain	LOCATION	but of the modern world as well .

		Her marriage to
Ferdinand of Aragon	ORGANIZATION	made possible the creation of the Spanish monarchy , which for a hundred years was the greatest power in the world .

		The subject of
Isabella	LOCATION	's career is one that readily lends itself to eulogistic treatment ; but the author can not be charged with having given the strenuous queen greater praise than her deeds have earned for her .

		Forty-five excellent illustrations , chiefly portraits , and a map of the Spanish peninsula in the
fifteenth century	DATE	, add materially to the inter - est and value of the work .

		Good company and good anecdotes are to be found in plenty between the covers of Mr.
Alfred Capper	PERSON	's reminiscent volume , `` A Rambler 's Recol - lections and Reflections '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		For thirty years and more Mr.
Capper	PERSON	has been a public entertainer , and has appeared as such before most of the royalties of
Europe	LOCATION	, not to mention the nobility , gentry , and common people .

		He is a thought-reader , and though he confesses he does not know how he does them , he has the reputation of doing some very extraordinary things at his entertainments , about which and about the cele - brated men and women he has met in his profes - sional journeyings he writes in a manner that few will fail to find interesting .

		His reminiscences are of the sort that the late
Marshall P. Wilder	PERSON	and Mr.
Weedon Grossmith	PERSON	have so successfully offered to their willing readers .

		The author 's por - trait and other illustrations are inserted .

		The reader of Mr.
Poultney Bigelow	PERSON	's '' Prussian Memories '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- might be tempted to accuse the author of discursiveness , were it not that the latter has disarmed such criticism by a frank avowal of his intention to be garrulous .

		His book
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 619 is disjointed , gossippy , at times irrelevant , but altogether delightful .

		Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	has that proper sense of humor which consists in seeing things -LRB- including one 's self -RRB- in their true proportions .

		Though he is a cosmopolitan globe-trotter , who has lived long in
Germany	LOCATION	and loved it , he acknowl - edges that the English-speaking world is his home .

		Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's acquaintance with
Prussia	LOCATION	began in
1864	DATE	, when at eight years of age he was put into a boarding-school at
Bonn	LOCATION	.

		His friendship with
William II	PERSON	was formed a little later , when the boys became playmates at
Potsdam	LOCATION	; it lasted until the publication in
1896	DATE	of Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's '' History of the German Struggle for Liberty , '' which gave offence to the imperial family pride and self - esteem .

		The sprightly character of these remi - niscences is greatly enhanced by the author 's pungent style .

		Fishing and finance , chasing the elusive dollar in Wall Street and the wild buffalo on the western plains , amassing and losing successive fortunes , and between whiles yielding to the call of the wild such have been the lifelong activities of Mr.
Anthony W. Dimock	PERSON	, as narrated by him with much vivacity in '' Wall Street and the Wilds '' -LRB-
Outing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Between a
New England	LOCATION	boyhood as the son of a country parson , and the vicissi - tudes of a Wall Street financier dealing in millions and controlling steamship companies and telegraph lines , the contrast is sharp enough to satisfy any - body ; and indeed the whole story is one of ups and downs , varied by the wholesome delights of life in the open .

		It is a remarkable record and an absorbingly interesting one , enlivened to the eye by numerous camera views , some of them the product of the author 's own skill as a photog - rapher , in which capacity he is said to have been the first to achieve success in photographing live wild animals .

		A distinguished Vermonter , son and grandson of eminent Vermonters , is introduced to the reader in the `` Life , Diary , and
Letters of Oscar Lovell Shafter , Associate Justice Supreme Court of Cali	ORGANIZATION	- fornia ,
January 1 , 1864	DATE	, to
December 31 , 1868	DATE	. ''

		The book is further described as '' a daughter 's tribute to a father 's memory , '' and is `` edited for Emma Shafter-Howard by
Flora Haines Lough	PERSON	- ead . ''

		The subject of the biography was born in
1812	DATE	and died in
1873	DATE	, so that to younger readers this chronicle will seem almost like ancient his - tory .

		But it is related almost wholly in the first person , and hence is not without vitality .

		A long list of '' decisions written by Judge Shafter '' is appended .

		Portraits and other illustrations are interspersed .

		Mr.
John J. Newbegin	PERSON	of

Saranac	ORGANIZATION	, and the death of Dr.

Stevenson	PERSON	's physician at that resort of consumptives , have directed public attention once more to the meteoric course of that rare genius during his too-short sojourn on our planet .

		Seasonable , therefore , is the appearance of Mr.
Clayton Hamilton	PERSON	's '' On the Trail of Stevenson '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- , a spacious octavo illustrated by Mr.

United States	LOCATION	. ''

		To
Vailima	LOCATION	and his death-bed the author does not follow his hero , honestly con - fessing that he has not pursued that trail , but holding out hope that '' some day we may see the Isle of
Upolu	LOCATION	arising from the sea . ''

		It is a good book with which to refresh one 's memory of
R. L. S.	PERSON	, his rather erratic journeyings , and his lovable eccentricities .

		That enthusiastic admirer of and writer on the scenic attractions of our great country , Mr.
George Wharton James	PERSON	, again asks his readers to enjoy with him some of these marvels , in a richly illus - trated volume entitled '' Our American Wonder - lands '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		His purpose , he explains , is , '' briefly and vividly , without entering into too much detail , to give the reader living glimpses of what
America	LOCATION	offers of antiquarian , scenic , geologic , and ethnologic interest . ''

		Mountain scenery , natu - ral bridges , stupendous glaciers , thundering cas - cades , prehistoric cliff dwellings , giant trees , native tribes and their tribal customs , with much else that can not possibly be seen from a car-window , are described and pictured in this alluring volume , which the author rightly thinks ought just at this time , when
Europe	LOCATION	is so largely closed to the tour - ist , to exert an influence in making Americans see
America	LOCATION	first .

		A useful map showing the regions described covers the end-leaves , the camera views are nearly half as many as the pages of the book , and an index is added .

		Mr.
James	PERSON	` si especial fit - ness for the preparation of such a volume has already been more than once demonstrated .

		Like a piece of time-worn tapestry , tattered and faded , and here and there showing the stitches of an attempted restoration , but a thing of wonder - ful beauty nevertheless , Mrs.
Elizabeth W. Champ	PERSON	- ney 's '' Romance of Old
Belgium	LOCATION	'' pleases at the same time that it awakens regrets .

		Its sub-title , '' From Caesar to
Kaiser	PERSON	, '' indicates the scope of the work .

		From dim antiquity it comes down to our own day when , as the writer phrases it , we `` tread the trail of the ` Devastating Hun , ' and look upon the results of his ' appalling world crime . ' ''

		Ninety illustrations buildings , ruins , portraits , paintings enrich the volume , which also draws upon many historical and literary sources for its substance .

		A collaborator , named on the title-page as
Frere Champney	PERSON	, has assisted Mrs.
Champney	PERSON	in her work , which is by no means the first of the sort from her prolific pen .

		One can not turn her pages and look at the accompany - ing pictures without praying with her that '' a federation of the world shall establish a universal republic , which will make the
Game of Kings	ORGANIZATION	forever impossible . ''

		Miss
Gertrude H. Beggs	PERSON	's '' The Four in Crete '' -LRB-
Abingdon Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the account of a visit from
Athens	LOCATION	to the sites of ancient JEgean civilization at
Knossos	LOCATION	,
Phaistos	LOCATION	, and
Hagia Triada	ORGANIZATION	.

		The '' four '' are '' The Western Woman , '' '' The Sage , '' `` The Scholar , '' and `` The Coffee Angel . ''

		The 620 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 23	DATE	Scholar 's informal and edifying discourses among the ruins give the book its body , whose naked use - fulness is partially covered and more or less adorned with the narrative of such light adventure as is usual to travellers in company by sea and land in
Mediterranean	LOCATION	regions . ''

		The Four in
Crete	LOCATION	'' is like other double-purpose books : both its purposes suffer from the combination .

		It is neither the best entertainment nor the best instruc - tion .

		However , it affords the general reader an easy and pleasant , if somewhat slight , means of becoming acquainted with the work of
Evans	PERSON	and Halbherr at their respective sites , and with the very interesting life which their discoveries have brought to light .

		The thirty-one illustrations , chiefly from '' The Western Woman 's '' camera , are very good .

		Languorous delights are by no means the sum and substance of Mr.
A. Hyatt Verrill	PERSON	's book , `` Isles of Spice and Palm '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		He maintains that the Lesser Antilles , which are the spicy and palmy islands referred to , are more bracing in their
summer	DATE	temperature , especially among the mountains of the interior , than are many of our northern towns , as of course they are milder in
winter	DATE	and of a more equable tempera - ture at all times .

		How to enjoy oneself sanely and inexpensively in one or more of the crescent of islets stretching from
Porto Rico	LOCATION	to
Venezuela	LOCATION	is agreeably told , with liberal accompaniment of illustrations , in this compact volume .

		Seventy pages or more of '' facts and figures , '' alphabeti - cally arranged , form a useful appendix , while the general information scattered through the book is not inconsiderable .

		`` Kipling 's
India	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
Arley Munson	PERSON	, is exactly the inviting sort of book implied by the title .

		There are forty-five excellent photographic illustrations , with two hundred pages of text giv - ing the passages from Kipling associated with the scenes depicted .

		The volume will make many read - ers keen to return to their Kipling , and has helped to make at least one reviewer keen to return to
India	LOCATION	.

		The publishers -LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have given the book a handsome setting .

		ART AND Music .

		The point of view of Mr.
Walter A. Dyer	PERSON	in his book on `` Early American Craftsmen '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is that of the collector of antiques who has yielded to the reaction towards '' Americana '' and interest in the things produced in the western world a century and more ago .

		His expressed intention is to study the crafts of those days through the craftsmen who produced the notable work of the period .

		It is a valuable service that Mr.
Dyer	PERSON	has performed in rescuing from oblivion such men as
Samuel Mclntire	PERSON	, the master carpen - ter of Salem ;
Duncan Phyfe	PERSON	, the cabinet-maker ; and the so-called ''
Baron '' Stiegel	PERSON	, maker of beau - tiful glass in the Revolutionary period .

		Of espe - cial interest is the record of the many-sided interests of
Paul Revere	PERSON	, and of the contribution which he made to our industrial art history .

		If Mr.
Dyer	PERSON	loses sight of the individual craftsmen in some of the other chapters , these latter are none the less of interest and value to collectors of '' Americana . ''

		Such chapters are those on
Duncan Phyfe	ORGANIZATION	's furniture , on
Windsor	LOCATION	chairs , clocks made by famous clock-makers in
Connecticut	LOCATION	and else - where ,
Stiegel	PERSON	's glassware , the silver ware of
Paul Revere	PERSON	, the work of the pewterers and braisiers , and the
Bennington	LOCATION	pottery ; all of these contain references to existing collections , warnings to col - lectors regarding counterfeits , and advice as to prices .

		The volume is profusely illustrated with photographic reproductions , chiefly of articles of craftsmanship ; and in addition there are charm - ing little drawings at the beginning and end of each chapter .

		Even to an unmusical person Mr.
Arthur Elson	PERSON	's encyclopaedic work , '' The Book of Musical Knowl - edge '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	ton -RRB- , is intelligible and interesting .

		It devotes itself to '' the history , technique , and appreciation of music , together with lives of the great composers , '' is well illustrated , and runs to the length of six hundred large pages .

		In the author 's words , it '' has been written with the idea of enabling the non-musician to comprehend the real meaning of the tonal art , and to familiarize himself with the value of the great composers ' works , the use of the instruments , the various musical forms , and a number of subjects of similar importance . ''

		Appended are a glossary of musical terms , '' a course of study , with references , '' and a full index .

		So comprehensive and popularly use - ful a work of this sort , in a single volume , has not , to our knowledge , ever before appeared in English .

		Such thoroughly Japanese arts as flower - arrangement and tea-ceremony are so strange to the western world that no little curiosity moves us as we open Miss
Mary Averill	PERSON	's lavishly illus - trated book on `` The Flower Art of
Japan	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , a companion volume to her recent '' Japanese Flower Arrangement , '' or , perhaps bet - ter , a continuation of that work .

		There seem to be countless schools of this floral art , though that called '' Ikenobu , '' dating back twelve hundred years , is the one in highest favor .

		So , at least , we infer from the book before us ; and it is to this school and one other , '' Ko-Shin-Ryu , '' that
Miss Averill	PERSON	says she owes her greatest inspiration .

		A skilful artist , not named but evidently Japanese , has given liberal assistance in making intelligible to the reader the fundamentals of flower-arrange - ment .

		There are seventy-five illustrations , of which one is in color .

		One hundred and ten grand operas , including , it is alleged , all that have been presented in the last five seasons in the four opera centres of the east - ern
United States New York	LOCATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia , and
Boston	LOCATION	and also half a dozen whose revival or first production in this country is an - nounced for the coming season , are given in out - line by Miss
Edith B. Ordway	PERSON	in '' The Opera Book '' -LRB-
Sully & Kleinteich	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The story of each is told act by act , each is characterized as tragic , comic , fairy , allegorical , sentimental , or heroic ; but all are classed under '' grand '' opera inasmuch as every word is sung and the recitative is usually
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 621 accompanied by the orchestra .

		Useful and care - fully verified data are given -LRB- not is given , as the preface announces -RRB- under each title , portraits of famous singers in costume are inserted , a list of composers is added , and welcome aids to the pro- nunciation of foreign names find a place both in the body of the book and in the concluding inde ^ x. MISCELLANEOUS .

		Unique in every aspect among the season 's gift - books is a thin quarto entitled '' The Ballet of the Nations '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , by the distinguished writer known as ''
Vernon Lee	PERSON	. ''

		Described on the title - page as '' a present-day morality , '' the text is a powerfully caustic allegory in which the Great War is presented as a grand ballet , staged by Death , with Satan for impresario .

		The orchestra is first assembled .

		Fear , with '' her shabby rest - less twins , '' Suspicion and Panic , take their places ; '' my Lady Idealism and my young Prince Adven - ture '' are next induced to join ; `` Sin , whom the gods call Disease , '' with her attendant crew of Rapine , Lust , Murder , and Famine , are not long in following ; and next come Hatred with Self - Righteousness , `` who pretend not to be acquainted . ''

		Two late-comers ,
Madam Science	ORGANIZATION	and Councillor Organization , at first taken by Ballet - Master Death for alien spies , are soon recognized as indispensable collaborators .

		Lastly appears Heroism , the foremost musician of them all .

		The nations then assemble , and to the compelling strains of the orchestra of human passions they begin their wild dance , in which they mutilate and dismember one another .

		As their efforts flag through exhaustion , Impresario Satan cunningly introduces two fresh musicians , Pity and
Indigna	PERSON	- tion , whose stirring notes revive the dancers to a new and madder frenzy of mutual extermination .

		This is only the baldest outline of what is truly a masterpiece of satiric allegory .

		The very essence of the present war , stripped of its cloak of surface appearances and befuddling sophistries , is here presented .

		A fitting and artistic '' pictorial accom - paniment '' is provided by
Maxwell Armfield	ORGANIZATION	in a series of decorative page borders , printed in red , and done in the manner of old Greek vase paint - ings .

		There is a striking cover design as well .

		Camera views , some in color , of notable private gardens in many parts of our broad land make up the bulk of Miss
Louise Shelton	PERSON	's sumptuous quarto , `` Beautiful Gardens in
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Serib - ner -RRB- .


Vancouver Island	LOCATION	, just beyond our border , is represented by two illustrations , and even
Alaska	LOCATION	has a brief chapter to itself , though no Alaskan gardens find place among the pictures .

		Imitations of European horticultural formalism , heavily adorned with marble or other stone con - structions , have been for the most part excluded from the book , which is designed '' to present , more particularly , another type of garden , demonstrat - ing the cultured American 's love of beauty ex - pressed through plant life rather than in stone . ''

		The garden as expressive of personality has been the quest of the compiler , and a good measure of success has attended her search .

		Striking in its title and thought-evoking in its contents , Mr.
Stephen Graham	PERSON	's latest book , '' The Way of
Martha	PERSON	and the Way of Mary '' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- is characterized by him as '' an interpretation and a survey of
Eastern Christianity	ORGANIZATION	, and a con - sideration of the ideas at present to the fore in Christianity generally . ''

		It is also , as its name implies , a book of contrasts : the way of Martha he considers to be the way of the West , that of Mary the way of the
East	LOCATION	.

		By the East the author means preeminently
Russia	LOCATION	.

		In
Russia	LOCATION	, which he knows as few Englishmen know that country , his book seems to have been written , and it contributes not a little to our knowledge of things Russian .

		Its breadth of view may be illustrated by this utterance , with which the volume closes : '' So two churches combine to make one truth , and the hand - maidens of the Lord ,
Martha	PERSON	and
Mary	PERSON	, are shown to be indeed two sisters , not only in kindred but in spirit . ''

		Twenty-two years ago Mrs.
William Starr Dana	PERSON	rendered a service to American flower-lovers who were not also expert botanists by issuing a manual that has since been taken as a model by many successful imitators of Mrs.
Dana	PERSON	's method . ''

		Wild Flowers of the North American Moun - tains '' -LRB- McBride -RRB- , by Mrs.
Julia W. Henshaw	PERSON	, is the latest successor to '' How to Know the Wild Flowers , '' its arrangement of the flowers in color - groups , its preliminary aids , its index to scientific names , and its list of common names , all being very much in the manner of that pioneer work .

		But it should be added in its praise that it goes a step further : it has many strikingly beautiful colored plates in addition to the simple half-tones , and it devotes forty-four pages to a '' general key to the families . ''

		The ferns and fern-allies , the trees , and the reeds , grasses , sedges , and rushes are taken up before the more important and more numerous flowering plants proper , these last , as already indicated , being roughly grouped accord - ing to color for the convenience of the laity .

		It is a valuable supplement , with some inevitable over - lappings , to earlier works of like character ; and within its own domain it can well stand alone on its peculiar merits .

		Few have practised more industriously or suc - cessfully than Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	the art of interviewing our country folk and reproducing the results in literary form , as is abundantly shown in his series of American travel books .

		Now he offers fresh proof of his skill by bringing forth a vol - ume of eye-witness accounts , taken for the most part from the lips of rustic narrators on or near the scene of action , of '' Battleground Adventures in the Civil War '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	ton -RRB- , a book that will appeal strongly to boys and also to many older readers , especially those whose recollections go back to war times .

		His quest for original material has taken him to
Harper	PERSON	's `` Ferry , Bull Run ,
Shiloh	LOCATION	,
Antietam	LOCATION	,
Fredericksburg	LOCATION	,
Gettysburg	LOCATION	,
Yicksburg	LOCATION	,
Chickaniauga	LOCATION	, Lookout Mountain and
Missionary Ridge	ORGANIZATION	, the Wilderness , Cold Harbor ,
Atlanta	LOCATION	, and the
Shenandoah Valley	LOCATION	.

		Aged men and women , white and black , have been called upon to revive their memories of the great conflict of half a cen - 622 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 23 tury ago	DATE	; and if it be true that nothing so con - duces to peace as a full recognition of the horrors of war , the book is a fit offering at this
Christmas	DATE	season .

		Mr.
Rodney Thomson	PERSON	vividly illustrates it with colored drawings .

		With the new year it will be half a century since '' The Dream of Gerontius '' came from Cardinal
Newman	PERSON	's hand , a noble poem barely saved from the waste-paper basket by a discerning intercessor , as the perhaps mythical account of its origin would have us believe .

		Fitting enough is it , at any rate , that the poem should have a semi-centennial re - issue in worthy form , and this re-issue is to be noted among the season 's publications of the
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Stella Langdale	PERSON	illustrates the vol - ume with ten drawings that well reflect the senti - ment of the poem , and Mr.
Gordon Tidy	PERSON	writes a bibliographic and appreciative introduction that fills half the book .

		It is safe to say that no pre - vious edition of this fine product of
Newman	PERSON	's genius can compare with the present one .

		Lincoln 's lyceum lecture of
1860	DATE	on '' Discoveries and Inventions , '' a discourse delivered by him in various places about
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, and in
Springfield	LOCATION	itself , a short time before his call to far more arduous duties than lecturing to rural audiences , is now for the first time made into a book all by itself and offered for sale by Mr.
John Howell	PERSON	of
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		Its interest for us now lies chiefly in its revelation of its writer 's range of reading and inquiry , in the proof it offers of his debt to the Bible for both thought and lan - guage , and in its excellence as an example of his clear and simple and at the same time sufficiently ornate , sufficiently picturesque mode of expression .

		A '' prefatory note '' gives the interesting history of the original manuscript of this lecture , and from that manuscript the lecture is printed .

		Mr.
Ian Hay	PERSON	, or , to be accurate , Captain
Ian Hay Beith	PERSON	of the
Argyll	ORGANIZATION	and
Sutherland	PERSON	High - landers , wrote not very long ago some lifelike sketches of schoolboy life for ''
Blackwood	PERSON	's
Maga	PERSON	- zine , '' and they are now gathered into a book and named , collectively , '' The Lighter Side of School Life . ''

		Mr.
Lewis Baumer	PERSON	furnishes a dozen good pastel drawings , here reproduced in color , to ac - company the tales or sketches , and the whole makes an excellent contribution to a class of literature that has been deservedly popular ever since
Tom Brown	PERSON	of Rugby came into being .

		This book is published in
America	LOCATION	by Mr.
LeRoy Phillips	PERSON	of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		It is a good gift-book for young or old .

		In the cab of a monster express engine , amid the glare and heat and din of a steel foundry , at the side of a leviathan of the deep just starting down the ways , in the power-house of a great electric plant , on the dizzy staging of a skyscraper in course of construction , and in divers other more or less perilous and exciting positions , Mr.
Joseph Husband	PERSON	has gathered the material for his `` America at Work '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a realistic presentation of the toils and struggles and dangers of men who wrestle with the forces not only of nature , but of nature and human inventiveness combined .

		The author will be remembered as the narrator of '' A Yean in a Coal Mine , '' and this second essay in the romance of industry will not lessen his popularity .

		He who seeks to array his soul , as Plato ex - presses it , in her own proper jewels , which are temperance , justice , courage , nobility , and truth , will find help in Dr.
Elwood Worcester	PERSON	's little book , '' The Issues of Life '' -LRB-
Moffat	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Nine years ' experience in watching the moral and physical regenerative effects of high thinking has qualified the author to speak with understanding and per - suasiveness on such topics as the following -LRB- from the book 's table of contents -RRB- : '' Keeping Our Hearts , '' '' Thought and Work , '' '' The Loneliness of the Soul , '' `` Revelations , '' `` Our Spiritual Faculties , '' and `` Religion and Neglect . ''

		To all devout souls the essence of religion is the same ; hence the cordial assent which thousands of read - ers of nominally different creeds will be able to give to the truth stated with the force of personal experience by the
Rector of Emmanuel Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		Three hundred and sixty-five little sermons , each a page long or less , and each assigned to a par - ticular day of the year , with a bit of verse instead of a sermon for Christmas , make up the contents of the gift-book entitled '' Every Day '' -LRB-
American Tract Society	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Edgar Whitaker	PERSON	Work .

		Each discourse is headed by a scriptural quotation from which it takes its keynote , and the admirable quality of brevity , of pithy compactness , marks every one of these sermonettes .

		An anthology of dog poetry not doggerel , but metrical compositions on dogs thirty-two selec - tions in all , by Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	,
Lord Byron	PERSON	,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	,
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	,
Louise Imogen Guiney	PERSON	, and later writers , has been com - piled by Mr.
Lincoln Newton Kinnicutt	PERSON	, and enti - tled '' To Your Dog and to My Dog '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Fine linen paper , broad margins , frequent blank pages for the insertion of additional poems , a space reserved on the cover for the portrait of one 's own dog these and other material details combine to make the volume pleasing to the eye and acceptable to the book-lover .

		A preface to the '' dear dogs '' explains the compiler 's purpose and shows him to be a discerning appreciator of canine excellence .

		A group of little books more or less appropriate to the
Christmas	LOCATION	season , and all suitable as
Christ	LOCATION	- mas gifts , must here be noticed with extreme brev - ity .

		Mr.
Harold Speakman	PERSON	illustrates in color and decorates in gilt `` The First Christmas '' -LRB- Abing - don Press -RRB- , being the scriptural account of the birth of Christ .

		The book is a little gem of art , beautifully printed and pleasing in every respect .

		`` The Glad Hand , and Other Grips on Life '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , by Mr.
Humphrey J. Desmond	PERSON	, com - bines the cheeriness expected and desired at this season with the reflective wisdom welcome at all times .

		Its arrangement is by non-consecutive paragraphs grouped under nine headings , sugges - tive of the `` infinitely repellent particles '' of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's essays .

		A diverting little book has been made by Mr.
Laurens Maynard	PERSON	in the shape of a collection of poems having to do with evolution .

		1915 -RSB- THE DIAL 623 '' Evolution : A Fantasy , '' by Mr.
Langdon Smith	PERSON	, opens the book and gives it its title ; and this familiar skit -LRB- it begins , '' When you were a tad - pole and I was a fish '' -RRB- is followed by a variety of verses , both frolicsome and serious , by various authors .

		-LRB-
John W. Luce & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		`` Cupid 's Capers '' -LRB- Button -RRB- is a book of rollicking verse by Miss
Lillian Gardner	PERSON	, illustrated in color , and amusingly descriptive of the pleasures and pains of love .

		Mrs.
Helen S. Woodruff	PERSON	's Christmas story is this year entitled '' Mr. Doctor Man '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- , being the tale of a philanthropic physi - cian who , after years of unselfish service , finds his old sweetheart , and all ends happily .

		A winsome child patient plays a leading part in the little drama , and it is for the benefit of children 's hos - pitals that the book is written and published . ''

		The Folly of the Three Wise Men '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Edgar Whitaker Work	PERSON	, is a variant of the familiar legend of the following of the star to find the new-born Messiah .

		Because these wise men were too eager in their pursuit to pause even for the simplest offices of charity they nearly failed in their quest ; but the appeal of a forlorn little shepherd boy , lost and hurt , saves them .

		The story is illustrated and decorated .

		A love story of the
Kansas	LOCATION	prairie is well told by Miss Mar - garet
Hill McCarter	PERSON	in `` The Corner Stone '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , in which
Edith Grannell	PERSON	and Homer Helm seem fair in each other 's eyes and , after cer - tain difficulties and misunderstandings have been overcome and cleared away , are happily wedded .

		The little book is daintily decorated , has a colored frontispiece , and is artistically boxed . ''

		Into His Own '' -LRB- McKay -RRB- is a dog story by Mr.
Clarence B. Kelland	PERSON	, who follows the fortunes of a thor - oughbred Airedale from a despised puppyhood to an honored maturity , telling the tale in the first person , from the dog-hero 's point of view .

		It is a touching story , well told , and adorned with the
Airedale	ORGANIZATION	's portrait , photographed from life .

		A pathetic tale in dialect , with title in dialect , `` When Hannah Var Eight Yar Old '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , is told by Mrs.
Katherine Peabody Girling	PERSON	.

		Han - nah , a Swedish girl , is made to describe her hard experiences during her mother 's illness and after her death , in the home country , before
Hannah	PERSON	, `` a big girl eight yar old , '' came to
America	LOCATION	.

		It is a story of humble heroism that goes to the read - er 's heart .

		Illustrations and decorations increase its attractiveness to the eye . ''

		The Man Who Was Too Busy to Find the Child '' -LRB-
Abingdon Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Lucius H. Bugbee	PERSON	, is the story of
Ben David	PERSON	, who was blind and deaf to his blessed opportunities until , on the very day of the cruci - fixion , he awoke to a sense of his obtuseness .

		The obvious moral stands out clearly .

		Two illustra - tions are inserted , and an ornamental paper cover encloses the score of pages containing the story .

		Captain
Ian Hay Beith	PERSON	, better known as
Ian Hay	PERSON	, chronicles the history of `` Scally '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , which is sub-titled '' The Story of a Perfect Gen - tleman . ''

		Excalibur is the full name of the hero , who is a dog , snatched from a watery grave in puppyhood .

		His memorable deeds , with a love - story interwoven , fill nine short chapters , and many readers will wish there were more .

		Scally is por - trayed in the frontispiece .

		An animal story of a different sort , entitled `` The Little Red Doe '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Chauncy J. Haw	PERSON	- kins , gives us the life and doings and pathetic death of a very ingratiating creature of the
Maine	LOCATION	forest , with excellent pictures by Mr.
Charles Cope	PERSON	- land .

		Rough lumbermen are softened by their feeling for the little red doe , and gallantly resolve to avenge her death ; whereby hangs a tale too long to be given here .

		Mrs.
Mary Raymond Ship	PERSON	- man
Andrews	PERSON	's war story , '' The Three Things , '' having won success in less permanent shape , now comes out in book form from the publishing house of Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Class pride , unbelief , and race prejudice were the three things not quite as they should have been in the hero ,
Philip Landi	PERSON	- cutt , who however had such passionate pity for the oppressed that he threw himself into the struggle for
Belgium	LOCATION	's emancipation , and there lost his class pride , his unbelief , his race prejudice .

		Other events , too , enrich the story , which furthermore has the merit of brevity , being but little more than fifty pages in length .

		`` Robin the Bobbin '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , by a writer designated as `` Vale Dow - nie , '' is the story of a blind piano-tuner , an elderly and -LRB- wonderful to relate -RRB- rich inventor , a boy ,
Tom Bunting	PERSON	, who turns out to be the lost
Robin	PERSON	, and a few other characters .

		The mystery and the interest centre themselves in the boy Tom , and of course all is cleared up in the end , and everyone is happy .

		Two pictures enliven the narrative .


New England	LOCATION	stories are almost invariable favor - ites with readers , provided they are well told , and it is safe to predict that `` Blue Gingham Folks '' -LRB-
Abingdon Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Dorothy Donnell Cal	PERSON	- houn , will receive the appreciation it deserves .

		It is a collection of Yankee tales , character sketches they might perhaps better be called , with a flavor that is genuinely
New England	LOCATION	.

		Local dialect abounds , and a few drawings help to make the reader better acquainted with the various person - ages of the book .

		In '' The Heart of Lincoln '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- we have a series of more or less authen - tic anecdotes and reminiscences concerning the War President .

		They illustrate the warmth and tenderness of his feelings , and make him a very Tinman , very lovable person .

		Mr.
Wayne Whipple	PERSON	is the compiler , and an unnamed artist supplies a portrait of Lincoln . ''

		Jimsy the Christmas Kid '' -LRB-
McBride	PERSON	-RRB- is a typical Christmas tale .

		In it Miss
Leona Dalrymple	PERSON	relates the adventures of a waif who wins the hearts of a crusty bank-president and his amiable wife , and is finally received into the family as a permanent resident .

		The little volume is attractively illustrated and beautifully decorated .

		Mr.
Irvin S. Cobb	PERSON	, home from the war and temporarily out of more thrilling themes , turns to amusing account his attack of appendicitis and the operation therefor . ''

		Speaking of Operations '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- makes the most of the rather abundant opportunity for sarcastic and facetious comment that is offered to a shrewdly observant surgical patient in an up-to-date hospital ; and it does so with the help of illustrations almost as provocative of smiles as is the little story itself .

		`` Letters from

		The immediately forthcoming books of Messrs.

Winifred Reed Tredwell	PERSON	, an illus - trated book on the life that underlies Chinese art , illustrated with examples from well-known collec - tions .

		A loss to English poetry is reported from En - gland in the death on
Dec. 9	DATE	of
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	,
1915	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL known to theatre-goers as well as to readers for his successful '' Paolo and
Francesca	PERSON	, '' if for noth - ing else .

		Some fifteen poetic and dramatic com - positions , however , besides his volume of poems that received the `` Academy '' one-hundred-pound prize in
1897	DATE	, stand to his credit , among them being '' Christ in Hades , '' which first arrested the attention of watchful critics , ''
Herod	PERSON	, '' ''
Ulysses	PERSON	, '' '' The Sin of
David	PERSON	, '' ''
Nero	PERSON	, '' '' The Last Heir , '' `` Pietro of
Siena	LOCATION	, '' `` The King , '' '' lole , '' and ``
Panama	LOCATION	and Other Poems , '' most of these being in dramatic form , and some of them tested as to their stage merits by actual presentation .

		Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	was well qualified to write for the stage since he had , in his first and only term at
Queen 's College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, cut loose from academic re - straints and joined Mr.
Frank Benson	PERSON	's company of players when it chanced to visit the town ; and for six years he played various small parts with this company .

		His previous schooling had been at
Stratford	LOCATION	and
Peterborough	LOCATION	, his father , the Rev.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, being Precentor of
Peter	PERSON	- borough Cathedral .

		To complete this reversed biography , he was born at Somertown , near Ox - ford ,
July 28 , 1868	DATE	, and was thus in the prime of life when death overtook him .

		Though his later books evidenced a sad decline in poetic power , the author of such works as '' Paolo and Francesca '' and ''
Marpessa	LOCATION	'' will long hold a secure place in the annals of English poetry .

		The following appeal for a
Tennyson Memorial	ORGANIZATION	appears in a recent issue of the
London	LOCATION	'' Times , '' signed by several notable names : '' The Com - mittee of the
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	at Lincoln are will - ing and it is their own suggestion to set apart a room to become the home for
Tennyson Manu	ORGANIZATION	- scripts , early and other editions of the poems , por - traits , busts , personal relics , & c. , somewhat in the same manner as has been done so successfully in the case of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	at
Dove Cottage	ORGANIZATION	,
Gras	LOCATION	- mere .

		It is believed that if it were known that such a centre was established , many admirers of Tennyson would be glad to send some gift which would increase the value of the collection and make it worthy of a visit by lovers and students of the poet from all parts of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is no time to ask for money ; and only very slight expenditure is contemplated .

		But it is a time to suggest that in his memory who wrote the Ode on the Death of the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	, the Charge of the Light and
Heavy Brigades	ORGANIZATION	, the Relief of
Lucknow	LOCATION	, The Revenge , and many other patriotic verses , lovers of Tennyson should be invited to give or lend some suitable contributions to a cen - tral
Tennyson Museum	ORGANIZATION	in the capital town of his native county .

		Gifts will be received and ac - knowledged by the Librarian Mr.
A. R. Corns	PERSON	Public Library ,
Lincoln	LOCATION	; and it would be well that before sending gifts the committee should be consulted through him , for space is limited .

		We hope that many objects of first-rate interest and importance will be enshrined in what will , we believe , become in time a very notable
Tennyson Collection	ORGANIZATION	.

		The proposal has the approval of Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	, who has already sent a number of valuable loans . ''
