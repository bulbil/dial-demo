Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, in one of his recently pub - lished letters , contrasted the work which he had been trying to do for
England	LOCATION	with that which Renan had sought to do for
France	LOCATION	.

		To stimu - late the ethical sense of his fellow-countrymen was the task to which the great Frenchman applied himself , conscious of the fact that intel - ligence had outrun morality as an element of the national life .

		Arnold felt that his own peculiar task was the obverse of this , since the masses of the English people were not so much lacking in moral sense as they were deficient in the higher sort of intelligence connoted by the terms '' sweetness and light '' of which the English critic made so much .

		Or , to recall those other terms about which the finely cul - tured mind of the Englishman took delight in playing , the English spirit suffered from a preponderance of Hebraism over Hellenism .

		This criticism had all the more force for com - ing from a thinker whose insistence upon the ethical side of life was unfailing , and who allotted to conduct , as the weightiest of all hu - man concerns , no less than three-fourths of the sum total of ideal human effort .

		We suppose that many a thoughtful Amer - ican has asked himself which of the two influ - ences the moral or the intellectual was the more needed in his own country .

		A prima facie judgment would be likely to pronounce for the latter , in view of the fact that we are primarily an English people , sharing with our kinsmen over-sea the common store of English sympathies , ideals , and social traditions .

		But upon reflection there comes to mind some thought of that added drop of nervous fluid by which
Colonel Higginson	ORGANIZATION	assures us that we are differentiated from the parent stock , some thought of the alien elements that have been injected into our social organism and as yet imperfectly assimilated , some thought of the national temper that has resulted from our iso - lation , our complex history , our unexampled material prosperity , and our frank acceptance of the great democratic experiment with all that it implies .

		And when we take all these things into account , viewing them in the light of recent political happenings , of the present state of public opinion revealed by press , pul - THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, pit , and platform , of the conclusions reached here and there by the philosophical observers who look for something deeper than surface indications , we are constrained to admit that while intellectually all is far from well with us as a people , it is still upon the moral side that we are most in need of wise counsels and a quickening discipline .

		We need both a Renan and an Arnold to spur us to a realization of our faults ; but , of the two , we are in the more need of a Renan .

		To all serious Americans , whose patriotism is too deep an emotion to find expression in bluster , to whom the sacred name of country how our language needs such a word as patrie !

		means little unless it stands for so - briety , and true dignity , and a passion for jus - tice , in a word , for virtue in the highest signifi - cance of that term , the political occurrences of the last two weeks must have been inexpressibly disheartening .

		That so monstrous a thing as a war with
England	LOCATION	about the disputed boun - dary line of a South American state should even have been hinted at by irresponsible pol - iticians and journalists was sufficiently discour - aging ; that it should have received the sanc - tion implied by the recent message of the President and its reception by the national Legislature , and that the popular response to these official acts should have been what it has been , is saddening in a degree for which it is difficult to find adequate words .

		Above all , the new attitude so suddenly assumed by the Presi - dent is cause for profound sorrow .

		That the man whose public career has so often won the admiration of the judicious should have become the aggressive leader of the reckless and the unthinking , that the man who has stood so steadfastly for the higher morality of political action should have ranged himself among the advocates of the lower morality of opportunism , that the man whom we have loved most for the enemies he has made , whom we thought could be trusted to stand like a rock in the defence of a nobler Americanism than is dreamed of in the blatant philosophy of the demagogue , that this man of all men should place himself shoulder to shoulder with the Lodges and the Chandlers and the Morgans , and join with them in the insensate jingoism which is their chief political stock in trade , is a shock from which the sober-minded will not soon recover .

		The verdict of history will , we trust , deal kindly with President
Cleveland	LOCATION	on account of the downright manliness with which he has so fre - quently put the politicians to shame ; but it can not condone this act of concession to the men who have brought our country into such disrepute , and once more pointed the famous Johnsonian definition of the patriot .

		Were there a new
Whittier	LOCATION	among us , he would be justified in writing a new '' Ichabod '' ; were a new Lowell to arise , he might fairly employ the quaint phraseology of ''
Hosea Biglow	PERSON	'' to sat - irize the bellicose spirit that has just received so new and unfortunate an impulse .

		The field of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	is not that of political discussion -LRB- except incidentally , in reviewing books upon political subjects -RRB- , and we leave to authorities upon constitutional history and in - ternational law the easy task of showing that the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	is not a part of the law of nations , and that the
Cleveland	LOCATION	Doctrine is not the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	.

		But we feel it our duty , as an organ of serious thought , to protest against the spirit of recklessness that has taken possession of the public mind in dealing with these grave matters , against the false concep - tion of national dignity that seems generally prevalent , against the popular intolerance ac - corded by the American Demos to any expres - sion of opinion not in agreement with its pre - judices of the moment .

		We appeal to the intellectual sanity and sober second-thought of our readers to aid in stemming the tide of mis - apprehension concerning our national rights and duties in relation to other countries .

		We urge upon every clear-headed observer , upon every student of political science , whether lay or professional , to express himself with no un - certain utterance upon this vastly-important subject .

		Every university professor , every member of the literary fraternity , every news - paper not abandoned to sensationalism , every preacher who can get away from his theology , every influential citizen of every community , should exert his influence in a way that , even though immediate danger be past , will aid in correcting public sentiment and in preventing the recurrence of a popular furor so opposed to the peace and dignity of our country and to the welfare of the world .

		It is easier , doubt - less , to swim with the current of the emotional politics of the hour , or to stand aloof with a cynical disregard of the vagaries of popular sentiment ; but neither attitude is worthy of the high-minded American , and neither is possible to one having a full consciousness of what it means to be a citizen of the Republic whose mission is more deeply significant for the future hopes of mankind than that of any other nation known to history .

		THE DIAL THE BRITISH AUTHORS ' APPEAL .

		On the
day before Christmas	DATE	there was printed in the
London	LOCATION	papers an address from British au - thors to their American brethren , pleading for a union of effort in behalf of peace between the two countries .

		The appeal was signed , it is stated , by thirteen hundred names including those of Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	, Hon.
John Morley	PERSON	, Mr.
John Rus	PERSON	- kin , Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	, Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	, Prof.
W. E. H. Lecky	PERSON	, Sir
Wrn	PERSON	.


M. Conway	PERSON	, Mr.
R. D. Blackmore	PERSON	, Mr.
William Black	PERSON	, Mr.
Alfred Austin	PERSON	, Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	, and Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	.

		Only portions of the address have as yet reached this country ; these are as follows : `` At this crisis in the history of the Anglo-Saxon race , there are two paths .

		One leads we know not whither , but in the end through war , with all its accom - paniments of carnage , unspeakable suffering , and hid - eous desolation , to the inevitable sequel of hatred , bit - terness , and disruption of our race .

		It is this path we ask you to join us in an effort to make impossible .

		Not on the grounds of political equity do we address you , but we are united to you by many ties .

		We are proud of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		There is nothing in our history that has earned us more glory than the conquest of the vast American continent by the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	race .

		When our pride is humbled by a report of something that you do better than ourselves , it is also uplifted by the consciousness that you are our kith and kin . ''

		There is no anti- American feeling among English - men .

		It is impossible there can be any anti-English feeling among Americans .

		For two such nations to take up arms would be civil war , not differing from your calamitous struggle of thirty years ago , except that the cause would be immeasurably less humane , less tragic , and less inevitable . ''

		If war should occur between
England	LOCATION	and Amer - ica , English literature would be dishonored and disfig - ured for a century to come .

		Patriotic songs , histories of victory and defeat , records of humiliation and disgrace , stories of burning wrongs and unavenged insult these would be branded deep in the hearts of our people .

		They would so express themselves , in poems , novels , and plays , as to make it impossible for any of us who live through the fratricidal war to take up again the for - mer love and friendship for the united Anglo-Saxon race that owns the great names of
Cromwell	LOCATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	,
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	,
Gordon	PERSON	,
Grant	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and
Milton	LOCATION	.

		There is for this race such a future as no other race has had in the history of the world ; a future that will be built on the confederation of sovereign States living in the strength of the same liberty . ''

		We appeal to all writers in the
United States	LOCATION	to exercise their far-reaching influence to save our litera - ture from dishonor and our race from lasting injury . ''

		The address in full will be awaited with much interest in this country .

		The reaction in public sentiment has probably rendered unnecessary any formal response , though there is little doubt as to what the spirit of that response would be .

		Nor can this manly and brotherly appeal fail of being a great influence for good in any future emergency threatening the peaceful relations of the two coun - tries .

		BIBLIOGRAPHY OF WORLD 'S CONGRESS PUBLICATIONS .

		Ever since the close of the World 's
Congress	ORGANIZATION	season , inquiries have been received from different parts of the world for definite information concerning the publica - tions which have been or will be made of the proceed - ings of the World 's Congresses held at
Chicago	LOCATION	under the auspices of the World 's
Congress Auxiliary of the World	ORGANIZATION	's Columbian Exposition of
1893	DATE	; and such in - quiries still continue .

		While no general and complete publication of the proceedings of the Congresses has yet been obtained , many special publications relating to particular Congresses have been issued in various quar - ters , but no full list of such publications has hitherto appeared .

		I have therefore thought it well to prepare and send to THE DIAL a brief Bibliography of the World 's
Congress Publications	ORGANIZATION	which have thus far come to my knowledge , believing that such an account would be of much interest , not only to the nearly six thousand active participants in the Congresses , but also to the much larger number of those who attended the sessions or were otherwise concerned in the proceedings .

		These publications have been issued so quietly and separately that very few persons can have obtained any adequate idea of their number and extent .

		In addition , thou - sands of articles have appeared in the public press , from which volumes might be compiled , showing that by com - mon consent the World 's Congresses of
1893	DATE	were the crowning achievement of what Prof.
Max Miiller	PERSON	calls `` the mighty Columbian Exposition . ''

		For convenience of reference and inquiry , the several publications are classified in the departments of the Congresses to which they respectively belong , and the entries are arranged not in chronological order but in the alphabetical order of the various departments , and are consecutively numbered .

		Most of these
Preliminary Publications	ORGANIZATION	- and Programmes are now out of print .

		These special publications relating to the various Con - gresses have tended rather to increase than to satisfy the demand for a general and complete publication of the proceedings .

		Those who took part in a
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in one of the departments naturally have a desire to know what was accomplished in the other Congresses , not only of their own department , but also of the whole great series which opened on
May 15	DATE	and closed on
October 28	DATE	of the Columbian year .

		For the most part , the publications which have thus , far appeared represent the self-sacrificing zeal of inter - ested societies .

		In many cases , the editions are limited to the needs of the members , leaving none to supply the general public .

		In some cases , as the list shows , the publications are not in suitable form for international use .

		Hence , while enough has been done to secure the historic perpetuity of the immense work accomplished in the World 's Congresses of
1893	DATE	, the need still re - mains for an appropriate Governmental edition of the proceedings of the various Congresses for distribution among the governments , colleges , universities , and lead - ing public libraries of the countries which participated in the World 's
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is required alike by the general welfare of the American people and the just obligations of international courtesy .

		THE DIAL ll THE LAW AND LOGIC OF RECON - STRUCTION .

		* In the preface to his work on ''
Reconstruc	PERSON	- tion during the Civil War , '' Mr.
Scott	PERSON	informs his readers that he intends to write the polit - ical history of the period of Reconstruction , and that the present work is merely preliminary to that undertaking .

		It will be found an exceed - ingly suggestive and stimulating contribution to the study of American politics .

		In dealing with the colonies prior to the Revolution , the author shows how constantly they kept in view the idea of their absolute separateness and equal - ity , and with what tenacity they clung to the principle of local self-government .

		These ideas continued to dominate them during the period of the Stamp Act and that which followed , covering the Congresses of
1774	DATE	and
1775	DATE	.

		Prior to
1776	DATE	, the idea of a union of the col - onies found no favor whatever ; and when the course of the mother country finally compelled them to consider the question of their common defense , the policy of surrendering their sep - arateness and sovereignty in any degree to the necessity of union was accepted with manifest hesitation and reluctance .

		Mr.
Scott	PERSON	shows the strength and persistency of this feeling in deal - ing with the
Articles of Confederation	ORGANIZATION	, the Ordinance of
1787	DATE	, the formation of the Con - stitution , and the
Virginia	LOCATION	and
Kentucky Reso	PERSON	- lutions of 1798-9 ; and it now seems an acci - dent that the Constitution was ever ratified .

		When adopted , it was everywhere understood to be a compact ; and this word was not intro - duced by
Calhoun	PERSON	at a later period , as asserted by Mr.
Webster	PERSON	, but , like the term '' confed - eracy , '' was a part of the current speech of the time . ''

		One can not read the writings of the days which followed the adoption of the Con - stitution , '' says Mr.
Scott	PERSON	, '' and fail to see that secession from the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, or rather the with - drawal and resumption of the states , of the delegated powers , was the remedy in contem - plation of the generation which made the Con - stitution ; that it was regarded as the logical and natural remedy , and as the only remedy . ''

		If the Constitution had been construed by the people as the creation of an indissoluble union , its ratification would have been impossible ; and it is not surprising that from the beginning of * RECONSTRUCTION DURING THE CIVIL WAR IN THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

Boston	LOCATION	:

		the government to the year
1861	DATE	threats of Dis - union , sometimes in the North and sometimes in the South , were not unfrequently heard , and that at no time during this period was the pub - lic mind free from apprehension on the subject .

		In dealing with the relation of the states to the general government , Mr.
Scott	PERSON	devotes sev - eral chapters to the formation of parties and the strife between the Federalists and Repub - licans which resulted in the triumph of
Jeffer	PERSON	- son .

		These chapters are particularly instruct - ive and interesting : but the growth of the idea of union kept pace with that of state sover - eignty .

		This is shown in his discussion of the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise of
1820	DATE	, and in the great speech of
Webster	PERSON	in reply to
Hayne	PERSON	in
1830	DATE	, which voiced the growing sentiment of union and gave it a fresh impulse by his masterly and eloquent presentation of the subject .

		In his inaugural address of
1861	DATE	, anticipating the tri - umph of our arms , Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	declared that '' no state , upon its own mere motion , can law - fully get out of the union ; that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void ; and that acts of violence , within any state or states , against the authority of the
United States	LOCATION	, are insurrectionary or revolutionary , according to circumstances . ''

		Mr.
Scott	PERSON	quotes these words , and the resolution of
July 22 , 1861	DATE	, that '' this war is not waged in any spirit of oppression , or for any purpose of conquest or subjugation , or purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of those states , but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution , and to preserve the union with all the dignity , equality , and rights of the sev - eral states unimpaired ; and that as soon as these objects are accomplished the war ought to cease . ''

		The Emancipation Proclamation of
January 1 , 1863	DATE	, showed the irresistible march of events , and how completely the President yielded to the popular demand respecting the abolition of slavery .

		On the 8th of
December	DATE	following he issued his proclamation of amnesty , providing a plan of reconstruction by which any seceded state might be restored to its place in the
Union	LOCATION	through the action of one-tenth of its voters , as shown by the presidential election of
1860	DATE	.

		This became known as the presiden - tial plan of reconstruction , which Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	never relinquished , and which was afterwards followed by President
Johnson	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Scott	PERSON	gives an admii-able sketch of the debates on this plan : on the bill that followed , which passed both Houses and embodied the congressional plan of reconstruction ; and on the refusal of 12 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, the President to sign the bill , and the vigorous and incisive protest of Senator
Wade	PERSON	and
Henry Winter Davis	PERSON	against his action .

		These debates are now matters of history ; but they awakened among the people at the time the most profound interest and solicitude , because they were understood to involve the vital issues of the war .

		That wide differences of opinion prevailed on the question of reconstruction was by no means surprising .

		It was a new ques - tion .

		Such a blending of the principle of local self-government and national union as was em - bodied in the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	had never been known .

		When its complicated mechanism was suddenly disrupted by an un - expected catastrophe , the minds of men were necessarily bewildered in dealing with the work of its restoration .

		It seemed as difficult as had been its formation , and a precedent for action was alike wanting in either case .

		But the ques - tion had to be met , and it demanded a solution in the midst of a terrific struggle involving the life of the nation .

		Three distinct plans of reconstruction were submitted to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the first of which was inaugurated by
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	and championed by him with zeal and pertinacity while he lived .

		Mr.
Scott	PERSON	correctly says of it : '' It could not have had its origin in any provision of the Constitution , for a new government was to be im - posed upon the state and not created by the people of the state ; it was not therefore a popular government : it was to be created , ostensibly , by a small fraction of the people , one-tenth ; it could not therefore be a gov - ernment of the majority , nor a republican form of gov - ernment : and it was to be inaugurated and indefinitely controlled by the army , and therefore was in violation of the Constitutional principle which subordinates the military to the civil power . ''

		The next plan of reconstruction was sup - ported by those members of the Republican party in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	who maintained that the states were in the
Union	LOCATION	in spite of secession , but that their people by secession had forfeited their federal rights , and were subject to the supreme authority of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of this plan of reconstruction Mr.
Scott	PERSON	says that if its champions had followed it to its logical con - clusion they would have had to concede that under any circumstances , those of reconstruc - tion included , their right of self-government had survived inviolate , and therefore that their restoration depended upon themselves .

		And he shows that no help could be found in the clause of the Constitution declaring that '' the
United States	LOCATION	shall guarantee to every state in this Union a republican form , of government '' ; for a guarantee implies a pre-existing govern - ment which had ceased to be republican , while all the seceded states had governments repub - lican in form , which had been recognized as such by the
United States	ORGANIZATION	from the beginning .

		Of the third plan of reconstruction , which was finally adopted by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Scott	PERSON	says : '' Much more manly and less dangerous were those who asserted that the seceded states , by the act of seces - sion and by maintaining this secession by force of arms , had placed themselves outside of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and had become mere territories over which the federal govern - ment might exercise the rights of conquest .

		They knew well that any policy which had for its foundations the inequality of the states , the interference of the federal government in the affairs of a state within the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, the subordination of the civil to the military power , and the abrogation of the rule of the majority , had no coun - tenance from anything within the four corners of the Constitution , and was in violation of the spirit as well as of the tenor of the bond of union ... This view placed the states without the pale of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	and the Constitution ; it made their soil conquered territory , to be disposed of as the
United States	LOCATION	should think fit , and making the rebels belligerents , handed them over when conquered to the mercy of the federal govern - ment . ''

		But Mr.
Scott	PERSON	, nevertheless , condemns this plan quite as unsparingly as the two preceding ones .

		Taking his stand against all schemes of reconstruction as unwarranted by the
Consti	PERSON	- tution , he believes the rebels , when conquered , had no duty to perform but to return to their allegiance , and that the government had no right to prescribe any conditions whatever .

		He emphasizes the words of Lincoln : '' No state , upon its own mere motion , can lawfully get out of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This is undoubtedly true ; but he does not say that it can not do this un - lawfully .

		That an unlawful act can not be done lawfully , is a simple truism ; but the effect or consequence of such act presents another ques - tion .

		The saying , '' Once a state , always a state , '' is a mere legal fiction , like the state - ment of Chief Justice Chase that the govern - ment is '' an indissoluble union of indestructi - ble states . ''

		The history of the world gives no account of an indestructible state , or an indis - soluble confederacy of states .

		Time and chance pertain to everything that is human .

		Mr.
Scott	PERSON	evidently agrees with a great party leader of the reconstruction period , that there was '' no power in the federal government to punish the people of a state collectively , by reducing it to a territorial condition , since the crime of trea - son is individual , aud can only be treated indi - vidually . ''

		A rebellious state would thus be - come independent .

		If her people could right -
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 13 fully be overpowered by the national authority , that fact would at once re-clothe them with all their rights .


Congress	ORGANIZATION	could prescribe no con - ditions , because this would be to recognize the states as territories , and violate the principle of state rights .

		This view made our war for the
Union	LOCATION	flagrantly unconstitutional ; for if the crime of treason was '' individual , '' and could only be treated '' individually , '' the
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eral government had no right to hold prisoners of war , seize property , and capture and confis - cate vessels ; for every rebel was in the full legal possession of his political rights , and could only be prevented from exercising them through a judicial conviction of treason in the district in which the overt act was committed .

		Mr.
Scott	PERSON	misconceives the character of the plan of reconstruction he so earnestly con - demns .

		While it does not recognize the re - volted districts or states in the
Union	LOCATION	, it deals with their people as subject to the authority of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		As citizens of the
United States	LOCATION	, they could no more escape their obliga - tions than they could run away from their own shadows .

		Through their treason and rebellion they lost their rights under the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, but
the Union	ORGANIZATION	lost none of its rights over them .

		They did not and could not destroy the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, or even abandon it , but simply forfeited their rights under it and thus subjected themselves to the coercive authority of the nation .

		When they ceased to be a mere mob , and became pub - lic enemies , this fact did not , as Mr.
Scott	PERSON	sup - poses , '' do away with their character as crim - inals and render punishment after subjection out of the question , '' because the law of nations determines the rights of nations in such cases , and one of these rights is the right of self - preservation .

		We admit that if the rebellion had been nipped in the bud , or had been abandoned be - fore it assumed its gigantic proportions , no reconstruction of the government would have been necessary .

		The punishment of the leaders might have been demanded , but nothing else would have been required but the return of the people in revolt to their allegiance .

		But when the conflict ceased to be any longer a mere insurrection against the national authority , and took upon itself the character of a war with a foreign power , as
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	decided , the insurgents became public enemies , and when conquered were the conquered enemies of the
United States	LOCATION	and subject to the power of the conqueror , accord - ing to the laws of war applicable to such a con - flict .

		The nation had the right to prescribe just such conditions as it saw fit , looking to indemnity for the past and security for the future .

		In doing this it violated no article or clause of the Constitution , but was governed by the laws of war recognized by all civilized governments , and by the Constitution itself .

		Nobody violated it but the parties who defied its authority and compelled the nation to defend itself against the attempt upon its own life .

		To argue that the men who carried on this work of devastation for four years in the name of
State Rights	ORGANIZATION	should be allowed at the end of the conflict to set up
State Rights	ORGANIZATION	as a bar to their accountability and a reason for their unconditional restoration to power , was a mock - ery of justice and an affront to common sense .

		It is perhaps superfluous to say that the bias of this volume is Southern .

		This is shown in the author 's treatment of the
Missouri	LOCATION	Com - promise , of the
Virginia	LOCATION	and
Kentucky Reso	PERSON	- lutions of 1798-9 , and the question of Recon - struction .

		The work , however , is written in a spirit of fairness , giving the argument on both sides of important questions , and thus helping the reader to a just conclusion .

		It will serve a good purpose in the political education of the people .

		THE PROCESSES OF CELL-LIFE .

		* Professor
Patrick Geddes	PERSON	has lately pro- posed the name Bionomics to designate what has been vaguely termed the science of organic evolution .

		In this sense , Bionomics would be the science which treats of the changes and adaptations in living beings , and the laws that govern them .

		This term Bionomics seems to me a very desirable one , and the science which it covers is one that draws material from every conceivable source of human knowledge .

		The fact that all our knowledge is human , and must , if expressed at all , be stated in terms of human experience , brings all of it into some bionomic relation .

		The central question in
Bionomics	LOCATION	is that of the ancestry of the various groups , and the influences which have caused them to become what they are .

		The central idea in the study is that of life-adaptation ; and no influ - * AN ATLAS OF THE FERTILIZATION AND KARYOKENESIS OF THE

		14 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, ence which can affect life in any way falls out - side the range of bionomic science .

		For the last fifteen years the most fruitful line of research in the whole range of
Bionom	LOCATION	- ics has been that of the life processes of the cell , collectively known as ITaryokinesis , and in the relation of the cell-structures and func - tions to the laws of heredity .

		For the last fifty years , since the discoveries of Schleiden and Schwann of the cellular structure of ani - mals -LRB- 1846 -RRB- , it has been recognized that the bodies of the higher animals , or metazoa , may be considered each as a colony or alliance of one-celled animals .

		These are bound together in relations of mutual help and mutual depend - ence .

		This alliance permits growth and spe - cialization , increase in size and strength with a physiological division of labor among the differ - ent parts , each organ being made of coordinate cells gathered together into tissues .

		From each of these organized beings or aggregations of cells , single cells are thrown off for purposes of reproduction .

		These germ-cells -LRB- ovum , sperma - tozoon -RRB- are in origin and nature similar to the tissue cells of which the body is composed .

		Each , again , is essentially similar to the one - celled organisms , or Protozoa , the supposed ancestors of the many-celled types .

		The many - celled body is derived from the ovum by a series of successive divisions , or cleavages ; the egg - cell dividing into two , four , eight , and so on , until a very large number of cells is produced .

		These remain together , building up tissues and organs , until a period of maturity of the com - pound structure is reached .

		Then other germ - cells are detached , which pass through similar cycles of growth .

		Among the descendants of each egg-cell , as stated by Professor
Wilson	PERSON	, '' a certain number assume the character of the original egg-cell , are converted into ova , and thus form the point of departure for the follow - ing generation .

		Every egg is therefore derived by a continuous and unbroken series of cell - divisions from the egg of the preceding gen - eration , and so on backward through all pre - ceding generations ; it is normally destined to form the first term in the series of cell-divisions extending indefinitely forward into the future . ''

		In this point of view , the egg and the com - pound individual into which it develops stand each as a link in an unbroken chain of life , extending backward to life 's beginning , what - ever that may have been .

		For as each living e gg-cell is cast off from living cell-structures by processes of life , death has nowhere inter - vened in any series which is now extant .

		These chains of life tend to diverge , one from another ; while the destruction of those links in the chain of organisms not fitted to the conditions of life tends by exclusion toward the perpetuation of those better adapted .

		In some low types , the egg is capable of cell - division and growth -LRB- Parthenogenesis -RRB- without the addition of the male element .

		Cross-fer - tilization -LRB- Amphimisis -RRB- with its mixture of hereditary materials derived from different sources , is so useful in evolution that it has virtually superseded Parthenogesis .

		Its im - portance lies in this : that it is the chief factor in promoting individual variation .

		Through the survival of favorable variations result higher adaptation and specialization .

		In most compound animals , the egg is incapable of division or cleavage until it has been fertilized by a germ-cell of the opposite sex , similarly derived from the tissues of a living body .

		Fun - damentally , the egg and sperm-cell are alike in origin and character , and each bears the same relation to the phenomena of heredity .

		The ovum , by processes of adaptation , has become in the higher forms immovable , and charged with food substance .

		The sperm-cell is active , and carries only its hereditary material and the protoplasm necessary to its motion and main - tenance .

		All cells , whether germ-cells or not , consist , omitting minor details , of protoplasm and nu - cleus .

		In the protoplasm a network of jelly - like substance in a fluid the actions of cell - life take place ; while the nucleus , itself inert , presides over or directs the results of these actions .

		Both Protoplasm and Nucleus are elaborate structures , not mere chemical com - pounds , and in each the function depends upon structure and not on chemical composition .

		In the loops and bands of the chromatin , the es - sential part of the nucleus , rests in some way the plan of the growing organism , the ances - tral directive force , according to which the or - ganism must develop .

		In each case of cell - division , an elaborate mechanism -LRB- centrosome , asters , etc. -RRB- is developed in the protoplasm , by means of which the chromatin is subdivided , each of its elaborate loops and tangles being equally shared between the two daughter cells formed by self-cleavage .

		By this means each resultant cell is like its mother cell in essential respects .

		But again , as an absolutely equal division is unknown in nature , each daughter - cell has in some minute degree its own pecu - liarities , its own individuality , apparently re - sulting from inequalities in the chromatin .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 15 These individual qualities , hidden in the de - termining chromatin , will reappear in the com - pound animal or individual into which the germ-cell develops .

		When the egg or sperm cell is mature and ready for fertilization , it differs from the or - dinary cells from which it is derived by con - taining only half the usual amount of chroma - tin or hereditary material .

		It is , therefore , so far as heredity goes , a half-cell , containing only half the architect 's plan , or hereditary direct - ive force , according to which its development is to be governed .

		The process of fertilization is the union of two half-cells , by which each half contributes its share of hereditary material .

		These become mingled together in the nucleus of the fertilized ovum , or cleavage-cell .

		This is then a new individual , and in its develop - ment it proceeds along the lines indicated by the mixed chromatin , and the forces of hered - ity somehow resident in this .

		This mixture of characters shows itself in the resultant individ - ual .

		In this sense , the individual begins life as a mosaic of ancestral fragments , diverse and sometimes contradictory as to details , with a fundamental basis of unity in the traits of spe - cies and race which have come down from many ancestors unchanged , and changeable only by very slow accretions or modifications .

		Professor
Edmund B. Wilson	PERSON	has rendered a great service to teachers and students in the publication of the splendid series of micropho - tographs of these different processes .

		Hitherto the student has had access only to descriptions and diagrams .

		The latter are always too ex - plicit for his best uses , inasmuch as they go beyond nature to someone 's theory of what na - ture should be .

		In the forty photographic plates in Professor
Wilson	PERSON	's atlas , all phases of changes in the ovum are shown as they appear in fact , with only the small source of error aris - ing from the processes of staining .

		These are accompanied by an admirably lucid text with many diagrammatic figures explanatory of the plates .

		ume , '' Bahama Songs and Stories , '' that it is not at all the equal of
Heli Chatelain	PERSON	's '' An - gola Tales . ''

		It is , however , an interesting and valuable contribution to folk-lore .

		The lovely
Bahamas	LOCATION	are , strangely , but lit - tle known .

		They comprise more than three thousand islands , most of which are very small .

		The
Main Island	LOCATION	is from fifty to one hundred miles long and from one to ten miles wide , with little hills that rise to one hundred feet in height covered with pine-trees of great size .

		Seaward from it are the cays , a chain of islets , repetitions in miniature of the main island , with smaller hills and stunted growth of shrubs and little trees , and with cocoa palms .

		Beyond them lies the reef .

		Island , cays , reef , all are coralline in origin .

		Color abounds everywhere : the vegetation is intensely green , the sea deeply blue , the coral sand dazzling white .

		And here there lives a curious population , pretty equally composed of blacks and whites , with the former slowly but constantly gaining .

		Thus our author describes the land and the people .

		After a brief but helpful sketch of their life and their ways , he presents their songs and their stories , songs and stories of negroes , negroes speak - ing English , but English of a quaint cockney sort , quite unlike the dialects among our South - ern negroes .

		Funny indeed is it to find these descendants of Africans dropping and misplac - ing their Ti as if
London	LOCATION	born and bred . ''

		Hall right , ' e ` as ` is ` ogs ` ere , '' would be quite a pos - sible sentence among the
Jamaica	LOCATION	blacks .

		And their `` vwas , '' `` vw ` en , '' `` vwalk '' are quite Wellerian .

		Of songs , our author has collected forty specimens , presenting music with the words .

		All of the pieces are religious in sentiment , more or less sombre in sentiment and rendi - tion , more or less grotesque in form and ver - bal content .

		Common among these negroes is the practice of sitting up all night to sing , the occasion being either joyous or doleful .

		Mr.
Edwards	PERSON	describes the service of song '' Held on the
night	TIME	when some friend is supposed to be dying .

		If the patient does not die , they come again the next night , and between the disease and the hymns the poor negro is pretty sure to succumb .

		The sing - ers , men , women , and children , sit around on the floor of the larger room of the hut and stand outside at the doors and windows , while the invalid lies upon the floor in the smaller room .

		Long into the night they sing their most mournful hymns and ' anthems , ' and only in the light of dawn do those who are left as chief mourn - ers silently disperse ... Each one of the dusky group , as if by intuition , takes some part in the melody and the blending of all tone colors in the soprano , tenor , alto , and bass , without reference to the fixed laws of har -

		In an appendix upon Negro Music the author brings together a considerable amount of data and presents a bibliography of the subject .

		Thirty-eight Bahama stories are given .

		Many of them are very imperfect in sense and dis - jointed in structure .

		This may be the result of the fact that children , and not adults , are the usual narrators .

		There are two kinds of tales recognized , `` old stories '' and `` fairy stories . ''

		The former are chiefly animal tales , analogous to the `` Br ` er Kabbit '' stories of '' Uncle Remus . ''

		The latter are chiefly of re - cent introduction from English sources .

		Rather curious is the variability of dialect ; the same word may be quite differently pronounced in successive sentences .

		The stories usually be - gin and end with some set formula .

		The open - ing is generally : '' Once it vwas a time , a very good time , De monkey chewed tobacco an ' ' e spit white lime . ''

		To which may be added : '' T wa ` nt my time , ' t wa ` nt you time ; 't was old folks ' time . ''

		The ending generally is : '' E bo ban , my story 's en ' ; If you doan believe my story 's true Has my captain an ' my crew .

		Vw ` en I die , bury me in a pot o ' candle grease . ''

		The three first lines are fixed ; the fourth va - ries .

		Space does not permit a detailed study of the stories .

		The variant of the '' Tar Baby '' story is curious .

		So is Story XX. , where we have ''
Ali Baba	PERSON	and the Forty Thieves '' done into Bahama . ''

		Big Claus and Little Glaus '' is terribly mangled , but has a quaint and original termination .

		Most of the fairy stories have peculiarly tragic terminations .

		As a sam - ple of dialect and of the old stories , we cite '' B'Helephant an ' B'Vw ` ale '' : '' Now dis day B'Rabby vwas walkin ' ` long de shore . '

		E see B'Vw ` ale . '

		E say , ' B'Vw ` ale ! '

		B'Vw ` ale say , ' Hey ! '

		B'Rabby say , < B'Vw ` ale , I bet I could pull you on de shore ! '

		B'Vw ` ale say , You cahnt ! '

		B'Rabby say , < I bet you free t ` ousan ' dollar ! '

		B'Vw ` ale say ,

		E gone . ''

		Brother Rabbit goes to find Brother Elephant , and makes a similar bet with him .

		Then , se - curing a strong rope , he succeeds in setting them against each other , both of them thinking that they are pulling against him .

		The rope breaks . ''

		B'Vw ` ale went in de ocean and B'Helephant vwent vay over in de pine-yard .

		Das v ' y you see B'Vw ` ale in de ocean to-day , and das vy you see B'Helephant over in de pine bushes to-day . ''

		EURIPIDES THE RATIONALIST .

		* Naturally , a new book from Professor Ver - rall is suggestive , stimulating , compelling re - luctant assent at times , as often , again , arousing eager opposition .

		He writes , as usual , to break with accepted beliefs , and upon a question well worthy of discussion .

		That the present essay , `` Euripides the Rationalist , '' is particularly fragmentary , and anything but final , its author would probably be the first to declare .

		Still , every real student of Greek drama indeed , every serious student of liter - ature should turn its leaves .

		It is universally conceded that Euripides ' plots have nearly all a serious structural weak - ness .

		Doubtless every reader since
Aristo	ORGANIZATION	- phanes has objected particularly to the long explanatory prologues , and to the spectacular finale wherein the '' god from the machine '' cuts the knot which the dramatist , or his char - acters , failed to untie through the natural in - evitable progress of the action .

		It has been noted , often , that these divine apparitions are much less vigorous and realistic than the hu - man characters .

		It was not left for Mr.
Ver	PERSON	- rall first to point out , either , that all the men and women in , for instance , the '' Hippolytos '' are heroic , while all the divinities are ignoble .

		That such a drama seems a covert but deliber - ate attack upon the very existence of the pop - ular gods , has also been often remarked .

		Euripides was certainly not in personal nor artistic harmony with the popular theology of his time .

		He was forced into outward con - formity with it by the whole environment , the traditions , the limited materials of his art .

		Compared with his greatest rivals , he was a realist , yet was obliged to accept the machinery of romance : or , as Mr.
Verrall	PERSON	would say , an earnest atheist , he was compelled to respect the conventions of a pulpit !

		But Mr.
Verrall	PERSON	advances far beyond these secure positions , and plants his standard boldly , declaring that Euripides used the drama chiefly , and persis - tently , for this one purpose of breaking down all belief in myth and miracle , in the inspira - tion of
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	, in the very existence of Apollo and
Athena	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Verrall	PERSON	applies his tests , in detail , only to three plays altogether : The '' Alcestis , '' the '' Ion , '' the '' Iphigenia in Tauris . ''

		In general , he attempts to divide each drama into a central * EUKIPIDES THE RATIONALIST .

		THE DIAL 17 plot , wherein purely human motives and ac - tions leave no room for the marvellous , and a tableau before , or after , or both , which satis - fied the popular conservatism , while at the same time impressing upon every thoughtful mind the helplessness , the dishonesty , the un - reality , of the people 's gods .

		As to the '' Ion , '' Mr.
Verrall	PERSON	in
1890	DATE	worked out this theory much more fully , in an annotated edi - tion and translation .

		Here he seems to the present reader to have an unanswerable argu - ment in the main .

		Apollo is indeed a shame - faced and baffled liar at the end of the play , a brutal libertine from the beginning .

		Here , certainly , Euripides hardly retains any pre - tense of belief at all .

		His spectacular
Pallas	PERSON	, at the close , only silences for the instant , at best , the voice of common-sense and right im - pulse .

		Apollo himself fails to appear , and no serious attempt is made to excuse his absence or his previous behavior .

		Yet even here Mr.
Verrall	PERSON	seems over in - genious in his detailed reconstruction of what Euripides , as he thinks , meant to show us really took place .

		Still less can we promptly agree that Alcestis evidently fainted only , from hysterical excitement , under the delusion of a doom appointed her .


Heracles	ORGANIZATION	, to Mr.
Verrall	PERSON	, is but a drunken braggart , who , entering the tomb , found the lady awake , and escorted her quietly back to the palace .

		If this were all quite evident , it should have been evident long ago .

		Milton , for instance , should have seen that '' sad Electra 's poet , '' he who brought back '' Alcestis from the grave , '' was but a scoffer !

		We are not quite willing , then , to have our poet 's consistency , his single-minded devotion to a cause , defended at such a terrible cost .

		We do not believe the creative imagination , the artistic delight in his work , could coexist so long in
Euripides	LOCATION	with pure scientific agnosti - cism .

		Disbelief , to be inculcated by '' innu - endo '' -LRB- Mr.
Verrall	PERSON	's favorite word -RRB- , corrodes the soul itself , as examples like
Lucian	PERSON	, Vol - taire , and Swift remind us .

		But we think Mr.
Verrall	PERSON	will be compelled by compulsion from within at least to apply his method to the whole list of extant plays , or at any rate to most of them .

		The study will be by no means barren , even if the final verdict on the main question be `` Not proven , '' or even '' Not probable . ''

		Especially interesting are his sketches of the many-minded keen-witted critical audience to which Euri - pides appealed , the reminders that the poet was not merely heard once , but read and dis - cussed all the year round , in general , the attempt to reconstruct the fifth century Athe - nian conditions .

		For all the imagination , the literary taste , the open-mindedness of Mr.
Ver	PERSON	- rall , classical scholarship has abundant cause for gratitude .

		Like his rival in iconoclasm , the German Wilamowitz , Mr.
Verrall	PERSON	often sallies into the field before his forces are quite assembled and fully under control .

		Thus , a straggling argu - ment on page 172 tells us '' the
Medea	LOCATION	was one of a group which gained not only a prize , but the first . ''

		In our meagre and fragmentary knowledge on such matters , hardly any one fact is more interesting than that in the historic year 431 B.C. JEschylus ' son , the heir of his art , was placed first , Sophocles second , while Euripides with the Medea took the third or '' booby '' prize !

		Professor
Verrall	PERSON	's style is not so clear , bright , and graceful as Mr.
Jebb	PERSON	's ; and the subtlety of his arguments makes this doubly apparent . ''

		No one who is accustomed to lit - erary composition will doubt that the Phoe - nissce did not originally conclude with the de - parture of CEdipus , '' etc. -LRB- p. 242 -RRB- .

		Everyone accustomed to literary composition will see clearly that the third negative bewilders nearly every mind .

		Lastly , hasty readers may be warned that the general thesis will be found in the preface , while the final summing-up is on pp. 259-60 , attached , perhaps by accident , to a very ingen - ious brief essay which has little essential bear - ing on the rest of the book .

		At any rate , these last paragraphs should be marked off as

Jan. 1	DATE	, tinctly formal transaction , and , at the same time , on the life of Christ as giving vital relations .

		The two conceptions mutually exclude each other .

		When he is to us the way , the truth , the life , the growing source of a spiritual experience , we can not attach much importance to any alleged reconciliation under a violated law .

		Being reconciled with God , we have no feeling left for any formal conflict between us .

		Hence , it has happened , while the dogma of salvation in
Christ	LOCATION	has lost ground , the fact of sal - vation in
Christ	LOCATION	has correspondingly gained ground .

		The thoughts of men are more than ever turning to him , and are laying hold of his life and words with unusual insight . ''

		Jesus as a Teacher , '' by Prof.
B. A. Hinsdale	PERSON	, is a sober , substantial , well-digested book .

		It em - braces knowledge , perception , and feeling .

		While its perusal would be profitable to most readers , it would be especially profitable to the better class of Sunday-school teachers .

		It holds itself more aloof from the merely formal side of truth , and gives itself more freely to its vital aspects than one would expect it to do as arising in the interests of peda - gogy .

		The volume carefully presents the circum - stances which imparted character to the teachings of
Christ	LOCATION	, as well as a full consideration of his spirit and method .

		It embraces a second part , '' The Making of the New Testament . ''

		It is not easy to give an adequate conception of the book entitled '' Christ 's Idea of the Supernat - ural . ''

		Each reader , as in testing a fruit of an un - usual flavor , must pronounce upon it for himself .

		There is so much individuality in it that it will please and instruct different persons very differently .

		To many , it may easily become a manual of heav - enly things .

		It is pervaded by a tone of very pos - itive spirituality .

		The thought and the feeling are so closely interwoven that the reader must share them both , if he is to catch the impulse of the au - thor .

		The line of presentation , like the path of a bird in flight , must be seen as it is evolved , as it escapes the eye almost at once .

		There is a great deal of beauty as well as of force in the volume .

		The author moves with alert and sympathetic steps along the lines of spiritual affinity .

		In spite of much difference , the work is not unlike '' Studies in Theologic Definition , '' a book also marked by insight and strong conviction .

		The purpose of both authors is to readjust our religious conceptions to the allotted conditions of knowledge .

		Both feel painfully the fact that religious convic - tion has lost ground in many minds by that which ought rather to have purified and strengthened it .

		The ruling idea by which Dr.
Denison	PERSON	would recon - cile the natural and supernatural , the earthly and the divine , is that of coordination the coOrdir.a - tion by which each living thing is put in vital rela - tions to the very different things which surround it .

		As physical life links together in one experience the organic and inorganic , so does a higher spiritual life lay hold of the sensuous facts beneath it and the supersensuous ones above it .

		This conception is handled in a wide facile way , and is made very fruitful .

		The idea which Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	finds equally pregnant is that the finite and the infinite are not opposed to each other , but that the infinite fully contains the finite .

		So the two are , and have been , in perfect reconciliation .

		Our exaltations of God have often been a driving of him out of his own word and works , the building up of an abstraction in place of an apprehension of concrete facts and a divine history .

		This conception the author de - velops with fulness and skill , and so will render a vital service to those who can readily accompany him .

		One feels , in reference to both these authors , that they thread the jungle with such swift and sturdy steps because they follow a path that wont and use have made familiar to them .

		In the light or out of the light , they escape , by the habit of their own minds , the entanglements and wanderings which others experience .

		This certainty of thought is a perfectly normal product in all higher , more complex , and spiritual themes .

		A bird gets the knack of the air by flying .

		We learn how thought and perception and feeling
spring	DATE	up and flow to - gether by standing where the full streams of life lie at our feet .

		We can easily believe that both books , flowing as they do from a vital experience , will carry refreshment and vitality with them .

		We can not speak with as much confidence of the next volume , '' The Christian Consciousness . ''

		To give such a definition to Christian Consciousness as to make it a distinct and productive source of power in human life , and to trace its way onward fertil - izing the thoughts and feelings of men , constitutes a most difficult task .

		We do not think that the author has attained that firmness in the original idea , or that clearness in the sequence of events under it which are necessary to render the discus - sion stimulating and fruitful .

		The things devel - oped do not turn with sufficient definiteness on the theme proposed . ''

		The Preacher and His Place '' is a volume of lectures delivered at the
Yale Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	.

		These lectures , in common with most of the courses which have preceded them , cling pretty closely to the peculiar practical wants which lie before the preacher in our time .

		These courses have been delivered by those who are in actual service , and supplement rather than continue the seminary work in
Homilities	LOCATION	.

		This fact is indicated in the present course by the titles of the several lectures .

		The first four titles are : '' The Preacher and the Past , '' '' The Preacher and the Present , '' '' The Preacher and his Message , '' '' The Preacher and other Mes - sages . ''

		The lectures of Dr.
Greer	PERSON	are enjoyable .

		The style is pleasing and perspicuous ; the subject - matter is interesting , and the temper serene .

		They are penetrative without being profound , earnest rather than fervid , and progressive while marked by no radicalism .

		They carry the mind forward with - out jar , evoking general acquiescence , and render the vision more clear and pleasurable in many direc - tions .

		They will be profitable to most ministers .

		THE DIAL '' College Sermons '' is made up of discourses de - livered by Professor
Jowett	PERSON	to the students of Bal - liol College , during his long term of service .

		They are admirably fitted to do college men good .

		They express the wise , sober convictions of a well-trained mind , earnest and devout in its temper , and regard - ing religious belief and action chiefly on their prac - tical side .

		Supported by the personal confidence and reverence which Professor
Jowett	PERSON	commanded , they must have been a very direct and irresistible means of good .

		The temper of the discourses , as became a scholar , is eminently liberal and charita - ble .

		Their purpose , pursued in a simple , unimpas - sioned way , is to sober , widen , stimulate , and strengthen the thoughts of young men .

		They are especially suited for this work .

		They are in sym - pathy with a large and purified life .

		The editorial work of this volume has not been very thoroughly done .

		These six books , taken collectively , like many others that have come before us , show no decay in the Christian spirit .

		They all involve an effort a vital and prosperous effort to restate religious truth , and readjust it to the new and better condi - tions which have come to it .

		This is not weakness , but strength ; not decay , but growth .

		The large adaptability of our faith and the emboldened and higher spirit which it so readily assumes are con - spicuous in such discourses as these of Professor
Jowett	PERSON	a man of ripe scholarship , sober thought , and wide life .

		JOHN BASCOM .

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Mr.
Stuart J. Eeid	PERSON	's life of Lord
John Russell	PERSON	is one of the best of the interesting series of political biogra - phies -LRB- '' Queen 's Prime Ministers ''
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- of which the author is general editor .

		A finer subject could , of course , hardly be desired .

		From the days when
Napoleon	PERSON	was changing the map of
Europe	LOCATION	almost at his will until the time of our own Civil War , Lord
John Russell	PERSON	was in the
House of Com	ORGANIZATION	- mons , and prominent from the first ; and this splen - did service was crowned with five years more of distinguished service as
Earl Russell	PERSON	in the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	and as Prime Minister .

		During this whole career Lord
John	PERSON	was the champion of the Whig principles of religious toleration and equality , and of the participation of the people in the government through widened suffrage and reformed representa - tion in
Parliament	LOCATION	.

		Himself a member of one of the proudest families of
England	LOCATION	, he outran even the bulk of the Whig party in his zeal for reform .

		In these days it is difficult to realize the exclusive - ness of the aristocratic spirit that prevailed among the ruling class at the beginning of this century .

		Men of broad culture , open minds , and patriotic impulses feared the overthrow of all the barriers against revolution if any slightest change were made in the institutions of the land .

		Lord
John Russell	PERSON	identified himself with reform movements at the outset ; the cause of parliamentary reform was so peculiarly his own that he was chosen to introduce the great measure of
1832	DATE	, although not yet of cab - inet rank .

		The beginnings of popular education were made or fostered by him against the strenuous opposition of his own class .

		So , though his vision was not always clear , and he sometimes was found opposing what he ought by his own principles to have favored , his influence in bringing
England	LOCATION	out from the aristocratic and mediaeval conditions pre - vailing before
1832	DATE	into the democratic equality of to-day was very great .

		The fault of Mr.
Reid	PERSON	's book is one that is almost inseparable from the biographical method of writing history , especially when the writer is a thorough admirer of his sub - ject .

		While the statements of the book are in the main correct and the point of view is the right one , yet the concentration of attention upon one actor necessarily magnifies his part in events .

		Although the author points out the mistaken judgments and acts of his hero , there is not enough allowance made for the work of others .

		Especially defective is the treatment of the relations of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	in our Civil War .

		Mr.
Reid	PERSON	sees in the
Alabama	LOCATION	question only a petty quarrel in which we were over-sensitive and
England	LOCATION	was in no way at fault ; but that she preferred to humble herself rather than be on hostile terms with us .

		Lord
John Russell	PERSON	, who was Foreign Secretary at that time , was not wont to tamely yield the rights and prestige of En - gland without compelling reason , nor was this con - sistent with
England	LOCATION	's past .

		It is often rather unjustly supposed that a critic ought not to make his appearance in imaginative literature unless he can show how the thing should be done by example as well as by precept .

		But there is no real reason to suppose that
Herr Nordau	PERSON	, for instance , could write better plays , even from his own stand - point , than Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	, or better novels than
M. Zola	PERSON	.

		If one read '' The Right to Love '' and '' The Com - edy of Sentiment '' -LRB-
F. Tennyson Neely	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- without knowing that they were by the great scourge of contemporary literature , one would not trouble much to consider one 's impressions .

		They are both of that kind of literature which used to be mildly con - demned as aping French wickedness , but which is now a favorite form with several popular moral - ists of our time .

		The first is a drama which shows - how an unfaithful wife finds the path of unfaith - fulness not so smooth as she had imagined ; the second is a novel which presents a German profes - sor in love with a bold-faced but charming adven - turess .

		Both allure to virtue -LRB- in a measure -RRB- by showing the thorns on the rose-bush of vice .

		Neither , on the whole , does much more : the drama gets along without real characters or situations , the novel has no real atmosphere .

		Both have certain good points , the idea of finally giving the unrepent -

Jan. 1	DATE	, ant wife the position of housekeeper to her hus - band is quaint , to say the least ; and one rushes through the tale of the professor 's intrigue , with a great desire to know how he is going to get out of it .

		Speculating upon these works as being written by the same hand which turned out '' Degeneration , '' we are led to wonder whether
Herr Nordau	PERSON	be not really an ornament , albeit a modest one , of the lit - erature of imagination rather than of the literature of knowledge .

		But , to tell the truth , this is a mat - ter upon which many people have made up their minds some time since .

		Even those who have never read the `` Breitmann Ballads '' by Mr.
Charles G. Leland	PERSON	and there must be some such can hardly fail to catch from ''
Hans Breit	PERSON	- mann in
Germany	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- a flavor at once distinct and genial .

		The hearty self-confidence , impossible in one who is not sure of himself and his readers , the strange fact that the dialect is never tiresome , the clear refreshment of the relapses into good German , these make a sort of quaint toning in which one perceives pleasurably the humorist at work , gravely subduing and bringing under control the great mountainous jokes and scattering the smaller ones with a winning artlessness .

		But the book has its other vein also , so that one goes com - fortably along , enjoying the conversation in prose , enjoying the ingenuously extempore verse , some - times warmed by a glow of genuine warm-hearted - ness , sometimes surprised by the sudden appearance of a quaint moral coming so seldom and so unex - pectedly that one is rather pleased than vexed .

		Even the tarry-at-home would enjoy the book ; but to another the all-penetrating influence of the
Vater	LOCATION	- land brings a sudden revival of connection with the high-pitched roofs and the winding streets , with the beautiful gardens and the well - remembered bier - lokals , of the hundreds of characteristic things that remain with everyone , the mention of one of which is enough to bring back on a sudden the old-time feeling of inverted homesickness .

		A curiously at - tractive book , doubtless much of its charm lies in the constant temper of the scholar and the man of culture beneath the cheerful features , displayed in the frontispiece , of the sympathetic humorist .

		It is to be hoped that it will be favorably reviewed and widely read , for upon such circumstances , we are given to understand , hangs the appearance of more volumes of the same kind .

		The history of
Bohemia	LOCATION	.

		It is a pity that the history of Bo - hemia is so little known and appre - ciated by the English-speaking peo - ples .

		^ Americans especially should know and admire a nation that , centuries earlier , stood for the princi - ples of
Plymouth Rock	ORGANIZATION	and American liberty .

		In
Bohemia	LOCATION	those same political and religious princi - ples worked out their natural result in a high-spirited , cultured , and freedom-loving people .

		But
Bohemia	LOCATION	was small ; greedy neighbors were powerful ; the all-dominating
Papacy	LOCATION	marshalled its armies to crush out by force the alien and dangerous spirit of a people that chance had brought under the do - minion of one of its sons ; division and religious strife entered to weaken and paralyze the effective energies of the Bohemians themselves ; and thus the land of

Bohemia	LOCATION	have lately been written , with the double purpose of giving to the English - speaking descendants of
Bohemia	LOCATION	in
America	LOCATION	a knowledge of their motherland , and of opening to others the stirring story of
Bohemia	LOCATION	's struggles and achievements .

		The first is an elaborate work of seven hundred and fifty pages by
Robert H. Vick	PERSON	- ers , published by
C. H. Sergei & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		It is furnished with maps , illustrations , and index , and can be commended as a thorough treatment of the subject .

		The other work is less pretentious , being a compilation under the title of '' The Story of Bo - hemia , '' by
Frances Gregor	PERSON	-LRB- published by
Cranston & Curts	ORGANIZATION	,
Cincinnati	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		This volume also has illustra - tions , but lacks an index .

		It gives a full outline of the history in about half the compass of the larger work .

Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The characters who figure in these sketches are real personages , and the author seems to have had access to sources , in the shape of diaries , memoirs , and autobiogra - phies , not commonly accessible .

		These being used with much literary art , a remarkably picturesque series of narratives is the result .

		The subject in each case is some person of high social or political distinction .

		The first two papers have to do with a Polish princess of the eighteenth century ; the third with that terrible woman-emperor ,
Catherine II	PERSON	.

		of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		At her death , a sealed manuscript was found among her papers an autobiography of the early years of her married life , written in her own hand , and addressed to her son , the Grand
Duke Paul	PERSON	, great-grandfather of the present Czar .

		At first kept in the imperial archives and guarded with scrupulous care , this manuscript finally , in some unexplained manner , was copied , found its way to
Paris	LOCATION	, and into print .

		One of the copies , rare and hard to come by , has served Miss Cooiidge as basis for '' The Girlhood of an Autocrat . ''

		A story of English official life in
India	LOCATION	bears the title '' Miss Eden , '' the authority being three volumes of de - lightful letters written by the sister of Lord Auck - land , Governor-General of

		THE DIAL 21 Mr -
Berenson	PERSON	's book on `` Lorenzo Lotto '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- will hardly prove Italian Painting , interesting reading to the average person .

		It is not , strictly speaking , a biography , but '' an Essay in Constructive Art-Criticism , '' as the secondary title tells us .

		The matter of it has been of more moment to the author than the style of it .

		The author has had something to say , and has not cared too much about how he has said it .

		So , begin - ning with a catalogue of facts , as though he were a German instead of an American , he ends with a conclusion , logical enough , if it does not meet with entire acceptance .

		He has reconstructed the mas - ters and influences of Lorenzo Lotto , and incident - ally overhauled the history of early Venetian art to prove -LRB- what is undoubtedly true -RRB- that the
Bellini	PERSON	were not the only teachers in
Venice	LOCATION	in
Lotto	LOCATION	's early days , and that there was a large following of the now-neglected Vivarini from whom Lotto de - scended , rather than , as formerly supposed , from the
Bellini	PERSON	.

		What this book proves about Lotto and the early Venetian school is perhaps not so import - ant as the method taken to prove it .

		We are here brought face to face with the working of the Higher Criticism in art the scientific method of arriving at the authorship of pictures .

		Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	, since the death of
Morelli	ORGANIZATION	, has become its high priest ; and while people may smile as they please about the art-criticism which consists in measuring ears and finger-nails and studying draperies and back - grounds , it is yet the only accurate basis upon which the study of ancient painting can rest .

		Moreover , Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	has modified the method of
Morelli	PERSON	, and is not flinging aside all the views of the past as '' antiquated rubbish . ''

		Where he establishes a new view , he does it with a reason and with a mas - tery of facts that few will venture to dispute .

		In - deed , Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	is to be treated seriously and with respect , not sneered at , as was the unjust fate of his learned forerunner ,
Giovanni Morelli	PERSON	.

		It is understood to be his ambition to rewrite the his - tory of Italian painting ; and , if we take his '' Lo - renzo Lotto '' aright , the book is merely to show us the method whereby he proposes to execute his larger task .

		A new and critical history of Italian art is much needed ; and if every important Italian painter is treated with the thorough study that char - acterizes the present volume , we shall have an epoch-making work .

		The sight of Mr.
E. L. Godkin	PERSON	's shapely volume of '' Reflections and Comments '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- calls to mind
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's curt comment in his recently pub - lished Letters : '' Far the best paper here is the
< Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	, ' written by Godkiu . ''

		Few culti - vated Americans , we fancy , will gainsay Mr.
Ar	PERSON	- nold here at least very flatly .

		Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	's writ - ing has long been a potent social and political force in this country ; and in so far as it lies in the way of the journalist qua journalist to do good in the society he lives in , he has done it .

		The volume is A volume of essays from `` The Nation . ''

		Norwegian Immigration to the
U. S.	PERSON	made up of thirty-three articles selected from the author 's contributions to '' The Nation '' during the past thirty years .

		Those have been chosen , of course , which seemed to him of most permanent value ; and while their prevailing tone is social and literary , political themes have not been avoided .

		Among the titles we note : '' The Short-Hairs '' and '' The Swallow-Tails , '' '' Organs , '' Panics , '' ''
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	, '' '' Role of the Universities in Politics , '' '' Physical Force in Politics , '' '' The Evolution of the Summer Resort , '' ''
Tyndall	PERSON	and the Theolo - gians , '' etc. .

		Ranging in tone , as in theme , from grave to gay , the volume shows Mr.
Godkih	PERSON	at his best and Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	is , as we all know , an engag - ing as well as a sound and scholarly writer .

		Some of the papers , it may be fairly said , are literature , not journalism .

		The census of
1890	DATE	indicated that there were at that time in the
United States	LOCATION	1,535,597 persons who were born in Scandinavian countries or were children of Scandinavian parents .

		An enumeration to-day , tak - ing into account grand-children and great-grand - children , would show upwards of two million of representatives of this blood among us , these being scattered through every state and territory of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Rasmus B. Anderson	PERSON	, the well - known champion of the Northmen , has recently published a volume of nearly five hundred pages , well-arranged and well-indexed , which he calls a '' first chapter '' in the history of Norwegian Immi - gration , from 1821-1840 .

		There were very few Scandinavians in the
United States	LOCATION	before
1821	DATE	.

		In the years between that time and
1840	DATE	, six main settlements were made : one in
Orleans	LOCATION	county ,
New York	LOCATION	; one in
LaSalle	LOCATION	county ,
Illinois	LOCATION	; one in
Chicago	LOCATION	; three in
Wisconsin	LOCATION	; besides a number of smaller colonies elsewhere .

		Himself the son of immigrants of
1836	DATE	, Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	has gathered a vast fund of information about the Norwegians , showing in some measure the contribution which they have made to the history of the world , and especially to that of the
United States of America	LOCATION	.

		The privations of the pioneers are well set forth , and a large number of biographical sketches are given , which , interspersed with pictures of individ - uals , of homes , and of public buildings , will be of great service to the thoughtful historian of later years , who , looking at the cosmopolitan population of this country , attempts to show what each race - element has contributed to its upbuilding .

		Others have presented the claims of the Scotch , the Irish , the Scotch-Irish , the French , the Huguenots as a special branch of French , the Dutch , the
Pennsyl	PERSON	- vania Dutch , the Germans , and the Welsh , and this new volume will be welcomed as a valuable addi - tion to the growing literature of American popula - tion .

		A creditable list of the names of prominent persons of this Norwegian descent might be made ; but far more satisfactory is the feeling , which many share with Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	, that the stock has been 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, uniformly excellent , and welcomed everywhere dur - ing the busy three-score years and ten since the first stragglers came to cast their lot in the Western land .

		Occasionally in the volume there are indications of what might be written in a '' second chapter , '' but the pioneer historian is the one who is especially to be commended , for the collection of material from the older citizens , who are fast dying out , is far more difficult than the compilation of facts about the life of the period since
1840	DATE	.

		The book is pub - lished by the author , at

W. Nixon	PERSON	's narration of '' How
Marcus Whitman	PERSON	Saved Ore - gon '' -LRB-
Star Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- is the work of an enthusiast rather than an histo - rian , and is a collection of newspaper sketches rather than a book .

		The story of
Marcus Whitman	PERSON	, with reference both to his ride to save
Oregon	LOCATION	and to the tragedy at
Waiilatpui	LOCATION	, has already been ade - quately told , and in much better English , by Mr.
Barrows	PERSON	, in his volume on
Oregon	LOCATION	for the '' Com - monwealths Series . ''

		The present work , although based upon tradition mainly , is substantially cor - rect in its statements ; yet there is an atmosphere of rhapsody for the hero and of disparagement for those whom he overcame which is not historical .

		Mr.
Barrows	PERSON	has given the true setting of the story with regard to
Daniel Webster	PERSON	, and it is not neces - sary to belittle him in order to magnify Whitman 's great service .

		The proof-reading of this work is very careless , and the author 's English is most slovenly , while his dates are occasionally incorrect for stand - ard events .

		The '' Introduction , '' by another hand , illustrates one of the abuses of bookmaking .

		If the book is worth anything , it should go on its own merits ; and this introduction by the Rev.
Frank W. Gunsaulus	PERSON	does not help it .

		It would be difficult to put into four scant pages more bad English , mixed figure , and distortion of historical proportion .

		One knows not what to say of such a statement as this concerning Whitman : '' He was more to the ulte - rior
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	than
John Harvard	PERSON	has ever been to the Northeast of our common country . ''

		Few works of equal length have Stories of the i - \ t t ^ i i r
Wagner	PERSON	operas , called torth so large an amount of comment and criticism as the eleven operas of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	.

		The author has been discussed as poet , as musical composer , as drama - tist ; his theories have been recklessly assailed and as recklessly praised ; his character and career as a man have been in turn lauded and decried .

		A cat - alogue of a
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	library , compiled by an en - thusiastic bibliographer and published some years ago , had already reached three large octavo vol - umes , and many additions have since accumulated .

		A new book on
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	, covering new ground , would seem to be almost impossible ; yet such an one has just come to hand in Mr.
H. A. Guerber	PERSON	's '' Stories of the Wagner Operas '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The charm of the book is in its adherence to the simple aim expressed by its title .

		No at - tempt is made to discuss the '' music of the future , '' to discourse of aria parlante or leit-motif , nor even to deal with the author 's biography except so far as it concerns the choice of his subjects and the sources of his inspiration .

		The stories of the Wag - ner music dramas are here retold in straightforward and attractive prose , according to the same princi - ple that has made Mr.
Guerber	PERSON	's other books so pop - ular .

		The illustrations , one for each story , are of uncommon beauty , some being copies of familiar designs by the best masters , and others being ap - parently drawn specially for this work .

		bridge , to succeed
Froude	PERSON	, aroused much interest
last winter	DATE	, and not a little curiosity to know more of his life and work than had pre - viously been made public .

		For many years it has been noticeable that when English scholars have spoken of
Lord Acton	PERSON	, it has been in terms of the greatest respect , although he has published hardly anything .

		On
June 11	DATE	, he delivered his inaugural lecture at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and this is now printed in a , small volume called '' A Lecture on the Study of History '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		A single lecture , of course , can not provide sufficient material to justify so great a reputation as that which
Lord Acton	PERSON	has so long enjoyed , but as far as it goes it shows that in him
Freeman	PERSON	and
Froude	PERSON	have found no unworthy suc - cessor .

		It reveals wide reading and philosophic breadth of manner , although there are indications that the writer has not fully digested his vast stores of information .

		The notes , which are about twice as voluminous as the text of the lecture proper , ad - mit us perhaps too freely into the secrets of his workshop .

		It would be interesting to know who is responsible for the bad proof-reading of this vol - ume , which has necessitated a list of no less than forty-three errata ; even in the list itself we have detected two errors and one unintelligible correction .

		Students of the Elizabethan period Italian influence on Q f our l etters are O f course conscious Elizabethan plays .

		She has already collected , she informs us , '' more than one hundred and sixty translations from the Italian , made by ninety or more translators , including nearly every well-known Elizabethan author , except Shake - speare and

		A chapter on `` the progress of American Independence and its basis in the law of

seventeenth century	DATE	, and illustrating the evolution of the idea out of the principles of the British Constitution .

		This chap - ter is a valuable contribution to our national history .

		Succeeding chapters take up , clause by clause , the provisions of our Constitution , stating in familiar language the purport and effect of the judicial opin - ions in which these provisions have severally been expounded .

		The Revolutionary period is of such im - portance that it has frequently been chosen for spe - cial investigation by students of American financial history ; but on the other hand the mode of proced - ure in making appropriations , which is the particu - lar subject of Mr.
Bullock	PERSON	's inquiry , has usually been neglected by American writers on finance .

		This essay gives evidence of much patient research among governmental records and possesses interest for the student as showing the development of budgetary methods in

		However , we can not com - mend the editor 's work very highly .

		The introduc - tion is of little value , and the classification clumsy : e.g. , he separates the '' syllogistic '' dog from the '' reasoning '' !

		Again , the stories on pages 208-9 plainly belong under the heading , Dogs and Lan - guage ; and the story on page 198 is clearly not a dog-story at all , but a cow-story .

		The only thing of any very serious scientific interest in the volume is Sir
John Lubbock	PERSON	's two letters on teaching dogs to read .

		This book , however , is not meant for the scientist , but for the dog-lover , to whom it will ap - peal most effectually by its many very interesting narratives of actual experiences .

Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's great contemporary .

		While the book makes no pretence of being more than a compilation , it is praiseworthy for the careful use that has been made of the best author - ities , and for the quality of its language .

		The style of the translation is modeled to a considerable extent upon the Biblical English of
Wyclif	LOCATION	, although obsolete words are but sparingly used .

		The apparatus of introduction , notes , and appendices supplies the beginner with the essentials , and the book as a whole may be said to ac - complish its modest purpose in a very satisfactory manner .

		Many poets miss their proper audience for being too voluminous or too widely dispersed in unrelated tomes .

Stopford Brooke for Shelley	PERSON	, by Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	for Mr.
Aubrey De Vere	PERSON	, or by Mr.

		The '' Mermaid '' series of old English dramatists , having rounded its first full score of volumes , enters upon what we hope may become a second score with a selection from
Chapman	PERSON	, edited by Mr.
M. L. Phelps	PERSON	.

		Selection was an easy matter in this case , for in no other Elizabethan dramatist is the distinction between good and inferior work so marked as it is with
Chapman	PERSON	.

		The volume contains '' All Fools '' the two Bussy d'Am - bois plays , and the two
Byron	PERSON	plays , a selection that way nothing less than inevitable .

		Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	writes a scholarly introduction , but makes a lower estimate of the value of
Chapman	PERSON	's work than we are disposed to accept .

		The Cambridge Edition '' of '' The Complete Poet - ical Works of
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is similar in all mechanical respects to the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	''
Longfellow	PERSON	,
Whittier	LOCATION	, and
Browning	PERSON	, except for the lesser mimber of pages and the consequently thicker paper .

		There is an etched portrait , a biography by Mr.
Scudder	PERSON	, with notes and indexes .

		We have so often before praised these editions that we need now do no more than refer to what we have said of the earlier vol - Times of the series .

		Few books accomplish their pur - pose as completely as these , or are so satisfactory in every way .

		Messrs.
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	send us a new and very attractive school edition of Messrs.
Greenough	PERSON	and
Kittredge	ORGANIZATION	's '' ^ neid , '' Books I. to VI .

		The illustrations are par - ticularly well-chosen and interesting , while the notes include many references to parallel passages in English poetry .

		From the same publishers we have a little vol - ume of '' Selected Lives from
Cornelius Nepos	PERSON	, '' edited by Dr.
Arthur W. Roberts	PERSON	.

		Dr.
W. B. Owen	PERSON	has edited for Messrs.
Leach	PERSON	,
Shewell & Sanborn	ORGANIZATION	the first book of Cicero 's '' De Oratore , '' making a neat and useful text-book .

		While on the subject of
Cicero	LOCATION	, we may also mention Dr.
W. Peterson	PERSON	's translation , with notes , of the speech in defence of Cluentius .

		-LRB- Mac - millan . -RRB-

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish `` A German Reader for Beginners , '' by Professor
Charles Harris	PERSON	.

		The se - lections are grouped according to their difficulty , and include several lengthy pieces .

		A vocabulary permits this book to be used without the aid of the dictionary .

		From the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	we have an edition of
Stifter	PERSON	's `` Das Heidedorf , '' edited by Mr.
Max Lentz	PERSON	; and a volume of `` Bilder aus der Deutschen Litera - tur , '' by Professor
J. Keller	PERSON	.

		The latter work is an elementary history , with selections .

		We may also note in this connection the '' Three German Tales '' -LRB- from
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Zschokke	ORGANIZATION	, and
Kleist	PERSON	-RRB- , edited by Mr.
A. B. Nichols	PERSON	-LRB- Holt -RRB- ; and Dr.
Max Poll	PERSON	's edition of `` Emilia Galotti '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- .

		Each of these books has an introduction and notes .

		The Lady of the Lake , '' edited by Dr.
Homer B. Sprague	PERSON	; `` The Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	, '' under the same editorial supervision ; and '' Select Minor Poems of
John Milton	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
James E. Thomas	PERSON	, are three recent additions to the '' Studies in English Clas - sics '' of Messrs. Silver ,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
May	DATE	- nard ,
Merrill & Co.	ORGANIZATION	send us , in their '' English Classic '' series , More 's '' Utopia , '' and a selection from
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's essays , both anonymously edited , and hence open to suspicion .

		A far better book than any of these is Pro- fessor
O. F. Emerson	PERSON	's edition of '' Rasselas , '' published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two school editions of Cicero 's '' De Senectute '' have just come to us .

		One , by Professor
Frank E. Rockwood	PERSON	, is published by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	; the other , edited by Mr.
E. S. Shuckburgh	PERSON	and Dr.
James C. Egbert	PERSON	, is a volume in the '' Elementary Classics '' series of
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish , in their '' College Series of Greek Authors , '' '' Eight Orations of Lysias , '' edited by Dr.
Morris H. Morgan	PERSON	.

		We may also mention , in this connection , Mr.
John H. Huddilston	PERSON	's '' Essentials of New Testament Greek , '' published by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Ralph M. Tarr	PERSON	's `` Elementary Physical Geography '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a book so attractive in ap - pearance , and so modern in method , that it should make instant appeal to the progressive educator .

		For one thing , it is a book like other books not the ungainly and unwieldy quarto of which most children think when the word `` geography '' is mentioned .

		Much is gained by the octavo form , and little or nothing lost .

		Physical maps , fortunately , do not need the acreage of paper de - manded by maps of the ordinary sort .

		It is hard to find a place for physical geography in the school curriculum ; the high school does not want it , and the grammar school is not up to it .

		Such a book as Professor
Tarr	PERSON	's , at any rate , is distinctly a manual for the secondary school .

		LITERARY NOTES .

		New editions of Mr.
L. B. Seeley	PERSON	's ''
Horace Walpole	PERSON	and His World '' and ''
Fanny Burney	PERSON	and Her Friends '' are among the latest importations of Messrs.

		La Recherche de 1 ` Absolu , '' translated by Miss Mar - riage , with a preface by Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	, is the latest addition to the acceptable Dent-Macmillan edition of Balzac in English .

Thackeray	PERSON	's '' Novels by
Eminent Hands	ORGANIZATION	, '' and `` The Echo Club '' by

		Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	has translated half a dozen short tales from the Italian of

		26 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, A reader of THE DIAL wishes to find a short poem , published some years ago , based on the farewell of Andromache -LRB- JSneid , Book III . -RRB-

		, of which he can re - call but one line : '' Her grief is more than I can bear . ''

		Can anyone identify the poem from this fragment ?

		The concluding volumes of the charming
Aitken	PERSON	- Dent edition of Defoe -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will include the rare '' Due Preparations for the Plague , '' and a number of pamphlets relating to
Captain Avery	LOCATION	,
Jack Sheppard	PERSON	,
Jonathan Wild	PERSON	, and other pirates and robbers , now re - printed for the first time .

		Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	's Sons ' popular '' Thistle Edition '' of

Stevenson	PERSON	's life in the
South Seas	LOCATION	, from
1888	DATE	to
1894	DATE	.

		The '' Extension Bulletins '' of the
University of the State	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	are doing valuable work as adjuncts to popular education .

		The latest issues -LRB-
October	DATE	and
November	DATE	-RRB- are devoted , respectively , to '' Study Clubs '' and '' Extension of
University Teaching	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The latter work is by Dr.
James E. Rus	PERSON	- sell , of the
University of Colorado	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Stepniak , '' the Russian revolutionist , was run over by a railway train near
London	LOCATION	, on the 23d of Decem - ber , and instantly killed .

		His real name was never divulged to the English public , and the current news - paper statements that it was Dragornanoff are without foundation .

		`` Stepniak '' visited
Chicago	LOCATION	about four years ago , and gave a lecture before the
Twentieth Cen	ORGANIZATION	- tury Club .

		He was a forcible writer and speaker , and the command of English displayed in his books is re - markable .

		The new international magazine , ''
Cosmopolis	LOCATION	, '' the first number of which is to appear in
January	DATE	, will deal with the literature , politics , and drama of
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Each writer will use his own language , and his remarks will be confined to his sub - ject in so far as it affects the country which he repre - sents .

		On the English side , Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	has promised to contribute the literary , Mr.
Henry Nor	PERSON	- man the political , and Mr.
A. B. Walkley	PERSON	the dramatic material .

		Mr.
Fisher Unwin	PERSON	is the English publisher of the magazine .

		That genial and wholesome family journal , '' The Outlook , '' announces that hereafter one of its issues every month will be a '' magazine number '' that is , will be enlarged , abundantly illustrated , and otherwise made more like a monthly magazine than a weekly paper .

		A series of papers on '' The Higher Life of American Cities '' is promised as one feature of these '' magazine numbers . ''

		Dr.
Albert Shaw	PERSON	will write of
New York	LOCATION	, Mr.
Melville	PERSON	Stone of
Chicago	LOCATION	, Dr.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	of
Boston	LOCATION	, Mr.
Talcott Williams	PERSON	of
Phil	PERSON	- adelphia ,
Miss Grace King of New Orleans	ORGANIZATION	, and the Rev.
John Snyder	PERSON	of
St. Louis	LOCATION	.

		A
Paris	LOCATION	correspondent gives these interesting particu - lars regarding the library of the late
Ernest Renan	PERSON	: `` The complete catalogue of
Renan	ORGANIZATION	's library has just been published .

		It will be well to add it to the writer 's own works , for it is the bibliography of what he accom - plished .

		Renan was not a bibliophile , and doubtless he took comparatively little interest in the form of a work .

		Books were for him above all tools .

		In turning over the leaves of his catalogue you enter really into the laboratory where all his life long he pursued unremit - tingly his scientific work , without rest , without discour - agement , with an imperturbable faith , the faith of his youth in the future of science .

		The Oriental and Bib - lical collection is incomparably rich .

		It includes more than three thousand works .

		There are to be found all the books , reviews , and pamphlets which he consulted for his exegetical , philological , archseological , and his - torical studies .

		These books Renan loved as the com - panions of his great labors .

		He often expressed the hope that after his death they would not be dispersed .

		It is his family 's wish that that desire should be ful - filled .

		They would like to dispose of the library as a whole , or at least not to let the richest portion of it namely , the Oriental collection be sold by auction . ''

		MR.
WATSON	PERSON	'S SONNET TO
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		towering daughter , Titan of the West , Behind a thousand leagues of foam secure , Thou toward whom our inmost heart is pure Of all intent , although thou threatenest With most unfilial hand thy mother 's breast , Not for one breathing space may earth endure The thought of war 's intolerable cure For such vague pains as vex to-day thy rest .

		But if thou hast more strength than thou canst spend In tasks of peace , and find ` st her yoke too tame , Help us to smite the cruel , and befriend The succorless , and put the false to shame : So shall the ages laud thee , and thy name Be lovely among nations to the end .

		THE DIAL , 29 THE REVIEW OF REVIEWS .

		EDITED BY
ALBERT SHAW	PERSON	.

		Trial Subscription for
Five Months	ORGANIZATION	,
$ 1.00	MONEY	.

		Three recent sample copies , cents .

		Subscription per Year ,
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		The Literary World of
October 5	DATE	says : '' We are deeply impressed from month to month with the value of the REVIEW OF REVIEWS , which is a sort of Eiffel Tower for the survey of the whole field of periodical literature .

		And yet it has a mind and voice of its own , and speaks out with decision and sense on all public topics of the hour .

		It is a singular combination of the monthly magazine and the daily newspaper .

		It is daily in its fresh - ness ; it is monthly in its method .

		It is the world under a field-glass .

		If we were the teacher of a school we should use the ' Review of Reviews ' as a reader , and so make it do duty as an illustrated text-book in current history . ''

		The only way to describe adequately the REVIEW OF REVIEWS is to put several copies into your hands ; for it is so entirely different from all other magazines that one can not form an idea of its timely interest and com - prehensive value without reading it .

		The RE VIE W OF RE VIE WS , as its name implies , gives in readable form the gist of the best articles in the other magazines all over the world , generally on the same date that they are published .

		With the recent extraordinary increase of worthy periodicals , these careful reviews , sum - maries , and quotations , containing the kernel of period - ical literature , are alone worth the subscription price .

		Aside from these departments , the editorial and con - tributed features of the REVIEW OF REVIEWS are themselves equal in extent to a magazine .

		The Editor 's '' Progress of the World '' is an invaluable chronicle of the happenings of the thirty days just past , with pictures of the men and women who have made the history of the month on every page .

		The brilliant character sketches , fully illustrated , of such notable personalities in every country and sphere of action as
Pope Leo	PERSON	, the Czar of
Russia	LOCATION	, Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	,
Thomas Edison	PERSON	, whoever is for the month most spe - cially prominent , are of absorbing interest .

		If anything really notable occurs in the economic , political , or literary world , the reader of the REVIEW OF REVIEWS will find it discussed immediately not after waiting two months by the writer best fitted to do so .

		Thousands of letters prompted by an introduction to the REVIEW OF REVIEWS , often from celebrated , and always from discerning people , have been merely varia - tions on the themes , `` the magazine is indispensable , '' `` the REVIEW OF RE VIEWS is invaluable , '' `` no Amer - ican citizen should be without it , '' `` it is a liberal educa - tion , '' etc. , etc. .

		THE DIAL 31 GRAND WINTER CRUISES BY THE MAGNIFICENT TWIN-SCREW EXPRESS STEAMERS OF THE HAMBURG-AMERICAN LINE .

		FOR several years past the
Hamburg	LOCATION	-
American Line	ORGANIZATION	has arranged cruises at certain seasons , placing at the disposal of travellers one of its floating palaces , and affording them all the comforts and luxuries of modern life .

		These cruises have become so popular with the American travelling public that the Company has made them a permanent feature of its service .

		THE FIRST CRUISE will be by the Twin -
Screw Express Steamer FURST	ORGANIZATION

New York	LOCATION	.

		The cruise from
New York	LOCATION	to the Orient and return to
New York	LOCATION	will occupy about ten weeks .

		Pas - sengers desiring to prolong their stay in
Europe	LOCATION	before returning to
America	LOCATION	may leave the excursion upon touching at
Genoa	LOCATION	the second time and take any one of the
Hamburg	LOCATION	-
American Line 's Express Steamers	ORGANIZATION	from
Hamburg	LOCATION	,
Southampton	LOCATION	, or
Cherbourg	LOCATION	, to
New York	LOCATION	, up to
August 1 , 1896	DATE	.

		Ever since the childhood of the human race the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	coasts have played the most important part in the history of advancing civilization .


Greece	LOCATION	has bequeathed to us her precious legacy of art and poetry ,
Rome	LOCATION	has given us her grand representatives of patriotism and statecraft ,
Egypt	LOCATION	has filled our souls with thrills of awe and wonderment , the Holy Land has inspired us with lofty sentiments and relig - ious fervor .

		All along the blue
Mediterranean Sea	LOCATION	we find the indelible imprints of man 's past , the glo - rious monuments of antiquity .

		The whole scenery of ancient history unrolls before our eyes , not in artistic reproduction , but in all its realistic grandeur and glory .

		The memories of such a trip , the sights of the scenery of the most remarkable events of man 's history , will remain for a lifetime in the soul of every beholder .

		THE SECOND CRUISE will be by the
Twin-Screw Express Steamer COLUMBIA	ORGANIZATION	, Cap - tain Vogelgesang , sailing from
New York	LOCATION
January 25 , 1896	DATE	, to the WEST INDIES and the SPANISH MAIN .

		The Itinerary will be : From

Venezuela	LOCATION	-RRB- ,
Kingston	LOCATION	-LRB-
Jamaica	LOCATION	-RRB- ,
Havana	LOCATION	, Key West , Old Point Comfort , and
New York	LOCATION	.

		This tour lasts about four and a half weeks , and offers American tourists a most attractive and com - fortable means of escaping the bitter blasts of our rigorous Northern winters .

		A glance at the itinerary suggests at once tales of romance and adventure , recalling many a famous exploit of dead-and-gone worthies .

		But it also presents to the mind a vista of smooth seas and lovely palm-covered beaches , of beautiful scenery and strange peoples , offering an ever-varying and inexhaustible fund of novelty to divert the mind and charm the senses .

		In cruising from port to port in these en - chanted seas , among verdant and flower-clothed islands , nature is seen in her brightest and most beautiful mood , and life in the tropics at its best .

		It would be difficult , indeed , to imagine any attribute of an ideal winter resort not found among these '' Fortunate Isles . ''

		CABLE CONNECTION WITH ALL PORTS TOUCHED ON THIS CRUISE .

		TIME AT EACH PORT IS AMPLY SUFFICIENT TO VISIT ALL PLACES OF INTEREST .

		The
Red Republic	ORGANIZATION	' stands head and shoulders above any American novel of the year .

		There are in it wonderfully impressive pictures of the days of the Commune .

		I know of no book fiction or history in which the savage cruelty of the mob , the pitilessness of irresponsible power , the pathos of headless armies marching to death , are so vividly described .

		It has blood and it has viscera .

		And the thing lives . ''

		`` Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	showed in ' The King in Yellow ' that he had the clue to the secret .

		By far the most notable book of the week .

		Last season American letters were enriched by two very original and very remarkable books ,
viz.	LOCATION	, '
Chimmie Fadden	PERSON	' and ' The King in Yellow . ' '

		The Red Republic ' is , I think , the one sort of his - torical novel which has a chance of living very far into the next century .

		... A wonderfully real and intensely vital picture of the
Commune	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is in the book a fine quality of romance which carries you along to the last page in a pleasurable state of excitement .

		... A book that will hold your attention from the first page to the last .

		54 THE SCHOLAR AND HIS FUNCTION IN SOCIETY .

		In the last issue of THE DIAL an urgent plea was made for serious thought and sober judg - ment in the matter of the grave international complication with which we were suddenly con - fronted at the approach of Christmas-tide , and which seemed to evoke in many quarters a spirit of recklessness creditable neither to our mor - ality nor our intelligence as a nation .

		With - out attempting to discuss the political questions concerned , we emphasized the need of delibera - tion in all such matters , and stated as our posi - tion that in a dispute involving , as the Vene - zuelan controversy does , delicate questions of international usage and historical investiga - tions such as only the well-equipped scholar can undertake , it was the part of sobriety and self-respect to maintain a decent reserve , await - ing the final verdict of the trained specialist , and provisionally deferring to the judgment of those alone whose authority can have any real weight .

		Our modest '' plea for sanity '' has called forth a number of communications , most of them in sympathy with the attitude of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, but a few breathing the `` amazement and indignation '' aroused in patriotic breasts by our tame and spiritless views .

		We are not concerned to reply to these angry outpourings , for they are all beside the mark .

		Those that make elaborate arguments about the boundary line of
Venezuela	LOCATION	discuss a sub - ject upon which we have expressed no opinion , and in which we take but a feeble interest .

		Those that denounce our utterances as '' trea - sonable '' and '' unpatriotic '' have yet to learn the meaning of the words '' fidelity '' and '' pa - triotism . '' ''

		Our true country , '' as
Lowell	PERSON	once wrote , '' is that ideal realm which we represent to ourselves under the names of religion , duty , and the like .

		Our terrestrial organizations are but far-off approaches to so fair a model , and all they are verily traitors who resist not any attempt to divert them from this their original intendment . ''

		We are happy to note that the opening weeks of the new year have brought much testimony to the existence among our fellow-countrymen of a nobler patriotic passion than is known to the philosophy of the jingo , and that hundreds of weighty utterances have voiced the sentiments of justice and humanity and civilization , justifying our appeal almost before it was made .

		There is , however , one aspect of the recent discussion , as of most public discussions in which fundamental principles are concerned , that seems to call for thoughtful consideration .

		The greatest fault of democracy is that it so often presumes to decide upon questions which in their very nature are to be decided upon intelligently only by experts .

		Every philosoph - 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, ical writer upon democratic institutions , whether sympathizing with them or not , has put his finger upon this weak spot , and found in it the greatest menace to the permanence of popular government .

		A sound decision upon almost any problem of political science , of economics or finance , is within the reach of specially dis - ciplined minds alone , and the opinion of the unthinking masses upon such matters has just as much or as little real weight as an opinion upon the special problems of engineering , or chemistry , or physiology .

		This doctrine , of course , will never receive the assent of the dem - agogue , whether he be a political schemer , or a legislator chosen by popular vote , or the editor of a newspaper conducted upon modern com - mercial principles .

		It is the business of all these people to pretend that their opinions upon the delicate problems presented by the art of government are as good as anybody 's , and probably a little better ; their stock in trade is an infinite self-assurance , and their method the method of flattery , either rank or insidious , according to the particular vanities or suscep - tibilities of their hearers .

		For many years these artful manipulators of public opinion , in pursuit of their ad captan - dum policy , have sedulously labored to devel - op the antagonism always latent between the masses and the men of scholarship .

		The pro- cess is by no means peculiar to this country , but has probably been more successfully car - ried out with us than elsewhere , in consequence of the innate irreverence of the American na - tional character , its unpleasant self-assertive - ness , and the superficiality of the educational influences under which it has in large part been shaped .

		A curiously mythical notion of the scholar and his function in society , as unlike the reality as anything that could well be im - agined , has come currently to be held , and in perfect good faith , by a large proportion of our population .

		One can hardly take up an Amer - ican newspaper without coming upon many a covert sneer at the scholar and his modes of thinking , upon many an expression of ill con - cealed contempt for his impracticability and his idealism .

		He is spoken of as if he were some curious sort of stuffed animal , exhib - ited in the glass case of some university or other institution of learning .

		That he has opinions upon the subject to which he has de - voted a lifetime of thought is , of course , a fa - miliar fact , for he sometimes has the temerity to state them in public ; but that they should be taken seriously by the plain sensible man of affairs , who lives in the world and rubs against it every day , is too extraordinary a proposition to be considered .

		This singular distortion of view has received so frequent illustration of late years that ex - amples seem hardly necessary .

		The history of our national economic and financial policy since the Civil War is an almost unbroken record of fatuous ignorance , and empirical experimenta - tion , and insolent disregard of the best estab - lished inductions of science .

		The only ade - quate analogy is that offered by a man who barely escapes with his life from a succession of diseases , each the result of some act of reck - lessness , and each dealt with in accordance with the rules of some new quackery or some time - honored superstition .

		That there is such a thing as the scientific treatment of disease , and that imminent disease may be averted by the precautions suggested by scientific knowledge , are the last propositions that such a man will admit .

		And the body politic seems to fare in much the same way , for your Demos is firm in his prejudices , and distrusts above all things else the pedantry of the university professor or other variety of trained practitioner . ''

		What can he know about politics ? ''

		some one said of
Lowell	LOCATION	, a few years before the death of our great American scholar ; '' he never made a stump speech in his life . '' ''

		What can he know about the tariff ? ''

		says the self-confident wool - grower of the authoritative writer upon eco - nomic science ; '' he never raised a flock of sheep in his life . ''

		The application of these illustrations to the Venezuelan controversy is obvious enough .

		That controversy presents leaving its ethics out of the question two special problems , one of international law and one of statesmanship .

		The first problem is concerned with the rela - tion of the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	to the body of in - ternational law and usage , together with the question of the legitimacy of an application of that Doctrine to this particular case .

		The sec - ond problem is concerned with the possible menace to our national safety resulting from a slight enlargement of a small English colony in a corner of
South America	LOCATION	.

		Both of these problems belong preeminently to the domain of the scholar , and upon neither of them is the opinion of the '' man in the street '' likely to have any value .

		Now the judgment of com - petent authorities upon both of these problems , in this country as well as in
Europe	LOCATION	, is sub - stantially unanimous as far as the essential ele - ments are concerned .

		That judgment runs
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 39 counter to an opinion , or rather a sentiment , that seems to have a somewhat widespread currency among our population , a sentiment based mainly upon prejudices of the baser sort , and inflamed by the pernicious zeal of time - serving politicians and journalists .

		What should be the attitude of the sober-minded to - ward this division of opinion ?

		It seems to us that but one rational answer to such a question is possible .

		The voice of a man who has made the subjects concerned the study of his life - time , who can bring to bear upon the problems the full weight of historical scholarship and scientific method , must surely outweigh the voices of many thousands of butchers and bakers and candlestick-makers , however suc - cessfully they may ply their respective crafts .

		It is only where really competent opinion is divided , as in the case of the fierce discussion about acquired characteristics and heredity which just now divides the biologists into two opposed camps , that the layman is at all justi - fied in taking sides , and even in such a case a modest suspension of judgment is for him the more fitting part . ''

		The majority is always wrong '' is the vehement utterance of one of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's characters , reflecting , doubtless , the view of the dramatist himself in one of his moods of angry individualism .

		Without ac - cepting this as a complete induction , we may say that history shows the majority to have been often wrong , at least , and honors the minority that has stood for justice and right .

		And we may add that the minority , when it really is right , and stands patiently steadfast , nearly always in the end brings around to its own way of thinking the wrong-headed majority .

		THE STAGNATION IN RUSSIAN LITERATURE .

		The close connection between politics and letters , which has been a distinctive characteristic of the intellectual life of
Russia	LOCATION	, was never more strikingly illustrated than at the present time .

		The confusion , uncertainty , and haziness of the political situation are fully reflected in the literature of the country .

		The land which has produced Tourgue ` nieff ,
Gogol	LOCATION	,
Dostoievsky	LOCATION	,
Saltikoff	PERSON	, and
Tolstoi	PERSON	, is now without a single definite literary school or movement .

		Tol - stoi , to be sure , lives and writes .

		His latest novel , '' Master and Man , '' whose success outside of
Russia	LOCATION	has not been very decided , has proved disappointing to the progressive youth of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		While every - thing
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	publishes is eagerly read and widely discussed , the ideas which he represents are no longer dominant .

		There is little sympathy with the cult of individual self-improvement and altruism ; progress is generally expected to take the form of a change in the economic , political , and educational conditions of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Tolstoi is indifferent to external reforms , and insists that character alone is essential .

		He exhorts individual men and women to be unselfish , brave , and truthful , and has no hope of improvement through any other agency .

		Nearly all his recent works , including '' Master and Man , '' enforce this moral ; and hence most of his readers , while admit - ting the literary power and charm of his latter-day fiction , declare that
Russia	LOCATION	no longer finds in it that inspiration and that aid which
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	afforded it in the days when his doctrines enjoyed considerable popularity .

		There is considerable interest in the new novel which
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	is understood to have nearly ready for publication .

		It deals with the life of Siberian convicts , and shows that moral regen - eration is not imposssible even under the worst con - ditions , provided love in its most unselfish form is present to guide and comfort the victims .

		Accord - ing to reports in the Russian press , the heroine of the new novel is a young woman unjustly accused of having poisoned a rich merchant with whom she lived in illicit relations , while the hero is the foreman of the jury which convicts the woman .

		This fore - man falls in love with the supposed murderer , and follows her to
Siberia	LOCATION	.

		Whatever the artistic merits of this new story may prove to be , its '' moral '' will be essentially the same as that of '' Master and Man , '' and it can not be taken as expressing the present sentiments and aspirations of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Tol - stoi is powerful , but he stands virtually alone .

		The progressive elements of
Russia	LOCATION	recognize his sin - cerity and moral greatness , but decline to follow him .

		He is not a leader of men , and his writings do not impel his readers to action along the lines indicated by him .

		The younger writers of fiction , having no special doctrine to preach , turn to actual life for their material , and find it colorless , vague , poor , unstable .

		Being , most of them , extremely realistic , their novels naturally reflect the emptiness and confusion of the life they depict .

		The most successful of them
Mamin	PERSON	,
Chekhoff	LOCATION	,
Korolenko	LOCATION	, and others still continue to describe peasant life ; but a number have abandoned that field and turned their attention to the aristocratic classes and the high life of the capital .

		This departure is deemed very significant by the best Russian critics , for ever since the eman - cipation of the serfs the `` Populist '' movement in
Russia	LOCATION	has attracted the finest writers , and the life and labor of the people the peasantry and the city proletariat have furnished the themes for their productions .

		This literary movement has coincided and corresponded with the revolutionary Populist movement , which sent thousands of the most cul - tured and refined youths into the villages and fac - tories , to live and work with the common people for the sake of disseminating liberal political ideas among them and scattering the seeds of revolution .

		Now , however , the revolutionary movement is prac - 40 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, tically dead in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The young men and women no longer go among the people as propagandists and conspirators against the powers that be , while terrorism has been abandoned as wasteful and futile .

		The desire of the progressive minority to be useful to the masses is as intense as it has ever been , but the methods have radically changed .

		Literature has not as yet adapted itself to these new conditions , and it is at present colorless , barren , and vapid .

		The high hopes of the reformers having been dashed by the reactionary attitude of the Czar , con - stitutional and political changes , while still secretly yearned for , have ceased to form the staple of dis - cussion .

		But it would be an error to suppose that no improvements at all are expected in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The present government is apparently determined to demonstrate that absolutism is not incompatible with true progress , and a number of important re - forms seem to have been decided upon .

		Perhaps the most important task undertaken by it is univer - sal popular education .

		There is a veritable educa - tional crusade in
Russia	LOCATION	at present .

		The Provincial Assemblies , the press , official and voluntary socie - ties , all talk about the means of raising the popular intelligence .

		Thousands of new schools are pro- posed for villages , night schools , libraries , lectures , and reading rooms are being organized in the cities , popular editions of national and foreign authors are being undertaken , and the young men and women of the country are turning their attention to this sphere of activity .

		Higher education is not neg - lected .

		A medical college for women has been au - thorized by the government , and several new com - mercial colleges have been opened for graduates of female gymnasia .

		A warm controversy has arisen in regard to the character of the proposed common schools .

		The Conservatives insist on religious train - ing and on the control of the schools by the clergy .

		They want none but priests as teachers , and plainly intimate that secular education would prove a source of the greatest danger to absolutism .

		Secular teachers , they say , would disseminate revolutionary heresies and undermine the foundations of
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Moreover , mere intellectual training , instruction in the '' three R 's , '' they argue , will be of little utility either to the masses or to the govern - ment .

		Honesty , loyalty , sobriety , and strong prac - tical sense , are virtues entirely unrelated to the abil - ity to read and write , and the government ought not to encourage education that is not spiritual , moral , Christian .

		On the other hand , the Liberals naturally insist on complete separation between the schools and the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and they point to the tendencies in the civilized world at large as sustaining their view .

		The government has not interfered with this discus - sion , but it is feared that it will finally take the side of the Conservatives .

		Economic and judicial reforms are also among the probabilities of the near future .

		New land - banks for the pesantry are planned , and in certain Provincial Assemblies it is proposed to organize legal bureaus to which the peasants could apply for free advice .

		The monopoly of the sale of liquor , which the government has experimentally intro - duced in a few provinces , appears to have worked well , and the disappearance of all private saloons is regarded as a great reform by all Russian writers except the few who claim that the nobility , rather than the government , ought to enjoy this monopoly .

		In short , reform , though not of a political or con - stitutional nature , is in the air .

		People are in a state of expectancy .

		They are hopeful , and yet skep - tical .

		They believe that something will be done by the present government , and they are eager to lend a hand and cooperate in anything really conducive to national welfare ; at the same time , they fear that the reactionary spirit presiding over these reform - atory movements may emasculate and deflower the most promising of the reforms .

		Under these circumstances the literary life can hardly be very vigorous .

		Publicists and economists manage to extract some comfort from the dim pros - pects and possibilities of progress , but the lot of the novelists and story-tellers is hard indeed .

		The present is dismal and chaotic , and they are not even sure that they are on the eve of a new era .

		Real - ism has always been supreme in Russian fiction , but even realism needs definite human documents and an active life full of movement , interest , and strug - gle .

		Stagnation , indefiniteness , confusion , are fatal to it .

		All is talk at present in
Russia	LOCATION	; there are no types or things worthy of study and portrayal .

		The Tourgue ` nieff atmosphere has vanished ; the ter - rorist and revolutionary days are over ; the enthu - siasm of the Populist propogandists has spent itself .

		No one knows what the future will bring .

		Tolstoi alone , as said above , unconcerned and indifferent , with a firm faith in the saving quality of his phil - osophy of life , is able to write and preach in the form of semi-realistic fiction .

		He has his ideal , source of inspiration , and message , and he finds sermons in stones and lessons in everything .

		THE DIAL 41 THE IJIFE AND TIMES OF
CORREGGIO	LOCATION	.

		* It has always seemed somewhat odd that a painter of
Correggio	LOCATION	's genius should have lived and worked in the centre of
Italy	LOCATION	, in the bright - est period of the Renaissance , without creating notice for himself or his art , outside of his local province , until long after his death .

		No con - temporary writer mentioned him ;
Ariosto	PERSON	over - looked him ;
Vasari	PERSON	could get little exact data about him , and had to write the first life of him from hearsay .

		In 1552
Landi	PERSON	said of him that he was '' a painter nobly formed by nature herself rather than by any master , '' and Titian at
Parma	LOCATION	with
Charles V.	PERSON	praised his Cathedral frescoes ; but the man 's life was still unknown .

		Baldinucci added nothing to the
Vasari	PERSON	biography but eulogy , and it was not until the eighteenth century that
Tiraboschi	ORGANIZATION	published documentary evidence about the painter and tried to get at the facts of his life .

		In our century much has been written about him : Pungileoni published new docu - ments ,
Meyer	PERSON	sifted all the old material into new form ,
Morelli	PERSON	straightened out the attribu - tion of his pictures ; and now the director of the
Parma	LOCATION	gallery , Dr.
Corradi Ricci	PERSON	, comes forward with more new documents in a large handsomely-illustrated folio which finally sums up all the recorded life of the painter .

		Students of history will take up Dr.
Ricci	PERSON	's book with eagerness , and they may put it down with some shade of disappointment .

		It doubt - less contains all there is to be known about
Correggio	LOCATION	, but the gist of it was already known .

		And those `` new documents '' to which the writer has had access , and which were to throw new light upon the painter , are neither very important nor very illuminating .

		Dr.
Ricci	PERSON	has written a sound critical and historical ac - count of
Correggio	LOCATION	the best yet published but it revolutionizes no old theories and estab - lishes no new point of view .

		It collects , cor - rects , amends , and in that way doubtless gets at the truth of matters ; for the writer seems to have no conception of
Correggio	LOCATION	that requires a distortion of probability .

		He gives the facts as they are known , and his inferences from them are neither far-fetched nor illogical .

		For this his readers will thank him .

		theory-forming and fact-straining in modern historical writing , that a plain common-sense statement is refreshing .

		The facts of
Correggio	LOCATION	's early life are practic - ally unknown , and this accounts for the '' isolated genius '' theory advanced by various writers .

		The absence of record was to them evidence enough that
Correggio	LOCATION	had neither teachers nor education , and that he sprang up suddenly , like a fountain in the desert , by virtue of in - herent force .

		Neither the tale of his childish ignorance nor that of his great learning has any basis in historic statement .

		He wrote a good hand and painted magnificent pictures : that is positively all we know about his learning .

		It is fair to suppose , however , that he could have done neither without some cultivated intelli - gence .

		He probably received the education of the youths of his time .

		His native town and province were quite as awake to the intelligence and learning of the Renaissance as other Ital - ian towns and provinces ; there was building , carving , and painting there as elsewhere in
Italy	LOCATION	, and the young
Correggio	LOCATION	was probably just as susceptible to the spirit of the age in the
Emilia	LOCATION	as the young
Raphael	PERSON	in TJmbria .

		Correggio was born in
1494	DATE	, of respectable but not rich or noble parents .

		His first mas - ter in painting was doubtless some local artist , like his uncle , or Antonio Bartolotti degli An - ceschi ; but this is not positively known .

		There is no record of his apprenticeship in art , save what shows in his early works .

		These are reminiscent of
Ferrara	PERSON	and
Bologna	LOCATION	, but it can - not be inferred that he was a pupil of Fran - cesco Bianchi-Ferrari , or of
Francia	LOCATION	, or of
Costa	LOCATION	.

		His first important picture , painted when he was twenty , was the '' Madonna of St.
Francis	PERSON	, '' now in the
Dresden	LOCATION	gallery .

		In it one meets with many resemblances to well - known artists .


Mantegna	PERSON	's '' Madonna of
Vic	PERSON	- tory , '' now in the
Louvre	LOCATION	, seems to have been studied by the young painter .

		The pose of the St.
Francis Madonna	PERSON	, the outstretched hand , the black-and-white of the pedestal , the drapery , the foreshortening , the children , all indicate a study of the great Paduan .

		Yet
Mantegna	PERSON	died when
Correggio	LOCATION	was twelve years of age ; he could not have been the latter 's master .

		The young
Correggio	LOCATION	was merely influenced by
Mantegna	PERSON	's work .

		And other influences were evidently upon him at the same time .

		The St.
Francis	PERSON	and the
St. Catherine	LOCATION	in the
Dresden	LOCATION	picture are strong reminders of
Francia	LOCATION	, and , though Dr.
Ricci	PERSON	will not admit it , the picture shows the influence of
Leonardo da Vinci	ORGANIZATION	.

		The 42 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, figure of
John	PERSON	at the right belongs to the Lom - bard school of Leonardo .

		The
Madonna	ORGANIZATION	's smile , the heavy eyelids , the oval face , the con - tours , the light-and-shade , are all borrowed from the same source ; and that foreshortened hand and arm may be seen in the '' Madonna of the Eocks '' in the
Louvre	LOCATION	, as well as in
Mantegna	PERSON	's '' Madonna of Victory . ''

		The Lom - bard tinge is again noticeable in
Correggio	LOCATION	's ''
Bolognini Madonna	PERSON	'' at
Milan	LOCATION	, and in other early works .

		There is no record that
Correg	PERSON	- gio ever was in
Milan	LOCATION	or ever saw
Leonardo	LOCATION	.

		It is highly probable , however , that he had seen and studied some Lombard pictures ; for dur - ing his youth
Parma	LOCATION	was at one time subject to
Milan	LOCATION	, and Milanese painters had been there yes ,
Leonardo	PERSON	himself for a brief visit .

		The study of
Correggio	LOCATION	's masters and early influences ends where it begins , in conjecture .

		Like most young painters , he probably swung here and there until he found his own mind and path .

		He was not a life-long assimilator like
Raphael	PERSON	, but a man of peculiar individ - uality , who always remained Emilian in art , though at first swayed by the great men of the times .

		It was natural that he should admire
Leonardo	PERSON	,
Francia	LOCATION	,
Costa	LOCATION	,
Dosso	PERSON	, and Man - tegna ; and that he followed the last-named in his frescoes for the Convent of S. Paolo at
Parma	LOCATION	, there can be little doubt .

		These fres - coes were done in
1518	DATE	, and
Correggio	LOCATION	was at that time living in
Parma	LOCATION	.

		In
1519	DATE	he re - turned for a year to his native town of Correg - gio , and then came back to
Parma	LOCATION	to do the frescoes of
S. Giovanni Evangelista	PERSON	, at the re - quest of the
Benedictines	LOCATION	.

		The fresco in the dome of this church marks something of a de - parture not only in
Correggio	LOCATION	's life but in Ital - ian art .

		It had been the practice in the com - position of large spaces to cut up the area into squares , triangles , and architectural niches , and to fill these with separate pictures ; but Cor - reggio invented a composition of colossal pro- portions , and threw the whole dome into one picture , showing Christ ascending in the cen - tre of the dome with the apostles and angels below him in a vast circle .

		And here in this fresco the grace of
Correggio	LOCATION	is as nothing to his strength .

		The figures of the apostles are almost like
Michael Angelo	PERSON	's , so powerful are they in line and form , while that charm and sweetness so characteristic of his later altar-pieces are hardly noticeable .

		It was in
1520	DATE	that
Correggio	LOCATION	's marriage took place , and about this time that he painted the `` Marriage of St.
Catharine	PERSON	, '' the `` Ma - donna della Cesta , '' and the '' Descent from the Cross . ''

		In
1523	DATE	he began painting the fres - coes of the
Parma Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	, and these occu - pied him until his death .

		He completed the great fresco in the cupola , and it seemed to receive almost instant recognition from his townspeople .


Vasari	PERSON	was the first outsider to write about it ,
Correggio	LOCATION	's immediate pupils -LRB- and after them the
Carracci	PERSON	-RRB- copied it , Titian praised it , and still
Correggio	LOCATION	was only a local celebrity .

		For all
Titian	ORGANIZATION	's praise ,
Venice	LOCATION	did not know him ; for all
Vasari	PERSON	's words ,
Flor	PERSON	- ence did not know him .

		Barocci , the later Bolognese , the Venetian Tiepolo , helped them - selves to the Parmese frescoes ; but it was not until the eighteenth century that
Correggio	LOCATION	really came to be ranked among the very great masters of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Between 1524 and
1530	DATE	, his large altar - pieces the three large ones at
Dresden	LOCATION	, the '' St.
Jerome	PERSON	, '' and the ''
Madonna della Sco	ORGANIZATION	- della '' at
Parma	LOCATION	were painted .

		His technique at this time was so perfect that he could thor - oughly express his meaning , and all his joyous - ness and delight in physical life were poured out regardless of his religious subjects .

		Grace , charm , movement , rhythm of line and color , light-and-shade , all blended with splendid hand - ling to make great art .

		Correggio was at his height .

		His mythological pieces were done in the last years of his life , with the exception of the '' Antiope '' and the '' Education of Cupid . ''

		Those years were destined to be few .

		His wife died in
1528	DATE	, and after
1530	DATE	there is no trace of him at
Parma	LOCATION	.

		He was evidently at his na - tive town of
Correggio	LOCATION	, a few miles away , where he died
March 5 , 1534	DATE	, aged forty years .

		There is no reason whatever to suppose that he died in poverty and neglect , as was formerly stated .

		In fact this latest biography makes it clear that he died wealthy and respected .

		Where his ashes repose , no one knows .

		They have his alleged body at
Correggio	LOCATION	, and his alleged skull is in the Academy at
Modena	LOCATION	; but both relics are bogus the skull being that of an old woman instead of a young man .

		These outline facts are about all that is known of
Correggio	LOCATION	the man .

		Correggio the painter has been well and thoroughly studied in his works , and though Dr.
Ricci	PERSON	's estimate of his genius and style is very good , it is not a novel estimate .

		Correggio was a painter of striking individuality , but his isolation from the leaders of the Renaissance did not neces - sarily produce his individuality ; he was simple , almost child-like , in his thought , having little
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 43 care for the religious , the classic , or the intel - lectual ; but his alleged lack of education did not necessarily produce his simplicity .

		It was a part of his nature to regard all things for what they looked rather than for what they meant , and to see all things as form and color rather than as symbols of ideas .

		Nothing could have greatly changed that point of view .

		In a way , he was material and sensuous , given to form and color for their own sake , and to human beings for their humanity 's sake .

		The problems of good and evil , of sin , death , and the hereafter , never concerned him .

		To live and be glad in the sunlight , to be simple , frank , natural , and graceful , apparently made up his sum of existence in art .

		He would have no solemnity , no austerity , no great intellectuality .

		Nothing tragic or mournful or pathetic inter - ested him .

		He was in love with physical life , and he told his love with all the sentiment of a lover .

		That he sometimes nearly precipitated sentiment into sentimentality , is true .

		He barely escaped it , and his followers were lost in it .

		It was the imitation of
Correggio	LOCATION	that produced the insipidities of painters like
Carlo Dolci	PERSON	and Sassoferato .

		That
Correggio	LOCATION	, technically , should have been so perfect , living as he did shut off from
Florence	LOCATION	and
Venice	LOCATION	, is more remarkable than his peculiar mental attitude , since craftsman - ship is seldom well-taught if self-taught .

		Yet
Correggio	LOCATION	was somehow extremely well taught .

		His composition was occasionally involved and bewildering , but his drawing was nearly fault - less and his movement excellent .

		His light - and-shade has never been surpassed by any painter , ancient or modern , his color was rich and harmonious , his atmosphere omnipresent and enveloping , his brush-work sure and spirited .

		Indeed , it was the technique of his art , rather than the spirit of it , that first drew the attention of painters to his work , and they made it known to the world .

		Dr.
Ricci	PERSON	has written a book that is the better for coming from a candid mind and a careful student .

		He has told us all there is to tell about
Correggio	LOCATION	, and that , too , in a concise and readable style .

		He might have followed ancient fables and made a more bulky biogra - phy , but it is matter for rejoicing that he has not done so .

		He has adhered to the records , and if he has found few new data about Cor - reggio it is all the more to his credit that he resisted the modern tendency to create hypo - theses and postulate them as proven fact .

		LESSONS IN MUNICIPAL , GOVERNMENT .

		* Mr.
Albert Shaw	PERSON	's valuable book on '' Mu - nicipal Government in
Great Britain	LOCATION	'' pre - pared us for a thorough piece of work in his handling of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	European cities ; and in this expectation we are not disappointed .

		His solid volume of five hundred pages is clear and systematic in treatment and is packed with information .

		Porter 's '' Human Intellect '' was said by a student of philosophy to be a book calculated to give one a headache at thought of the author 's vast reading implied in it .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's work in like manner is obviously the essence of countless reports and other inter - minable documents .

		But it is the essence .

		And it is illumined by a painstaking and loving study of this most modern of subjects in polit - ical science .

		The nine chapters form really a discussion of five related topics .

		The first two chapters nearly half the book are devoted to
Paris	LOCATION	and the French municipal system in general .

		This is taken as the type with which other sys - tems are to be compared .

		Municipal institu - tions in
France	LOCATION	were powerfully affected by the French Revolution , and early reached an ad - vanced development .

		The results have been very interesting and instructive , and it is largely from them that the impulse has been given to the rest of the continent .

		The third and fourth chapters relate to
Belgium	LOCATION	and Hol - land ,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	.

		The next three cover the subject in
Germany	LOCATION	, and the last two in
Austria	LOCATION	and
Hungary	LOCATION	.

		Russian and
Scandi	PERSON	- navian cities are not considered .

		The comprehensive nature of the work will be seen by a mere enumeration of the topics treated in discussing
France	LOCATION	.

		The author speaks of public order , streets , paving , light , transit , water , drainage , sanitation , bridges , schools , libraries , savings banks , and pawn - shops .

		He also analyzes the structure and work - ing of government by which all these services are administered .

		Some of the distinctive facts in the study of
Paris	LOCATION	are worthy of notice .

		One of them , and one that has an important bearing on the great development of that city , is the fact that
Paris	LOCATION	is the national capital .

		Hence the general government has a close re - lation to its civic life , as is the case , indeed , with the capital cities of most nations .

		Our own city of
Washington	LOCATION	is governed directly under the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	, with * MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT IN CONTINENTAL

		44 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	r little or no home-rule .

		The
Paris	LOCATION	police is man - aged by a department of the national adminis - tration .

		But that is also the system in Lon - don .

		And the recollection of the Commune of
1871	DATE	, to say nothing of previous insurrections , will make
France	LOCATION	hesitate long before entrust - ing the preservation of public order in
Paris	LOCATION	to local control .

		In the management of na - tural monopolies , such as gas and street tran - sit , the city follows methods which should make Americans begin thinking .

		No perpetual , or virtually perpetual , franchises are granted .

		All are subject to careful conditions , which include adequate compensation to the public treasury , specified services and prices , constant govern - mental supervision and control , and ultimate reversion of plants to public ownership .

		In many cases these services are owned and ad - ministered directly by the city .

		Public edu - cation , especially in technical lines , is exceed - ingly elaborate .

		There is no newspaper war on '' fads '' in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		It is recognized that taste , knowledge , and manual skill return their cost many fold .

		Accordingly , the most careful instruction is given in all forms of hand-work and in the fine arts .

		Manual training in the use of tools for boys , in needlework and the do - mestic arts for girls , in music and drawing for all , is given special attention .

		At the same time there are distinct trade-schools of many kinds , and high-schools of science , literature , classics , and engineering .

		The German system of local government is not radically different from the French .

		In each the fundamental part is the council .

		This is chosen by the people , and in turn selects the administrative staff .

		Of course
Paris	LOCATION	is an exception , as in that city the civic administra - tion is in the hands of the national government .

		And on the other hand , in
Germany	LOCATION	munici - pal suffrage , unlike the French and American systems , is usually limited to those possessed of some amount of property .

		The three-class system of
Prussia	LOCATION	, for instance , is simply this : Those who pay taxes on large amounts of prop - erty , amounting to one-third the whole , form the first class ; those who pay on the next third form the second class ; the remainder of the tax-payers form the third class .

		Each class elects a third of the city council .

		Obviously , the number of voters in the third class greatly outnumbers those in both the others combined .

		In all the continental cities , Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	finds efficiency , economy , and trained intelligence characterizing municipal administration .

		He finds the ward politics , which is so familiar to us , entirely wanting .

		He finds city administra - tion a profession the German cities calling a mayor from some other city , just as one of our universities would call a president .

		He finds corporate privileges dealt with primarily for the benefit of the municipality , and so most carefully hedged about with restrictions .

		He finds better paving , better sanitation , better care for education , better municipal bookkeep - ing , than in American cities .

		The
Germania of Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	has been thought by some to have been a political tract , intended to show what
Rome	LOCATION	ought to be by painting some other country as possessing the virtues which
Rome	LOCATION	lacked .

		One is almost tempted to consider Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's optimistic picture of European cities as made on a similar plan .

		Nearly everything he depicts is something which we do in exactly the opposite way , and with just the opposite results .

		To be sure , we have great difficulties .

		Our cities grow very rapidly .

		But those of
Germany	LOCATION	, since
1871	DATE	, have grown at the same rate .

		We have universal suffrage .

		But so has
France	LOCATION	.

		We have , it is true , a more heterogeneous population than European cities ; but that is not enough to account for our short - comings .

		And Americans can not do better than to make themselves thoroughly familiar with Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's vivid exposition of how city government ought to be conducted , as seen in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Almost any American city will show more or less plainly how it ought not to be done .

		THE DIAL 45 in a brief prefatory remark , one would soon dis - cover that these stately volumes bear through - out the distinguishing characteristics of the learning and genius of the Downing Professor of Laws at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		And those who know Professor
Maitland	PERSON	's work in other publica - tions will be glad that it is so , for they must all have long since recognized that for a most happy ability to combine the functions of inves - tigation and interpretation , he is without a peer in the field of political science .

		His painstak - ing and patient examination of original mate - rial , his dextrous insight , his calm and undog - matic judgment , may be found in other men ; his logical marshalling of the vast array of facts , in others ; and his lucid and fascinating manner and language , in others again ; but it is a rare combination which brings all these together in one man , and which has made Pro- fessor
Maitland	PERSON	the master in his field .

		All these characteristics of his former work appear again in these his latest volumes , and prompt the reader to the wish , with which he leaves them , that this great scholar may live to give the world the history of later English law .

		The first two hundred pages of the work are devoted to a general sketch of the law for the period prior to
1272	DATE	, under the headings
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon Law	ORGANIZATION	,
Norman Law	PERSON	, the Age of
Glan	PERSON	- vill , the Age of
Bracton	LOCATION	, and Roman and
Canon Law	ORGANIZATION	.

		Eleven hundred pages more discuss the Doctrines of English Law in the
Early Middle Ages	LOCATION	, under the headings , Tenure , Sorts and Conditions of Men , Jurisdiction and the Com - munities of the Land , Ownership and Posses - sion , Contract , Inheritance , Family Law , Crime and Tort , and Procedure .

		This mere list of capital headings will show how admirably the whole subject is conceived of for presentation .

		The chapter on the age of Glanvill is rich in suggestion .

		Nowhere else is so clearly traced the growth of the jury system , from its sources in the Frankish inquisition , through the assizes of the reign of
Henry II	ORGANIZATION	.

		No student who has painfully tried to work out these assizes in the pages of
Stubbs	PERSON	but will be thankful for this simple exposition of the whole matter .

		It is , however , unfortunate that while the text is without flaw in its distinction of the great pro- prietary assize the Grand assize from the four possessory or petty assizes , the index fails one completely .

		There is no entry whatever under the title Proprietary Actions , although reference should certainly be made to I. 126 - 128 , 333 , II .

		62-79 , 136 , 140 .

		The same dis - tinction is worked out in the doctrinal portion of the treatise , under the head of Ownership and Possession , in the discussion of seisin and writs of entry .

		As an illustration of the felici - tous manner in which these archaic subjects are handled it may suffice to cite the following pas - sage in regard to the transition from assize to jury : '' In a little time we have these four and only these four petty assizes .

		Only in these four instances does the writ , which is the first step in the procedure , the original writ , direct the empanelling of an inquest .

		Trial by jury , in the narrowest sense of that term , trial by jury as distinct from trial by an assize , slowly creeps in by another route .

		The principle from which it starts is simply this , that if in any action the litigants by their pleadings come to an issue of fact , they may agree to be bound by the verdict of a jury and will be bound accordingly .

		In course of time the judges will in effect drive litigants into such agreements by saying ` You must accept your opponent 's offer of a jury or you will lose your cause ' ; but in theory the jury only comes in after both parties have consented to accept its verdict .

		An assize , other than a grand assize , is summoned by the original writ : it is summoned at the same time that the .

		defendant is summoned and before his story has been heard ; a jury is not summoned until the litigants in their pleadings have agreed to take the testimony of the country ' about some matter of fact .

		In course of time the jury , which has its roots in the fertile ground of consent , will grow at the expense of the assize , which has sprung from the stony soil of ordinance ; even an assisa when summoned will often be turned into a jury -LRB- yertilur injuratam -RRB- by the consent of the parties ; but still trial by jury , if we use this term in a large sense , and neglect some technical details , is introduced by the ordinances of
Henry II	ORGANIZATION	.

		as part of the usual machinery of civil justice . ''

		In the chapter on Bracton the growth of the system of royal courts is treated in the same suggestive manner , and one sees , as from a bird 's - eye view , the branching off from the
Curia Regis of Exchequer	ORGANIZATION	, Common Pleas ,
King	PERSON	's Bench ,
Chancery	LOCATION	,
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and
Privy Council	ORGANIZATION	.

		Only in the matter of the earliest dis - tinction between Common Pleas and
King 's Bench	ORGANIZATION	is there failure to put it quite as clearly as Mr.
Pike	PERSON	did six months earlier in his `` Con - stitutional History of the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The chapter on the canon law is very brief , but sheds much light .

		The influence of Roman law is shown to be partly by way of repulsion , partly by way of attraction .

		English lawyers were moved , not only to bring their own law abreast of the foreign rival by recourse to its native forces of progress , but also by imitation and incorporation of the stranger .

		Stress is laid upon the accident of a divergence of En - glish and continental law from one another , as the one shook off the Roman influences which the other accepted .

		The book abounds in new view-points for 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, old ideas .

		Thus , the failure to discover the judicial trial by battle in
Saxon England	LOCATION	, as in other Germanic countries , is accounted for by the persistence of extra-judicial fighting .

		Only in those lands where a central power was strong enough to forbid the latter could the judicial duel have place , '' thus combining the physical joy of battle with the intellectual luxury of strictly formal procedure . ''

		Scutage , which many think of as introduced in
1159	DATE	, is prob - ably of much earlier date , and even under Ed - ward I. the tenant-in-chief who failed to attend would be rated , after the campaign ended , in a levy which included , not only the traditional scutage , but a heavy fine .

		It '' seems clear that the tenant-in-chief 's duty of providing an armed force is not commuted into a duty of paying scutage . ''

		So , again , in the chapter on Tenure , it is shown in regard to alienation that '' we must start not from the absolute inaliena - bility of ' the fief , ' nor from the absolute alien - ability of * the fee simple , ' but from ... an indeterminate right of the lord to prevent alien - ations which would seriously impair his inter - ests . ''

		The Gordian knot that has been tan - gled out of free men holding by unfree tenure is thus resolved , while we wonder that it was not done long ago . ''

		The tenure is unfree , not because the tenant ' holds at the will of the lord ' in the sense of being removable at a moment 's notice , but because his services , though in many respects minutely defined by custom , can not be altogether denned without constant reference to the lord 's will ... The man who on going to bed knows that he must spend the morrow in working for his lord , and does not know to what kind of work he may be put , though he may be legally a free man , free to fling up his tenement and go away , is in fact for the time being bound by his tenure to live the same life that is led by the great mass of unfree men ; custom sets many limits to his labours , custom sets many limits to theirs ; the idea of abandoning his home never enters his head ; the lord 's will plays a large part in shaping his life . ''

		One finds in the discussion of
the County	LOCATION	, as is expected , a fuller presentation of the view of the suitors in the county court , first brought forward by Mr.
Maitland	PERSON	in
Volume III	ORGANIZATION	.

		of the '' English Historical Eeview . ''

		This is , in brief , that attendance at court was a burden , and not a privilege , and that it fell , not on free - holders as such , but upon certain units of land , by no means equal in area .

		When this appor - tionment was made he does not pretend to say , although in the review article he guessed at the reign of
Henry I.	PERSON	, but he maintains his main thesis with force .

		So vast an achievement can be only touched in a review .

		The charm of the whole work lies in the absence of any dogmatism , and in the continual presentation of the variety and irregularity of mediaeval life .

		Here are no beautifully symmetrical theories to maintain , but only a careful collocation of an immense body of facts , and an attempt to discern in them the lines of movement toward the
England	LOCATION	of to-day .

		The work has been grandly done , once for all , we surmise , as to the substance of it , although new discoveries may alter details of the picture .

		The whole work is a great credit to the publishing houses that put it forth .

		Our only criticism is on the inadequate index , of which we have already spoken .

		Additional omissions noted are
Droitural Actions	ORGANIZATION	, II. , 379 ; and as citations under topics already en - tered , Barns ' Part , II. , 375 ; Bastard , II. , 373 - 376 ; Possessory Actions , II. , 378 .

		THE STORY OF THE ``
ALABAMA	LOCATION	. ''

		* A surviving officer of the Confederate crui - ser ''
Alabama	LOCATION	, '' Lieutenant
Arthur Sinclair	PERSON	, has prepared , chiefly from his own recollec - tions , an account of the career of that famous vessel , and this is now published in a substan - tial illustrated volume of some three hundred and fifty pages .

		It is essentially a personal narrative , readable though not literate in style , good-tempered though one-sided ; yet , with its many faults , a distinct contribution to the per - manent literature of the Civil War .

		For it is the statement of an eye-witness of and active participant in some of the more stirring and memorable sea episodes of that eventful period .

		It is , of course , hardly to be expected that a strictly impartial statement of the ''
Alabama	LOCATION	's '' character and position , or of her adventures and achievements , should come from one of her own officers .

		Lieutenant Sinclair naturally believed in the vessel and in her mission ; and that is enough for the purposes of his narra - tive .

		It is told with an attractive frankness , and apparently with a desire to write fairly and truthfully as to disputed points .

		These , how - ever , appear but incidentally ; the chief por - tions of the work are given to an account of the vessel 's career and to descriptions of life on board .

		THE DIAL 47 tion in the
summer of 1862	DATE	.

		The Confederate cruisers had already , in their raids in the
North Atlantic	LOCATION	, demonstrated their capacity for mis - chief to the commerce of the
United States	LOCATION	, and it was decided to build larger and more formidable vessels and extend the field of their operation .

		In pursuance of this plan , secret agents of the Confederate government , acting as private purchasers , negotiated with the
Lairds of Liverpool	ORGANIZATION	for the vessel which was first known as the '' 290 '' and soon became the **
Alabama	LOCATION	. ''

		She made her trial trip and es - cape from the Mersey barely in time to avoid detention , the agents of the
United States	LOCATION	hav - ing obtained evidence of her true character and laid the same before the British government .

		Sailing as a simple despatch boat , under the British flag and an English master , she soon reached her rendezvous at the
Azores	LOCATION	, where she was transferred to the command of
Captain Semmes	LOCATION	and his officers , and received her ar - mament and stores .

		The question of a crew became a pressing one , as the men on board had been shipped simply for a trip to the
Azores	LOCATION	, and were ignorant of the true character and purposes of the vessel .

		The test of their read - iness to enlist under the new flag was soon made .

		Our author thus describes the scene : '' The officers are all in full uniform of an attractive shade of gray , with a redundancy of gold lace shock - ingly inappropriate to marine traditions ... The men are mustered aft to ' call ' of boatswain , and
Semmes	LOCATION	, mounting a gun-carriage , reads his commission from the President of the
Confederate States	LOCATION	as commander .

		... The ' stops ' to the halliards at the peak and main - mast head are broken , and the flag and pennant of the young nation float to the breeze ... Our Captain ad - dresses the men in a few curt but eloquent and persua - sive words , making known the character of the vessel and the purpose of the cruise .

		The paymaster has brought amidships his shipping list , and , like the rest of us , awaits the result of our gallant commander 's speech .

		But the suspense is easing .

		One by one the groups dis - solve , and
Jack	PERSON	, hat in hand , presents himself at the capstan and signs the articles , till eighty-five men have been secured . ''

		Thus began the memorable two-years cruise of the ''
Alabama	LOCATION	, '' during which she sailed 75,000 miles and visited almost every quarter of the globe the
West Indies	LOCATION	,
Gulf of Mex	ORGANIZATION	- ico ,
Brazil	LOCATION	, Cape of Good Hope ,
China	LOCATION	Seas ,
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	,
Cape Town	LOCATION	, and the English Channel , shifting rapidly from place to place so as to do the utmost damage and inspire the utmost terror by the unexpectedness of her attacks upon our merchant ships .

		She overhauled and examined several hundred vessels ; those be - longing to neutrals received an apology and went on their way , those having neutral cargo were released on ransom-bond , and those of the
United States	LOCATION	were plundered and burnt .

		There were fifty-seven of the latter , for which
Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	paid , according to the terms of the
Geneva	LOCATION	award ,
$ 6,750,000	MONEY	.

		The author gives some very interesting pic - tures of life on shipboard , which decidedly lacked the monotony of the ordinary humdrum sea-life .

		The seamen all had double pay and a double allowance of daily grog , and seem to have been on the whole a hearty and efficient lot of fellows .

		Some good anecdotes are told of
Semmes	LOCATION	, the commander , who was usually referred to by the under officers as '' Old Bees - wax '' an appellation probably bestowed on account of his tenacity in holding fast to a chase .

		He had , it seems , a sardonic sort of humor , which often showed itself in a rather rough '' guying '' of the captured Yankee skip - pers who had vainly tried to outsail him .

		All the officers were , it appears , exceptionally fine and amiable men as mild-mannered , in fact , '' as ever scuttled ship . ''

		It was the custom , on sighting a Yankee merchantman , to ap - proach under cover of the
United States	LOCATION	or English colors .

		If the prey became suspicious and attempted to escape , a blank shot , or , that failing , a solid one , usually brought her to .

		She was boarded , night or day , in all weathers ; the crew and available stores , and always the chro - nometer and flag , were brought off ; and then the vessel was fired .

		If near land , the captured crews were put ashore .

		Lieutenant Sinclair takes some little credit to the ''
Alabama	LOCATION	'' for materially increasing in this way the population of the
Azores	LOCATION	.

		It often happened , however , that the cruiser found it necessary to play the host to so many involuntary guests that she became uncomfortably crowded , and the opportunity to strike a bargain with some foreign ship to take them off was a welcome one .

		The strange crews slept on the open deck , but were pro- tected by awnings from sun and rain ; the au - thor says they were invariably well treated , their officers being accommodated as far as pos - sible at the officers ' mess of the ''
Alabama	LOCATION	. ''

		Not infrequently the pleasing prospect of double wages and grog twice a day tempted the pris - oners into the ''
Alabama	LOCATION	's '' service .

		As for the chronometers , they accumulated so rapidly that Lieutenant Sinclair soon had to give up his daily task of winding them .

		The justification offered for the ''
Alabama	LOCATION	'' is , of course , that by damaging and threatening Northern commerce she drew off the
United States	LOCATION	war vessels from their work of block - 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	r ading Southern ports , and thus materially aided the prospects of the Confederacy .

		She was often pursued by
United States	LOCATION	cruisers , but usually evaded them , sometimes running into neutral ports and escaping by her superior speed .

		She was a very swift vessel , having both steam and sail power .

		Her armament was considered a powerful one , and our author is evidently proud of her fighting qualities . ''

		She was a fighting ship , '' he says , '' and under no circumstances , within reasonable odds , con - templated avoiding battle . ''

		Yet the truth is that the only real fight in which she engaged was the one in which she was sent to the bottom .

		A similar fate had been visited by her , it is true , upon the
United States	LOCATION	gunboat '' Hatteras '' the year before in the
Gulf of Mexico	LOCATION	; but this affair can hardly be classed as a fight .

		The ''
Alabama	LOCATION	'' lured the '' Hatteras '' to her side in the
night	TIME	, while purporting to be , and announcing herself to be , a British ship ; and suddenly , while the small boats of the '' Hat - teras '' were being lowered to come on board the ''
Alabama	LOCATION	, '' the latter opened her broad - side in the darkness , sinking the gunboat in thirteen minutes .

		The entire career of the ''
Alabama	LOCATION	'' was , in fact , that of a sea-rover rather than a battle-ship , and her commander 's fame as a sea-fighter must rest upon the one engagement in which he was defeated .

		Lieutenant
Sinclair	PERSON	's descriptions of the two affairs referred to are worth quoting , as being the report of an eye-witness .

		The first relates to the sinking of the '' Hatteras . '' ''

		It is dark , the enemy being but indistinctly seen . ' '

		. '

		.

		^ e enem y has now come up .

		She hails us : ' What ship is ^ that ? ' '

		This is her
Britannic Majesty	ORGANIZATION	's steamer Petrel , ' is the reply ... Our crew have lock-strings in hand , keeping the guns trained on her , and awaiting the command to fire .

		The two vessels are so near that con - versation in ordinary tones can be easily heard from one to the other .

		For a time the < Hatteras ' people seem to be consulting .

		Finally they hailed again : ` If you please , I '11 send a boat on board of you , ' to which our executive officer replied , Certainly , we shall be pleased to receive your boat . '

		When the boat is about half-way between the two vessels , the signal is given , and sky and water are lighted up by our broadside ... About six broadsides were fired by us .

		The enemy replied irregu - larly .

		Then she fired a lee gun , and we heard the quick , sharp hail of surrender , accompanied by the request that our boats be sent to her immediately , as she was sinking .

		The whole thing had passed so quickly that it seemed to us like a dream . ''

		In
June , 1864	DATE	, the ``
Alabama	LOCATION	'' put in at the harbor of
Cherbourg	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	.

		The ship was to undergo repairs , and officers and men were to have a leave of absence .


Three days later	DATE	, the
United States	LOCATION	war steamer ''
Kear	PERSON	- sarge , '' under command of Captain
Winslow	PERSON	, entered the harbor .

		Immediately on the arrival of the '' Kearsarge '' Commander Semmes for - warded to
Winslow	LOCATION	, through the
United States Consul	ORGANIZATION	, a challenge to fight the ''
Alabama	LOCATION	'' outside the harbor and beyond the limit of French waters .

		The news was flashed over cables and wires , and on
Sunday	DATE	, the llth ,
Cherbourg	LOCATION	was filled to overflowing with sight - seers , while throughout the world people awaited eagerly the result of the naval duel . ''

		Our ship , as she steams off shore for her antagonist , hull down in the distance and waiting for us , presents a brave appearance .

		The decks and brass-work shine in the bright morning sunlight , from recent holystoning and polishing .

		The crew are all in muster uniform , as though awaiting
Sunday	DATE	inspection .

		They are ordered to lie down at their quarters for rest , while we approach the enemy .

		A beautiful sight the divisions stripped to the waist , and with bare arms and breasts looking the athletes they are .

		The decks have been sanded down , tubs of water placed along the spar-deck , and all is ready for the fray .

		The pipe of the boatswain and mates at length summons all hands aft ; and
Semmes	LOCATION	, mounting a gun-carriage , delivers a stirring address . ''

		The two vessels steamed some eight miles off shore , and , approaching within a mile of each other , the ``
Alabama	LOCATION	'' delivered a broadside , from her starboard batteries .

		The battle was carried on with the contestants circling round a common centre .

		A hundred-pound percus - sion shell was early lodged in the '' Kearsarge '' near her screw , but failed to explode .

		Soon after the vessels closed to point-blank range the ''
Alabama	LOCATION	'' was pierced by a shell at the water line .

		Seeing that his ship was sinking , Semmes struck his flag .

		The officers and crew were picked up by the '' Kearsarge '' and by the English yacht '' Deerhound , '' as the '' Ala - bama '' settled under water . ''

		The '
Alabama	LOCATION	's ' final plunge was a remarkable freak , as witnessed by the writer about one hundred yards off .

		She shot up out of the water bow first , and descended on the same line , carrying away with her plunge two of her masts , and making a whirlpool of considerable size and strength . ''

		Two of the author 's best chapters are given to the incidents of this memorable sea-fight , and will not be overlooked by the reader of this interesting volume .

Cherbourg	LOCATION	fight , shows a striking face , thin , careworn , but bold and crafty , almost sinister , in expression .

		The appendix contains biographical sketches of all the officers , and a general muster-roll of the ship 's crew .


CHARLES H. PALMER	PERSON	.

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 49 BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		More of the Napoleonic revival .

		The literature of the '' Napoleonic revival '' seems destined to show us the Emperor from every conceivable standpoint , ere the movement completes its course .

		His career has been discussed by historians , moral - ists , and military critics ; and his portrait has been drawn , or redrawn , by memoirists of every shade and variety of opinion and bias , from the hero - worshippers down to the malignant
Barras	PERSON	.

		In Con - stant 's account of `` The Private Life of Napoleon '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , we are permitted to see the great man through the eyes of his valet de chambre an op - portunity that will be eagerly grasped by the large class of American readers whose biographical crav - ings and standards are reflected in the newspapers .

		We do not mean to impliedly underrate the uses and merits of Constant 's book , or of the class of books to which it belongs .

		Constant contributes to our knowledge of his master very much as men like
Pepys	PERSON	and
Boswell	PERSON	and the virtuoso of Strawberry Hill contribute to our knowledge of their times ; and the hardiest wiseacre will scarcely impeach the historical services of that immortal trio of gossips .

		Constant 's book is a rich repository of the sort of information that helps us to see the Emperor as his daily associates saw him .

		The author was for four - teen consecutive years , from the opening of the
Marengo	PERSON	campaign to the departure from
Fontaine	PERSON	- bleau , in constant attendance upon his master , '' as inseparable from him as his shadow '' ; and the por - trait he draws is vivid , human , and incontestably accurate .

		The vogue of these Memoirs when they first appeared , in
1830	DATE	, was very great ; and the recent reprint in
France	LOCATION	has been favorably re - ceived .

		The present translation , admirably done by
Elizabeth Gilbert Martin	PERSON	, and published in four shapely volumes by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , is , we believe , the first English version ; and the reader will find it decidedly one of the most entertaining and graphic of Napoleonic works .

		Constant brings us perhaps nearer to
Bonaparte	PERSON	the man than any other memoirist of the period has done .

		A readable introduction is furnished by
M. Imbert de Saint	PERSON	-
Amand	PERSON	, who , as usual , is quite unable to deny him - self a passing allusion to his '' Martyr Queen , '' as he is pleased to style her .


Marie Antoinette	PERSON	's suf - ferings in the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	, her high bearing in adver - sity , and the stoicism with which she met her fate , have blinded romantic and chivalrous minds to the ugly fact that this '' Martyr Queen '' was the centre of the vile court ring whose sins previous to the Revolution , and whose selfish and insensate policy during the Revolution , are as fairly chargeable with the excesses of the Terror as the fanaticism and blind devotion of the Terrorists themselves .

		The world has so long been accustomed to hold up its hands in execration of the political cruelties and drastic expedients of that intrepid band of patriots , that it has well-nigh lost sight of its services of the fact that it saved
France	LOCATION	from anarchy , from a relapse into the fatal gripe of the old order , perhaps from the fate of
Poland	LOCATION	.


Louis XVI	PERSON	.

		was the real martyr of the
Ancien Regime	ORGANIZATION	.

		With mistakes and weaknesses enough , he had no crimes to expiate save those of his predecessors .

		The Anglomania which has so long disquieted patriotic souls in this coun - try has at last fairly given way be - fore the tidal wave of Anglophobia evoked by the '' sturdy Americanism '' of a recent state paper .

		Despite this widespread change in the national sen - timent , however , there seems to be a class of our countrymen who still perversely decline to recog - nize hostility to
England	LOCATION	as a test of patriotism , and who even doubt the wisdom of injecting into our foreign policy an infusion of the temper of
Donny	LOCATION	- brook Fair .

		To such peace-loving souls the little olive-branch wafted to us over the troubled waters in the shape of a book on
America	LOCATION	by that genial Briton , Dean Hole , should prove a welcome and timely token .

		The book is the outcome of the au - thor 's recent lecturing tour in the States in aid of the fund for the restoration of
Rochester Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	; and we are glad to learn that the pecuniary result of the mission was the reverse of disappointing .

		Replying to his English critics who had questioned the propriety of '' sending round the hat '' in Amer - ica for an object that should be regarded as a '' na - tional duty '' at home , the Dean concludes pretty forcibly : '' We had done what we could -LRB- at home -RRB- , and I saw no signs of ' national duty ' coming for - ward to complete our unfinished work .

		... In pre - ferring to spend the surplus of five hundred pounds which I brought home upon the cathedral , rather than in appropriating it to myself , I fail to appre - hend that I have acted ' hardly in consonance with the dignity of the nation and of the national church . ' ''

		The Dean writes in his usual chatty , facetious vein , skimming lightly over a variety of subjects : our clubs , hotels , railways , theatres , churches , horticul - ture , our cities and their various forms and degrees of misgovernment , etc. , treating us and our ways with unfailing good-humor save , indeed , when he comes to consider our newspapers . ''

		All who love
America	LOCATION	, '' he says , '' must protest against these de - gradations ... There is no excuse for the piling up of the agony , for the proclamations in huge and hideous type of the most abominable crimes , for a procession of bad men and bad women on the front of the stage , as though these actors were of all the most important , and as though this ' rogues ' march ' down the hill to perdition were much more inter - esting to the public than the march of intellect , the progress of industry , the advancements of science , the ascents of religion and of truth . ''

		That the Dean 's book will be widely read in this country goes without saying , and it will repay reading if only for the novel pleasure of seeing ourselves fairly , and for the most part gratifyingly , reflected in a mirror held up to us by an English hand .

		50 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, A journal especially if it be a wo - n 's - ^ usually an artificial and often a morbid piece of writing .

		Such is not the character , however , of `` The Jour - nal of Countess Franchise Krasinska , '' just trans - lated from the Polish by
Kasimir Driekonska	ORGANIZATION	, and published by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This Polish Countess the great-grandmother of
Victor Emmanuel	PERSON	is the most artless and unsophisticated of creatures .

		Beginning her journal at sixteen and keeping it up for two years , she discourses of her - self and of things about her with the utmost free - dom from bias .

		She says that she has heard more than once that she is pretty , and adds : '' Some - times , looking in the mirror , I think so myself . ''

		There are four daughters in the household , and all , when they reach the age of sixteen , are taught to add to their daily prayers the request for a '' good husband '' a very natural supplication , they think , since the husband must take the place of the pa - rents , and it is '' very right to ask God that he shall be good . ''

		Not until she is sixteen does this eight - eenth-century young woman ever have any money to spend , or ever receive a letter through the post - office addressed directly to herself .

		The latter event makes the day `` forever memorable , '' and the letter and its envelope are preserved as an '' eternal souvenir . ''

		When she is about eighteen , the Countess meets
Duke Charles	PERSON	, favorite son of the King of
Poland	LOCATION	.

		It is a case of love at first sight on both sides ; and the Countess having no reserves from her journal , we get a very pretty story of the wooing and wedding .

		The last words of the journal are : '' I am sure of my husband 's faith and love . ''

		Alas , that this confidence should have been so shaken by years of inconstancy !

		Continual sorrows took away her strength and her wish to write any more ; after a time , however , the old affection returned , and the lady 's life ended , not in the splendor once dreamed of , but in a happy home .

		Both the
King	ORGANIZATION	and Queen of
Italy	LOCATION	are the great-great-grandchildren of
Frangoise Krasinska	ORGANIZATION	.

		Memories of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
F. Adolphus	PERSON	's '' Memories of
Paris	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , is an exceedingly readable book .

		In the opening chap - ter the writer describes the
Paris	LOCATION	of forty years ago , before the
Haussmann	PERSON	reconstruction ; and he passes thence to a recital of his recollections of the city under the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, and during and immedi - ately after the siege by the Germans .

		The entry of the latter is graphically described , as are the later scenes incident to the rise and
fall	DATE	of the Commune this chapter making one realize how perfectly capable modern
Paris	LOCATION	is of repeating , under due conditions , the revolutionary excesses of a century ago .

		The Communards of
1871	DATE	were , in capacity for evil and the brute instinct of de - structiveness , plainly no whit behind the ferocious rabble by means of which the Jacobin extremists swayed , saved , and dishonored the great Revolu - tion .

		Among other dramatic episodes of the time , the author witnessed the pulling down of the Ven - dome Column one of the many insensate perform - ances of the latter-day Sans Culottes .

		The first attempt had failed , the great structure steadily resisting the strain of rope and windlass .

		But after an hour 's delay , says the author , '' I had become conscious , after a particularly savage jerk on the ropes , that the line between the chimney and the statue was no longer exactly straight .

		Slowly very slowly the statue swerved past the chimney ; .

		slowly the great column bowed towards me never did anyone receive so superb a salutation ; slowly it descended , so slowly that it almost seemed to hesi - tate : in a great haze of spurting dust it fell ... With a wild rush and frantic shouts , the people dashed past the sentries into the Place Vendoine , leaped upon the dislocated fragments , and howled coarse insults at them . ''

		Allowing for a rather pro- nounced tendency to overcolor in his more dramatic passages , we think Mr.
Adolphus	PERSON	-LRB- who was evi - dently at
Paris	LOCATION	as a press correspondent -RRB- may be ac - cepted as a trustworthy narrator .

		An amusing chap - ter is devoted to Mr.
Worth	PERSON	, and another to General
Boulanger	PERSON	.

		A remarkable Whoever buys ''
Macaire	PERSON	, a Melo - performance dramatic Farce '' -LRB-
Stone & Kimball	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of genius .

		because it is by
Robert Louis Steven	PERSON	- son and
William Ernest Henley	PERSON	, will be apt to won - der a little , after he has read it , how those distin - guished men of letters happened to bring it to pass .

		The work may perhaps have had peculiar antece - dents : it may have been written for the stage and been refused ; it may possibly have been written for a wager ; it may have been written for the '' Chap - Book , '' in which we believe it has appeared ; it may even have been written only for fun .

		These mat - ters , however , are not before the general reading public -LRB- curiously enough , too , in these days of the omniscient literary gossip -RRB- , and the average reader will take the book for whatever he finds between its covers .

		Thus regarded , without adventitious props , '' Macaire '' is a remarkable performance of genius .

		In a book written in collaboration , there is usually some curiosity as to what was written by which .

		In this case we note a comparison that came out of one of Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's poems , and a curiously un-English use of the word '' one '' which was kindly lent by Mr.
Attwater	PERSON	of '' Ebb Tide '' fame ; otherwise it is hard to say which author was most responsible .

		If Mr.
Gilbert	PERSON	had never written , it would probably have been different .

		The traditional
Macaire	ORGANIZATION	is certainly a character with opportunities ; it would seem on the face of things that
Stevenson	PERSON	at least might have incarnated him once more , might have given us a new reading of the character , might have put in a form to be remembered that vague con - ception of intellect , effrontery , and un-morality .

		But it was not to be ; and all that can now be done by the reader if he be , as we are , a lover of Ste - venson and an admirer of
Henley	ORGANIZATION	is to drop the book silently into the river of oblivion , trusting that no Astolpho will ever find it necessary to rescue it .

		THE DIAL 51 '' A
Manual of Public International	ORGANIZATION	.

		Law '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
Thomas Al	PERSON	- f red
Walker	PERSON	, Lecturer at
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, is designed as an introductory text-book '' for the use of students commencing to read Pub - lic International Law . ''

		Its simple plan is the pre - sentation of the rules that have been established by the agreement of modern nations , in the form of propositions , tersely stated , eighty-six in number .

		For example , No. 41 is : '' The final touchstone dis - tinguishing belligerent from neutral , is willing sub - jection to belligerent or to neutral control . ''

		No .

		60 is : '' It is the duty of a neutral ruler to refuse the right of passage across his territory to belliger - ent troops . ''

		Each proposition is illustrated by com - mentary , at greater or less length , generally based on and illustrating one or more historical incidents , nearly all of which are of great interest .

		Mr.
Walker	PERSON	's novel plan of teaching this frequently dry subject will no doubt be well received .

		His style is far from dry , and his book is agreeably readable .

		He adheres to the term '' law '' as applied to interna - tional usages , though agreeing that they '' lack alike determinate lawgiver , determinate sanction , and de - terminate enforcing court , '' because each nation adopting those usages treats them as law , and fur - nishes them a sanction by voluntarily observing them .

		Very many of the precedents cited by Mr.
Walker	PERSON	as authorities are drawn from the interna - tional complications in which the
United States	LOCATION	has participated ; and references to American decisions and American commentaries are frequent Story being styled '' the great American judge . ''

		Indeed , the pages of this English commentator bear abund - ant testimony to the great part which our republic has played in modifying former international usages and aiding to establish the progressive modern rules ; for we have taken the lead in many instances in the work of introducing them .

		Miscellaneous Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		writings of have done readers a great a very
Waiter Bagehot	PERSON	.

		grea t service in republishing the miscellaneous writings of
Walter Bagehot	PERSON	.

		Five volumes of their neat and inexpensive '' Silver Li - brary '' are devoted to this purpose , and include all of
Bagehot	PERSON	that the general reader wants , aside from the '' English Constitution '' and '' Physics and Politics , '' both of which works are easily procurable .

		Three volumes of literary studies , one of biograph - ical studies , and one of economic studies , make up the set .

		There is a portrait of the author , and a sympathetic memoir by his friend , Mr.
R. H. Hutton	PERSON	.

		Bagehot was not always right , but he never failed to be interesting .

		In one of his essays , contrasting Shakespeare with
Milton	PERSON	, he says : '' The latter , who was still by temperament , and a schoolmaster by trade , selects a beautiful object , puts it straight out before him and his readers , and accumulates upon it all the learned imagery of a thousand years ;
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	glances at it , and says something of his own . ''

		So the average critic , writing of
Shelley	LOCATION	, or Be ` ranger , or
Scott	LOCATION	, gives us , as a rule , the conven - tional judgments that have been accumulating for years ; whereas
Bagehot	PERSON	always '' says something of his own . ''

		And , even if we dissent from this some - thing , it somehow sets us to thinking along new lines , and we are glad that
Bagehot	PERSON	said it .

		Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	, in editing this series of volumes , has made considerable use of the notes prepared by Mr. For - rest
Morgan	PERSON	for the edition of
Bagehot	PERSON	published a few years ago by the Travellers ' Insurance Com - pany , of
Hartford	LOCATION	.

		That edition contained , also , the longer works , which the present one does not ; but , on the other hand , Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	has added a number of papers that Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	failed to include .

		Mr.
Gilbert M. Tucker	PERSON	's modest vol - on `` Our Common Speech '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a collection of six good but disconnected essays on matters of linguistic interest ; and is not so much a handbook to be consulted at need as a book to be read and enjoyed .

		The book is more in the line of Trench and
R. G. White	PERSON	than of
Sievers	PERSON	and Sweet ; but this does not prevent its being a scholarly , albeit popular , piece of work .

		Mr.
Tucker	PERSON	's interest is in present usage and past meanings .

		Although he gives no indication of great breadth of reading , he is well equipped as far as familiarity with the dic - tionaries is concerned , and he realizes perfectly just what he can do best .

		His two papers on Diction - aries are very convenient : the first gathers a good deal about the old dictionaries which is new , doubt - less , even to many students ; while his remarks on later dictionaries are eminently sensible .

		Start - ing from this lexicographical standpoint , we have the first essay in the book on the necessity of using words exactly and correctly , and the last on Amer - icanisms -LRB- chiefly on the subject of Briticisms -RRB- , with a good bibliography .

		These four essays have some - thing of an enduring interest , and will probably be a stimulant and a guide to just the readers they are intended for .

		More entertaining than important is the essay on '' Degraded Words '' : those familiar with the principle in question will be interested in Mr.
Tucker	PERSON	's collection of examples ; those who have never thought of change of meanings in language will probably fail rightly to estimate its import .

		Lastly , the paper on the English of the Revised Version , although its points are well taken , is rather fragmentary , and , on the whole , ephemeral .

		The book is easily and pleasantly written , and will prob - ably be enjoyed by the student and the more general reader .

		The antique Mr -
Laurence Hutton	PERSON	, well known to of Sports and readers of ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine , is Festivals .

		prepared to affirm that the facts set down in '' Other Times and Other Seasons '' -LRB- Har - per -RRB- have '' never hitherto been gathered together in any single volume . ''

		This may or may not be the case : more important is it that , such as they are , these little collections of information about football , THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, golf , tobacco ,
St. Valentine	ORGANIZATION	's day , and so forth , are just the things to interest and please many people .

		Bits of antiquarian lore , out-of-the-way quotations from good literature , reminiscence of old-time cus - toms , all this , and much else , makes very pleasant reading , and admirably serves the purpose for which the volume was intended .

		Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	is a large reader , even of books which seem stupid to the world at large ; and everyone knows his cleverness at getting something out of almost anything .

		In the present case he has pored over many rare vol - umes and gathered much recondite learning ; he also deals genially with the ''
Badminton Library	ORGANIZATION	, '' as even with the '' Century Dictionary . ''

		His bits of information , both quaint and commonplace , are displayed and arranged with a bland humor quite in keeping with the picture of himself that forms the frontispiece of this pretty little book .

		`` Charm and Courtesy in Letter - 2 * '' '' * ; Writing '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a pleasant and useful volume , pleas - ant to those whose letters are by nature charming and courteous , and useful to those who hitherto have had little thought of either courtesy or charm when they had occasion to communicate with others by the medium of the public post .

		Of the latter class there are almost too many in the present era of printed letter-heads and postal cards , and if one could be certain they were amenable to kind treat - ment it would be wise to do one 's best to help cir - culate
Miss Callaway	LOCATION	's book .

		Whether or not it succeeds in softening the manners of those who might be helped by it , the book is pleasant reading , especially for those who have no pressing need of it .

		It is easily written , with a slight conventionality of sentiment , and a semblance of method -LRB- as wine-jelly is sometimes moulded into the form of a verte - brate -RRB- , but not enough to do any harm .

		The au - thor has extracted many good letters from episto - lary literature , and shows a pleasant appreciation of them , which , it is to be hoped , she will convey to many readers .

		An unusually bright and suggestive sheaf of silhouettes of foreign travel is Mr.
W. D. McCrackan	PERSON	's pretty booklet , '' Little Idyls of the Big World '' -LRB-
Joseph Knight Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
McCrackan	PERSON	is the author of several serious historical books ; and his '' Idyls , '' with not a little of sparkle and lightness of touch , show a vein of thought and sentiment that lifts them considerably above the common run of travel pic - tures .

		A few of the titles are : ''
Pontifex Maxi	PERSON	- mus , '' '' A Riot in
Rome	LOCATION	, '' '' A Woman of
Paris	LOCATION	, '' '' A
Sunday	DATE	in
Vienna	LOCATION	, '' '' The Sultan 's Prayer , '' `` At the Manoeuvres , '' `` Self-Government , '' etc. , the last-named paper giving a graphic account of the meeting of the inhabitants of a Swiss canton to vote on the adoption of a new constitution .

		There are several illustrations , including a photographic plate of
Bastien	PERSON	Le Page 's beautiful portrait of
Jeanne D'Arc	PERSON	.

		Silhouettes of travel .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Professor
H. Graetz	PERSON	's '' History of the Jews , '' issued by the
Jewish Publication Society of America	ORGANIZATION	, has been brought down to the present time by publication of a fifth volume , which covers the period from the
Chmiel	PERSON	- nicki persecution in
Poland	LOCATION	-LRB- 1648 -RRB- to the year
1870	DATE	.

		The work is not , however , completed , for a supplemen - tary volume is promised , to include a memoir of the author , a chronological analysis of Jewish history , an index to the entire work , and a series of maps .

		The Society also offers a prize of one thousand dollars for a story upon a Jewish subject suited to young readers .

		From twenty thousand to thirty thousand words is the stipulated length , and particulars of the competition may be had from Miss
Henrietta Szold	PERSON	, 708 West Lom - bard street ,
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		In his account of '' The Minute Man on the Frontier '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , the Rev.
William G. Puddefoot	PERSON	recounts his experiences as a frontier missionary in the
Western States	LOCATION	.

		The author writes in a '' breezy , '' off-hand way , and his book will doubtless prove entertaining to readers interested in the various phases of Western frontier life .

		It contains a number of interesting photographic plates ; and there is a frontispiece portrait of Mr.
Puddefoot	PERSON	, with his signature in ^ ac simile . ''

		The Warwick Library of English Literature '' -LRB- im - ported by Scribner -RRB- is a new series of books , under the editorship of Professor
C. H. Herford	PERSON	, each of which is to '' deal with the development in English literature of some special literary form , which will be illustrated by a series of representative specimens , slightly anno - tated , and preceded by a critical analytical introduc - tion . ''

		The first volume of this series , with an intro - duction by Mr.
Edmund K. Chambers	PERSON	, is devoted to '' English Pastorals , '' from the sixteenth to the eight - eenth century , and has just been published .

		Volumes to follow will deal with such subjects as '' Literary Crit - icism , '' Letter - Writers , '' `` Tales in Verse , '' `` English Essays , '' and `` English Masques . ''

		The several vol - umes are in the hands of competent scholars , who may be trusted to carry out acceptably the excellent idea of which the series is an embodiment .

		A translation of Dr.
Lassar-Cohn	PERSON	's '' Laboratory Man - ual of Organic Chemistry , '' made by Dr.
Alexander Smith	PERSON	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , provides American students with an extremely useful '' Compendium of the methods ac - tually used in the laboratory in the prosecution of organic work . ''

		What variations from the original have been embodied in this version have received the sanction of the author , and may be considered improvements upon the German text .

		We have also received a treatise on '' The Fatty Compounds '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , by Mr.
R. Lloyd Whiteley	PERSON	; and a little book on `` Practical Proofs of Chemical Laws '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , by Mr.
Vaughan Cornish	PERSON	.

		The Cid '' of

		We heartily congratulate our younger contemporary on its years and honors .

		Colonel
Thomas W. Knox	PERSON	, the well-known traveller and writer of books for boys , died on the 6th of Jan - uary at his rooms in the
New York Lotus Club	LOCATION	, at the age of sixty .


Henrik Jseger	PERSON	, who wrote the best biography of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	thus far published , and was afterwards engaged in the preparation of a history of Norwegian literature , died last month in
Christiana	LOCATION	, at the age of fifty-one .

		The friends of Mr.
Edward J. McPhelim	PERSON	, one of the best literary and dramatic critics ever connected with journalism in
Chicago	LOCATION	, will be grieved to learn of the violent attack of insanity that befell him on the seventh of this month , while a visitor in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Messrs.
Way & Williams	ORGANIZATION	have received from Mr.
Morris	PERSON	's '' Kelmscott Press '' their artistic edition of
Rossetti	PERSON	's `` Hand and Soul . ''

		Only 541 copies were printed for both
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	; and a good portion of them were sold in advance of publication .

		Volume XLV .

		of the '' Dictionary of National Biog - raphy '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- extends from
Pereira	LOCATION	to
Pockrich	LOCATION	.

		It includes noteworthy studies of the two
Pitts	PERSON	, but little else of marked interest .

		The P 's do not seem to have included as many great Englishmen as the other letters of the alphabet .

		The many friends of the late
Eugene Field	ORGANIZATION	will be glad to learn of the new and uniform edition of his com - plete works , announced by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		It will be in ten volumes , each with a photogra - vure frontispiece .

		Besides the regular edition , there will be a special numbered edition of a hundred sets , printed on
Japan	LOCATION	paper .

		It is stated that the '' American Men of Letters '' se - ries is to be extended in the near future to include vol - umes upon
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	and
Hawthorne	PERSON	, the former by Mr.
A. H. Smyth	PERSON	, the latter by Mr.
G. E. Wood	PERSON	- berry .

		Hawthorne , it will be remembered , is the one American included in the '' English Men of Letters '' series , edited by Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	.

		The first annual meeting of the Central Modern Lan - guage Conference was held in the Lecture
Hall	PERSON	of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, on the 30th of
December	DATE	and the two days following .

		As the aims of this Confer - ence have already been set forth in THE DIAL , it will suffice to remind our readers that the increasing interest in modern languages in the West and
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	seemed to make such a Conference desirable .

		The success of this first meeting proved the correctness of that belief .

		There were present teachers and professors from most of the
Western States	LOCATION	, representing the Universities of
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	,
Louisiana	LOCATION	, the
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	,
Washington University	ORGANIZATION	, and many other institutions .

		A programme of twenty - three numbers , including papers on literary and linguis - tic topics in German , English , ' and French was listened to by an audience of from sixty to one hundred and fifty persons , mostly specialists .

		Such discussion as the brief time permitted followed the papers ; and further measures of importance with regard to the future of the organization were taken .

		Propositions for cooperation having been received from the
American Modern Lan	ORGANIZATION	- guage Association , the Conference determined to re - solve itself into the '' Central Division '' of that Asso - ciation .

		This division will maintain its own organization , and meet at least twice in three years , with the expec - tation that the
National Association	ORGANIZATION	will meet the third year at some point in the
Central District	ORGANIZATION	, when there will be a joint session .

		Publication will be controlled by a joint committee from the two societies , and one membership fee gives to members of the Central
Divis	PERSON	- ion the right of membership in
the Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		The latter organization has decided to meet at
Cleveland	LOCATION	next year .

		The officers of the
Central Division	ORGANIZATION	for the ensuing year are : Prof.
W. H. Carruth	PERSON	,
University of Kansas	ORGANIZATION	, President ; Prof.
C. A. Smith	PERSON	,
University of Louisiana	ORGANIZATION	, Prof.
E. T. Owen	PERSON	,
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, and Prof.
G. T. Hench	PERSON	,
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, Vice - Presidents ; Prof.
H. Schmidt	PERSON	-
Wartenberg	PERSON	,
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, Secretary .

		Of the appointment of Mr.
Alfred Austin	PERSON	as succes - sor to the line of English poets laureate , perhaps the best that can be said is that there have been worse ones .

		It is the contrast between him and those whom he im - mediately follows , that makes the appointment so unac - ceptable to the public and inauspicious to him ; for in the brilliancy of the two great names that have given the title its chief glory , it will be hard for Mr.
Austin	PERSON	's light to show more than a doubtful glimmer .

		The new laureate is already sixty years of age .

		He took his degree at
the University of London	ORGANIZATION	in
1853	DATE	, and began life as a barrister , but soon turned to literary and journalistic work .

		For many years he has been one of the best-known '' leader writers '' in
London	LOCATION	, and for ten years edited '' The National Review . ''

		He is a Roman Catholic in religion and a Conservative in poli - tics .

		His first poem , ''
Randolph	PERSON	, '' was published when he was in his nineteenth year .

		He has been a prolific writer , his collected works in verse , published by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, filling six volumes .

		His latest vol - ume , '' In
Veronica	LOCATION	's Garden , '' has appeared since the new year ; and from it , as a favorable example of his lyric power , and as particularly pertinent at the present time , we give an extract which re-echoes in no unworthy strain the old song of peace and good - will : '' But not alone for those who still Within the Mother-Land abide , We deck the porch , we dress the sill , And fling the portals open wide . ''

		But unto all of British blood Whether they cling to
Egbert	PERSON	's
Throne	LOCATION	, Or , far beyond the Western flood , Have reared a
Sceptre	ORGANIZATION	of their own , '' And , half - regretful , yearn to win Their way back home , and fondly claim The rightful share of kith and kin In
Alfred	PERSON	's glory ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's fame , '' We pile the logs , we troll the stave , We waft the tidings wide and far , And speed the wish , on wind and wave , To
Southern Cross	ORGANIZATION	and Northern Star . ''

		Yes !

		Peace on earth ,
Atlantic	LOCATION	strand !

		Peace and good-will .

		Pacific shore !

		Across the waters stretch your hand , And be our brothers more and more I '' Blood of our blood , in every clime !

		Race of our race , by every sea !

		To you we sing the Christmas rhyme , For you we light the Christmas-tree . ''

		8G THE YOUNG PERSON .

		It is a well-known principle of pathology that interference with the normal activity of an or - gan results in functional perversion .

		The atrophy that follows upon the disuse of one organ may have for a concomitant the exces - sive development of others , with some form of degeneration as a consequence ; or the over - stimulation of one may be accompanied by a weakening of all the others , leading in the end to dissolution .

		In either case , whether the dis - turbing physiological factor take the shape of a forced activity here or a suppressed activity there , the result is some development of dis - tinctly morbid type .

		Now the analogies be - tween the organism of the individual and the larger social organism are always instructive , if philosophically dealt with , and the thought of the past thirty or forty years has been par - ticularly fruitful in applications of this method of comparison .

		The whole modern science of sociology , for example , may be described as an expansion of this fundamental idea , and gets its most trustworthy results from the intelligent discussion of these analogies .

		It is our pur - pose just now to apply to one aspect of literary activity the method in question , and to ask if it may not have some instruction for the critic of contemporary literature .

		That reverence is due to the young is one of the most venerable of critical maxims .

		It has been knocking about in literature ever since its embalmment in one of the satires of Ju - venal , and perhaps for longer than that .

		It has very noticeably influenced the literary pro- duction of the present century , but it has not always been wisely apprehended and applied .

		Let us take a moment to see what has been done with this precept in the case of the two greatest literatures of our time the French and the English .

		In both instances there has been at work a sub-conscious instinct that has sought to keep from the contemplation of youth - ful minds certain parts of human life and cer - tain phases of human emotion .

		But the instinct has worked itself out in curiously different ways .

		French books have become sharply dif - ferentiated into books for the
Young Person	ORGANIZATION	and books for the full-grown man or woman .

		English books , on the other hand , have nearly 62 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, all been written , until very lately , with the
Young Person	ORGANIZATION	carefully in view , and , it would often seem , without any consideration for any other class of readers .

		These two theories , car - ried to extremes , have been productive of the most ludicrous results , exemplified , in the one case , by the school - girl editions of ''
Tele	ORGANIZATION	- maque '' which carefully substitute amitie for amour ; in the other , by such an anecdote as has recently gone the rounds of the newspapers , revealing the fact that a popular magazine of wide circulation in this country does not per - mit any mention of wine to be made in its pages .

		And both of these theories , even when kept within bounds , seem to us to have led to an abnormal condition of things in the litera - tures that have respectively practised them .

		We all know
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's hard saying about the French people that they have de - voted themselves to the worship of the great goddess of lubricity .

		This remark was never meant to be taken without qualification , as many passages of
Arnold	LOCATION	's critical work show plainly enough .

		It may be sufficient to instance his judgment of George Sand , pronounced upon hearing of her death . ''

		She was the greatest spirit in our European world from the time that Goethe departed .

		With all her faults and Frenchisms , she was this . ''

		The warmest ad - mirers of that woman of genius will feel that something more than justice is done her by this bit of eulogy , but they will also feel that the man who uttered it must have had strong grounds for what harsh things he at times felt bound to say about modern French literature .

		That literature doubtless gives undue promi - nence to one particular form of passion , and doubtless sins against the proprieties more fre - quently and more conspicuously than any lit - erature ought to do .

		To revert to the patho - logical figure of our introductory paragraph , French literature seems , in its treatment of the relations of the sexes , to have suffered a sort of fatty degeneration , and erotic pates defoie have entered too largely into the daily diet of its con - sumers .

		It seems to us quite clear that one of the causes of this abnormal development must be sought for in an unnatural separation of books for the
Young Person	ORGANIZATION	from books for the Gallic adult .

		Since -LRB- in theory , at least -RRB- the
Young Person	ORGANIZATION	is never supposed to see the books written for his elders , there is no need of writing them virginibus puerisque ^ and all restraint and all reticence are thrown to the winds .

		The English theory , of course , has been as far removed from the French theory as possi - ble .

		Taking for granted that the Young Per - son is quite as likely as anybody else to read a book of any sort , all books -LRB- broadly speak - ing -RRB- have been written with his needs and lim - itations in view , and the result has been an emasculated literature , from which discussion of certain subjects has been excluded by as ef - fective a taboo as was ever practised among the
South Sea Islanders	LOCATION	.

		Newspaper cant and the censorship of the circulating libraries have so narrowed the scope of nineteenth-century English literature that the future student of Victorian manners and morals will have to go outside of literature to get the facts in proper perspective .

		These remarks apply with equal force to the English literature produced upon our own side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		The suppres - sion of natural literary activity thus indi - cated has been correcting itself of late , and in the usual violent way .

		Unless atrophy has gone so far as to prove fatal , nature usually contrives to reassert herself , and throws the whole organism into disorder by so doing .

		The last few years have brought realism and plain - speaking back into English literature , and with a vengeance .

		The dovecotes of hypocrisy have been fluttered by ominous birds of prey , and the sober-minded , who have all along viewed with apprehension the attempt to keep English literature in a strait - jacket , have stood alter - nately amused and aghast at the antics with which it has celebrated its newly-acquired lib - erty .

		The problem is certainly a vexatious one .

		The example of one nation shows us the bad effects of ignoring the Young Person ; the ex - ample of another furnishes an instructive les - son in the consequences of deferring to him overmuch .

		Unbounded license is an unques - tionable evil ; the cramping of ideals , on the other hand , leads to a reaction almost equally evil .

		Whether the one course be pursued or the other , freedom of literary expression will find its stout champions , as it has already found them in both countries , from
Moliere	LOCATION	to Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		We do not want a revival of eigh - teenth century grossness .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	says , in a recent critique , that with Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's latest novel '' we have traced the full circle of pro- priety .

		A hundred and fifty years ago , Field - ing and
Smollett	PERSON	brought up before us pictures , used expressions , described conduct , which ap - peared to their immediate successors a little more crude than general reading warranted .

		In Miss
Burney	PERSON	's hands , and in
Miss Austin	LOCATION	's ,

		63 the morals were still further hedged about .

		Scott was even more daintily reserved .

		We came at last to
Dickens	LOCATION	, where the clamorous passions of mankind , the coarser accidents of life , were absolutely ignored , and the whole question of population seemed reduced to the theory of the gooseberry bush .

		This was the ne plus ultra of decency ;
Thackeray	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	relaxed this intensity of prudishness ; once on the turn , the tide flowed rapidly , and here is Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	ready to say any mortal thing that Fielding said , and a great deal more too . ''

		Fortunately , we are not yet forced to take '' Jude the Obscure '' as typical of our century and literature , although atrocious faults of taste displayed by that book do not stand alone to represent their class .

		And we can not agree with Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	in saying that to censure such outspokenness '' is the duty of the moralist and not the critic . ''

		If criticism has any most im - perative duty , it is precisely the one so airily disclaimed by this self-constituted spokesman for the craft .

		And there is not much pallia - tion for such an offence as Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's in the prefatory danger-signal which describes the book as '' a novel addressed by a man to men and women of full age . ''

		This is the French theory over again , and might be used to cloak all of the French excesses .

		It seems to us that the real solution of the problem presented by the
Young Person	ORGANIZATION	must take the form of a compromise , and that a compromise is possible that shall mean neither a loss of virility in lit - erature nor the exposure of the immature to corrupting influences .

		We need , first of all , to clear our minds of cant on the subject of the supposed ignorance of the
Young Person	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Frenchman knows perfectly well that his theory does not work , and that boys and girls read the books they are not supposed to read .

		The En - glishman knows equally well that his theory works no better , and that boys and girls who do not get a knowledge of life from literature get it in other and usually worse ways .

		Why should we not admit right away that our edu - cation is not as frank as it ought to be ?

		With this admission we might couple the plea , on the one hand , for less prudishness than we have been accustomed to put into books likely to fall into the hands of the
Young Person	ORGANIZATION	; while sternly insisting , on the other hand , that all literature should be clean , that grossness is a thing unpardonable in itself , and not merely for its degrading influence upon a certain pos - sible class of readers .

		Some such middle ground as this should be found safe for all the interests concerned ; it should result in a literature both strengthened and purified , not losing from view the needs of the
Young Person	ORGANIZATION	, but rather ac - cording them a more rational consideration than they have had hitherto .

		CLASSIC SLANG .

		It is a matter of current observation and remark that the slang of to-day is orthodox literature to-mor - row .

		But it is not so commonplace that modern slang can often '' point with pride '' to most aristocratic line - age away back in classic Greek and Latin .

		Literature repeats itself , as well as history , and everything else ; for they all come from the human soul , itself an eternal unity of variety .

		This bond between past and present may be illustrated by a few examples out of many .

		We moderns are not the first to find things which '' make us tired , '' for
Virgil	PERSON	, speaking doubtless from a rich personal experience , complains that '' Juno makes earth and Heaven tired . ''

		His description of a city riot , in which he says '' rocks fly , '' is twin brother to the reportorial railway strike , wherein coupling-pins always `` fly . ''

		Cicero might have been a Roman from
Cork	ORGANIZATION	, when he speaks of '' a power of silver and gold '' ; and he is forever '' t ` rowing Cataline out '' -LRB- of the city -RRB- .

		Caesar says that
Ariovistus	PERSON	`` had taken to himself such airs that he seemed unendurable . ''

		Our word '' business , '' which is so convenient to piece out conversational poverty with more or less legitimate uses , is a prime favorite with both
Cicero	PERSON	and
Caesar	PERSON	.

		The following phrases are quite Chicagoese : '' An op - portune time for finishing the business '' -LRB- of destroying the enemy 's fleet -RRB- ; '' What business had Caesar in
Gaul	LOCATION	? '' ''

		They undertook the business '' -LRB- of arresting the Allobroges -RRB- , etc. .

		Xenophon gives us in Greek the same phrase as
Cicero	LOCATION	in
Latin	LOCATION	, for he says , '' Tissaphernes threw out others '' -LRB- of the refugees from the city -RRB- .

		He seems like an elder brother when he declares , '' I made a find , '' and '' They were like to wonder . ''

Feb. 1	DATE	, JUSTICE TO THE MODERN JEW .

		* Mrs.
Frances Hellman	PERSON	's English translation of M. Leroy-Beaulieu 's ''
Israel	LOCATION	among the Na - tions '' will doubtless be widely read in this country .

		The fame of the original work as the best , because the fairest , most searching , and most critical , study of what is vaguely styled and more vaguely known as the Jewish Ques - tion has preceded and paved the way for Mrs.
Hellman	PERSON	's admirable version ; and there are just now obvious reasons why Americans espe - cially should wish to understand this Jewish Question , and to qualify themselves to judge of its possible bearing upon their own present and future .

		The main conclusion , probably , that the American reader will draw from
M. Leroy-Beaulieu	PERSON	's book is the comfortable one that there is for us no Jewish Question the conditions which gave rise to that question and tend to perpetuate and inflame it in the Old World not obtaining here .

		Antisernitism and Jewish particularism are the outwardly dissim - ilar but really cognate blossoms of a tree for - eign to our soil , and unable , when transplanted , to flourish in our social and political atmos - phere .

		The Jew 's troubles in the Old World and the chronic '' Question '' concerning him have been and are rooted in and bound up with his peculiar status a status primarily thrust upon him from without , and secondarily of his own creation .

		In every land in which for the past fifteen centuries the son of
Jacob	PERSON	has pitched his tent he has been perforce the man without a country , the intruder , a stranger within the gates of the
Gentile	LOCATION	, in fine , the man of a race and a religion distinct from the dominant ones about him .

		Always isolated , usually threatened , and often persecuted , he has naturally tended -LRB- to quote an expression of
Tolstoi	LOCATION	-RRB- to curl back upon himself and retreat into the shell of his own exclusiveness .

		Given these conditions , and the Jewish Question arises of itself .

		In
America	LOCATION	the Jew is placed in a new environment .

		For the first time since he began his wanderings , he finds himself at home actually in a country he can call his own unchallenged , where his claim to citizenship is flawless , and where his blood and faith are nat - urally matters of relative indifference to a *

		mixed and cosmopolitan community .

		Our na - tional bond is neither racial nor religious , but the broader and humaner one of national con - sciousness ; and we have hitherto freely ex - tended the right of citizenship , with all that the term implies , to whomsoever comes to us be he Jew or
Gentile	LOCATION	, bond or free and says , as
Ruth	PERSON	said to
Naomi	PERSON	, '' Thy people shall be my people . ''

		This the Jew has done ; and that he now comes to us largely a suppliant , with his hereditary gabardine rent and tattered by bit - ter blasts of race hatred and persecution , should not constitute his least claim upon our hospi - tality ; nor should the fact that he alone , of all our transplanted fellow - citizens , may in general be said to have left no fatherland behind him , and brought no ancestral patriotism with him , constitute the least warrant of his whole-hearted acceptance of his adopted country .

		A soil that has never been darkened by the walls of the Ghetto may well be doubly dear to him .

		For the oppressed Jew of
Europe	LOCATION	, the promised land lies no longer Jordanwards ; he turns his wistful gaze to the far West , to the shores of the new Canaan beyond the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, at whose portals stands Liberty with flaming torch light - ing the way for the oppressed of all nations .

		And this new promised land once reached , why should he need much time to become attached to it ? ''

		It would not surprise me , '' says
M. Leroy-Beaulieu	PERSON	, '' if , on disembarking , those Jews were to feel like pressing their lips to the ground , as did their forefathers on reaching the Holy Land . ''

		If there is ever to be a Jewish Question in this country , it must be primarily the result of our own apostasy of our failure to maintain those sublime humanitarian prin - ciples which it is
France	LOCATION	's greatest glory to have first proclaimed to the world , and which the founders of the
American Republic	ORGANIZATION	, touched with the optimism of their era and nerved by its faith in the intrinsic virtue and high terres - trial destinies of mankind/stamped freely upon their institutions and confidently left to the guardianship of posterity .

France	LOCATION	, the
France	LOCATION	of Turgot and of
Condorcet	LOCATION	, first bade Ahasuerus `` Rest '' ; despotic
Russia	LOCATION	, at the close of our nineteenth century , bids him take up his wanderer 's staff anew .

		Pelted by the pitiless storm of a new persecution , he bends his steps westward ; and his almost pathetic readiness , when he reaches our shores , to be of us , to be like us , to master our ways and our tongue , and to respond like other men to the fusing influence of universal liberty and toler - ance , indicate that an American Jewish Ques -
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 65 tion , should it ever arise , will
spring	DATE	from a seed of our planting , not of his .

		Turning now to our author , let us glance at a few of his leading facts and positions ; and first as to the numbers and distribution of this Sem - itic remnant which is pointed out as the potent source of the evils that afflict modern society .

		There are at this period of
Israel	LOCATION	's greatest dispersal seven or eight millions of Jews scat - tered among five or six hundred millions of Christians and Moslems the
Kussian Empire	ORGANIZATION	holding about one-half of all the Jews in the world .

		Surely the Son of
Jacob	LOCATION	, looking about him and noting the vast complexity of social phenomena ascribed to him as the efficient cause , may well say , with ^
Esop	ORGANIZATION	's fly , '' What a dust do I raise ! ''


Israel	LOCATION	's centre of gravity is in ancient
Poland	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	,
Roumania	LOCATION	, and Austro-Hungary , this district forming a res - ervoir of Jews whose overflow , always tend - ing westward , is now vastly increased , and threatens to sweep old European and the young American states with a long tidal wave of Jew - ish immigration .

		As the numbers and import - ance of the Jews in western
Europe	LOCATION	increase , so does the prejudice against them increase .

		Hence has arisen Antisemitism a threefold conflict of creed , race , and class .

		Rooted in an - tiquity , and partly an atavistic trait ,
Antisemit	PERSON	- ism flourishes afresh under favoring conditions ; and , being cradled in the new empire of the Hohenzollern , it naturally '' plays the pedant , '' proses learnedly from the Kathed & r ^ and cov - ers its barbarous gospel of race-hatred with a modern scientific veneer .

		While religious an - tipathy of the vulgar sort counts for little in the movement , one of the main charges brought against the Jew is that he is the born enemy of '' Christian civilization '' ; that he is at work through a thousand occult agencies , noiselessly sapping the foundations of the City of God , and undermining the fair fabric of Christian traditions and institutions .

		Antisemitism is thus the counterpart of Anticlericalism ; it is another
Kulturkampf	LOCATION	, this time instituted by the Clericals as a tactical manoauvre , in the heart of the struggle between the new Empire and the Romish hierarchy , against the foes of '' Christian civilization . ''

		Sprouting from this germ , the tree of Antisemitism has spread and flourished until its baleful shadow has dark - ened western
Europe	LOCATION	the German-Ultramon - tane war-cry , '' Make front against the
New Jerusalem	LOCATION	, '' being echoed widely in
Protestant Germany	LOCATION	, in
Catholic France	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	, and in orthodox
Russia	LOCATION	, until Catholic or Sectarian Slav ,
Latin	LOCATION	,
Teuton	LOCATION	, and
Magyar	ORGANIZATION	would seem to have united in this singular movement to put an end to what Antisemitism terms the '' judaising '' of European states and societies .

		Essentially , these vague and grandiose charges against the Jew amount to the sufficiently ab - surd one that he is the author as well as the main disseminator of what is termed the spirit of the age , of the modern practice of summoning belief to the bar of reason .

		That this charge is out of all accord with the facts of history let us add , with the real stature of the modern Jew is plain .

		That the rationalistic temper budded in the stifling atmosphere of the Ghetto , and that the spirit of free inquiry was cradled behind the bars of the Judengasse , is a propo - sition , one would think , to stagger even the trained credulity of a Pastor
Stoecker	PERSON	; and , as our author observes , it would surely have sur - prised
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	and Diderot to be told that they were only the unconscious agents of the Jews .

		Small wonder is it that the liberal Israelite , quick to discern his advantage , has ostenta - tiously accepted the reproach hurled at him from Lutheran pulpits and Russian tribunals , and decked his brow with it as with a garland .

		But let
Israel	LOCATION	be content with its matchless glory of having given to the world its religion , its Decalogue , its sublime ideal of human duty .

		One sees , indeed , many scientific Jews , but no - where a Jewish science ; and inquiry shows us that , in modern times , the Jew has been mainly receptive , not originative ; the broker of ideas , not the author of them . ''

		Look at them , '' said a friend of the author , '' see how quickly and with what squirrel-like agility they climb the first rungs of any ladder ; sometimes they suc - ceed in scaling the top , but they never add to it a single round . ''

		Without wholly accepting this disparaging estimate , may we not agree with
M. Leroy Beaulieu	PERSON	that , in the main , the genius of the modern Jew lies in a certain unique facility of adaptation , a talent for grasping the varying gifts , of different races and blending them into an eclectic whole which is unlike each yet contains a tincture of all ?

		That there is in high and exceptional cases a new and unique flavor superadded , the lover of
Heine	LOCATION	, of Men - delssohn , or of
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	may well claim .

		But the origin of the modern world lay neither in the Jew nor in the Jewish spirit . ''

		It was due to the spirit of analysis , of research , to the sci - entific spirit , whose first teachings came to us , not from
Judea	LOCATION	, but from
Greece	LOCATION	; and though , at a later day , the Jews or the Arabs brought them back to us , they have none the less ema -
66	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, nated from the Greeks . ''

		In all the world there is no man more stubbornly conservative than the talmudic Jew ; and the new light that shot in a thousand prismatic rays of verse and prose from the '' burning and far-shining spirit of Voltaire '' penetrated with the utmost difficulty the chinks in the walls of Ghetto and
Juden	PERSON	- gasse .

		Well may Jewish rabbis , viewing with sorrow the sceptical tendencies of their dis - persed flock , hurl back at the Gentile the charge of having secularized or '' paganized '' modern society , and say to him , as
Nathan	PERSON	said unto
David	PERSON	, '' Thou art the man . ''

		The reply which the Russian novelist has placed upon the lips of the accused Lithuanian Jew may well be sadly repeated by many of the latter 's co-relig - ion iste , in the West as well as in the East : '' Our children have no longer our beliefs ; they do not say our prayers , nor have they your beliefs ; no more do they say your prayers ; they do not pray at all , and they believe in nothing . ''

		Neither the distinctive merits , then , of mod - ern civilization , nor the defects of those merits , are of Jewish origin .

		Let us not reverse the roles of Jew and
Gentile	PERSON	. ''

		Despite the statements of certain Semites , or cer - tain Antisemites both tending equally to exaggerate the importance of
Israel	LOCATION	it is not the Jew who has emancipated Christian thought , but Christian thought , or , if you prefer , Aryan thought , that has emancipated the Jew ... Scepticism , nihilism , materialism , so far from being Jewish products , are , in the Jews infected by them , but a sign and a consequence of the closer union of races ; they bear witness to the contact of the Jew with ourselves . ''

		Then there is the
National Grievance	ORGANIZATION	.

		Not content with de - christianizing his neighbors , the Jew , it seems , threatens to de-nationalize them ; and this , in our century , when national feeling counts for so much , is an unpardonable sin .

		In an evil hour for the sons of
Abraham	LOCATION	, there was discerned , at the bottom of the Jew , the Semite the natural antagonist of the Aryan , the blood-foe of that precious deutsche Kultur complacently held by the naive philoso - phy of history of an ultra-Teutonic school to be the nurse and mother of modern civilization .

		This profound discovery made , and a weak point in the lines of the liberal attack present - ing itself , the signal for a new Judenhetze was sounded summoning the defenders of German - enthum to make front against Judenthum .

		The slogan sounded in
Germany	LOCATION	soon found , as we have seen , an echo beyond her borders ; and once more the ominous cry '' Hep !

		Hep I '' or its modern euphemism , warned the startled Jew of his old fatal status as a stranger the root of every charge brought against him since the Babylonian captivity .

		Antisemitism decks itself and hides its vulgar origin with the specious theory of a pinchbeck social philosophy ; and at the heart of this philosophy one detects the old tribal notion that identifies nationality with race .

		It is urged that '' since every nation is founded on unity of race , and since the Jews are a separate race , they can never belong to any nation . ''

		Confronted at this primitive stage of his argument with the fact that not a single modern nation , not even
Germany	LOCATION	, can justly lay claim to unmixed blood , to a national basis of race-unity , the Antisemitic philoso - pher widens his concept , and urges that , after all , these superficially diverse ethnic elements constituting modern nations are really homo - geneous elements , rays diverging from a com - mon centre , branches of the noble Aryan oak .

		But is it true that none but Aryan elements have entered into the composition of modern nations ?

		What of the underlying strata of
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean pre-historic races of Cro-Magnon or of Neanderthal which must have been sim - ply covered over , and not obliterated , by Indo - European deposits ? ''

		Nothing warrants the belief that we are all Aryans ; the Frenchman or the German who prides himself on his pure Indo-Germanic blood , may have descended from the cave-dwellers .

		In fact the existence of an * Aryan race ' at the present time is perhaps as purely imaginary as the existence of a ' Latin race . ' ''

		Again , what becomes of this notion of a sharp and antagonistic confrontation of Jew and Aryan upon which Antisemitic theory depends , when we consider that , while it is certain that alien blood , pagan or Christian , flows freely in Jewish veins , it is also certain that Christian nations have , on their side , a marked strain of Jewish blood ?

		Shem and Japhet , supposed to be incapable of blending , have already blended .

		There is probably not a single modern nation that is quite free from admixture with the
Semite	LOCATION	; while some of them , like
Spain	LOCATION	and
Portugal	LOCATION	, have absorbed so much Jewish blood that they have become '' completely impregnated with it . ''


Germany	LOCATION	is not exempt ; and an ironical destiny may have so ordered it that the Teutonic current in the veins of indignant Pastor
Stoecker	PERSON	himself is faintly perfumed with thefastor Judaicus . ''


Israel	LOCATION	has been like an island whose borders , swept by the waves , have crumbled piecemeal into the ocean , until more than once it seemed threatened with com - plete submersion .

		Of all the descendants of
Jacob	PERSON	, only a small part , perhaps even only an infinitesimal minor - ity , has remained faithful to the religion of its fathers .

		The great majority of the twelve tribes have accepted
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 67 the yoke of the Cross ; they have long since become merged in us ; the waters of baptism have swept them out among the nations of the world .

		We Christians can never be sure that we do not number among our ancestors some unrecognized Northern or Southern Jew . ''

		We can not here follow further
M. Leroy	PERSON	-
Beaulieu	PERSON	's elaborate argument , nor even glance at his interesting chapters on the Physiology , the Psychology , and the Genius of the modern Jew .

		His views are by no means always flat - tering to the latter ; but they are always broad , well-considered , and based on the freest and fullest scrutiny of facts .

		One point upon which he constantly insists , and which may be per - haps taken as the key-note of his eloquent plea for a humaner view of the Jewish Question , is the truth that the Jew of to-day that is , the Jew of the marked type generally objected to is what he is largely because of the life we have so long forced him to lead .

		The virtues which we accuse him of lacking could scarcely have blossomed under the rod of persecution .

		If he is the child of the
Talmud	LOCATION	, he is none the less the child of the
Ghetto	LOCATION	; and it is to the latter parent that most of his objectionable traits may be traced .

		Antisemitism has little chance even of a hearing in this country , as recent events have proved we trust to the sat - isfaction of
Herren Stoecker	PERSON	and Ahlwardt .

		To us , we believe it is no idle boast to say , the most '' philosophical '' Antisemite is simply a Jew-baiter with a doctrine ; and the only part of that doctrine with which we need concern ourselves is refuted by our daily experience of our Hebrew fellow-citizens .

		As all priestly power had its visible head and source in the city of the
Seven Hills	LOCATION	, as all secular authority was ultimately held of the Holy Ro - man Empire , so could all the streams of knowledge by which the
Universal Church	ORGANIZATION	was watered and fertilized be ultimately traced as to their fountain-head to the great universities , especially to the
University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	.

		The history of an institution which held such a place in the imagination of a mediaeval historian , is no mere sub - ject of antiquarian curiosity ; its origin , its development , its decay , or rather the transition to its modern form , are worthy of the same serious investigation which has been abundantly bestowed upon the
Papacy	LOCATION	and the Empire . ''

		In his preface the author briefly refers to the origin and growth of his book , describes his ideal or plan , and indicates the sources of his materials and the extent of his obligations to others .

		Like many other works of English scholarship , this book originated in a univer - sity prize essay , which was won in
1883	DATE	.

		At first the author intended nothing more than such a revision and expansion of the essay as would justify its publication in book-form ; but he continued his labors until twelve years were gone , and his essay had been expanded into
1400	DATE	octavo pages .

		His plan is '' to describe with tolerable fulness the three great archetypal universities
Bologna	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and to give short notices of the foundation , consti - tution , and history of the others arranged in national groups . ''

		Even of the three great uni - versities , he does not profess to have written a history .

		Referring to the others , he says : '' The condensed treatment of seventy-three univer - sities in 316 pages has of course rendered that part of my work of little interest , except for purposes of refer - ence ; but to have ignored all but the most famous
Stu	PERSON	- dio , would have left the reader with a very inadequate impression of the extent and variety of the mediseval university system , and of the importance of the part which it played in the making of civilized
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Moreover , it would have been impossible to write satis - factorily the history of even one university without an acquaintance with the documents of all the rest .

		The great defect of university histories has been the non - application of the comparative method .

		The general reader will perhaps find most that will interest him in Vol .

		Volume I. opens with a discussion of the question , What is a University ?

		This is fol - lowed by a longer chapter on
Abelard	PERSON	and the Renaissance of the
Twelfth Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then come a few pages devoted to
Salerno	LOCATION	, which in university history is little more than a great name .

		An extended chapter of 180 pages is devoted to
Bologna	LOCATION	, and
Paris	LOCATION	fills out the vol - ume .

		The universities of
Italy	LOCATION	,

Bohemia	LOCATION	, and the Low Countries , of
Poland	LOCATION	,
Hungary	LOCATION	,
Denmark	LOCATION	, and
Sweden	LOCATION	, and of
Scotland	LOCATION	, comprise the 316 pages described by the author in the quotation given above .

		Volume II. , part ii. , is devoted principally to
Oxford	LOCATION	, but it contains also an account of Cam - bridge , and two other chapters of a general character .

		For Dr.
Rashdall	PERSON	's sources , we can only refer the reader to his preface and numer - ous bibliographies and notes , adding merely the remark that he must have spent his twelve years industriously to have explored so much material .

		The reader who is not already familiar with the main facts stated in the first chapter will find it necessary to make them at once his sure possession .

		The notion that a university means a school in which all branches of knowledge are taught '' has long since disappeared from the pages of professed historians . '' ''

		A glance into any collection of mediaeval documents re - veals the fact that the word ' university ' means merely a number , a plurality , an aggregate of persons . ''

		In the earliest period in which the word is used in a special sense , '' the phrase is always ' university of scholars , ' ' university of masters and scholars , ' ' university of study , ' or the like . '' ''

		It is particularly important to notice that the term was generally in the middle ages used distinctly of the scholastic body , whether of teachers or scholars , not of the place in which such a body was established , or even of its collective schools .

		The word used to denote the academic institution in the abstract the schools or the towns which held them was Studium , rather than Uni - versitas ... The term which most nearly corresponds to the vague and indefinite English notion of a univer - sity , so distinguished from a mere school , seminary , or private educational establishment , is not Universitat but Studium Generate ; and
Studium Generate	ORGANIZATION	means , not a place where all subjects are studied , but a place where students from all parts are received .

		Studium Generate became common at the beginning of the
13th century	DATE	, when it was used as vaguely and indefinitely as the English term Public School or the German
Hoch	PERSON	-
Schule	PERSON	. ''

		The name now implied three characteristics '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- That the school attracted , or at least invited , stu - dents from all parts , not merely those of a particular country or district ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- That it was a place of higher education , that is to say , that one at least of the higher faculties , theology , law , medicine , was taught there ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- That such subjects were taught by a considerable number , at least by a plurality , of masters . ''

		How the meaning of the name fluctuated , how , progressively , it became more definite , and how , finally , it disappeared , giving place to univer - sity , it would take too much space to tell even in the fewest words .

		Most persons who read books of this class , if not indeed all of them , will find themselves constantly falling upon surprises .

		Dr. Rash - dall himself has found a closer acquaintance with the facts resulting in '' a certain disillu - sionment . '' ''

		We have often had occasion to notice , '' he remarks in his epilogue , `` that features of the mediaeval university system which have constantly been appealed to as binding precedents were really less universal and less invariable than has been supposed . ''

		The following extract shows what he means , and also teaches us to beware of pushing gen - eralizations too far : ''
The University	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	, after being empowered by
Royal Charter	ORGANIZATION	to do all things that could be done by any
University	ORGANIZATION	, was legally advised that it could not grant degrees to women without a fresh charter , because no university had ever granted such degrees ; we have seen that there were women-doctors at
Salerno	LOCATION	.

		We have been told that the mediaeval university gave a religious education ; we have seen that to the majority of students it gave none .

		We have been told that a university must embrace all faculties ; we have seen that many very famous mediaeval universities did nothing of the kind .

		That it eventually came to be considered necessary , or at least usual , that they should do so , is due to the event - ual predominance of the Parisian type of university organization , minus the very peculiar and exceptional absence of a Faculty of Civil Law .

		We have been told that the collegiate system is peculiar to
England	LOCATION	; we have seen that Colleges were found in nearly all univer - sities , and that over a great part of
Europe	LOCATION	university teaching was more or less superseded by college teach - ing before the close of the mediaeval period .

		We have been told that the great business of a university was considered to be liberal as distinct from professional education ; we have seen that many universities were almost exclusively occupied with professional education .

		We have been assured , on the other hand , that the course in arts was looked upon as a mere preparatory discipline for the higher faculties ; we have seen that in the universities of
Northern Europe	LOCATION	a majority of students never entered a higher faculty at all . ''

		Different readers will find different parts of the book most instructive and interesting .

		We have taken a special interest in the chapters and sections of a more general character . ''

Rashdall	PERSON	attacks the traditions that assign thirty thou - sand students to
Oxford	LOCATION	, and corresponding numbers to
Paris	LOCATION	and
Bologna	LOCATION	, when those uni - versities were at the summit of their greatness .

		Valuable data for such a purpose are far from abundant ; inference must largely take the place of registration lists ; but we can see no good reason to dispute the general soundness of his conclusions , which will be presented in his own words . ''

		-LRB- 1 -RRB- It is improbable that the numbers of either Bologna or
Paris	LOCATION	can ever have exceeded some 6000 or 7000 .

		At
Paris	LOCATION	at least it is pretty certain that this limit was approached during its period of highest repute say , the beginning of the fourteenth century .

		About the middle of the fifteenth century , however , the number at that university was probably nearer 3000 .

		In

Bologna	LOCATION	so serious , that neither
Bologna	ORGANIZATION	nor any one of its rivals can ever have approached the numbers of

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- The maximum number at

1500	DATE	and
3000	DATE	.

		By about
1438	DATE	the num - bers had fallen to under 1000 . ''

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- The numbers of

Vienna	LOCATION	and Leipsic may at one time have had

		The numbers of the other German universities during the fifteenth century varied between 100 and

France	LOCATION	and elsewhere , wherever ascer - tainable , is always numbered by hundreds and not by thousands ; at

		The most serious defect of Dr.
Eashdall	PERSON	's book is the omission at the close of a summary view of the whole field .

		No doubt such a chap - ter would have been a peculiarly difficult one to write .

		Still , it would have given a unity and completeness to the work that it now lacks , End should have been written .

		THE HISTORICAL , DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICITY .

		* The demand for popular scientific literature having to do with electricity and magnetism has of late been prodigious .

		A great deal has been written to gratify a love for the mysterious and sensational , or , on the other hand , to supply a little information that might immediately be turned to practical purposes .

		Much of this popular writing has been indifferent and of but slight value to general readers .

		The technical literature of the subject has been too severely scientific and mathematical either to interest or profit any except specialists .

		Electricity in its manifold applications is the dominant scientific feature of the age ; and yet to the large body of thoughtful readers the subject is one shrouded with an air of mystery , because so little under - stood .

		The great magazines and periodicals , with rare exceptions , seem to avoid the subject , not , probably , from lack of interest , but rather on account of inseparable technicalities .

		This difficulty is oftener fancied than real , for there is much connected with electricity which is sug - gestive and filled with absorbing interest .

		The subject only requires humanizing to arouse a more intelligent interest in its historical devel - opment as a preparation for understanding its existing applications .

		This , Dr.
Park Benja	PERSON	- min 's book on '' The Intellectual Rise in
Elec	ORGANIZATION	- tricity '' is eminently fitted to do .

		It is a book that will prove a most welcome addition to the library of every thoughtful reader .

		This book marks the beginning of a new epoch in the literature of electricity , and shows that the science has far transcended the sup - posed period of its infancy ; for to the extent the literature of any science becomes philosoph - ical , it approaches the perfection of its develop - ment .

		The layman can scarcely appreciate the narrowness of the electrical profession .

		The marvellous development of the applications of electricity has scarcely permitted time for phil - osophical thought to be directed toward either its history or its broader relations .

		No science has ever been so exacting , or had so little to do with the strictly material .

		Devotion to it has meant absorption with mere technical de - tails .

		The writer who has presumed to tran - scend petty technicalities , and to introduce gen - eral conceptions or philosophical allusions , has been called irrelevant , unpractical , and out of touch with the times .

		The purely intellectual * THB INTELLECTUAL RISE IN ELECTRICITY .

		By
Park Benjamin	PERSON	, Ph.D. , LL.B .


New York	LOCATION	:
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		70 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, possibilities of the subject have scarcely been dreamed of or imagined , and few have pos - sessed the courage to attempt to utter them .

		But all this bids fair to be changed , and the '' Intellectual Rise of Electricity '' to receive a new impulse .

		What is urgently needed is that laymen acquire such a knowledge of electricity as will make its history , the general scientific elements underlying the science , living reali - ties ; that its devotees rise to broader apprecia - tion of literature , history , and philosophy .

		`` From the inception of the study of natural phe - nomena , the human mind has pursued its development along two well-defined lines .

		At first a phenomenon is a mere matter of observation , of sensation ; then , as its perception strengthens , the attempt is made to turn the occurrence to some practical application , without seek - ing to incorporate it into a generalization .

		This may be called the pre-scientific attitude .

		The true scientific spirit develops when the mind passes from mere observa - tion to classification , and then on to the higher realm of search for causes , for laws .

		It was when the light - nings burst from the clouds and the thunders shook the earth that the human mind was awed before the mys - terious and uncomprehended powers of nature .

		In the childhood age of the race , the mind saw in such events only the manifestation of the terrible powers of su - pernatural beings , which the superstitious revered as gods to be appeased with sacrifices and placated with prayers . ''

		* The task Dr.
Benjamin	PERSON	has addressed himself to is to entangle the mingled threads of fact and fancy , of mythology and history , and reveal the birth of the electrical idea , its growth , and tell how later on it blossomed and bore rare scientific results .

		Nor has the author placed a false estimate on the value of his subject , when , in the Introduction , he says : '' The intellectual rise in electricity is worthy of his - torical investigation , not merely because of the material results , actual and potential , which have come from it , but because it shows clearly anew the marvellous power of the human mind as an instrument of discovery , capa - ble of correcting its own errors .

		Beginning with a sin - gle phenomenon , afterwards including effects , all for long periods seemingly fortuitous and uncorrelated , this rise has involved questions of an interest second only to that which mankind has yielded to the great issues of life and eternity ; questions which challenged the human understanding and compelled it to measure itself against them . ''

		The story of the amber and the magnetic stone is often repeated in classic lore , and is so interwoven with early thought that the history of development from these simple facts to the dynamo , the telegraph , and the trolley of to - day , involves very largely the various stages of progress of intellectual growth in general .

		So the author defines the spirit in which he wrote , when he says : *
Albrecht	PERSON	,
Getchichte der Elektricilat	ORGANIZATION	.

		11 In this research I have felt that it is not so much the trials and discoveries made in the great and new field of Nature which attract us , instructive and useful , even momentous , as they are , not these so much as the breathing human beings , who in the far past saw them and deciphered them in the light of those other days , and of whose light they formed a part ; who thought of them , and whose thoughts lived on , and became immor - tal , and moved downward through generation after gen - eration , to us ; even as our thoughts , joining theirs , will pass through the ages to the generations yet to come . ''

		Electricity as a science is fully matured , and is in no sense in its infancy , except that the extent of its possible applications is just be - coming realized .

		Its essential definition , full of poetic fancy at first , has now become as clearly defined as our notions of gravity and of the nature and constitution of matter .

		We speak of electricity to-day as an ether-stress , an expression full of meaning to those who have thought far enough to grasp its signifi - cance .

		But what a progress from the concep - tion of an '' amber soul '' to '' ether-stress '' f Yet in the interval of time which marks this progress , all the intellectual and political his - tory of the human race can be written .

		In - stead of being in its infancy , electricity is really the oldest of sciences , since possibly the first recorded experiment in natural science was the electrification of a bit of amber .

		The word electricity comes from the Greek names applied to amber , and the significance of this term is singularly appropriate .

		To the poetic fancy of the Greek , the amber-gold , elector , was an embodied sunbeam .

		From the amber the name passed to a property possessed by it that of attracting light bodies ; and now , by a most singular coincidence , the imprisoned sun - beam energy of coal is released to furnish the brilliant arc light , and we still name the agent electricity .

		The earliest mention of the electrical prop - erty of amber is mostly legendary , and whether the property was first discovered by genius or accident may never be definitely known .

		Yet it is especially interesting , in these latter days , whn women are struggling for fuller recogni - tion , to learn that in all probability the discov - ery of electricity was due to a woman .

		The Thracian women used amber spindles when spinning thread , and these were called '' clutch - ers , '' because dust and light substances were attracted by them after having been rubbed against the garments .

		The lodestone , or natural magnet , has an equally interesting history , and a no less ob - scure origin of discovery .

		The simple phe - nomena of the magnet and amber were doubly
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL mysterious to the ancients ; both possess a strange power of attraction and repulsion , and these tendencies are selective , the amber for light bodies only , the magnet affecting naught else but iron or its like .

		Did not such action partake of the nature of an intelligence , and to what else could it be ascribed than the pres - ence of a soul in amber and lodestone ?

		In such attraction and repulsion they recognized both Love and Hate , and it becomes easily appar - ent that the '' Intellectual Rise '' here chron - icled has touched upon the profoundest con - cepts of philosophy .

		A potent charm for the cure of all manner of bodily ills was thought to reside in the magic amber and lodestone .

		From the times of the Samothracian priests , the medical quack has flourished and fattened on the credulous faith of people in the miraculous healing power of magnetic and electric belts , rings , pills , and so on through the list of traps for the unwary .

		It is a singular fact that both in the develop - ment of electricity and chemistry the first prac - tical application was made in the attempted healing of bodily ills .

		It is difficult to explain the vitality of the belief in the healing efficacy of magnetism and electricity .

		This persistence certainly is no argument for the healing-power of such devices , but is rather evidence of the persistence of superstition and belief in dia - bolism .

		The passage from poetic speculation to a con - crete science did not occur until the close of the sixteenth century .

		In this change , the names of Gray and
Gilbert	PERSON	stand as landmarks .

		Bacon ,
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	,
Hooke	PERSON	, and
Boyle	PERSON	, all contributed to gather the grains of fact from what had hitherto been so largely legendary .

		Other bodies were found to possess the attractive power of amber under favorable conditions .

		Substances were divided into electrics and non-electrics , and the behavior of such under excitation was studied .

		Magnetic phenomena were carefully studied .

		Later ,
Otto von Guericke	PERSON	discovered how to generate considerable quantities of static elec - tricity by a rubbed sulphur globe ; and von
Kleist	PERSON	was as much dismayed by the shock that marked the discovery of the
Leyden	PERSON	jar , as the world was surprised .

		Then electrical experi - ments became the fad , and monks , nuns , cour - tiers , and soldiers were repeatedly and indis - criminately shocked .

		A rich vein of humor runs through the descriptions of these times .

		The medical quack took fresh courage , and plied the gullible public with vigorous activity .

		We read of the marvellous cures of a certain Flemish physician ,
Van Helmont	PERSON	, who worked wonders with the ''
Balsamick Emanations	PERSON	of the Sympathetick Unguent or Powder . ''

		Mag - netic remedies abounded , which were famed for curing even at great distance .

		Here we note the rise of the conception of communication at a distance by magnetic or electric means .

		Tel - epathy was firmly believed in , and one may readily discern the beginnings of modern hyp - notic suggestion in those times .

		But even at that period a wonderful idea was slowly taking form in the minds of the more thoughtful .

		Men began to dream of transmit - ting intelligence through space , germs of thought which have developed into the electro - magnetic telegraph and telephone .

		A great generalization remained to be established , the identity of the electric spark with the lightning ; and with this master-stroke of Franklin the chronicle of '' The Intellectual Rise in Elec - tricity '' comes to an end .

		The final lesson of the author is worthy of note : '' Man-made systems may fall , apostles of degenera - tion may find , in the things which make up the environ - ment of the hour , signs of impending decay .

		But he who turns to the history of intellectual endeavor in the study of nature will learn that when mind thus faces the pu - rity of the Infinite , it does not and can not degenerate .

		Rather will he see in the constant effort to reveal the truth an influence always making for good , always neutralizing the tendency to evil , always vast in uplift - ing power . ''

		Dr.
Benjamin	PERSON	has done his work well .

		He has brought to his task the scientific training of the specialist in electricity , the resources of a private library considered without an equal in the country , and a literary style that is both elevated and charming .

		The work is free from mathematics and technicalities , and is as en - tertaining as a romance .

		^ jy THE CAVE-DWELLERS or YUCATAN .

		* The examination of the earth accumulations upon the floors of caves in
Europe	LOCATION	has given im - portant evidence to the archaeologist .

		Ancient men used the caverns as homes , and in them are found to-day layers and heaps of rubbish that accumulated during this occupancy .

		Bones of animals that were used as food , rude tools and implements , charcoals of ancient fires , are among the objects found .

		From their evidence it is known that in

Western Europe	LOCATION	was at first a savage , with the crudest tools and weapons ; that he was capable of pro- gress , and that he made improvement , the steps in which may be traced .

		All this has been clearly proved .

		Comparatively little careful exploration has been made of American caverns .

		What has been done is quite largely the work of Mr.
Henry C. Mercer	PERSON	, who has recently studied caves in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
West Virginia	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	,
Kentucky	LOCATION	, and
Tennessee	LOCATION	.

		The results are interesting and important , but can not be presented here .

		The exploration of these caves suggested investigation of those of Yucatan .

		Everyone knows of the curious ruins left in that peninsula by the
Mayas	LOCATION	.

		A strange culture is shown by them and by the relics found with them .

		Was this culture indigenous , growing up in Yucatan itself , or was it introduced in full development ?

		Mr.
Mercer	PERSON	believed that an examination of the caves would solve the question .

		Fortunately , means for the enter - prise were not wanting .

		Mr.
John White	PERSON	Cor - with offered the funds for the investigation , and with Mr.
Mercer	PERSON	and a small party of help - ers spent some months last year in the field .

		The results of the trip are presented in Mr.
Mercer	PERSON	's volume on '' The Hill Caves of Yu - catan . ''

		The physical geography of Yucatan is at once peculiar and simple .

		The country is largely one of limestones , and these are almost honey - combed with subterranean channels and cham - bers .

		Of high mountains there are none ; a low ridge was the mass in which lay the caves examined .

		It presented no cliffs or rock walls .

		Caves like those of
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, of
Tennessee	LOCATION	and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, do not seem to exist there .

		Those found are described as '' A very striking class of underground chambers from fifty to three hundred and fifty feet in diameter and from fifteen to seventy feet high , more or less brightly lit by round openings in the ceiling ten , twenty , and fifty feet in diameter .

		Through these skylights fragments of the original crust had fallen , forming piles of loose stones on the cave floor ... Where the rock pile was high enough , banana trees and tropical evergreens grow - ing upon it swept the brink of the chasm with their boughs , making strange rattlings when the wind blew .

		Sometimes the subterranean groves lay far beneath the surface in rotundas inaccessible from above .

		Then they were first seen after a long clamber underground , like gardens beneath the vaultings of sombre passages .

		Doves built their nests in high ledges by the skylights , and animals found refuge under the rock heaps , where Indians had built blinds of loose stones to stalk them . ''

		Such were the caves to be examined .

		The work was often difficult .

		The fallen rock masses were frequently so numerous , so large , and so closely packed , that the excavation had to be abandoned long before the original floor of the cave was reached .

		It was soon evident that these caves had never been to any great extent either homes or burial places .

		But for all that , they contained the evidence sought .

		Yucatan has little surface water , few streams , and no great rivers .

		But underground water abounds , and these caves contain a fairly full and reliable supply .

		Man to-day comes to them for water , and he must have done the same ever since the peninsula has been inhabited .

		Never living here continuously , he has always been a frequent visitor and camper .

		Though relics are neither as abundant or varied in the earth-layers upon these floors as they are in the French caves , they occur , and are ample .

		Twenty-nine caves were visited . ''

		Thirteen had archaeological significance ; six yielded val - uable , and three decisive , results . ''

		The excava - tions at
Oxkintok	LOCATION	,
Loltun	LOCATION	, and
Sabaka	PERSON	showed a single layer of rubbish , consisting of pots - herds , stone tools and weapons , charcoal , and bones of animals and birds , some of which had served as food .

		The objects found do not indicate vast antiquity , do not prove the co - existence in Yucatan of man and extinct species of animals , do not show a progress in culture .

		In closing his study , Mr.
Mercer	PERSON	arrives at three conclusions , which may be stated in his own words : '' First .

		That no earlier inhabitant had preceded the builder of the ruined cities in Yucatan . ''

		Second .

		That the people revealed in the caves had reached the country in geologically recent times . ''

		Third .

		That these people , substantially the ances - tors of the present Maya Indians , had not developed their culture in Yucatan , but had brought it with them from somewhere else . ''

		These conclusions appear justified by the evi - dence .

		It is now desirable that similar studies should be made in
Central and Southern Mex	ORGANIZATION	- ico , and in
Guatemala	LOCATION	and other parts of Cen - tral
America	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	's interesting study of '' Early Man in
Mexico	LOCATION	'' appears to show a progressive culture in the
Valley of Mexico	LOCATION	, and legends of Nahuatl and other tribes tell of successive populations in various portions of the Isthmian Area .

		Examination of caves in the regions suggested , such as Mr.
Mercer	PERSON	has made in Yucatan , might yield most valuable results .

		THE DIAL 73 SOME PHASES OP THE SCIENCE OF MIND .

		* Different in subject and scope as are the five vol - umes included in this review , an important bond of community between them is none the less apparent ; and this consists of their common bearing upon the rigorous study of mental phenomena , that forms one of the striking features of contemporary thought .

		For , apart from the anatomists , zoologists , and phy - siologists , who are enlarging the facts and interpret - ing the results of their own specialties as a self - sufficient and independent pursuit , there exists a body of students ready to take up so much of these data as can be utilized in the exposition and inves - tigation of psychological problems .

		And what is true of the relations between the sciences that deal with the body and those that deal with the mind , is true , though in different ways and degrees , of an - thropology and philology , of psychiatry and sociol - ogy .

		Indeed , we may be said to have completed the circle of the sciences , beginning with the days when all knowledge was one , and that one philoso - phy , and slowly developing to the formation of the several sciences into independent groups ; and now realizing , in the light of this vast accumulation of fact-material , the essential interrelation and inter - dependence of the many specialties .

		The various sciences represent the directions of our interests and the limitations of each man 's powers , quite as much as they represent groups of facts naturally or logically separated from other groups of facts .

		Professor
Donaldson	PERSON	's work on '' The Growth of the Brain '' is devoted to a systematic and discrim - inating account of the growth-changes in the nerv - ous system , accompanying and forming so essential a factor of the march from birth to death .

		To give this account its maximum significance , the introduc - tory chapters describe the main factors of cell and body growth ; and for the proper comprehension of the bearing of these changes , a clear and telling exposition of the architecture and function of nerve tissues is introduced .

		The volume thus does more than it promises , for it gives the facts of brain - growth a carefully wrought and attractive setting .

		Our knowledge of the nervous system has recently progressed quite rapidly , but the records of the pro- gress are difficult of access in scattered papers and technical journals , and require the elimination of contradictory data and accidental variations before their significance is revealed .

		So readable and at once so scholarly an account of the essential facts of neurology , embodying these recent advances , is itself an important acquisition to the literature of the subject .

		It is in the results of the main problem under dis - cussion that the reader will probably be seriously disappointed ; he will find it difficult to carry away any very definite conclusion regarding brain changes and individual variations in brain structure .

		He appreciates the interpretation of the several tables of comparisons of cranial capacity and the like ; he realizes the many sources of error and chances for misinterpretation and loose inferences in the treat - ment of the subject for these are clearly set be - fore him ; but he can not escape the suspicion that the positive outcome of the discussion , though not to be ignored , is none the less disappointing .

		For this he must blame , not the author , but the present condition of the subject .

		It is in many ways an unfortunate time to attempt the grouping of the facts into an orderly whole , and particularly to pre - sent them in a form suitable for a semi-popular scientific series .

		The many tables and curves , the cautious preliminary discussions and careful consid - erations of sources of error , it is to be feared , will deter the layman , while calling out the admiration of the fellow specialist .

		Pioneer work is necessa - rily unsatisfactory from an artistic point of view .

		A quarter of a century hence the time may be riper for the preparation of such an essay on the growth of the brain as the average reader may desire , but will not find in the present volume .

		However , although the keystone will be the most conspicuous , the other stones are quite as essential to the strength of the structure .

		Before leaving this volume , we must give a mo - ment 's notice to its sub-title '' a study of the nerv - ous system in relation to education . ''

		The growth - changes of the nervous system are obviously funda - mental in all that process which we call education ; and in the last two chapters of the work , the edu - cational bearings of the whole are ably set forth .

		It is true that these educational applications are based as much upon other facts as upon those treated in the volume , and even more so ; but they tell very plainly the lesson that neurology teaches .

		They show how apt we are to exaggerate the importance of formal education and technical acquisition , and how slight this may be when compared with uncon - scious absorption and the unfoldment of natural dispositions ; they show that no discussion of the effects of educational methods can be considered complete that does not take into account the changes in the nervous system by which all such processes are conditioned .

		Our knowledge of such relations is lamentably imperfect in detail , but the attempt 74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, to interpret educational changes in neurological terms is in itself most helpful , and gives additional importance to the volume under discussion .

		Professor
Wilhelm Wundt	PERSON	is widely known to English readers as a pioneer and a leader in the development of modern psychology and as the foun - der of the first laboratory for the experimental study of mental phenomena ; yet the present is the first volume of his writings to appear in an English trans - lation .

		These lectures on `` Human and Animal Psychology '' were first published over thirty years ago , being one of the very earliest contributions to the experimental field ; in
1892	DATE	the author revised and rearranged the older lectures , and from this second edition Professors
Creighton	PERSON	and Titchener , of
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, have prepared their transla - tion .

		Of all of Professor
Wundt	PERSON	's writings , this vol - ume is best suited for translation , because it is adapted to a wider reading public , and covers , in a less didactic and detailed manner than his more formal treatises , the chief problems of mental sci - ence .

		The first group of lectures considers the facts and interpretation of sense-impressions .

		The dis - cussion of the measurement of intensities of sensa - tion and of the methods of gaining a knowledge of space-dimensions are particularly fully and inter - estingly treated .

		A second group of chapters takes up the time-relations of mental phenomena , consid - ering the rapidity of mental processes , the range of consciousness , the fluctuations of attention , the nature of associations , and the like .

		Besides the lectures which treat of the nature of animal activi - ties , there are also discussions of abnormal states , dreams , hypnotism , and allied phenomena ; of the development of the will and its relation to reflex , automatic , and expressive movements ; of the funda - mental theories connecting bodily and mental states ; and more less incidentally of a variety of interest - ing psychological problems .

		It is thus apparent that the lectures cover a very wide range ; but there is little attempt to give the various topics a definite setting in a coordinated general conception .

		In each of the groups of prob - lems considered , a few problems are selected as typical , and are treated with considerable detail , their relations to other almost equally important topics being left without notice .

		This defect is per - haps to be ascribed to the lecture form of the work , but will often leave the general reader at sea re - garding the significance of what he has read .

		Indeed , the reader to whom the volume will be most helpful is one who has some elementary acquaint - ance with scientific psychology , and is willing to make some effort to extend that acquaintance , and at the same time demand a readable and impressive exposition .

		This class of readers does not include the largest share of those who will be tempted to scan the title-page with a view of perusal , but it is large enough to sanction the labors of translation ; nor should the demands of the rapidly increasing number of professed students be ignored .

		The revision of a course of lectures prepared in the budding-time of an expanding science could hardly have been an easy task ; and the result , as the author confesses , is not free from the architec - tural defects and compromises inherent in the mod - ernizing of an old structure .

		Distinctly new topics , that have come into prominence within recent years , are introduced ; other lectures are omitted ; and very generally new facts and experiments are sub - stituted for the old ones .

		But in spite of all these changes the volume does not adequately represent the methods and results of the movement to which Professor Wundt has so largely contributed .

		Wel - come as the volume undoubtedly is as an addition to the psychological shelves of our libraries , private and public , it must be recommended with an explan - ation of its relative historical importance , and of the plan of its modernization .

		The translation is both readable and accurate qualities not so often combined as to need no com - mendation ; here and there the harsh Teutonic tech - nical phrases are insufficiently disguised , or unusual words used when more familiar ones are in vogue .

		But these minor imperfections entirely disappear in the general excellence of the whole .

		Professor
Ktilpe	PERSON	's '' Outlines of Psychology '' is a product of the Leipzic school of psychology ; the author was for several years an assistant to Profes - sor Wundt , and dedicates the volume to his master .

		It is in some respects a compendium of
Wundt	ORGANIZATION	's larger work the resemblances of arrangement and treatment , of theory and perspective , being many and striking , but in the main deserves to be re - garded as an original exposition of psychological problems from the experimental point of view .

		It is to be regretted that the author has not availed himself of the convenience of a preface to explain the special purposes of the volume , the class of read - ers to whom it is addressed , and the basis of selec - tion of the particular problems selected and omitted .

		The '' psychologies '' of an earlier period were mostly expositions of individual systems , or the tenets of a school ; more recently a '' psychology '' has come to represent the particular group of problems , treated from this or that point of view , in which the author is specially interested .

		It may be seriously ques - tioned whether the progress of a science depending upon such contributions alone would be rapid or certain .

		It would be foolish to question the right of any scientific worker to express his own convic - tions upon the main problems of his science in a way most satisfactory to himself , and , indeed , a frank acknowledgement of this individualistic mo - tive upon the title-page would often ward off a severe but justifiable criticism of the work ; but from the point of view of a disinterested zeal in the advance of science it may be confidently maintained that a general discountenancing of such works would be a wholesome corrective to a natural excess .

		Many a work of ability , and replete with expositions of originality and importance , repels rather than attracts , because it is entitled '' principles '' or '' out - lines '' of psychology , instead of '' some contribu -
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 75 tions to the consideration of selected problems in psychology . ''

		The matter is not one of title , of course -LRB- and unwieldy titles are obviously objec - tionable -RRB- ; it is a question of the wholesomeness of a certain literary tendency that is particularly pre - valent in psychology .

		Professor
Kiilpe	PERSON	's work is an able example of the tendency in question .

		It represents more than any - thing else his individual interests and methods of exposition ; able as these are , and interesting as they may be to his fellow-theorizers , it may be doubted whether they will appeal to that considerable body of English-reading students for whom the transla - tion was presumably prepared .

		The work is not easy to read nor to describe .

		To the collegiate stu - dent of psychology it will be quite generally puz - zling and unsatisfactory ; although the claim is made that '' experimental psychology is fully within its rights when it claims to be the general psychology of which we propose to treat , '' it is surprising how few experimental results are described ; unusual technical terms and needlessly abstruse classifica - tions are constantly introduced .

		In brief , it is a work much better suited to the German than to the English mind ; our education demands more atten - tion to guidance and instruction than is traditional in the academic freedom of a German university .

		We reap the benefit of this in the pains taken by our professional writers to be clear and useful .

		The work is divided into three parts , devoted respectively to the elements of consciousness , the connection between these elements , and the general considerations of states of consciousness .

		Under the first head , sensations are considered , first with refer - ence to their quality or specific character , and then with reference to their intensity .

		We ordinarily restrict the term sensation to the process that be - gins with the action of some agency outside our - selves and makes us aware of such stimulus ; for this , Dr.
Ktilpe	PERSON	prefers the term '' peripherally ex - cited sensation , '' and treats of the processes of memory , imagination , reproduction , and association as '' centrally excited sensations . ''

		A final section on the elements of consciousness is devoted to the feel - ings , with some slight reference to the will .

		The '' conscious elements '' are connected mainly in two ways : by fusion , illustrated best by the mingling of several tone-stimuli into one sensational effect ; and by colligation , which finds its best instance in the method of our deriving a knowledge of space from the combination of touch , movement , and sight .

		The terms '' fusion '' and '' colligation '' are used so broadly that a consideration of the emotions and impulses , of the perception of time and space , of the many variations of simple and compound reactions , of the phenomena of contrast and optical illusions , are all made more or less pertinent to the discus - sion .

		The part dealing with the states of conscious - ness discusses attention , self-consciousness , sleep and dreams , hypnotism and allied conditions .

		As already indicated , the treatment gives least space to the description of facts , and dwells fully upon interpre - tations , analysis , and the merits of rival theories .

		Considering the character of the work , the trans - lation is more than creditable ; an elimination of technical terms and unusual phrases and the didac - tic arrangement would have been a departure from a literal version , but a relief to the English reader .

		But in consideration of the recent contributions to our literature of similar scope , it may be doubted whether the translation meets any real need .

		Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	's essay on the psychology of feeling is a noteworthy and original contribution to a much - discussed but obscure problem the origin , signifi - cance , and course of development of the emotional activities and dispositions .

		The author 's contention , as implied in his title , is that the feelings prompt - ing to and accompanying actions can be rightly interpreted only in the light of an evolutionary hy - pothesis and under the principle of serviceability .

		This at once emphasizes the problem as one belong - ing to comparative psychology , and sends the stu - dent to studying the simpler emotional capabilities of children and of the lower animals .

		On the other hand , Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	is convinced that the typically psychological method is introspection , that feeling can be known only by a discriminating and self - observant feeler ; in this method , therefore , the first place is given to a rigid self-analysis , the results of such analysis to be controlled and corroborated by observation of less complex personalities than our own , as well as of the various historical , social , and anthropological variations which the study of man furnishes .

		The beginning of all mental life is in the pleasure - pain feelings ; these precede cognition , the primi - tive organism realizing that its psychic state is dis - turbed before it is aware of a something causing the disturbance .

		Indeed , the incentive to cognition is the feeling ; '' pleasure and pain bring their objects , not objects pleasures and pains . ''

		Of the two , al - though both primitive modes of manifestation , pain is perhaps the earlier .

		Both appear because of their serviceability in advancing the good of the organ - ism and protecting it from evil , and both develop in the line of more and more efficient and far-seeing benefit and protection . ''

		Further , that pain should be attained where there is little actual harm , is good , but to attain pain , and self - conservative action before any injury is done , but only about to be done , is better .

		Reaction to potential harm is a most important advantageous step .

		In the earlier form of mentality , the animal must actually be in the process of being devoured by an enemy before a pain reaction is achieved , but in the later representative form of reaction there is complete anticipation , and the ani - mal can come off with an absolutely whole skin .

		Ideal pains , as fear , anger , and other emotions , are gradually substituted for pains which are real in the sense that they arise in a positive hurt to the life of the organism .

		The saving which is effected through emotion is most important , and this economy is reason for the rise of emotion in the strugle of existence .

		Those animals who are able , not merely to react on slight injuries to them - selves , but also through fear , etc. , to avoid all actual injury , have a very manifest advantage . ''

		76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, As forewarned is forearmed , as experience brings wisdom , as the power of prediction is the test of science , so the same prudential and anticipating advantages furnish the clue for the development of the emotions .

		Fear and desire , repulsion and attraction , the avoidance of evil , the seeking of good , bring about opposite pairs of emotions , gradualy differentiating into more and more forms with the increased complexity of the animal organization and environment , until in man we have all shades and grades of fear emotions , requiring the trained powers of an astute observer for their analysis and delineation .

		The portrayal of these differentiations of fear and desire , of surprise , hope , dissappoint - ment , of anger and despair , make up the central portion of the volume , and do not admit of a sum - mary statement .

		Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	is equally forcible and felicitous in his treatment of more complex and peculiarly hu - man emotions , as in his analysis of the simpler feel - ings common to all living kind concerned in the struggle for existence .

		His analysis of the aesthetic and the ethical feelings the two most difficult chapters in the psychology of feeling which are certain to arouse objections in the minds of many , can not but be suggestive and stimulating to all ; and in particular the chapter on the '' Psychology of Literary Style '' is cordially recommended to students of literature as well as of psychology as an attractive bit of psychological analysis .

		Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	's views will incite criticism at the hands of those who have maintained different views of the significance and origin of feeling notably in this country of Profesor James and Mr.
Mar	PERSON	- shall ; and his general method will be opposed some - what by the claimants for the introduction of ex - periment and objective tests throughout the psy - chological field .

		The former will find much food for reflection in this evolutionary exposition of the subject ; and the latter , while convinced that the author underestimates the possibilities of experi - ment in psychology , will probably admit that its application to the emotions is most difficult , and will be ready to admit introspection as a legitimate method when it is used , as it is in this volume , with discrimination , with a recognition of its many sources of error , and under the guidance of a mental habit formed by familiarity with scientific thought .

		The last volume in our group furnishes an addi - tional example of an all too frequent discrepancy between title-page and content .

		The reader , hav - ing his appetite aroused by an attractive menu , is perhaps unduly annoyed at finding a very simple meal , quite wholesome and palatable in itself , but very different from what he was led to expect .

		Had Mr.
Hoffman	PERSON	entitled his essay '' Contributions to the study of American picture-writing , '' he would have attracted a more limited public , but would have fed this public to its satisfaction .

		The essay touches the fascinating problem of the origin and growth of sign-making frequently , but in an irregu - lar and unsystematic manner .

		This problem is fun - damentally a psychological one , involving the sur - vival of the best-suited modes of communication under various primitive conditions , the necessity of communication being in turn an outcome of the social impulse .

		The typical forms of sign-making must therefore correspond to typical modes of asso - ciational and other mental processes ; of these , sym - bolism is perhaps the most interesting and most efficient .

		Mr.
Hoffman	PERSON	's grouping of signs involv - ing this and similar processes is valuable and help - ful ; and in general it may be said that the more limited purpose of the volume the illustration of the principles of sign-making by American picto - graphs is successfully accomplished .

		As such , the volume will be welcomed by a rapidly increasing number of students and general readers who are convinced that the proper study of mankind is man .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 77 the Obscure '' known as '' Hearts Insurgent '' dur - ing the period of its publication in a popular maga - zine is a book sure to command much attention , and to provoke widely diverse expressions of opin - ion .

		When engaged in reading the opening pages , it seemed to us that the book bade fair to equal , if not to surpass , any of the author 's previous achieve - ments .

		There is always something supremely touch - ing in the story of a boy of high aspirations and exceptional intellectual endowments , struggling up - ward to the light under conditions the most adverse , and this is the story outlined for us in the begin - ning of the book .

		But as our reading went on , and the twilight of the opening chapters deepened into the gloom of those that followed instead of flushing into the dawn that we had reason to expect , as the youth who at first aroused sympathy developed into the man who could inspire little besides contempt or disgust , as the book became more and more a bitter tirade against the fundamental institutions of society , and as we realized that its tenor was to re - main one of cheerlessness throughout , we must con - fess to a feeling of utter disheartenment at the use which the author was set upon making of his splen - did talent .

		Ours is not the childish complaint of the reader who wants his stories to come out well ; we do not dispute the right of tragedy to a con - spicuous place in the literature that deals with the stern realities of human life , and we are more than most writers in sympathy with the moods of the pessimist .

		But between the noble tragedy which performs for us the Aristotelian function of purging the soul of baseness and such tragedy as Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	gives us in the present novel , between the proud pessimism of a revolted but self-centred spirit and the scolding sort of pessimism to which this book gives vent , there is a world-wide difference .

		The one is as attractive as the other is revolting to the reader of serious temper .

		The author tells us that his book '' attempts to deal unaffectedly with the fret and fever , derision and disaster , that may press in the wake of the strongest passion known to hu - manity . ''

		Fret and fever he doubtless gives us , and both derision and disaster , but to say that he does it unaffectedly is the last thing that would occur to a reader of wholesome instincts .

		On the contrary , it would be uncharitable not to assume that the gratuitous cynicism , and the sullen temper , and the moral perversity of the book , were all affected , de - liberately and of set purpose .

		It can not be , for example , that
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	is indeed to Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	the city of dreadful night that his Christminster is made to appear .

		To the childish imagination of Jude it appeared as a very city of the soul , and the chap - ters that present it to us in this aspect themselves belie the other chapters in which it takes on so dif - ferent a guise .

		As for the plot of the novel , any outline statement would appear merely farcical ; with the wealth of observation and episode brought to the working-out , it escapes this charge , although but narrowly .

		In characterization it is , of course , strong beyond most contemporary novels , and Sue is a creation of a charm so elusive yet irresistible that she is secure in the affections of the reader , although her kaleidoscopic nature is inconsistent far beyond the point to which inconsistency as the pre - rogative of her sex is admissible .

		The book is also a very plain-spoken one , more than necessarily plain - spoken , we think .

		Will these realists leave nothing to the imagination in dealing with the subject which above all others makes a decent reticence imperative ?

		Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	once wrote of Browning in these terms : '' The worst of it is that this kind of con - centrated writing needs so much solution before the reader can fairly get the good of it . ''

		Mr.
Mere	PERSON	- dith 's style calls for solution quite as much as
Browning	PERSON	's ever did , and does not so well reward the patience .

		Whatever may be the insight or the robust philosophy of his books , their utterly per - verse manner must exclude them from the vital literary interests of the great majority of readers .

		This is unfortunate , for Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	has better stuff to offer us than any of his contemporaries among novelists , but it is nevertheless inevitable .

		The rich kernel of his thought is encased in too hard a nut for many to crack , and his doctrine is likely to remain chiefly esoteric . ''

		The Amazing Marriage '' is not as hard reading as some of its predecessors have been , but is harder than most of us like to undertake for pleasure .

		Between this book and
Kant	PERSON	's '' Kritik , '' let us say , it is some - thing like a toss-up , with the chances a trifle in favor of the sage of KOnigsberg .

		We do not profess to have read every line of these two thick volumes , but we have caught glimpses in their pages of sev - eral intensely-realized individuals , and have as often wished that the author might have presented his characters with the lucid art of a Balzac or a Thack - eray , instead of as in a glass darkly , straining the gaze and thwarting the attention .

		Considered sim - ply as a story , the book has but a slender equip - ment .

		An impulsive and eccentric young noble - man meets an unconventional girl , and proposes to her on the spot .

		He soon regrets the act , while she , never doubting his sincerity , holds him to the word which he makes it a point of strenuous honor not to evade .

		The wedding is accomplished , and the bride is taken , for her wedding-journey , to a prize - fight , described with ghastly exactitude .

		Immedi - ately thereafter the husband deserts her , but can - not escape the spell cast over him by her proud and vital personality .

		The rest of the book is devoted to a description of the process of soul-subjugation to which the hero finally succumbs , only to be flouted , and to find that he has cast irrevocably away a jewel too cheaply prized .

		She leaves the scene upon some mad errand of mercy to the Span - ish rebels , and he finds refuge in a monastery .

		An obtrusive person called
Dame Gossip	ORGANIZATION	interrupts the narrative from time to time , and an equally obtru - sive Old Buccaneer , sometime father of the heroine , is permitted to bore us every now and then with certain maxims left at his death to a wondering world .

		78 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, One of the most noteworthy features of recent English fiction is the revival of interest in the
Scot	ORGANIZATION	, due in part to the writings of
Stevenson	PERSON	and Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, and still more largely to the still later group of writers that includes Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	, Mr.
Watson	PERSON	, and Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	.

		Of these three , the latter , to judge by what has already been accomplished , rep - resents the greatest fertility of invention , as well as the most marked literary force .

		Two recent novels by Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	appeal to us , as their predecessors have done , by their faithful delineation of scene and character , their romantic manner , and their shrewd humor .

		Both are human books in a high sense , and both enlist the sympathies of the reader , holding them to the end . ''

		A
Galloway	PERSON	Herd '' is a story whose scenes are mainly Scotch , although predetermined by certain tragic happenings in Lon - don , and ending , almost tragically , in the
Paris	LOCATION	of
1871	DATE	and the
Commune	ORGANIZATION	.

		The passages are some - what loosely linked together , and one is often puz - zled to trace the connection between scene and scene .

		This lack of explicitness is doubtless a fault , as is also the intrusion of certain romantic elements not quite in keeping with the tenor of the narrative .

		The dialect , too , is a stumbling-block , and makes hard reading of far too many pages .

		That the book should , on the whole , compel attention to the end , in spite of these shortcomings , is perhaps the best tribute that we can pay to its essential charm .

		We should add that the book is an early production , now reprinted without the author 's sanction . ''

		The Men of the Moss-Hags , '' Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	's other novel , is '' a history of adventure taken from the papers of
William Gordon	PERSON	of
Earlstoun	LOCATION	in Gal - loway . ''

		It deals with the persecution of the Cov - enanters , and has many a stirring episode of con - flict , and imminent danger , and escape .

		It is , in - deed , open to the reproach of being little more than a series of episodes , and its charm is to be sought in the faithful finish of its separate scenes rather than in the action taken as a whole .

		The dialect , too , makes it difficult reading , but that is a necessary evil in a tale of this sort , and we gladly put up with the strange speech for the sake of the local color and sympathetic delineation .

		The closing episode makes no small demand upon credulity , but the story , taken altogether , is not lacking in verisimili - tude , and the author has so thought and felt him - self into the period of which he writes that we are more than once reminded of
Scott	LOCATION	, without for a moment thinking of Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	as an imitator .

		Another Scotch story wholly Scotch as to scene , and largely so as to character is Mrs.
Steel	PERSON	's '' Red Rowans . ''

		The writer herself frankly styles it '' a love story , '' and the name is accurately applied .

		It must have necessitated a sharp readjustment of fo - us for the writer to turn to another country from the
India	LOCATION	that she knows so well , and a book like the present is the last that we should have expected from the author of `` The
Potter	PERSON	's Thumb . ''

		In some respects the art of `` Red Rowans '' marks an advance upon that of the Indian tales , an advance most notable in the matter of construction , although in this respect Mrs.
Steel	PERSON	has still something to learn .

		We can not forgive the tragically abrupt ending of the story , for the whole tenor of what goes before does anything but warrant so startling a conclusion .

		One is almost tempted to think that it was adopted in sheer despair , and because a nat - ural solution of the complication was found too dif - ficult .

		The story is , in the main , a wholesome piece of work , excellent in both description and charac - terization .

		If it has not the extraordinary power of '' The
Potter	PERSON	's Thumb , '' it is probably because its theme is too hackneyed and commonplace to per - mit of a like display .

		But , in any case , the histo - rian of our latter-age fiction will have to reckon with Mrs.
Steel	PERSON	.

		The unfamiliar name of ''
Aubrey Lee	PERSON	'' is at - tached to the story of ''
John Darker	PERSON	. ''

		The book is an exceedingly amateurish performance , with but scant display of constructive skill or rather an exasperating absence of it where most needed and concerned with people whose characters are so self-contradictory that we soon give up the attempt to reconcile their curious traits .

		Yet there is a cer - tain crude power in parts of the book that arrests attention , and sustains a certain degree of interest .

		It is more than accident that the writer makes oc - casional reference to
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	, for many passages suggest the peculiar temper of the author of ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	, '' and the heroine -LRB- who uses the first person -RRB- succeeds in making herself almost as real as her other characters are impossible .

		The sum of it all is that the writer must be a young woman , who has had some personal experiences out of the common , who has preserved an unusually vivid rec - ollection of them , and who has thrown her person - ality unreservedly into her pages .

		Mr.
Boothby	PERSON	has hardly done well to desert , even in part , the Australasian scenes hi which his earlier novels have been placed , and '' A Bid for Fortune '' is weakened by being made to cover so much ground .

		It opens with a mystery so well conceived as to stimulate the most jaded interest , and speedily de - velopes into a promising love-story .

		But the love - story ends in insipidity , and the mystery appears too much for its inventor , since he fails to clear it up , although he calls hypnotism and other uncanny agencies to his aid .

		The plot is for the most part wildly improbable , if not impossible , and the book can hardly be called anything better than rubbish of a rather clever sort . ''

		The Chronicles of Count Antonio '' is an ex - periment in mediaevalism , and the author has been fairly successful in the task of investing his narra - tive with the romantic atmosphere of the Italian life of some centuries ago .

		A petty state , its rul - ing prince , a noble maiden , and a valiant outlaw , are the materials out of which this somewhat la - bored book is made .

		We must confess to having found it dull reading , with hardly a trace of the sort of romantic interest that the author contrived to put into '' The Prisoner of Zenda , '' for example .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 79 The nature of the subject , of course , precludes the introduction of the element of comedy that gives zest to such other books as '' A Change of Air '' and * ' The Indiscretion of the Duchess , '' and that makes those books so effective .

		The recent revival of interest in the Maid of Or - leans has resulted in the production of a consider - able amount of romantic fiction , of which the most important example is Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's '' A Monk of Fife . ''

		The subject is one almost ideally suited to Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's hand , appealing , as it does , to his deepest interests and intellectual sympathies how warmly the noble poem in his latest volume of verse may wit - ness .

		The romance before us pretends to be a transla - tion of a French manuscript in the
Ilatisbons Scots College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Whether this pretense be wholly a bit of mystification we are not concerned to inquire ; for all practical purposes '' A Monk of Fife '' is an original work of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's imagination , although it follows historical fact more closely than such fiction is wont to do .

		As to the style of the book , it may be de - scribed in Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's own words , as '' not imitating , in manner , the almost contemporary English of the *
Paston Letters	ORGANIZATION	, ' or the somewhat earlier English style of the
Regent Bedford	ORGANIZATION	, but merely attempt - ing to give a moderately old air to his -LSB- Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's -RSB- version of a French which , genuine or imitative , is certainly , in character and spelling , antique . ''

		The story is told in the first person , and is essentially the narrative of a young Scotsman , fleeing from his own country in consequence of a brawl , and finding service with the French at such a time as to be con - cerned in the siege of
Orleans	LOCATION	, and to become closely associated with the fortunes of the Maid .

		A pretty love-story after the fashion made so famil - iar by the author of '' A Gentleman of
France	LOCATION	'' runs through the chronicle , and gives it an extra - historical interest .

		The narrative is at times la - bored , as the result of a wish to omit no historical fact of importance , but is for the most part highly readable , giving a vivid impression of the stirring life of early fifteenth-century
France	LOCATION	.

		It is to the
France	LOCATION	of a later period than this , of a period later even than that with which he has been in the habit of dealing , that Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	takes us in '' The Red Cockade . ''

		The hackneyed theme of the French Revolution has for a time , and that not altogether happily , diverted the author 's attention from the ages of
Henry IV	ORGANIZATION	.

		and of
Riche	LOCATION	- lieu in which he has shown himself so entirely at home .

		The present story is confined within the first year of the Revolution , and its scene is in the provinces .

		At first , it pictures the peasant uprisings of the
summer	DATE	and autumn of
1789	DATE	; then the hope - less stand taken by the clerical party at Nimes the year following becomes the subject of the story , bringing it to an effective climax .

		It is the conven - tional and melodramatic view of the Revolution that Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	gives us , a view that will not bear very close historical examination , but that is , of course , highly effective for romantic purposes .

		It does not seem , to us , however , that this book is as well planned and carefully written as two or three of its predecessors .

		The illustrations leave much to be desired ; most of all , perhaps , that the artist should have read the text with which he was sup - posed to be working .

		It is a little startling to read of the heroine , at a certain critical juncture , that her hair was falling loosely over her shoulders , and to note the elaborate coiffure given her in the cor - responding picture .

		The selection of American fiction made for the present review can not better be headed than by the name of Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	, who this year gives us of his largess two full-grown romances . ''

		Clarence '' is a sequel to ''
Susy	PERSON	, '' and reintroduces us to
Clarence Brant	PERSON	, this time as a Union officer in the Civil War .

		The plot is based on the estrangement between him and his wife , resulting from the pronounced South - ern sympathies of the aforetime Widow Peyton , and leading somewhat tragically to her death .

		Another heroine is introduced to console
Clarence	PERSON	in his be - reavement and make him happy at the end .

		Our old friend Susy appears once more , as saucy and bewitching as ever , and plays an important part in the fortunes of the hero .

		The story is certainly one of the best that have been written with the his - tory of our Civil War for a background .

		Mr.
Harte	PERSON	's other novel , '' In a Hollow of the Hills , '' must , we fear , be reckoned among his comparative failures .

		It would impress a reader unfamiliar with the bulk of the author 's work as striking enough , but to the one who views it against the background of so many earlier performances of its kind , the hackneyed character of the material is only too ap - parent , while it displays , in exaggerated form , the author 's weakness for situations that are made start - ling only at the sacrifice of probability .

		Its kalei - doscopic changes are not easy to follow , or to con - nect into a coherent work of art .

		Mr.
Townsend	PERSON	, to whom we are all indebted for the discovery and introduction to polite circles of
Chimmie Fadden	PERSON	, has essayed , in '' A Daughter of the Tenements , '' the conventional novel form , and , if a good plot , close familiarity with the scenes and types depicted , and genuine human sympathies are the elements of success in such an effort , the author has certainly achieved it .

		His plain , almost blunt , style savors of journalism rather than of literature , but affords just the medium needed for a vivid real - ization of the sort of characters with which he has chosen to deal , and whose life , both internal and external , he knows so intimately .

		In a word , Mr.
Townsend	PERSON	offers us realism of a good kind , and de - serves our gratitude .

		His heroine is a very win - some young person , his hero is a fine example of manhood , and his villain is as despicable as the properly - behaved villain ought to be .

		Even the ward politician has , it appears , a human side , and is not altogether deserving of the sweeping condem - nation bestowed upon him by self-righteous critics .

		If we must find some fault with Mr.
Townsend	PERSON	's story , it shall be that it is crowded toward the close , and leaves us with a feeling that the threads of a 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, rather complex entanglement have not been straight - ened out with sufficient deliberation .

		Mulberry Bend , alas , is no more , but this novel will preserve the memory of that famous slum , and , what is still better , will help the student of the future to recon - struct not a little of its variegated and character - istic local color . ''


Dolly Dillenbeck	PERSON	'' is not the story of a maiden , as might be inferred , for
Dolly	ORGANIZATION	is short for Adol - phus , and the name is borne by a gilded youth who runs through his fortune in an incredibly brief pe - riod , and , after a season of convivial companionship with as disreputable a collection of deadbeats as Broadway can furnish , ends his wretched career in an asylum .

		He becomes successively famous as a '' wine-opener , '' a society-newspaper publisher , and a '' putter-up '' for an actress , before his final dis - appearance from the scene , and his story becomes , in the clever hands of Mr.
James L. Ford	PERSON	, a me - dium for the presentation of a good deal of cutting satire , and a number of rapid and realistic sketches of metropolitan types of character .

		The book does not introduce us to any very desirable society , yet the total impression is not as unpleasant as might be expected from this description , a fact largely due to the flashes of genuine humor that light up the pages of the narrative . ''

		Rose of
Dutcher	PERSON	's Coolly '' is a most uncom - promising title , and seems to symbolize an unneces - sarily stern insistence upon the particular form of realism or veritism of which Mr.
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	has so often made himself so outspoken and unami - able a prophet .

		The title introduces , moreover , a novel characterized by several noticeable defects , such as an obtrusive didacticism , a repulsive lack of reticence concerning those details of the sex prob - lem that it should be the first principle of whole - some art to avoid , and a style that is often slovenly .

		We may illustrate the latter defect by such sen - tences as , '' Rose received a note from her asking her to come over and see her , '' and '' I would be a literary if I were not forced to be a newspaper man , '' which are examples taken almost at random .

		Of the other defects noted , we may say that the very nature of one forbids any attempt at illustration on our part , while the other is familiar enough to read - ers of the author 's earlier imaginative work .

		But we are happy to say that Mr.
Garland	PERSON	's novel is a better one than his theories would rationally account for , that the wanton nastiness of a few chapters does not prevent the book as a whole from exercising a singular power over the reader 's imagination , and that the faulty style is in part , at least , offset by some striking word-painting of the impressionist sort , and by a vivid presentation of the vital mo - ments in the life of the heroine .

		At times , as in the chapter called '' M * son talks on marriage , '' or in the strong description of a storm on
Lake Mich	LOCATION	- igan , the reader ceases to be critical , and frankly gives himself up to delight in the display of genuine characterization , or poetic observation , as the case may be .

		The story centres about the life of a sin - gle person a girl who by sheer force of genius rises out of an adverse and benumbing environment to shape for herself spiritual freedom .

		The delinea - tion of this character is warmly sympathetic , and displays a degree of insight nothing less than re - markable .

		It is in the creation of this character that Mr.
Garland	PERSON	has achieved his success , a more notable success , to our mind , than anything to be found in his earlier books .

		And he may indite essays in iconoclasm by the score if he will only now and then , by way of proving his quality , project into our fiction a few more Roses by any other name hailing from
Dutcher	PERSON	's Coolly or other localities of cacophonous designation . ''

		The Red Badge of Courage '' is a book that has been getting a good deal of belated praise within the past few weeks , but we can not admit that much of it is deserved .

		There is almost no story to Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's production , but merely an account , in rough - shod descriptive style , of the thoughts and feelings of a young soldier during his first days of active fighting .

		The author constructs for his central char - acter a psychological history that is plausible , but hardly convincing .

		We do not know , nor does the writer , that it is what actually does go on in the mind of a man who is passing through his baptism of fire .

		It may be retorted that we do not know any the more that
Count Tolstoi	LOCATION	is giving us the real thing in his war-stories , or `` Stendhal '' in the '' Chartreuse de Parnie , '' but the descriptions in these books at least seem inevitable while we are reading them , and Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's descriptions do not . ''

		A Singular Life '' is perhaps the strongest piece of work yet done by the author of '' The Gates Ajar . ''

		It is marred by the note of hysterical emotion , from which none of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's books is quite free , and parts of it read too much like the unrestrained out - pourings of the revivalist or '' temperance '' lecturer .

		But it has a fine simple theme to build upon that of a clergyman who seeks to live the life of Christ rather than expound the doctrine by which theology has so successfully obscured the essential Christian spirit and the idea is worked out in fairly sym - metrical form .

		In one aspect , the book might be described as a tragic dramatization of the
Andover	LOCATION	Controversy ; in another , as the story of an Amer - ican Brand , devoting himself single-hearted , like his Norwegian prototype , to the work of saving souls .

		The main impression made by Miss
Dougall	PERSON	's new novel is that the author has tried to make too much of a single slender idea .

		What might have been an admirable short story of thirty pages has taken the shape of a rather tedious long story of some three hundred pages .

		The religious motive is not lacking in this any more than in
Miss Dou	LOCATION	- gall 's other books , but the '' Question of Faith '' sug - gested by the title is not a religious question at all , being nothing more than a question of the amount of faith that a man should repose in the woman whom he expects to make his wife .

		There is room for casuistry in the treatment of such a subject , but the
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 81 author avoids using it , and presents her problem in a direct and matter-of-fact way that can admit of but one solution .

		When the end is reached , it seems as if a great deal of trouble has been taken to set - tle a very simple matter , and the sense of disap - pointment is inevitable .

		We will bring this already overgrown article to a close with some mention of the two most important of recent translations of foreign fiction .


Herr Drachmann	PERSON	, who is foremost among the living story - tellers of
Denmark	LOCATION	, makes his first appearance be - fore an English public with a pretty idyllic tale dat - ing from his earlier period . ''

		Paul and
Virginia	LOCATION	of a Northern Zone , '' put into English by the late
T. A. Schovelin	PERSON	, with the aid of Mr.
F. F. Browne	PERSON	, is a charming addition to our collection of transla - tions from the fiction of the Scandinavian countries .

		The story has the freshness , if not naiveti , that gives to so many of the products of Scandinavian fiction their peculiar charm , and is so well exem - plified in the writings of
Herr Lie	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work dates from the author 's earlier period , before he went the way of nearly all the moderns and began to write about problems .

		Its publication should be followed by other translations from
Herr Drachmann	PERSON	, whose place in contemporary Danish literature is a high one , if not the highest .

		The transition from romantic idealism to `` ten - dencious '' realism , that has marked the career of such Northern writers as
Herr Drachmann	PERSON	,
Herr	PERSON	Lie ,
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	, and Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	, is equally no - ticeable in the strongest contemporary writers of
Southern Europe	LOCATION	.

		It may be illustrated for this occasion by the '' Dona Perfecta '' of Senor Galdds , now translated by Mrs.
Serrano	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, from whose mintage we cheerfully accept the needed word `` tendencious '' -LRB- tendenciosoin Spanish -RRB- , writes an introduction to the translation , saying , among other things , the following : '' Up to a certain time , I believe ,
Galdds	PERSON	wrote romantic or idealistic novels , and one of these I have read , and it tired me very much .

		It was called '
Marianela	PERSON	, ' and it surprised me the more because I was already acquainted with his later work , which is all realistic . ''

		But Mr.
Howells	PERSON	does not admit that the author of '' Dona Perfecta '' has undergone complete conversion , and sorrowfully adds : '' I am not saying that the story has no faults ; it has several .

		There are tags of romanticism fluttering about it here and there ; and at times the author permits himself certain old - fashioned literary airs and poses and artifices , which you simply wonder at .

		It is in spite of these , and with all these defects , that it is so great and beauti - ful a book . ''

		We are quite disposed to admit that the book is both great and beautiful , although not exactly for the reasons advanced by our critic with a hobby .

		We should say rather that the book has these qualities because its author has had the ro - mantic training , and has kept to its essential method while at the same time gaining a firmer grasp upon the actualities of life .

		The religious bigotry of the provinces is the central theme of this remarkable story , and the problem is attacked in the bitterness of spirit that comes from close familiarity with a phase of life quite as characteristic of an
Iowa	LOCATION	vil - lage as of a Spanish town .

		The universality of the problem makes the book far more than a local study , and gives it a place among the half-dozen best works of modern Spanish fiction .

		BRIEFS osr NEW BOOKS .

		imaginary portraits ^ is art of a peculiarly delicate and of Sir Thomas More sympathetic kind by which a modern and his family .

		wr it e r is able not only to show us how to understand the past , but also to show us how the past understood itself .


Walter Pater	PERSON	and
Rob	PERSON	- ert
Browning	PERSON	have special gifts for painting these imaginary portraits ; but humbler writers , by a fic - tion of memoir or correspondence or journal , have also succeeded in drawing the great heroes as their contemporaries may be thought to have seen them . ''

		The Household of Sir
Thomas More	PERSON	, '' a work first published about the middle of the present century , belongs among the best things of this kind , although the author 's name , by her own choice , has remained almost unknown , not appearing on the title-page of any of the numerous editions through which the work has passed , nor even being included in the recent `` Dictionary of National Biography . ''

		In the Introduction to the new and beautiful edition just issued -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , the Rev.
W. H. Hutton	PERSON	,
B.D.	LOCATION	, supplies the very meagre information that the book came from the pen of Miss
Manning	PERSON	, and that '' almost all that her wishes suffer us to know is that she was sister of Mr.
William Oke Manning	PERSON	, to whom she affectionately dedicated the fourth edition of her work ; that she was never married ; and that she was a genuine student and an indefatigible writer on historical and literary subjects . ''

		The style of this book professing to be the journal of
Margaret	PERSON	, the eldest and best be - loved of Sir Thomas More 's daughters is in the quaint old English spelling and the prose forms of composition of the sixteenth century ; and every detail of the present handsome edition is in keeping with these characteristics .

		The illustrators Mr.
John Jellicoe	PERSON	and Mr.
Herbert Railton	PERSON	have im - bibed the spirit of the text ; and the reader , aided by their twenty-five illustrations , feels that he does indeed see the home of him who was called '' the best of all the English , '' with his family , in their habits as they lived .

		The volume of '' Ballads and Other Poems '' that completes the new '' Thistle '' edition of the works of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	-LRB- Scribner -RRB- brings with it a welcome surprise in the shape of nearly fifty hith - erto unpublished pieces of verse .

		Written for the most part during the past five or six years , and re - flecting the new and strange environment in which 82 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	,
Stevenson	PERSON	found , or nearly found , the peace of soul he so long had sought , these poems reveal to us his ripest thought upon the vast themes of human life and destiny .

		Their brave undaunted temper is noth - ing new to us , nor their frank acceptance of what - ever life might have in store .

		Reading these last poems , it becomes more difficult than ever to real - ize that the bright spirit that found expression in them has left us forever .

		Here is a noble and pathetic quatrain that would have been worthy of Lander : '' I have trod the upward and the downward slope ; I have endured and done in days before ; I have longed for all , and bid farewell to hope ; And I have lived and loved , and closed the door . ''

		A strain more characteristic of the author is found in the following song : '' Bright is the ring of words When the right man rings them , Fair the fall of songs When the singer sings them .

		Still they are carolled and said On wings they are carried After the singer is dead And the maker buried . ''

		Low as the singer lies In the field of heather , Songs of his fashion bring The swains together .

		And when the west is red With the sunset embers , The lover lingers and sings , And the maid remembers . ''

		One more brief illustration may be given a copy of verses written on the leper island of
Molokai	LOCATION	: '' To see the infinite pity of this place , The mangled limb , the devastated face , The innocent sufferer smiling at the rod A fool were tempted to deny his God .

		He sees , he shrinks .

		But if he gaze again ,
Lo	LOCATION	, beauty springing from the breast of pain !

		He marks the sisters on the mournful shores ; And even a fool is silent and adores . ''

		That most interesting and important A new Life of the , , r \ TT German Emperor , personage , the German Emperor , is the subject of the last number of the series of '' Public Men of To-day '' -LRB-
F. Warne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author , Mr.
Charles Lowe	PERSON	, has already written biographies of
Bismarck	PERSON	and
Alexander III.	PERSON	, and has shown in them excellent judgment and great famil - iarity with European politics .

		In the present vol - ume we see these qualities to even better advantage , for the critical balance is held more evenly ; the book shows full appreciation of the Emperor 's good qualities without the warping effect of the enthu - siastic admiration that marred the life of
Bismarck	LOCATION	.

		The author shows his journalistic training by the vividness with which he presents the many sides of
William	LOCATION	's character , but his style suffers from the constant effort to be vivid , as well as from too great a familiarity with German idiom and mode of expression .

		His figures are sometimes almost grotesque , and his choice of words extends from current slang to the recondite treasures of the un - abridged dictionary .

		But these are minor blem - ishes on an excellent presentation of the early life , training , and first seven years ' rule of an extraordi - nary man .

		As the author says , the life of a mon - arch so near the beginning of his reign must nec - essarily be a torso .

		For this reason he has chosen the descriptive rather than the critical method , and has presented the Emperor 's ideas and motives in the words of his own speeches .

		The picture shows
William	PERSON	's self-confidence , amounting to an assump - tion of infallibility on all subjects ; his extreme self - consciousness , his pride , restlessness , despotic ten - dencies , his almost insane fondness for his army and navy , his incessant speech-making and journeyings by land and sea .

		But it shows also his extraordi - nary energy , his versatility , his unceasing effort to keep the peace of
Europe	LOCATION	; it leaves on us the im - pression that beneath the froth of youthful vanity there are many solid qualities , though it may not persuade us to share the author 's conviction that
William	PERSON	is '' gifted with such a striking combina - tion of both mind and will as has distinguished no occupant of the Prussian throne since it was va - cated by Frederick the Great . ''

		The subjects of Mr.
George H. Ell	PERSON	- Danger 's six brief sketches , entitled collectively '' Idyllists of the Country Side '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , are
Izaak Walton	PERSON	and White of
Selborne	LOCATION	,
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	and
Richard Jeff	PERSON	cries , our own Thoreau and
Burroughs	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Ellwanger	PERSON	, like many other writers , is most enjoy - able when his language is simplest ; for he has a large vocabulary of odd and unusual words , and in reading a book of this sort one does not care to keep an etymological dictionary at hand .

		This love of words for their own sake has led to the fault of spreading his language , of needless repetition .

		Moreover , he does not always make himself quite clear , and his grammar is not immaculate .

		Not - withstanding these blemishes , however , the book is an entertaining one ; and although , as the author asserts , '' an unbounded love for nature and a poet 's eye ... are alone the gifts of the gods , '' yet we believe that the first , at least , which often lies dor - mant in those who are city born and bred , may be developed by much reading of the true nature - writers .

		If Mr.
Ellwanger	PERSON	shall have succeeded in drawing attention to some of these , his book has not been written in vain .

		Some literary portrait .

		** by
D. G. Mitchell	PERSON	.

		The third volume of Mr.
Donald G. Mitchell	PERSON	's '' English Lands , Letters , an -LRB- j King8 -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is not less readable than its two predecessors .

		Covering the period of Queen
Anne	PERSON	and the two
Georges	PERSON	, it includes , of course , some of the most interesting figures in
England	LOCATION	's literary history : the novelists ,
Richardson	PERSON	, Fielding ,
Miss Burney	LOCATION	,
Jane Austen	PERSON	,
Maria Edgeworth	PERSON	; the famous group of '' The Lit - erary Club , '' consisting of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	and his worshippers ; the poets
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	,
Cowper	PERSON	, and
Burns	PERSON	, and the illustrious company known as '' The Lake
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 83 Poets , '' with
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	, and Lamb as its central figures .

		One is again struck with Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's happy art of characterization , in noting how he succeeds in giving in a few lines a more vivid impression than the whole of some big biog - raphy furnishes .

		Take , for example , Miss Edge - worth : the entire two volumes of her recently pub - lished '' Life and Letters v contain no such clever analysis of her life and work as the five pages de - voted to her in this little book .

		In Miss
Florence A. Maccunn	ORGANIZATION	's brief `` Life of
John Knox	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- we have an admirable sketch of the work of the great Scottish reformer , of the Refor - mation in
Scotland	LOCATION	, and of the miserable failure of the brilliant
Mary Stuart	PERSON	as both queen and woman .

		The narrative moves straight on , with little of praise or denunciation , yet is so presented as to make the leading characters live before us , with their good and bad traits , their mistakes and their successes , and with their motives so far as their words or their acts have disclosed them .

		The grand and heroic qualities of
Knox	PERSON	are apprecia - tively set forth , but the other side is not hidden , the side that shows his arrogance , pride , ambi - tion , harsh cruelty , and personal hatreds .

		But with all his faults , we are shown his wonderful influence for good upon the character of the people of
Scot	PERSON	- land , perhaps a greater shaping influence than any other man has ever exercised over a whole nation .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The historical text-books of Professor
Philip Van Ness Myers	PERSON	have been favorably known to American teachers for many years .

		They certainly have no supe - riors for high school and college use , and it is doubtful if they are equalled by any of their competitors .

		Pro- fessor
Myers	PERSON	has now issued a '' History of
Greece	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , upon the general lines of his earlier treatment of the subject , but expanded to more than double the length .

		A Short History of
Greece	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
W. S. Robinson	PERSON	, is a work of perhaps half the com - pass of the preceding , sparingly illustrated , but trust - worthy and straightforward as to text .

		A number of the lesser known writings of
Defoe	PERSON	are collected in volumes fifteen and sixteen of the charming Dent-Macmillan edition of that author , and complete the publication .

		Our gratitude for this entirely satis - factory set of books should be shared about equally by the publishers , the learned editor , Mr.
George Aitken	PERSON	, and the skilful illustrator , Mr.

		The books form as pretty a series as has been seen for many a day .

		The publication of Parts 23 , 24 , and 25 of The Book of the Fair '' -LRB-

		These instalments discuss the special buildings of the foreign governments , with their contents , and the work of the World 's Con - gress Auxiliary .

		A chapter follows on '' Results , Awards , and Incidents , '' and then comes a final chapter on the
California Midwinter International Exposition	ORGANIZATION	, which was in some respects an offshoot of the
Chicago Fair	ORGANIZATION	.

		An index completes the work , bringing it up to an even thousand pages .

		We congratulate Mr.
Bancroft	PERSON	and his associates upon their work .

		The publication is not without some minor defects , but is , on the whole , ex - tremely creditable , and very fully accomplishes its pur - pose .

		Professor
C. F. Bastable	PERSON	's work on
Public Finance	ORGANIZATION	'' is so well known to students of the subject that little need be said of the new edition recently published -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- beyond remarking that the author 's revision has brought the work fully up to date , adding many new facts and figures , new chapters on `` The Maxims of Taxation '' and `` Death Duties , '' and a new subject - index .

		Even so recent a matter as the abortive income - tax law enacted by our last
Congress	ORGANIZATION	is brought into the discussion , and offers only one among many illustra - tions of the timeliness of the new publication .

		The '' Arden ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, published by
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a new series of texts for school use .

		It is aimed in this edition '' to present the greater plays of the dramatist in their literary aspect , and not merely as material for the study of philology or grammar . ''

		This is the best of theories upon which to prepare a set of the plays , and the names of the editors inspire con - fidence .

		The volumes thus far published include '' Ham - let '' and '' Macbeth , '' both edited by Mr.

Slade Professor of Fine Art in Cambridge University	ORGANIZATION	is pub - lished in a neat volume of 130 odd pages , by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Waldstein	PERSON	, treating his theme from the three standpoints of the production , the en - joyment , and the understanding of art , sketches what may be considered an ideal scheme of organization for university art study .

		The book is a most useful and suggestive one ; and its point of view is timely . ''

		Washington a Model in his Library and Life '' -LRB-
Young & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the outcome of a lecture by Dr.
Eliphalet Nott Potter	PERSON	, now extended and arranged in four parts .

		Dr.
Potter	PERSON	has not the gift of clear and sys - tematic presentation , but he has gathered together some good material concerning
Washington	LOCATION	's books and his way of regarding them and using them .

		Several times the author touches on an attractive topic the present whereabouts of
Washington	LOCATION	's books ; and it is to be hoped that he will be able to carry out his plan for treating this subject fully and in detail .

		We have frequently had occasion to commend the '' University '' series of manuals , designed for the uses of the general reader and university extension student , and their excellence has often suggested the painful contrast that exists between these books and most of the books written for a similar purpose by an Ameri - can scholar .

		Their aim '' is to educate rather than to inform '' this is the keynote of their success , and the index of the contrast that we have suggested .

		Mr.
J. W. Mackail	PERSON	's '' Latin Literature '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , just added to the series , is one of the best of them all a really 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, intelligent and delicately critical account of the whole subject within moderate compass .

		It is the work of a pupil of the late
William Sellar	PERSON	, reflects much of the inspiration of his method , and may be unreservedly com - mended .

		A trip to the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	offers an American the happiest means of escaping from the severity of a North - ern winter , and the number of persons taking such a trip grows yearly .

		Under the title of '' The Mediterranean Trip '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , Mr.
Noah Brooks	PERSON	has prepared a brief guide-book for the use of travellers , including the
Azores	LOCATION	and
Madeira	LOCATION	in the itinerary .

		The book is useful as far as it goes , but it has the fault of most American guide-books in failing to give the exact and detailed information that one is so sure to find in his
Baedeker	LOCATION	.

		Again , illustrations in such a book are an impertinence where maps are lacking , and with maps this book is most pitifully supplied .

		To give the traveller a photo - graph of
Athens	LOCATION	when he wants a diagram of the streets is like giving stones for bread a fact that can not be too strongly impressed upon the consciousness of most guide-book makers .

		It is safe to say that no prettier book for children has been published this season than '' The Arabella and Araminta Stories , '' just issued by
Messrs. Copeland & Day	ORGANIZATION	.

		The stories are by Miss
Gertrude Smith	PERSON	, and they are embellished by fifteen illustrative designs , the work of
Miss Ethel Reed	ORGANIZATION	.

		A charming introductory poem by Miss
Mary E. Wilkins	PERSON	gives the book the hap - piest kind of a send-off .

		The title-page describes the book as belonging to the '' Yellow Hair Library , '' which indicates , we trust , that it is the forerunner of others of like design . ''

		Brown
Heath	PERSON	and Blue Bells '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a dainty booklet of Scottish travel-sketches from the pen of Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	, forms a welcome addition to that graceful writer 's familiar series ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's
England	LOCATION	, '' '' Gray Days and Gold , '' and '' Old Shrines and Ivy . ''

		The new volume contains , in addition to the twelve Scottish sketches , a half-dozen fugitive papers on various themes , besides several personal tributes -LRB- to Doctor
Holmes	PERSON	,
George Arnold	PERSON	,
Fitz-James O'Brien	PERSON	,
Jefferson	PERSON	, etc. -RRB- , added , the author says , '' with the feel - ing that admiration for fine spirits may fitly consort with remembrance of beautiful scenes . ''

		The merits of Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's delicate and lucid prose are familiar to our readers ; and we need only say of the present vol - ume that it fulfils the fair promise of its predecessors .

		A book of French Folly in Maxims '' -LRB-
Brentano	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a collection of seven hundred sayings , more or less epi - grammatic , gathered from the literature which is most happy in such utterances , and translated and edited by
Henri Pene	PERSON	du Bois .

		The names of
Jules Janin	PERSON	, Co - quelin ,
Paul Bourget	PERSON	,
Alexandre Dumas	PERSON	fils ,
Francisque Sarcey	PERSON	,
Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	,
Joubert	PERSON	,
Chateaubriand	LOCATION	,
Pierre Loti	PERSON	, Sainte-Beuve ,
Ferdinand Brunetiere	PERSON	,
Victor Hugo	PERSON	are an evidence that there is something beside '' Folly '' in these pages ; neither is the sub-title `` Of the Stage '' strictly descriptive .

		The Rev.
S. Humphreys Gurteen	PERSON	's volume on The Arthurian Epic '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a somewhat unscholarly attempt to trace the development of the Arthurian stories from their inception to the '' Idylls of the King . ''

		The writer is quite unfamiliar with modern investiga - tions on his subject , and the historical part of his book is therefore not to be treated seriously .

		The extended comparison between
Tennyson	PERSON	and that poet 's predeces - sors in Arthurian fields resolves itself into this : when
Tennyson	PERSON	follows
Walter Map	PERSON	's lead , he is right ; .

		when he strikes out for himself , he is inartistic .

		The criti - cism of ''
Merlin	PERSON	and
Vivien	PERSON	'' is a fair sample of Mr.
Gurteen	PERSON	's critical range .

		The poem is roundly scored on Christian grounds because
Tennyson	PERSON	did not make
Vivien	PERSON	the `` female Galahad '' that
Walter Map	PERSON	in - tended her to be .

		Then follows several pages of proof that ''
Vivien	PERSON	of the Idylls no longer retains this char - acter '' !

		Further comment is unnecessary .

		LITERARY NOTES .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons have reissued Mr.
Con	PERSON	- way 's edition of Paine 's '' Rights of Man '' in a separate volume . ''

		Yeast '' and The Water Babies '' are the latest addi - tions to the
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	'' Pocket Edition '' of
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	's novels .

		The memoirs of Mr.
Locker-Lampson	PERSON	, edited by his son-in-law , Mr.
Augustine Birrell	PERSON	, will shortly appear under the title of '' My Confidences . ''

		Volume X. of the Gibbings-Lippincott edition of
Smollett	PERSON	's novels , containing '' The Adventures of Sir
Launcelot Greaves	PERSON	, '' has just been published .

		Messrs.
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	send us a new edition of Mr.
Arthur Waugh	PERSON	's ''
Alfred	PERSON	,
Lord Tennyson	PERSON	, '' the most satisfactory life of the poet yet published . ''

		Ursole Mirouet , '' translated by Mrs.
Hamilton Bell	PERSON	, has just been added to the Dent-Macmillan edition of Balzac . ''

		Old Goriot '' will be the next volume .

		The
United States Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	reprints in two paper - covered volumes its well-known editions of '' The Prose Dramas of
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	, '' including eight of the mod - ern plays , translated by various hands .

		The long-promised
Life of Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	, by his pupil and associate
Jules Marcou	PERSON	, is about ready for publication by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		They will also issue im - mediately ''
England	LOCATION	's Darling , and Other Poems , '' by the new laureate .

		Lord
Beaconsfield	ORGANIZATION	's ''
Sybil	PERSON	, '' and Captain Marryatt 's ''
Peter Simple	PERSON	'' are the latest works to be reprinted in the
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	edition of standard English fiction .

		Mr.
H. D. Traill	PERSON	and Mr.
David Hannay	PERSON	write introductions for the respective volumes .

		A chapter on '' The Mercantile System , '' translated from Professor Schmoller 's ''
Wirthschaftliche Politik Friedrichs	ORGANIZATION	des Grossen , '' is the latest addition to Pro- fessor
Ashley	PERSON	's series of '' Economic Classics , '' published by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		That clever politico-military brochure , '' The Battle of Dorking , '' is reprinted in pamphlet form by
Messrs. Way & Williams	ORGANIZATION	.

		Older readers will recall its remark - able vogue in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	on its first appear - ance twenty-five years ago , and the drift of current events seems to make its reappearance hardly less timely and pertinent .

		The Rev.
J. L. Spalding	PERSON	, Bishop of
Peoria	LOCATION	, has pub - lished through Messrs.
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	a volume of '' Songs Chiefly from the German . ''

		The work of translation is gracefully done , reproducing much of the feeling and beauty of the originals .

		An index of authors is lacking to the volume , for which defect we find it difficult to account .

		A second volume of the selection of '' Lyrical Poetry 1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 85 from the Bible , '' made by Mr.
Ernest Rhys	PERSON	, has just appeared with the Dent-Macmillan imprint .


Eccles	PERSON	- iastes , the Song of Songs , the Prophetic Books , and the Gospel of
St. Luke	LOCATION	are drawn upon for the contents of this volume , which thus supplements the earlier selec - tion from the Psalter and Job .

		A new edition of Professor
A. E. Dolbear	PERSON	's '' Matter , Ether , and Motion '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- contains three chapters hitherto unpublished , and embodies several corrections of the former text .

		The note of mysticism , apparent in the earlier edition , is still more pronounced in this revision , and puts the book , in part , into the category of metaphysical publications .

		The progress of specialization in physical science has a striking illustration in the newest periodical publica - tion of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a quarterly devoted to '' Terrestrial Magnetism , '' and the subject gives it a title .

		It is published under the auspices of the
Ryerson Physical Laboratory	ORGANIZATION	, with much learned American and European collaboration .

		The '' Journal of Pedagogy , '' published quarterly at
Binghamton	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, is in appearance an unpreten - tious periodical , but it takes high rank among our edu - cational reviews .

		Its contents are varied and dignified , while its editorial comment is serious in tone , advocat - ing , as it does , progressive and praiseworthy ideals .

		No teacher who adds this excellent paper to his list will regret having done so . ''

		The National Review '' has never been as well known in this country as the other three great English month - lies , partly because no effort has been made to distribute it , and partly because it has not had quite the power of its older contemporaries to secure the services of the greatest writers .

		But for all that , it is an excellent and readable periodical , and we note with pleasure that it is now supplied to American subscribers by the publisher , Mr.
Edward Arnold	PERSON	, who has recently established a branch office on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	. ''

		The Auk , '' which is the official organ of the Amer - ican Ornithologists ' Union , enters upon the thirteenth volume of its new series with the
January	DATE	number .

		It is one of the most creditable scientific periodicals that we have , and is of interest to more than ornithologists , unless we may give that name to all interested in birds .

		Publication is quarterly , and each issue contains a highly-attractive colored plate .

		Mr.
L. S. Foster	PERSON	, 35 Pine street ,
New York	LOCATION	, is the publisher , as well as the agent of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	for all its other publications .

		The July-September number of the '' American Jour - nal of Archaeology , '' just published , contains three pa - pers of the
American School of Classical Studies	ORGANIZATION	at
Athens	LOCATION	, an account of '' Some Sculptures from Koptos in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, '' an article , by the Rev.
John P. Peters	PERSON	, on '' Excavations at Nippur , '' and a rich miscellany of '' Archaeological News . ''

		Two of the
American School	ORGANIZATION	papers are by Mr.
Edward Capps	PERSON	, of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, and treat , respectively , of the chorus in the later Greek drama , and of recent excavations at
Eretria	LOCATION	.

		The '' Journal '' is published quarterly by the Prince -
ton University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		On the 25th of
January	DATE	, news was received in this country of the death of
Alexander Macmillan	PERSON	, the younger of the two brothers who founded the great publishing house that bears their name .

		He was seventy years of age at the time of his death , and had retired ten years previously from active participation in the business .

		He made two visits to this country , the sec - ond , in
1869	DATE	, leading to the establishment of the Amer - ican branch of the house .

		The business is now left in the hands of his two sons ,
Frederick	PERSON	and
Maurice	PERSON	, of
George	PERSON	, his nephew , of Mr.
George L. Craik	PERSON	, and of Mr.
George P. Brett	PERSON	, the latter of these gentlemen representing the firm in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		An American observer can - not help marking the close coincidence of this death with that of the senior member of the house of
Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Morley Roberts	PERSON	, whom some of our readers may possibly know as the writer of a few fairly clever short stories , has voiced in '' The
Saturday	DATE	Review '' his indig - nant protest against what he calls the '' whining appeal to the authors of the United States '' framed by Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	on behalf of the
London	LOCATION
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is kind enough to put aside the point , '' which could be strongly urged , that there are no authors to appeal to on the other side of the
Western Ocean	LOCATION	, '' but can not rest under the imputation of having been in any way concerned in such a demonstration of friendliness and good-will . ''

		Those who sign this precious paper go on to say that we are proud of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Sir , we might be proud of them ; but to say that we are proud of them is to speak most disingenuously .

		Who can be proud of our connection with a politically corrupt and financially rotten country , with no more than a poor minority vainly striving for health ?

		... If our liter - ature is the only bond between us and this most ill - mannered country , it may be time for us to repudiate American copyright before the Americans repudiate it .

		But literature is no real bond , because not one
Ameri	PERSON	- can in a thousand , no , not one in ten thousand , has had his manners made less brutal by the most casual ac - quaintance with it . ''

		Bravo , Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	!

		If we have not heard of you before , we have heard of you now , and are not likely to forget the lesson in international amen - ity conveyed by the courteous phrases of your disclaimer .

		The first number of ''
Cosmopolis	LOCATION	'' has reached us , and amply fulfils our expectations .

		It is a monthly review in the three culture-languages , English , French , and German , published by Mr.
Fisher Unwin	PERSON	.

		Each number is to contain 320 pages , so that the purchaser really gets a good-sized English magazine , a good-sized French one , and a good-sized German one , all within the same covers .

		Among the contents of this
January	DATE	issue are the beginnings of serials by
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	and Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	; an acute critical study of `` Othello , '' by Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	; a piece of pure litera - ture in the shape of '' Le Chanteur de KymeY ' by
M. Anatole France	PERSON	; an essay on the Roman death-penalty , by Professor
Mommsen	PERSON	, and papers by
Herr Spielhagen	PERSON	, Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	, Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	,
M. Edouard Rod	ORGANIZATION	,
M. Francisque Sarcey	PERSON	, and several others .

		Besides these leading articles , there are series of '' chronicles '' which constitute perhaps the most noticeable feature of the publication .

		The political chronicles will appear monthly , one for each country ; the three dramatic chron - icles are to be written tri-monthly ; while the literary chronicles will be bi-monthly for
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, monthly for
France	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	and
M. Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	are the literary chroniclers for
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	.

		We understand that occasional chronicles from other countries will appear , thus giving the sub - scribers to this periodical a fair conspectus of what is .

		going on throughout the world of politics , literature , and art .

		We have long wished that someone would undertake such a publication as ''
Cosmopolis	LOCATION	, '' and we heartily welcome the enterprise .

$ 2.50	MONEY	. ''


Palmyra	LOCATION	is chiefly known for its ruins and its traditions of
Zenobia	LOCATION	's illustrious reign .

		To both of these Dr.
Wright	PERSON	does more justice than is commonly expected from travellers ' tales .

		He has occupied himself with original research and the study of inscriptions so that his narrative has a very different style from that of the vapid second-hand and tenth-rate literature of the majority of unprofessional travellers .

		Much enter - tainment as well as much information may be found in this modest volume . ''

		A vivid picture of the
Palmyra	LOCATION	of the present day .

		He has never been quite so successful as in his last book .

		Those who know most about
Palmyra	LOCATION	and
Zenobia	PERSON	acknowledge that this is the standard work on the theme one which can never be ignored when the subject is discussed .

		121 A UNIVERSITY SYMPOSIUM .

		The rapid growth of some of our larger uni - versities has given much prominence , during the past few years , to the question whether they should retain their present form of organ - ization , simply expanding upon the old lines , or seek to reconstruct themselves upon a basis better fitted to meet the needs of their enlarged bodies of undergraduate students .

		In other words , it has become a serious question to de - cide whether the system which has worked so admirably in dealing with hundreds should not give place to some system planned with express reference to the wants of thousands .

		In trying to answer such a question , we naturally look to the Old World , where universities with thou - sands of students are not uncommon , and ask if some modification made with the best
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean models in view may not be worth under - taking in the case of our own larger institutions .

		In this survey of the problem as it exists else - where than in the
United States	LOCATION	, attention is , of course , chiefly attracted to
Germany	LOCATION	and to
England	LOCATION	to the former country , because so many of our educators have got their training and inspiration there ; to the latter because it is a priori probable that the main trunk of the English race has developed the university ideals most likely to find acceptance in any commu - nity the offshoot of that race .

		The
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post , '' in a recent issue , presents a very interesting account of the English uni - versity system , written with reference to its possible adoption , or rather adaptation , in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		This account is accompanied by a collection of views expressed by members of the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and
Yale	ORGANIZATION	faculties , examining the subject in its general aspects , as well as from a number of special standpoints .

		While these expressions of opinion are far from ap - proaching unanimity , they make it evident that the existence of a very real and pressing prob - lem is felt , and that the English university system , or certain features thereof , may turn out to offer us the best solution .

		The feeling at
Harvard	LOCATION	, more noticeably than the feeling at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, seems to favor the English idea , with - out , however , giving any countenance to the notion that an acceptance en bloc of the En -
96	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, glish plan of organization would be either prac - ticable or desirable .

		To begin our discussion with a few figures , the latest statistics show an enrolment of
3358	DATE	students in the
Oxford	LOCATION	colleges and halls , of
2795	DATE	students in the
Cambridge	LOCATION	colleges and hostels .

		Against these figures we may set
3600	DATE	, the total enrolment at
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, and
2415	DATE	, the total enrolment at
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The problem is , then , quantitatively much the same in both countries .

		At the English uni - versities , these six thousand odd students are members of something like forty colleges , each having its own foundation , its own buildings , its own corps of instructors , and its own dis - cipline .

		Trinity at
Cambridge	LOCATION	has over six hundred students ; no other college at either university has as many as three hundred , and a dozen or more have less than one hundred each .

		We need hardly add the information that the colleges have nothing to do with honors or degrees , except to prepare candidates for these distinctions , as awarded respectively by the
University Senate	ORGANIZATION	at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and Con - vocation at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		In our two American universities , on the other hand , half of the stu - dents are enrolled in the special or professional schools -LRB- which to a certain extent embody the English college idea -RRB- , while the other half be - long to
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	and
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	,
1199	DATE	to the former ,
1771	DATE	to the latter .

		The central difficulty is in these two overgrown col - leges , still organized upon a plan admirably adapted to the hundreds of a generation ago , but not equal to the demands made by the greatly increased numbers of the present .

		It will be seen that this educational diffi - culty is analogous to the political difficulty with which the larger centralized governments of to-day are forced to contend .

		The French Re - public , for example , or the English monarchy , suffers in a hundred ways from over-centrali - zation .

		A system that was once fairly adequate is found sadly wanting in this age of multiplied special interests and local self-assertion .

		The elasticity of the federal system , as displayed in the
United States	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
Switzerland	LOCATION	, stands in striking contrast to the rigidity of the system which heaps all the work of govern - ment , in matters both large and small , upon the shoulders of a single set of officials .

		Many a philosophical observer in
France	LOCATION	or
England	LOCATION	, while not blind to the faults of the federal or - ganization of the
United States	LOCATION	, has cast long - ing glances in our direction , and recognized the fact that our Federal system , in spite of the imperfections of its working-out , embodies the political ideal toward which the larger gov - ernments of the world are inevitably tending .

		This is the real explanation of such experi - ments in English politics as county and parish councils , and even of the mismanaged Home Rule movement .

		That movement failed , as it deserved to fail , because it aimed to institute local government in but a single part of the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	, and because it sought to be - stow a dangerous degree of political power upon the people of
Ireland	LOCATION	; but the decentralizing principle upon which the movement was based is a sound one , and so profound an observer as
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	gave frequent testimony to its validity .

		Applying our analogy to the educa - tional question now under discussion , it will readily be seen that the English university rep - resents the federal type of organization , while the American university illustrates the central - ized system , once entirely adequate , but now so overgrown as to have become unstable from its own weight .

		And just as it would be theo - retically possible for the English government to transform itself into an artificial reproduc - tion of the system which in the
United States	LOCATION	has been a product of natural growth , so it would be theoretically possible for
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, let us say , to create a system of colleges corresponding , in most of the essential respects , to the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	colleges which began as independent foundations , and afterwards be - came merged in the aggregate which is known as the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		This , stated in terms of the broadest general - ization , is the question which has now reached , both at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, the stage of discus - sion in which an ideal becomes something more than a mere counsel of perfection , and is brought within the range of the practicable .

		A thoughtful paper by the late
Frank Bolles	PERSON	may be said to have set the ball of discussion rolling , and the expressions of opinion now brought together by the '' Evening Post '' sym - posium show us the discussion in its present state .

		The more conservative find many diffi - culties in the way of reorganization upon the college basis .

		Their objections relate mainly to discipline , the division of endowment funds , the duplication of teaching , and the weaken - ing of loyalty to the university .

		These objec - tions are all worth considering , but it is evi - dent that no one of them offers an obstacle to reform in the nature of the case insuperable .

		And it is equally evident that some sort of com - promise in all of these matters would be found
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 97 necessary .

		As one of the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	instructors puts it , there can be no question of adopting the English system as a whole , but only a question of adapting its best features to our own use .

		In the matter of discipline , our universities now occupy a middle ground between the '' mo - nastic '' English methods and the extreme freedom allowed to students in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		If an improvement is to be made here , it should probably be in the English rather than the Ger - man direction , but need not go to the extent of '' gating '' and compulsory chapel .

		As far as the question of endowments is concerned , it should not be impossible or even extremely dif - ficult to make an equitable allotment to the several colleges , should such be organized .

		The division of teaching should probably not be carried nearly as far as at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and Cam - bridge , both because the expense of the En - glish system is very great , and because the range of the student under that system is un - necessarily narrowed to the courses he can get within the walls of his own college .

		A wise adjustment of this matter of teaching would go far to remove whatever force there may be in the argument that the English system stimu - lates loyalty to the college at the expense of loyalty to the university .

		On the whole , the subject seems to be one eminently open to discussion , with the balance of argument inclining a little toward the col - lege idea .

		The positive pleas made for that idea are forcible , to say the least .

		The pres - ent system is said to result in something like '' social chaos , '' under which , as Mr.
Bolles	PERSON	wrote , a man might possibly be '' a living , hop - ing despairing part of
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	, '' eating , sleeping , studying alone , and `` not even hav - ing the privilege of seeing his administrative officers without having to explain to them who he is and what he is . ''

		This plaint is amplified with a good deal of force by the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	cor - respondent of the '' Evening Post , '' who uses the following language : '' Plainly , the old - fashioned idea of a student 's benefiting by contact with and the example of his teachers and officers outside the lecture-rooms is at pres - ent relegated to the past , and the proof of that , if any were needed , is to be found in the utter - ances of graduates of thirty or forty years ago in regard to their teachers , as compared with those of graduates of recent years .

		One hears , too , constant complaint that the men are liv - ing their lives in smaller groups , coming less and less into contact with one another , and so leaving
Cambridge	LOCATION	with a narrower point of view than a university-bred man should have , while the class organization and fraternal feel - ing , long since killed by the elective system of studies and the large number of students , is soon to be definitely buried by the inevitable adoption of a three-years course in some form or other . ''

		It may be worth while , in closing this presentation of an interesting discussion , to call attention to the fact that the organization of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	carries the division of faculties and student-bodies a little farther than it is carried elsewhere , and that the several '' halls , '' which constitute one of the most dis - tinctive features of this institution , are , to a limited extent at least , like the colleges of an English university .

		That is , they provide a cer - tain amount of discipline and self-government , of personal relation between students and in - structors , and of social intercourse ; and , in so far as they provide these things , they approach the type that the advocates of the English col - lege system have in mind .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		THE PROBLEM OF THE `` YOUNG PERSON '' IN LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The problem of the freedom of literary expression is , as THE DIAL intimates in its last issue , a '' vexatious '' one ; but I think it must be more clearly apprehended that its vexatiousness lies largely in the fact that it is distinctly a two-fold problem : first , as to the scope of literary art ; and second , as to its dissemination , or , in other terms , the problem of the '' Young Person . ''

		As to the first problem , we must remark that literary art , like all art , was in its origin lyric and hortatory ; the love-song proceeded from and excited to love , the war-story was the expression of and incitement to war .

		And , in fact , every representation by early art was avowedly to stimulate the action represented , and so if the action was evil , the art also was evil .

		But while lit - erary art was primitively excitement and incitement , in our day it has attained a high degree of dramatic and psychological objectivity , and even depicts innocently and artistically the coarsest sexuality .

		Thus , Zola deals with the most licentious subjects without allure , but with com - plete artistic objectivity . ''

		La Terre , '' for instance , is a powerfully artistic realization of the typical force and significance of the coarsest peasant sexuality , which is invested with a certain large aesthetic interest compar - able in its kind with that which
Millet	ORGANIZATION	's paintings throw about the peasant as sodden toiler .

		But Zola should make the history of the typical prurient reader of his works the subject for a novel .

		Every fact , then , so general as to be of typical sig - nificance , objective art can dignify and glorify .

		Art sounds all the depths as well as all the heights of life ; it treats impartially the lowest animalism and the gross - est crime , as well as the loftiest aspiration and the no - blest endeavor .

		The '' -LRB- Edipus Tyrannus '' of Sopho - 98 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, cles , the '' Cenci '' of
Shelley	PERSON	, the '' La Terre '' of Zola , are as truly works of art as the '' Paradiso '' of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, the '' Imitation '' of
Thomas d Kempis	PERSON	, or Banyan 's '' Pilgrim 's Progress . ''

		Purely artistic appreciation of any of these carries no influence on the actions and life .

		Objective art is separate from life ; it is a life of its own , which stands wholly without the life it feeds on ; to it , all is spectacle .

		But we come now to the second side of the problem : whether the dissemination of all literary art should be as universal as its scope .

		It is an obvious fact , and , indeed , a sad one , that art is mostly used for unartistic enjoyment , to stir every passion and emotion but the aesthetic .

		Anyone who watches , for instance , the crowds at the theatres , must feel this to be true .

		And so all art , literary , graphic , musical , as well as dramatic , is continually diverted from its true purpose , and is made to minister to reality rather than ideality .

		That the art of a novelist is thus swerved is not that artist 's fault ; that people read '' La Terre '' and '' Jude the Obscure '' to stimulate their passions rather than their aesthetic natures , does not , from one point of view , attach blame to the writers .

		Still , these novelists may well ask whether they should not respect the weakness of the grand majority to whom their writings may come , or whether other and less dangerous subjects may not give full development to their creativeness .

		Goethe knew well the universal scope of art , but he did not publish his freest productions , keeping them only for a few ap - preciative friends .

		Zola appears to be an honest artist , but his novels , spread broadcast , have sown great cor - ruption .

		Readers in general are unable to attain the free and calm objective spirit which such art demands ; with them , art is the servant of reality ; with them , the thought of evil becomes an evil thought .

		While to most the thought of murder may not be a murderous thought , yet the thought of lust is a lustful thought .

		It may be a reflection on our civilization , but it is still an un - doubted fact , that though society has got beyond the danger-point as regards such a homicidal novel as
Sien	PERSON	- kiewicz 's '' Fire and Sword , '' it yet feels most evil effects from such lustful novels as Zola 's '' La Terre . ''

		While we acknowledge that Zolaism , as the art which flinches not at any human animalism and sexualism , has a cer - tain theoretical vindication , yet we must consider its general circulation extremely noxious .

		It is a bit of stubborn Philistinism to decry real art of any kind , but it is a matter of common-sense to keep art away from those who will only misuse it .

		EMERSON 'S IDEAS OF TEACHING LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Students of the biographies of great authors must have been reminded many times that the curricula of colleges and universities were not adapted to the minds of expanding genius .

		Turning aside from the college courses , they have often had their souls kindled and their imagination aroused by the reading of the best literature , or , as was the case with
Wordsworth	PERSON	, have found in Nature joy and inspiration .

		This can not be explained by saying that genius must educate itself , this is begging the question ; genius demands life , and this is what universities have not given them in many cases .

		Tennyson found more interest in attending the meetings of the
Water Club	ORGANIZATION	, where he and those gifted young men talked '' on mind , and art , and labor , and the changing mart , '' than he did in the
Cambridge	LOCATION	curri - culum .

		What is true of authors has been true of many men of less power ; this is what those who plead for the study of literature in colleges to-day are striving to ob - viate they are striving to bring into the lines of col - lege men that larger inspiration that comes from a study of the works of imagination .

		While many men of genius have felt this lack of inspiration ,
Emerson	PERSON	felt and expressed it in words that have in them the very force of the great emanci - pator .

		He experienced the need of it in his own life .

		He has told us of the '' idle books under the bench at the
Latin School	LOCATION	, '' and many of his fellow-students have left us accounts of his extensive reading while at Har - vard .

		He knew less about text-books than many , but a great deal more about
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Bacon	LOCATION	, and
Milton	LOCATION	.

		He was a '' dunce in mathematics , '' but could '' console himself with
Chaucer	PERSON	and Montaigne , with
Plutarch	PERSON	and
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, at night . ''

		From his earliest days he lived in the atmosphere of literature , although he was very far from letting any books he might read take away the original bent of his own mind .

		He was a creative reader ; following his own advice along that line admir - ably , he was as far removed as possible from mere re - ceptive reading .

		Having graduated at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	,
Emerson	PERSON	became an associate with his brother
William	PERSON	in a school for young ladies .

		Many years afterwards , in speaking to some of his old pupils , he expressed a deep regret for two things that had happened while he was a teacher . ''

		The first is that my teaching was partial and external .

		I was at the very time already writing every night , in my cham - ber , my first thoughts on morals and the beautiful laws of compensation and of individual genius , which to ob - serve and illustrate have given sweetness to many years of my life .

		I am afraid no hint of this ever came into the school , where we clung to the safe and cold details of languages , geography , arithmetic , and chemistry .

		Now I believe that each should serve the other by his or her strength , not by their weakness , and that , if I could have had an hour of deep thought at that time , I could have engaged in thoughts that would have given reality and depth and joy to the school , and raised all the details to the highest pleasure and nobleness .

		Then I should have shown you -LRB- as I did afterwards to later friends -RRB- the poems and works of imagination I de - lighted in ; the single passages which have made some men immortal .

		The sharing of a joy of this kind makes teaching a liberal and delicious art .

		What I wonder at is that I did not read to you , and attempt to teach you to read certain selections of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and the poets , in which in late years I have had a certain degree of success . ''

		* Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	tells us that when
Emerson	PERSON	was teach - ing at
Chelmsford	LOCATION	, somewhat later , '' one of his modes of instruction was to give the boys a piece of reading to carry home with them , from some book like
Plu	ORGANIZATION	- tarch 's Lives , and the next day to examine them and find out how much they retained from their reading . ''

		It is no wonder that these boys found in him a great inspiration .

		In
August , 1838	DATE	,
Emerson	PERSON	made the opening address at the
American Institute of Education	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The * This may account for the fact that
Emerson	PERSON	was not a happy teacher , rather , '' a hopeless schoolmaster , '' as he called himself .

		How many teachers there are to-day worrying their lives out teaching grammar and rules of composition , to say nothing of other dry-as-dust , when they might be leading the young into the enjoyment of the life of literature .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 99 subject was , '' The best mode of inspiring a correct taste in English literature . ''

		I give Mr.
Cabot	PERSON	's account of the lecture : '' The leading thought was that since all the colleges in the world can not make one scholar , any more than the physician can make one drop of blood , those who are to supervise education must not expect much from ingenious methods or urgent appeals , but should aim to awaken in those under their charge the sense of their own powers and their particular voca - tion , and in the way of instruction acquaint them with the wealth of their mother-tongue , as the best means for calling out their capabilities , whatever these may be .

		The first step towards a revolution in our state of society , would be to impress men 's minds with the fact that the purest pleasures of life are at hand , unknown to them ; that whilst all manner of miserable books swarm like flies , the fathers of counsel and of heroism ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	, and
Taylor	PERSON	, lie neglected .

		As to method , would you inspire in a young man a taste for Chaucer and
Bacon	PERSON	?

		Quote them . ''

		This last advice sounds rery much like the words of Dr.
Corson	PERSON	in '' The Aims of Literary Study , '' and can be readily understood by all those who have ever heard that great teacher read the classic pieces of English literature .

		In
1864	DATE	Emerson delivered an address on university education .

		After speaking of defects in the educational system at that time , and anticipating the elective sys - tem of modern times , he says : `` Then the imagination must be addressed .

		Why always coast on the surface , and never open the interior of nature not by science , which is surface still , but by poetry .

		Shakespeare should be a study in the colleges , as
Boccaccio	PERSON	was appointed in
Florence	LOCATION	to lecture on
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		The students should be educated not only in the intelligence of , but in sym - pathy with , the thoughts of the great poets .

		Let us have these warblings as well as logarithms . ''

		Emerson had a faith that everyone is capable of some interest in literature .

		A great number of his lectures were on the subject of English Literature .

		Who can tell how much he accomplished , in
New England	LOCATION	and elsewhere , in the way of spiritualizing the lives of people by bring - ing them in contact with the best literature , and who can calculate what will be the good to come from the sympathetic study of literature in the colleges of Amer - ica , not the study of philology , nor the study of criti - cisms on literature , but the literature itself ?

		MODERX NAVAL , WARFARE .

		* Naval men and general readers interested in current naval problems will find in Mr.
H. W. Wilson	PERSON	's new volume , '' Ironclads in Action , '' a most useful and informing book .

		The au - thor 's aim has been to present , with fair detail and with constant reference to the technical value and bearing of the facts narrated , a sketch of naval warfare during the period of transi - tion which has followed the introduction of steam that is to say , from
1855	DATE	, when ar - mored ships were first tested in action -LRB- at
Kinburn	ORGANIZATION	in the
Crimea	LOCATION	-RRB- and the history of the ironclad may be said to have begun .

		The ques - tions which agitate the naval world to-day are , despite the practical teachings of the past two years , largely open ones , and must remain so until brought to the crucial test of a great sea - fight , or a series of them , between two first - class maritime powers .

		As Lord
Salisbury	PERSON	said recently : '' In respect to armaments , nobody yet knows what the torpedo will do in actual warfare .

		Nobody yet knows which is the more important , the big ironclad or the swift cruiser .

		These things can only be decided by experience .

		You can obtain for any particular opinion any collection of expert authority you wish to get ... '' While , however , the world 's experience of naval warfare has been small -LRB- perhaps distressingly so , from the professional standpoint -RRB- since the advent of steam and armor , material for induc - tion is not wholly lacking ; and this material the reader will find intelligently sifted and ar - ranged , and attractively set forth , in the work before us .

		In his Introduction , Captain
A. T. Mahan	PERSON	emphasizes his approval of Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- son 's book by laying down the principle that , even in the present period of transition , exper - iment , and rapid development , it is to history , rather than to theorizing and the tests of the proving-ground , that the naval profession should chiefly look for guidance . ''

		Scanty indications there obtained are worth much more than the most carefully arranged programme , in which the elements of actual danger , of perplexity re - sulting from anxious doubt , of the confusion and chances of real battle , can not be efficaciously represented . ''

		Nearly two-thirds of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's opening volume are devoted to the naval operations of our Civil War , including an instructive chap - * IRONCLADS IN ACTION : A

		In Volume II .

		the author , after a brief resume of the French naval operations in
Tunis	LOCATION	and the
East	LOCATION	, proceeds to give a detailed critical account of the maritime phases of the recent struggle in the
Orient	LOCATION	.

		The opening action off Asan and the subsequent sinking of the transport Kowshing by the Japanese cruiser
Naniwa	ORGANIZATION	are vividly described , as is the memor - able , if not very instructive , fight off the mouth of the
Yalu	LOCATION	.

		A thoughtful chapter is devoted to a prophetic picture of '' The Naval Battle of To-morrow , '' and a painful one to '' Ironclad Catastrophes , '' in which are recounted the tragic episodes of the foundering of the Cap - tain , the sinking by collision of the
Vanguard	ORGANIZATION	, the
Grosser Kurfiirst	PERSON	, and the
Victoria	LOCATION	, and the loss of the
Reina Regente	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work closes with an instructive chapter on the devel - opment of the British battleship .

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's account of the action off Asan and of the sinking of the Kowshing -LRB- both of which events took place before a declaration of war had been made -RRB- is not favorable to the Japanese .

		It may be remembered that the Asan affair arose from a chance meeting in the
Gulf of Korea	LOCATION	of the three Chinese warships , the
Tsi Yuen	ORGANIZATION	, the Kuwan-Shi , and the
Tsao	PERSON	-
Kiang	PERSON	, with the fast Japanese cruisers
Yosh	PERSON	- ino ,
Naniwa	ORGANIZATION	, and AJdtsusu .

		According to Japanese reports , the Chinese were the aggres - sors ; but this time it seems the conflicting Chi - nese version is the more probable .

		According to the latter account , the three Japanese ships took their opponents unawares , and opened fire on them without notice or provocation .

		At the first discharge several shots struck the conning - tower of the
Tsi Yuen	ORGANIZATION	, piercing it , and blow - ing to pieces the first lieutenant and a sub - lieutenant , while steering-gear , engine-room telegraphs , etc. , were completely wrecked .

		Or - ders were at once given by the Chinese captain to clear for action ; but before anything could be done , a second broadside struck the ship , working terrible havoc in her upper works , rid - dling her hull above water , and placing her virtually hors de combat .

		So searching and deadly was the hail of projectiles poured upon her by the Japanese quick-firers that not a man was left on deck those of the crew who were not killed seeking shelter below the armor - deck , whence they could not be driven until their officers had drawn their revolvers and threatened to use them with effect .

		As soon as her hand steering-gear could be got to work , the
Tsi Yuen	ORGANIZATION	, now in dreadful plight , turned from her enemies and headed for Wei-hai-wei , hotly pursued by the Yoshino , which , for some reason not yet clear , finally abandoned the chase , allowing her crippled foe to gain shelter without further mishap .

		A European who saw the
Tsi Yuen	ORGANIZATION	on her arrival at Wei-hai-wei thus describes her : '' The vessel presented the appearance of an old wreck .

		The mast was shot through half-way up , the gear was torn in pieces , ropes hung loose and tattered .

		On deck the sight was cruel and beggars description .

		Wood - work , cordage , bits of iron , and dead bodies , all lay in confusion . ''

		To this an English officer adds : '' The slaughter had been awful , blood and human re - mains being scattered over the decks and guns .

		Three of the five men working the 4-ton gun in the after-tur - ret were blown to pieces by a six-inch shell from one of the
Yoshino	PERSON	's quick-firing guns , and a fourth was shot down while trying to leave the turret .

		The remaining gunner stuck to his post , and managed to load and fire three rounds at the Yoshino , and , one shell entering her engine-room and another blowing her fore-bridge away , she hauled off .

		The Chinese admiral awarded the plucky gunner
1000	DATE	taels .

		One shell struck the
Tsi	ORGANIZATION	Yuen 's steel deck , and , glancing , passed up through the conning-tower and exploded , blowing the gunnery lieu - tenant to pieces , and leaving his head hanging to one of the voice-pipes .

		Huge fragments of armor and back - ing had been torn from their fastenings and carried in - board , crushing a number of poor wretches into shape - less masses , even the upper part of the funnels being splashed with blood .

		An engineer-officer -LRB- European -RRB- was sent for to repair the steam-pipe of the steering - engine , and tried to grope his way through the smoke of bursting shells and heaps of killed and wounded lying on the deck , when a shot struck his assistant and dis - embowelled him , covering the engineer with blood .

		He nevertheless managed to reach the steering-engine , and repaired the pipe , for which he received a rather hand - some reward from the admiral . ''

		Still more tragic than the fate of the
Tsi	ORGANIZATION	Yuen was that of the Kowshing an English steamer of
1355	DATE	tons , flying the British flag and carrying a British captain and British offi - cers , and chartered by the Chinese to convey troops to
Korea	LOCATION	.

		On
July 23	DATE	she left Taku , having on board 1100 Chinese infantry , two Chinese generals , Major You Hanneken , and twelve field-guns with a large quantity of am - munition .

		On
July 25	DATE	-LRB- the day of the Asan fight -RRB- she sighted a large warship , probably the
Tsi	ORGANIZATION	Yuen in retreat before the Japanese , steam - ing westward .

		An hour later four large iron - clads , also heading west , hove in sight , and it
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 101 was presently seen that the nearest vessel flew the Japanese flag .

		She approached rapidly , saluted the Kowshing , and passed her .

		The Japanese vessels appeared to be chasing the Tsan CMeng -LRB- which had also been sighted -RRB- , and to intend no harm to the Kowshing ; but presently the nearest ship signalled the English vessel to anchor .

		The order was obeyed , and was followed by a second one , '' Remain where you are or take the consequences , '' after which the Japanese ship circled and signalled to her consorts .

		As she afterwards drew rapidly nearer it was seen that her crew were at quarters , and her guns trained on the Kowshing .

		A boat was lowered and sent to the English vessel , when it was learned that the challenger was the cruiser
Naniwa	ORGANIZATION	, Captain
Togo	LOCATION	.

		The Chi - nese on the Kowshing were greatly excited ; and , when urged by
Von Hanneken	PERSON	and the English officers to surrender , replied that they would die first , and asserted that if the English attempted to leave the ship they should be killed .

		Meantime , the Japanese officers who had boarded the Kowshing were told that she was a British ship , with the British consul 's clearance , and that she had sailed in peace and in good faith .

		In reply , the Kowshing was ordered to follow the
Naniwa	ORGANIZATION	; but this course the Chinese , who had set a guard over the an - chor , absolutely refused to allow , and
Von Han	PERSON	- neken , finding argument useless , had the Nan - iwa 's boat recalled .

		Placed thus between two fires , the foreigners were in no enviable plight .

		The Japanese were clearly determined to take or to sink the Kowshing ; and the Chinamen were apparently bent on resisting the
Naniwa	ORGANIZATION	's onset with small-arms .

		Close upon the return of the
Naniwa	ORGANIZATION	's boat to her ship came the warning signal , addressed to the Europeans , '' Quit ship as soon as possible , '' this order be - ing followed a moment later by the peremptory one , '' Weigh , cut , or slip ; wait for nothing . ''

		To obey , in the face of a thousand armed and menacing Chinamen , was hopeless ; and the
Kowshing	PERSON	' s captain signalled back , '' We can - not . ''

		At once the
Naniwa	ORGANIZATION	got under way , blowing a long and ominous blast on her steam siren , and hoisting a red flag .

		Approaching to within 500 yards or less of the ill-fated trans - port , she discharged a torpedo , firing at the same instant with a terrific crash and with mur - derous effect a broadside from her five guns , two of twenty-eight tons , and three six-inch .

		According to
Von Hanneken	PERSON	, the torpedo struck a coal bunker amidships . ''

		The day became night ; pieces of coal , splinters , and water filled the air , and then all of us leaped overboard and swam . ''

		Other survivors state that the torpedo missed , and that the main damage was done by a 500-lb .

		shell which exploded the
Kowshing	ORGANIZATION	's boilers .

		The transport soon listed heavily to starboard , while the deadly Japanese fire raked her crowded decks , riddled her sides and top-hamper , and searched her vitals . ''

		From the
Naniwa	ORGANIZATION	' s tops , where were mounted Gat - lings , and from Nordenfelts and small quick-firers on her upper deck , came a hail of small projectiles , tear - ing through the dense mass of Chinamen on the Kow - shing 's deck .

		The Chinese replied in a futile , though gallant manner , by discharging their rifles at the enemy .

		The result could not be long in doubt .

		The heel of the Kowshing became greater , and she sank lower and lower in the water , till , about 2 o'clock , an hour from the fir - ing of the first shot , her deck was submerged .

		All this time the Europeans , and many of the Chinese who had leaped overboard , were in the water , exposed to stray shots from the Japanese , and deliberately fired upon by the Chinese who were still left on board the sinking ship .

		Bullets began to strike the water on all sides of us , ' says Mr.
Tamplin	PERSON	, the
Kowshing	ORGANIZATION	's first officer , ' and , turning to see whence they came , I saw that the Chi - nese , herding round the only part of the Kowshing that was then out of water , were firing at us . ' ''

		The scene that followed the sinking of the Kowshing was a terrible one , and , according to evidence which the author deems '' incontro - vertible , '' a most disgraceful and barbarous one .

		It appears that the Japanese not only made no attempt whatever to rescue their drowning ene - mies , but deliberately fired upon them in the water an act which , to the Western mind , no plea short of the direst necessity can palli - ate .

		Mr.
Tamplin	PERSON	of the Kowshing , who had been picked up by one of the
Naniwa	ORGANIZATION	's boats , testifies that the officer in charge told him that he '' had orders to sink the Chinese lifeboats , and in spite of remonstrances he proceeded to do so . ''

		Two volleys were fired into them , and both were sunk ; and the
Naniwa	ORGANIZATION	, having com - pleted her bloody work , steamed backwards and forwards on the scene of her not very cred - itable victory until eight in the
evening	TIME	.

		From the Yalu fight , which is described and minutely analyzed by the author , the most con - tradictory deductions have been drawn each naval expert finding in it full confirmation of his particular hobby .

		While it was the first time that fleets equipped with modern engines of destruction , monster guns , torpedoes , quick - firers , went into action , it must be remembered that no large first-rate battleships of recent types fought at the Yalu .

		The Japanese vic - tory was a foregone conclusion a fact of which they themselves were thoroughly aware .

		Their moral superiority alone was enough to decide 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, the issue ; but in addition to this they had bet - ter and newer guns , with speedier and , on the average , larger ships .

		They fought through - out by signal , as a compact , organized force ; while their opponents were , after the first on - set , merely a mob of ships .

		The gunnery of the Chinese was extremely indifferent , their heavy guns were antiquated , and they carried no large quick-firers thus lacking precisely the weapons which would have been most ef - fective against the Japanese unarmored cruis - ers .

		The Japanese had , of weapons ranging from the 6.8-inch
Krupp	ORGANIZATION	to the 4.7-inch Arm - strong , no less than ninety-four , sixty-six of them quick-firers ; while the Chinese had , of corresponding calibres , only twenty-seven , prob - ably all slow-firers .

		The numerical disparity is virtually increased by the fact that , as a quick - firer will discharge in a given time from three to six times as many rounds as a slow-firer , each Japanese quick-firer was worth three Chi - nese guns ; and a rough calculation shows that whereas the whole Chinese fleet could fire on the broadside , in a space of ten minutes , 58 , - 620 pounds of projectiles , the weight of metal discharged in the same period by the Japanese was 119,700 pounds , making the artillery pre - ponderance of the latter nearly two to one .

		The greater speed of the Japanese vessels gave them an advantage comparable to the posses - sion of the weather-guage , and enabled them to wheel and circle at will around their slower antagonists .

		The number of fires that occurred on board the ships of both combatants was a striking feature of the battle ; and a propos of this we may quote the account of a European who served on the large armored ship ,
Chen Yuen	PERSON	-LRB- Chinese -RRB- . ''

		In helping to put out one -RSB- of those fires I was wounded .

		The fire was forward , on the forecastle , and there was such a fierce fire sweeping the deck between it and the fore-barbette , that the officer whom I ordered to go and put it out declared it to be impossible to get there alive ; so I had to go myself .

		I called for volun - teers , and got some splendid fellows some of our best men , unhappily , for nearly all were killed , but we got the fire under .

		The fire was on the port side , and as the starboard fore-barbette gun was firing across it , I sent orders that it was only to fire on the starboard side , but , as bad luck would have it , the man who re - ceived the order , the Number One of the gun , had his head shot off just after I had gone forward , and his suc - cessor did not know of the order .

		As I stooped to pick up the hose , a shell , or a fragment , passed between my wrists , grazing each .

		Shortly afterwards , I heard a loud explosion , and saw a brilliant light behind me , was knocked down , and lay unconscious for a while how long I do not know .

		I believe it was the flame from the gun which I had ordered to fire only on the star - board side , but it may have been a shell exploding , though , if so , I ought to have been blown to pieces .

		Anyhow , I was pretty badly burnt , and when I came to I sat up leaning on my elbow , and found myself look - ing down the tube of the great gun pointing straight at me .

		I saw the end move a little to one side , then to the other , up a little , then down : and I waited for years a fraction of a second no doubt for the gun to fire , for I knew the gunner had taken aim .

		Then it sud - denly occurred to me to make an effort .

		I rolled over on my side , and by great good fortune , down a hatch - way some eight feet or so , onto a heap of rubbish , which broke my fall ; as I fell I heard the roar of the big gun . ''

		Reviewing his deductions as to the lessons to be drawn from the Yalu , Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	con - cludes that , except as to the danger of fire , the engagement has done nothing but emphasize known principles , and tends to confirm the views of those who hold that '' naval science is an exact science , and that its issues can be pre - dicted . ''

		Upon the points where practical in - formation is especially needed , such as the use and disposal of torpedo-boats in a fleet action , or the possibilities of the ram , the Yalu throws no light .

		We may fitly conclude our citations with the following forecast of '' the naval battle of to - morrow , '' admitting at the same time that we find some difficulty in entering at all into the evident enthusiasm of the writer . ''

		Two great lines of monster ships steaming side by side , but far apart , whilst the uproar of the cannonade , the hail of shells , fills the air .

		As the minutes pass , funnels and superstructures fly in splinters , the draught sinks , the speed decreases , ships drop to the rear .

		The moment for close action has come , and the victor steams in on the vanquished .

		The ram and the torpedo , amidst an inferno of sinking ships and exploding shells , claim their victims .

		The torpedo-boats of the weaker side in vain essay to cover the beaten battleships .

		Beneath a pall of smoke , upon a sea of blood , the mastery of the waters is decided for a generation .

		Such an encounter will not lack sensation .

		To live through it will be a life 's experience ; to fall in it a glorious end . ''

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's book is indispensable to the student of naval science , and general readers will find its descriptions graphic and its expo - sitions lucid .

		Outwardly the volumes are very attractive ; the illustrations are profuse and well-chosen , and the maps , charts , etc. , all that the most exacting could well ask .

		A RECENT decree of the
French Education Depart	ORGANIZATION	- ment has opened some of the French faculties to Amer - ican students upon terms so advantageous that the Ger - man universities will no longer be likely practically to monopolize this constituency .

		The American bacca - laureate degree will hereafter be accepted in
France	LOCATION	as a qualification for admission to these faculties , the old restrictions having been largely done away with .

		MM .

		Berthelot and Bre'al have been particularly active in bringing about this change , which has long been urged by many American scholars .

		THE DIAL 103 RECEXT EDUCATIONAL , LITERATURE .

		*
Bishop Spalding	PERSON	's new book on `` The Means and Ends of Education '' has in general the same valuable qualities of his earlier works .

		It is marked by clear thinking , deep sympathy , reverent faith in God and human nature , high ideals of man 's worth and work and destiny , and so of the teacher 's function , and practical ideas as to modes of working out these ideals , all expressed in a clear and winning style .

		While urging his favorite thoughts with force and earnestness , the Bishop is remarkably free from those habits of mind , deemed offensive by many , which are often associated with the
Church	ORGANIZATION	- man .

		We have a good illustration of this in the catholic chapter entitled '' The Scope of
Public School Education	ORGANIZATION	, '' from which a few sentences will be quoted . ''

		Unless we bear in mind that the school is but one of several educational agencies , we shall not form a right estimate of its office .

		It depends almost wholly for its success upon the kind of material furnished it by the home , the state , and the church ; and , to confine our view to our own country , I have little hesitation in affirming that our home life , our social and political life , and our religious life , have contributed far more to make us what we are than any and all of our schools .

		The school , unless it works in harmony with those great forces , can do little more than sharpen the wits .

		Many of the teachers of our Indian schools are doubtless com - petent and earnest ; but the pupils , when they return to their tribes , quickly lose what they have gained , because they are thrown into an environment which annuls the ideals that prevail in the school . ''

		This protest against an exaggerated estimate of the office of the school , and this demand for cooperation with the school on the part of the home , general society , and the church , are well timed .

		Perhaps we may add that among no part of our population are they more needed * THE MEANS AND ENDS OF EDUCATION .

		than among the
Bishop	ORGANIZATION	's own co-religionists .

		But to quote again : '' It is impossible for an enlightened mind not to take profound interest in our great system of public educa - tion .

		... I am willing to assume and to accept as a fact that our theological differences make it impossible to introduce the teaching of any religious creed into the public schools .

		I take the system as it is , that is , as a system of secular education , and I address myself more directly to the question proposed : What is , or should be , its scope ?

		... I myself am persuaded that the real and philosophical basis of morality is belief in the power of God ... But it is possible , I think , to cultivate the moral sense without directly and expressly assigning to it this philosophical and religious basis ; for goodness is largely its own evidence , as virtue is its own reward .

		It all depends on the teacher ... We must cease to tell boys and girls that education will enable them to get hold of the good things of which they believe the world to be full ; we must make them realize rather that the best thing in the world is a noble man or woman , and to be that is the only certain way to a worthy and contented life . '' ''

		School Interests and Duties '' is one of those practical books that neither teachers nor parents are likely to read too much .

		The sources of the book are shown by its explana - tory title : '' Developed from Page 's * Mutual Duties of Parents and Teachers , ' from various public reports and documents , and from the bulletins of the
National Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		While he is a compiler merely , Mr.
King	PERSON	shows good judgment and taste in selection and ar - rangement .

		He will not revolutionize the think - ing or practice of good teachers , but such teachers as read his book will find help and encouragement in pursuing the good old ways that experience has approved and that can never become obsolete .

		The book has been pre - pared with a particular view to reading-circle work .

		The leading word in Professor
Tompkins	PERSON	's titles indicates his point of view .

		He seeks to base the teaching process and the managing process on universal ideas . ''

		Science explains a group of phenomena by a principle , or law , coextensive with the group explained .

		At least , emphasis is given to such a principle .

		Philos - ophy explains a group of phenomena by some principle , or law , which extends beyond the group explained to all other groups . '' ''

		The Philosophy of Teaching '' is devoted to the teach - ing process in its wide relations .

		The great divis - ions of the book are : '' The Teaching Process , '' '' Aim in Teaching , '' and '' Method in Teach - ing , '' the third division receiving principal at - tention .

		This is an outline that is perfectly intelligible and coherent .

		The only question that can arise is whether the first and second 104 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, topics should not be given in the reverse order .

		In the other work , the leading ideas are not equally clear .

		They are : '' The Fundamental Law , '' `` The Law Creating the Organism , '' and '' The Law Executing the Organism . ''

		The '' Law '' in question is the '' Law of Unity . ''

		This law is found '' within the organism itself , '' or , in the final analysis , '' within the spiritual unity of the pupil . ''

		But how , if the law is in the organism , can it evolve the organism and execute the organism ?

		This question , of course , leads back to some old contentions about the relations of ideas and things .

		We are quite in sympathy with the author 's attempt to base school man - agement on ideas .

		We quite agree with him in his protest against the wretched empiricism of the schools .

		A person is not equipped for school management when he has merely learned the catalogue of '' do 's '' and '' do not 's . '' ''

		The - ory and Practice are organically one , two sides of the same process : the process in thought and the process in external realization '' ; '' the - ory is practice in thought , '' practice '' theory emerging from thought , '' all of which is very well put .

		But the difficulty is organically to relate the two .

		Authors do not always find this easy , as the book in hand shows ; and prac - tical teachers often find it positively difficult .

		To tell a teacher that he is to manage a school with reference to universal ideas , is not to give him very much immediate assistance .

		We have never known a teacher in the common schools so philosophical , so intelligent , so wise , that he did not find much use for the maxim , '' Do the best you can . ''

		And this is the maxim of the opportunist , or the empiricist if you will .

		We feel sure that some very intelligent teachers , resorting to Professor
Tompkins	PERSON	to help them in the management of their schools , will , while attending to his practical suggestions , have dif - ficulty in discovering just where the '' philos - ophy '' comes in .

		But if the second book is the less successful of the two , the author can fairly plead that to connect the managing pro- cess and universal ideas is much more difficult than it is to connect the teaching process and such ideas .

		Once more , we see no reason why much pf the matter that is in the second book might not with equal propriety , or even more propriety , be put in the first one .

		The two new volumes in the '' International Series '' are valuable contributions to the stock of kindergarten literature .

		The '' Pedagogics '' is a translation of fifteen of
Froebel	ORGANIZATION	's essays , collected by Dr.
Wichard Lange	PERSON	, and published in
Berlin	LOCATION	in
1861	DATE	.

		The translator contributes an extended analysis of its contents .

		While ac - knowledging our debt to Dr.
Stanley Hall	PERSON	'' for the wide-spread interest in the
United States	LOCATION	created by his labors in the movement known as child study , '' Dr.
Harris	PERSON	certifies : '' In this book are collected the first great European con - tributions to the subject .

		They are so subtle and so suggestive that every teacher should be - gin his pedagogical training by reading and studying them . ''

		The voluminous title of the other volume describes its character .

		In her introduction ,
Miss Blow	ORGANIZATION	says that
Froebel	PERSON	, in the Mother Play , '' deciphers all that the child feels in cipher , and translates for mothers the hieroglyphic of their own instinctive play .

		As a child 's book , this little collection of songs and games is unique in literature .

		As a mother 's book likewise it has no ancestry and no posterity .

		It is the greatest book for little children , and the greatest book for mothers , in the world .

		When all women shall have laid to heart its lessons , the ideal which hovers before us in the immortal pictures of the
Madonna	ORGANIZATION	will be realized , for then , at last , each mother will revere and nurture in her child the divine humanity . ''

		Only an enthusiastic kindergar - tener can rise to this high level .

		Mr.
Roark	PERSON	has written his '' Psychology in Education , '' he says , '' for the average teacher , and because of the deep interest that the aver - age teacher the private in the grand army of education is taking in the subject . ''

		We should say that he has well guaged the reader for whom he writes , and that he has written a book which is well adapted to his needs .

		We do not remember a book that , everything con - sidered , is better worthy of being recommended for use in all the places and ways where the average teacher may be reached .

		It is scien - tific on the one side and practical on the other .

		It was hardly necessary for the writer to say , as he does , '' Almost every paragraph was writ - ten with the thought constantly in mind , ` What application can be made of this in the details of every-day school work ? ''

		If we were to offer any general criticism , we should say the book is over-minute in its division of subject - matter .

		The writer has not invented elements ; all the elements that he recognizes exist ; but there is reason to think that he has sometimes carried his analysis too far for the average teacher .

		We fear that the elaborate division which constitutes Chapter II .

		will produce a depressing effect upon the mind of his typical reader ; and would suggest to him whether , in his next edition , it would not be better to put this
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 105 skeleton after his discussion rather than before it , or , at least , to insert in this place only the main dividing members , leaving the full scheme for a later page .

		Again , we have not found a multiplicity of definitions of the same term help - ful for the average mind , but rather the contrary owing to their leading to confusion .

		If the various groups of definitions are to be retained for purposes of critical comparison , they should at least be left untouched until the common reader has set the main ideas firmly in his mind .

		It is pleasant to see that Mr.
Roark	PERSON	knows the difference between psychology and physiology .

		He runs some risk of being styled a '' faculty '' psychologist , although he is not so in fact .

		Expecting ourselves to see a reaction from the present tendency to throw aside the word '' fac - ulty '' as a psychological term , we are pleased to find him saying : '' Although it is remembered that the mind is a unit , and has no divisions , yet the term faculties ' is used , because there is no better term by which to express the fact that the mind manifests its activity in different ways .

		Dr.
Laurie	PERSON	says in his ' Institutes of Education , ' it seems to me quite unnecessary to abandon the use of so useful a word . '

		Dr.
Ladd	PERSON	endorses the term by using it , and so does Dr.
Van Norden	PERSON	.

		I am content to be in such excellent company , and shall use ' faculties ' as it has always been used to name collectively the different phases of the mind 's activity . ''

		The strength and the weakness of Renan 's method are well known .

		He writes not as a scholar speaking to scholars .

		He feels that he commands a larger audience .

		He is bril - liant in generalizations , epigrammatic in phrase - ology .

		His style is that of a causeur rather than of an erudite expositor .

		His books , for this reason , have failed to pass muster before the exacting criticism of the German schools , of whatever party leanings .

		It is a mistake to suppose that the '' higher criticism '' welcomed in him a sturdy yoke-mate .

		While Renan ac - cepted some of the positions and propositions of this school , he was at other times too strongly inclined to galvanize old rationalism .

		He leans to rationalistic interpretations of the miracles and the miraculous in the biographies of the Biblical heroes .

		This tendency of his is due un - doubtedly to his early training under the influ - ences of the Catholic Seminary ; but he never succeeded in emancipating himself from the spell of these earlier ideas , and to the last his books show its traces and always where one would least expect it .

		Such surprises , however , add spice to his narratives .

		Renan has been called a novelist ; his '' Life of Christ '' espe - cially has been described as belonging to the department of fiction .

		His other works show the same ear-marks ; in them the novelist pre - dominates over the critic .

		This verdict is not pillared on an opposition to his fundamental view on the character and origin of Biblical literature .

		The Dutch and German , and now the English , schools of '' higher criticism '' are still bolder than was Renan in denying to the Biblical documents an exceptional position among the ancient writings on history .

		And yet , the men of these schools have not been less insistent in relegating Renan to the ranks of brilliant novelists than are the speakers on the conservative and orthodox side of the house .

		But this very weakness in the eyes of schol - ars constitutes the strength of Renan 's method in the forum of non-professional readers .

		He writes well and entertainingly .

		He is never 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, '' dry as dust . ''

		Subjects under his touch are given bones and muscles and nerves and hearts ; and circumstances are endowed with local col - oring .

		What if , occasionally , to turn a pretty and striking phrase , he strains a fact too far ?

		The general reader will enjoy the epigram , though the German professor will shake his head most ominously .

		The volume before us is not to be exempted from these strictures .

		It shows the hand of its author .

		If anything , it lacks brilliancy and vim of style .

		Whether the English version is at fault , or the impending shadows of approach - ing death had cooled and chilled the impulses of the vivacious writer , the impression of a cer - tain languor in the movement of the sentences and paragraphs becomes confirmed in the reader as he proceeds from chapter to chapter .

		Of epigrams there is no dearth , and the old habit of misrepresenting facts to bolster a bril - liant statement asserts itself time and again .

		The period under discussion gives , it is true , but little latitude to a fancy-possessed historian .

		The ground is well explored .

		Greek and He - brew literature of the day is accessible ; the material for reconstructing the times as they were is abundant .

		Renan has had in this field many predecessors .

		His book does not advance a single new theory or suggest view-points hith - erto neglected .

		And yet the volume is a grate - ful addition to the books on the period .

		For it presents to the general reader , in a very at - tractive guise , the results of scholarly investiga - tions hitherto buried in foreign periodicals and inaccessible publications .

		The book is the story of the failure of the Maccabean house , and the consequences result - ing therefrom .

		It introduces us into the inner life of the Jews , and makes us acquainted with their party ambitions and the literature which is the precipitate of the religio-political con - troversies agitating the Judean world during the tottering years of the Maccabean dynastic reign .

		It traces the gradually asserted pre - ponderance of
Rome	LOCATION	in the destiny of
Judea	LOCATION	and Judaism ; it gives us an insight into the rise and development of a Judaism denational - ized and deterritorialized , its philosophy and Messianic outlook , from which
Christianity	ORGANIZATION	is the ripe off-shoot .

		We are thus in this one volume invited to the confidences of the
Rab	PERSON	- binic schools and the intimacy of the
Alexan	PERSON	- drian Jewish Platonists .

		The dual tendency of Judaism running toward national exclusive - ness , and as strongly toward universal cosmo - politanism , is brought out most forcibly a dual tendency which explains much in the life of Judaism that otherwise seems a riddle .

		Renan has on the whole grasped this dual ele - ment most happily , and yet at times he fails to remember it .

		His characterization of the Tal - mud and the Talmudic dialectic method is in - deed superficial and one-sided , simply because he forgets the dualism of Jewish life .

		Certain it is that the
Halakha	LOCATION	legal rigorism and the Haggadah the poetic ethical element of Talmudism are not two currents which at no time intermingle .

		The Halakhic Rabbis were also the Haggadists .

		Nor does Renan remember that much in the Talmudic discussions is mere academic exercise ; the extravagances in method and matter are due to school logic , and never either had or attempted to have an influence on the actualities of religious practice or thought .

		At the period of which this book treats , Tal - mudism in this sense was still in its infancy .

		Renan , as many others , unable to pilot their craft through the breakers of the Talmudic ocean , has not strictly enough kept separate the successive stages of the Talmudic process .

		The Talmud seems to him to be almost a personality , while it is an encyclopedia of six hundred years , in the making of which many generations and men had a part .

		Renan 's exposition of the differences between the politico - religious parties not sects or schools the Pharisees ,
Sadduces	PERSON	, and Essenes , is on the whole correct .

		He has here utilized the researches of Jewish scholars .

		The Phar - isees are the party of national independence , the party of the learned ; the Sadduces are the priestly aristocrats , with little care or under - standing for motives beyond those of selfish class interest .

		This general distinction is clearly brought out .

		But Renan fails to connect organ - ically with this cardinal difference on the one hand the seeming ritualism of the Pharisaic '' school '' which had its origin in the purpose to make Jewish family life and the synagogue as '' holy '' as was by law the priestly fraternity and the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	; or , on the other , the dogmatic discussions of immortality , resurrection , and providence , which in the national scheme of Phariseeism have a bearing totally at variance with the ideas ordinarily connoted thereby .

		But even in its imperfect state , Renan 's pre - sentation will do much to disabuse men of the current prejudice that Pharisee and hypocrite are exchangeable terms .

		Into other details of this work we can not en - ter .

		PSYCHOLOGY GONE MAD .

		* The author of '' A Scientific Demonstration of the Future Life '' has made his debut in a former work , '' The Law of Psychic Phenom - ena '' -LRB- reviewed in THE DIAL of
June 16 , 1893	DATE	-RRB- ; and so far as possible he now outdoes himself in extreme statements and illogical , or rather logic - less , arguments .

		The so-called '' scientific demonstration of a future life '' is based upon alleged thought-transference exper - iments , and the general '' telepathic '' concep - tions that are current .

		As far as there is a sem - blance of an argument in the book , it goes about as follows : There are two minds , an object - ive mind and a subjective mind .

		The objective mind is the one connected with the body and exercising the ordinary every - day function with which we associate the term rationality .

		On the other hand , the subjective mind dis - ports itself quite otherwise ; it is subject to sug - gestion , it reasons perfectly and intuitively , has a perfect memory , is the seat of the emotions , moves ponderable objects without physical con - tact , and telepaths freely and vigorously .

		Fur - thermore , as all faculties must be of some use here or hereafter , and as the subjective mind does not express itself fully and normally here , there must be a hereafter ; q. e. d. Incidentally to this argument -LRB- ? -RRB-

		we are re - galed by a series of remarkable views .

		We become acquainted with the `` subjective mind '' through '' mediums '' or '' psychics '' who are suggestible , and thus prove the duality of the mind as well as the existence of a soul .

		Re - ligion belongs to the soul , and is therefore psychic science .

		Moses was a psychic ; '' he subjectively saw the vision of the burning bush , and he subjectively -LRB- clairaudiently -RRB- heard the voice '' ; and what he believed to be the word of God was '' objective
Moses	PERSON	talk - ing with subjective Moses . ''

		The prophets were psychics , and `` Jesus himself was the most stupendous psychic phenomenon the world has ever seen . ''

		hypnotism and telepathy , the subjective mind has been clearly recognized , and so the highest step in the evolution of religion has been reached .

		The possibilities of the subjective mind are many and various . ''

		All good music is a product of the subjective mind '' ; bad or mechanical music is not .

		But the subjective mind is not to be trifled with : '' Psychic phe - nomena are never produced except under the most intensely abnormal conditions of the phy - sical and mental organism '' ; '' all immorality , vice , crime , and insanity are the direct results of abnormal psychic activity and control over the dual mental organization '' ; '' the degree of psychic power attainable by anyone is in exact proportion to the intensity of his ner - vous derangement . ''

		Musicians , stenographers , typewriters , and compositors all unduly develop their subjective powers -LRB- and consequently are '' entitled to shorter hours and increased pay '' -RRB- , and are thus liable to nervous and mental dan - gers .

		Anyone who doubts that the author is in earnest need only read such a passage as this : '' Is there any reason to suppose that telepathy is so restricted in its field of operations ?

		Why should it be restricted to any two individuals in a group of three or more ?

		As well might one say that the power of grav - ity is restricted to two of the heavenly bodies , and that because it operates between the sun and the earth , it can not operate between the sun and any other planet .

		As well might one assume that the moon does not shine upon the earth , since it is known that the moon derives its light from the sun .

		The logical consequences of these two suppositions would be no more disastrous to the planetary universe than it is to the mental world to suppose that B. can not telepath to C. because A. can telepath to B .

		In the one case it leads to planetary chaos ; in the other it leads directly and inevitably into the dark and dismal realm of superstition . ''

		It is difficult to take this effort seriously , but everyone who has observed popular reasoning upon such topics appreciates the fact that works like this have a distinctly pernicious effect .

		They divert interest from profitable channels , and bring into disrepute lines of inquiry sim - ilar in name but happily different in scope and method .

		Far better the grossest superstition , and the most ignorant and crude beliefs , than such a senseless parody of the manner and methods of science .

		It is not strange that an entire absence of the significance of a fact or of the logic of science should occasionally be found in combination with the power of putting words together in the semblance of an argu - ment ; but it is strange that a reputable pub - lisher can be found to place his imprint upon such a riot of logic - aping extravagances , such a protracted mental debauch .


JOSEPH JASTROW	PERSON	.

		108 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, TEACHING THE ART OF WRITING .

		* Between the text-books in rhetoric of even ten years ago and the text-books in composition of to-day there is a gap which to the teacher of English is a safely crossed Rubicon .

		The past decade has seen the practical application of what is at bottom not a startling theory : that the way to teach a student to write is to make him write .

		The old way of teaching him to write by loading him with rhetorical principles has lost its hold .

		Text-books of the present-day insist , therefore , that the student shall write ; and to be successful now , a text-book must ac - cordingly be practical , explicit , and stimulating .

		It is a fact of much significance that some of the most distinguished English scholars in the country have deemed it worth their while to prepare for academies and colleges '' Outlines '' and '' Handbooks '' and '' Foundations '' of com - position .

		Among these genuinely successful texts is '' A Handbook of English Composi - tion , '' by Professor
J. M. Hart	PERSON	, of
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is without doubt one of the most interest - ing volumes that has been written on the sub - ject of writing for many a day .

		It reads so well , in fact , that a teacher might perhaps won - der whether it was suitable to use as a class drill-book .

		But , to use stage lingo , it not only reads well , it acts well : it stands the test of the class-room .

		Take it through and through , it is the best thing of the kind that has ap - peared .

		To justify completely this sweeping statement calls for a detailed analysis such as would be out of place in THE DIAL .

		But some of the excellent qualities of the book may easily be noted .

		It is written in a style clear , pre - cise , and fluent ; its directions are never vague , are numerous enough to apply to many cases , yet not so numerous as to be confusing ; its instances are drawn almost entirely from books that every student is likely to have read ; it is both sound and original -LRB- a sufficiently rare combination -RRB- in its treatment of the problems it sets out to solve .

		It is , moreover , fully as helpful to the teacher as to the student , espe - cially to the teacher who has been brought up in the inadequacies of the old system and is painfully working out his own salvation .

		Such a teacher will find that no conventional dogma is overthrown by mere assertion of an opposite dogma ; wherever a reason is needed , a reason is given .

		The one possible fault of the book is that a student to whom rhetorical issues are * A HANDBOOK OF ENGLISH COMPOSITION .

		as remote as
Venezuela	LOCATION	will now and then miss the force of a trenchant paragraph .

		The book is in four main parts , the first two of which , '' Invention '' and '' Expression , '' are outlined in the table of contents conventionally enough .

		The independent treatment , however , begins on the first page , where invention is de - fined not as finding out what to say , but as the art of putting together what one has to say .

		Under the first head are treated paragraphs and the forms of writing -LRB- narration , etc. -RRB- ; un - der the second , clearness , force , propriety , fig - ures .

		One notes , in passing , the stress laid on the necessity of observation ; the careful and easily intelligible distinction between will and shall ; the proof that our best writers observe no distinction in the use of who or which and that as coordinate and restrictive relatives ; and the much - needed comment on the historical present : '' The historical present presupposes a vivid imagination .

		Are you sure that you pos - sess such an imagination ?

		Are you really aglow over this particular passage ? ''

		The third part consists of practical directions in preparing compositions for the class-room , together with a series of composition subjects suggested by means of stimulating questions on familiar books .

		The relation between reading and com - position is set forth so plainly here that even a careless student must mark the unity that runs through his course in English .

		The last part of the book is given up to an interesting discussion of the kinds of poetry including questions of metre , of oratory and debate and to a brief historical sketch of the language .

		The volume is a genuine handbook a book for the student to keep close at hand in the knowledge that reference to it will always be helpful .

		The general reader , unfortunately , has little interest in rhetorical textbooks ; but should this one fall into his hands , he will prob - ably be led to read a good deal in it before he puts it down .

		THE DIAL 109 MORE BOOKS ON BOTANY .

		* In a recent review , attention was called to the fact that in these latter days books dealing with botan - ical subjects are appearing with remarkable rapid - ity .

		This statement finds further confirmation in the fascicle that has again accumulated for review .

		The completion of Mr.
Oliver	PERSON	's translation of
Kerner	PERSON	's '' Natural History of Plants '' is a matter for congratulation .

		This important work , in two large volumes , appeared almost without notice , and American botanists have been agreeably surprised to receive an edition of their own .

		The illustrations and typography leave nothing to be desired , and a scientific treatise so intelligible to the general reader has not appeared in many a day .

		Although deal - ing with a somewhat miscellaneous range of sub - jects , and not at all coordinated after the style of a text-book , it chiefly emphasizes the newly recog - nized and newly named field of '' ecology , '' which , freely translated , means plant sociology .

		The sub - jects treated in the first volume have already been mentioned in this journal .

		The second volume , now before us , deals with reproduction and the history of species .

		The most brilliant recent advances in botany have been in our knowledge of the phenom - ena of reproduction , and to have this knowledge presented in a popular way is a service to the sci - ence as well as to the public .

		It must be said , how - ever , that
Kerner	PERSON	's views concerning the reproduc - tive processes are faulty in the extreme , and this portion of the work should only be read in con - nection with Professor
Oliver	PERSON	's clear statements later in the volume .

		The story of reproduction in plants is now essentially complete in its outlines , perfectly uniform in its principles , but wonder - fully varied in its expression .

		In general , in all plants there are two kinds of cells specialized for reproduction .

		One kind , the spore , is capable of germination alone , and unaided can produce a plant body .

		These spores are not restricted to the lower groups , as is so commonly supposed , but are com - mon to the highest as well .

		The '' pollen-grains '' of flowering plants are spores having the same pow - ers as the spores of mosses and ferns .

		The other kind of reproductive cell is the gamete , incapable of germination alone .

		Two gametes must coalesce , the process being known as the sexual act , and the * THB NATURAL HISTORY OF PLANTS .

		resultant cell is then able to produce a plant body .

		Gametes are therefore sexual reproductive cells , spores are asexual reproductive cells ; and the fact that pollen grains are sexless bodies may be a sur - prise to some .

		Kerner also describes in a most fas - cinating way the wonderful devices for securing cross-pollination , that almost sensational region in the economy of higher plants opened up by
Darwin	PERSON	.

		The means of attraction and protection , the marvel - lous intricacies of adaptation between flowers and insects , the origin and dispersion of species , are all chapters of intense interest that deserve more than botanical attention .

		One of the notable books that have just appeared is
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	's '' Mosses and Ferns . ''

		Dr.
Campbell	PERSON	has long been a student of the '' Archegoniatse , '' so named on account of the peculiar female sex organ called the `` archegonium . ''

		These groups of plants are the intermediate ones , with the maze of
Thal	PERSON	- lophytes below them , and the Spermaphytes -LRB- '' flow - ering plants '' -RRB- above them .

		This position gives them exceptional interest to the student of the evo - lution of the plant kingdom .

		Dr.
Campbell	PERSON	pre - sents a great body of facts dealing with the embry - ology of these forms , and then discusses their genetic relationships .

		The mosses are represented by two well-known groups , the liverworts and the true mosses .

		We see now that liverworts have devel - oped from the Algae , the so-called '' seaweeds '' among Thallophytes ; that the true mosses have come from liverworts , but have led to nothing beyond ; that another line of advance from liverworts has led to the fern plants ; that the fern plants in turn have given rise to the gymnosperms , the group to which our conifers belong , but which has led to noth - ing further ; while another line from the fern plants has developed into our ordinary `` flowering plants . ''

		Such views broaden our conception of the processes of evolution , and emphasize the fact that many groups of plants represent finished lines so far as their present display is concerned , and that the '' main axis '' of evolution is a relatively short one after all .

		The Seaweeds have just received treatment at the hands of Dr.
George Murray	PERSON	, of the British Mus - eum .

		Our ordinary text-books , being compelled to give a general account of the plant kingdom , can do any special part of it but scant justice .

		Courses in general morphology form the foundation of our botanical training , and in these courses seaweeds play a very prominent part .

		This is necessarily so , not merely because training begins with them , but chiefly because the whole plant kingdom is rooted in them , and no proper conception of the higher groups can be obtained without their study .

		No general text is full enough to do justice to the sub - ject of algae , and Mr.
Murray	PERSON	has done valuable service in supplying this lack .

		It is to be regretted that he chiefly deals with seaweeds literally ; that is , the brown and red forms of our seacoasts .

		These , in a sense , seem to be '' finished lines '' of algse ; while the abounding green algae of the fresh waters 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, are looked to as the forms from which the higher groups have come .

		The most notable event in the domain of syste - matic botany is the completion of the great ''
Kew	LOCATION	Index . ''

		The four large folio volumes of 1300 closely-printed pages contain a list of the names of all flowering plants that have been described up to
1885	DATE	, together with their authorities and countries .

		The work is of incalculable benefit to '' systemat - ists , '' and is another proof of the sagacity of
Charles Darwin	PERSON	, who left a bequest to be applied to its pre - paration and publication .

		The amount of biblio - graphical work involved is almost beyond computa - tion , and could hardly have been possible except with the staff and library at command at
Kew	LOCATION	.

		Physiological Botany is also represented among the recent books .

		This subject has barely been introduced into American universities , both from lack of properly trained teachers and the time con - suming character of the work .

		What was needed was some laboratory guides to show instructors how much could be accomplished in very simple fashion .

		That plant physiology , which deals with the life phenomena , is of supreme importance , is beyond question .

		The wonder is that we could have been content so long with dissecting plant corpses .

		The study of the phenomena of nutrition , growth , irritability , reproduction , must be considered funda - mental in any biological work .

		Mr.
MacDougal	PERSON	, of
the University of Minnesota	ORGANIZATION	, has supplied us with an elementary laboratory guide .

		Experiments are described , one hundred and twelve in number , which illustrate the general principles of absorption of liquids , movements of water , absorption of gases , respiration , and other forms of metabolism , irrita - bility , and growth .

		It is to be hoped that this book and others like it will work a revolution in our bot - anical teaching , and will help change the point of view from the plant as a form and a structure to the plant as a thing of life .

		In our swing away from the dead plant , we are in danger of losing sight of the fact that physiology and ecology are both based upon structure .

		Plant anatomy has been called the '' dry bones '' of the science ; and perhaps it is , but the '' bones '' are none the less necessary .

		Miss
Emily L. Gregory	PERSON	, of Bar - nard College , has reminded us that anatomy is still to be studied , though the most of us are teaching it as an incident to morphology rather than as a sub - ject that can stand by itself .

		Her book is naturally divided into anatomy of the cell and anatomy of the tissues .

		The organization of a living cell , espe - cially one capable of division , is complex beyond any conception of the uninitiated ; and the modifi - cation of these cells and their massing into diverse tissues will illustrate the possibilities of the com - plexity of results that can arise from a unit struc - ture .

		Miss
Gregory	PERSON	describes and illustrates the prominent facts of plant anatomy , and the book will be useful as a reference to those who need direc - tion in the demonstration of various kinds of cells and tissues .

		They limn the character of the '' strong , simple , silent '' captain with the same sympathy and unerring judgment that are displayed in the '' Com - memoration Ode '' portraiture of Lincoln .

		An etched photograph of
Lowell	LOCATION	, jEt .

		70 , provides the volume with an appropriate frontispiece .

		Mr.
Henry S. Salt	PERSON	and Mr.
Frank B. Sanborn	PERSON	have done literature an excellent service in selecting from
Thoreau	LOCATION	's writings a little volume of '' Poems of Nature . ''

		Fifty pieces are thus brought together , from '' The Dial , '' ''
Walden	PERSON	, '' and other sources .

		Thoreau was not a poet in any finished sense , and even his friend
Emerson	PERSON	had to admit that '' he no doubt wanted a lyric faculty and technical skill '' ; but he was a genuine literary force , and the poetic aspect of his thought is not without interest .

		Most of his verses were written when he was very young from twenty to twenty-five and none of them are remarkable ; yet we may say , with one of his critics , that there is '' a frank and unpretending nobleness '' about them , and that they have some measure of '' ripe fulness of thought , gravity of tone , and epigrammatic terseness of expression . ''

		They sometimes faintly suggest
Emerson	PERSON	, and sometimes
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	, and have a nook of their own among the works of the
Concord School	ORGANIZATION	.

		Most readers , we fancy , will be surprised to learn that the late
Samuel F. Smith	PERSON	, whose ''
America	LOCATION	'' we all know , was the author of sufficient verse , sacred and secular , to fill a volume of three hundred and seventy-five pages .

		Yet such are the dimensions of the collection just published , under the editorial supervision of
General Henry B. Carrington	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are in this volume poems for all sorts of domestic and public occasions including a number written for the famous Harvard class of
1829	DATE	all sorts of patriotic songs and nature lyrics , all sorts of hymns and other sacred pieces . ''

		The morning light is breaking '' is , of course , as familiar in its way as ''
America	LOCATION	, '' and one can not help noting the fre - quency with which the author prepared new sets of words to go with the tunes to which his two best - known songs are sung .

		These pieces are too mod - est to challenge technical criticism ; they accomplish all that their author expected them to accomplish , and we are less sensible , in reading them , of their defects as poetry , than of the transparent simplicity , kindliness of heart , and genuine religious feeling that they embody .

		Dr.
Smith	PERSON	is secure of a place in our national affections , and this volume affords the best possible memorial of his long , active , and helpful career .

		Mr.
Henry Stevenson Washburn	PERSON	is , like Dr.
Smith	PERSON	, the author of one set of verses familiar to every American , and his volume is appropriately named `` The Vacant Chair and Other Poems . ''

		His work is not unlike that of Dr.
Smith	PERSON	, being in the main devotional , patriotic , and occasional .

		There is no question of inspiration in such verse as this ; it is commonplace in sentiment and pedestrian in movement , but it was doubtless pleasant to compose , and doubtless gave pleasure to the circle of those for whom it was intended .

		A number of illustra - tions add to the attractiveness of Mr.
Washburn	PERSON	's volume .

		Passing from these collections to Mrs.
Stoddard	PERSON	's volume , we are in the presence of poetry in a more serious sense .

		It would be difficult to do justice to the intensity of noble feeling that throbs beneath the stern grave simplicity of these poems . ''

		Idle poet , a word with you : You sing too much of love 's sweet wrong , Of rosy cheeks , and purple wine ; Give us a loftier song . ''

		From this reproach , at least , Mrs.
Stoddard	PERSON	is free , for her song rarely fails to reach into the very heart of nature and of life .

		Let an exquisite lyric of '' March '' witness to one aspect of her thought . ''

		Ho , wind of
March	DATE	, speed over sea , From mountains where the snows lie deep , The cruel glaciers threatening creep , And witness this , my jubilee ! ''

		Roar from the surf of boreal isles , Roar from the hidden , jagged steeps , Where the destroyer never sleeps ; Ring through the iceberg 's Gothic piles ! ''

		Voyage through apace with your wild train , Harping its shrillest , searching tone , Or wailing deep its ancient moan , And learn how impotent your reign . ''

		Then hover by this garden bed , With all your wilful power , behold , Just breaking from the leafy mould , My little primrose lift its head . ''

		The impression of Mrs.
Stoddard	PERSON	's work , as a whole , is a sombre one , but she has the power to compel to her mood by sheer force of sincerity ; the poetic vision is hers in a remarkable degree , and the power to impart it .

		If we may use a figure that seems peculiarly appropriate to the occasion , we will say that these poems are suggestive of the sea after a storm , before the calm has wholly supervened .

		We feel that the waters have been stirred to their depths , and that peace has not yet been fully wrought out of passion .

		In all our choir of American singers , there is no woman 's voice more distinctly individual than this , or more compulsive in its appeal .

		In turning from Mrs.
Stoddard	PERSON	to Mrs. Fields , we pass from turbulence to tranquility of soul . ''

		The Singing Shepherd and Other Poems '' is a sheaf of song preserved from the harvests of some thirty years , and winsome with tender hues .

		A quick sensitiveness to all that is beautiful , a strong undercurrent of religious feeling , and a fair mas - tery of the rhythmical art , are the characteristics of the pieces which Mrs. Fields has brought together in this her latest volume .

		As a favorable example , we may quote the opening stanzas of '' Death , Who Art Thou ? ''

		112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, '' Thus questioned they who watched the .

		ZEgean Sea Stretch up white arms to drag the diver down , And they who waked to find Thermopylae Scarlet and white with glory overblown . ''

		Tears dropped , even then , in that far early world , Dropped on the soft face of the fresh-turned earth ; And curses gathered by despair were hurled By mortal sorrow in her primal birth . ''

		But the young runner grasped his wreath , and died ; Antinoiis loved , and plunged him in the deep ; The goal attained , world 's glory and world 's pride , Life held no more , they said , and sank to sleep . ''

		The refined feeling and good taste displayed in these verses are qualities that they share in common with most of the contents of the volume in which they occur .

		Professor
W. C. Lawton	PERSON	has collected the verses that a vagrant and impulsive Muse have from time to time constrained him to write , and published them in a volume of marked mechanical individ - uality .

		A series of illustrative cuts , happily fitted to the various texts , add to the attractiveness of the little book .

		Occasional pieces , classical reminis - cences , and impressions de voyage are the chief con - tents of a collection distinguished for culture , ideal - ity , and a certain naivete that does not detract from the general charm .

		As well as anything , perhaps , we like the graceful tribute to the memory of Pro- fessor
Merriam	LOCATION	, from which this extract is made : '' Far and far away The sun is bright on
Hellas	PERSON	' hills to-day ; And he who best of all our eager race The deep-cut word , the artist 's line , could trace , Has reached the city of the violet crown , Only in dreamless sleep to lay him down .

		Too soon completed is his absent year .

		He knows not time nor distance , far or near : Perchance in loving thought he is among us here . ''

		Professor
Merriam	PERSON	, it will be remembered , died a little over a year ago , at
Athens	LOCATION	, whither he had gone to spend his '' sabbatical year '' of vacation from
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is true of Professor
Lawton	PERSON	's verse that '' Every chord has rung a thousand times To the firm touch of masters new and old , '' but this is no reason why they should remain un - plucked by the hands of the younger generation , and it is safe to add that they are not likely to suf - fer such neglect .

		Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	has practised many forms of the literary craft , bringing to them all capacity and serious purpose .

		But none of his other ventures -LRB- as far as known to us -RRB- have been a source of quite the satisfaction with which we have read his recently-collected volume of verse .

		It includes four sections songs , sonnets , vers de soci & e , and pieces `` in more serious mood , '' and it would be a pleasure to illustrate them all .

		Space failing , we will be content with a sonnet and this pair of qua - trains upon a familiar text from
Dante	ORGANIZATION	'' In la sua voluntade e nostra pace . '' ''

		Peace ?

		Can we find it in this world of trial , Where battles fierce and every form of ill And pain and sorrow and hard self-denial Our checkered lives from birth to death must fill ? ''

		Peace ?

		peace ?

		How sweet the word and tender I Its very sound should wrangling discords still !

		And I might find it if I would surrender Myself and my will to His perfect will . ''

		It is a pity that one of these lines should be scant , but the defect is easily remedied .

		The sonnet we wish to quote is the second of two on '' Beethoven . '' ''

		I love the ocean 's glorious symphonies In nature 's everlasting solitudes ; The deep adagio of its peaceful moods ; Its light allegro when the white-caps rise ; Its minor when the sunset zephyr dies ; Its mighty major when the storm-cloud broods And sweeps the straining harp-string of the woods , And far on high the foaming water flies ! ''

		So when
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	's magic music swells , Like voices of the angels heard in sleep , My spirit to its utmost depths is stirred As though a more majestic sea I heard , As though some sunken city 's silver bells Swung palpitating in the purple deep . ''

		Mr.
Dole	PERSON	's verse has melody rather than harmony , fancy rather than imagination , wit rather than hu - mor ; but its command of these lighter qualities is easy , and its utterance nearly always pleasing .

		Miss
Litchfield	ORGANIZATION	's volume is well named '' Mimosa Leaves , '' for its every page gives evidence of a sen - sitive nature , and the tremulous quality of the verse is one of its noticeable characteristics .

		The poems mostly short semi-impulsive pieces reveal an outlook upon life somewhat saddened , yet tempered by a faith that the dark mysteries of sorrow are somehow part of a divine plan , and that the heart of things is not pain .

		This attitude finds its fullest expression in two poems , '' In the Hospital '' and '' Beyond the Hospital , '' too lengthy to be used for illustration .

		We select instead the characteristic stanzas entitled '' Courage . '' ''

		Hast thou made shipwreck of thy happiness ?

		Yet , if God please , Thou ` It find thee some small haven none the less , In nearer seas , Where thou may ` st sleep for utter weariness , If not for ease . ''

		The port thou dreamedst of thou shalt never reach , Though gold its gates , And wide and fair the silver of its beach , For sorrow waits To pilot all whose aims too far outreach , Towards darker straits . ''

		Yet so no soul divine thou art astray On this cliff 's crown Plant thou a victor flag ere breaks the day
Across night	TIME	's brown , And none shall guess it doth but point the way Where a bark went down . ''

		Miss Litchfield 's versification is often faulty , and she has not been well-advised in making the ana - paestic measure her favorite form .

		It is the most difficult of all our fundamental rhythms , and the failure to handle it is conspicuous in the present instance .

		That the poetic tradition of
California	LOCATION	, so welL established by Mr.
Harte	PERSON	, Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	, and Mr.
Miller	PERSON	, has not been permitted to lapse with the
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 113 passing of those men to other scenes is a fact made very evident by such a book as Miss Coolbrith 's '' Songs from the Golden Gate . ''

		Her work has poetic sensibility and vision , besides command of a considerable variety of lyric forms .

		There are , of course , occasional literary echoes in her work , no - ticeably in the case of '' Oblivion , '' which is sure to recall
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	's '' Dreamland '' ; but , for the most part , Miss Coolbrith transmutes the gold of other singers into metal of her own .

		We can not do better than quote her lines on `` The Poet . '' ''

		He walks with God upon the hills !

		And sees , each morn , the world arise New-bathed in light of paradise .

		He hears the laughter of her rills , Her melodies of many voices , And greets her while his heart rejoices .

		She , to his spirit undefiled Makes answer as a little child ; Unveiled before his eyes she stands , And gives her secrets to his hands . ''

		A series of drawings by Mr.
William Keith	PERSON	, the artist of '' fields a-thrill with motion and with light , '' provide the book with illustration in a very attract - ive and unusual sense .

		Another volume of song , not obviously inspired , but at least graceful and refined comes to us from
California	LOCATION	.

		Miss Shearer 's '' The Legend of Au - lus '' includes , besides the long titular poem , a num - ber of sonnets , ballads , and lyrics , the breathings of a sensitive and delicately-attuned spirit .

		Every poet pictures , at one time or another , some '' city of the soul '' in contemplation whereof is peace of mind .

		Miss Shearer 's picture is suggested by the romantic wonderland of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's creation . ''

		What soft enchantment wraps my soul away ?

		The magic juice hath sure been spilt on me .

		Behold the sunken ships within the bay !

		Prospero weaves his web of glamourie , Imprisoned Ariel struggles to be free , Miranda with her Prince talks heart to heart .

		This is the isle where I have longed to be , Most subtly tinted by the
Master	ORGANIZATION	's art ; Here let me rest , nor ever from these shores depart . ''

		As for '' The Legend of Aulus , '' it is a narrative poem of the early Christian period in
Rome	LOCATION	, based upon a story in the '' Gesta Romanorum , '' sympathet - ically conceived , but somewhat pedestrian in move - ment .


Chicago	LOCATION	has its share in the poetical product of the past few months , for no less than four of the volumes upon our list come from men whom the
Lakeside City	LOCATION	claims for her own .

		She claims Mr.
George Horton	PERSON	new
United States Consul	ORGANIZATION	at
Athens	LOCATION	by virtue of his old connection with
Chi	PERSON	- cago journalism , and of his '' Songs for the Lowly , '' published some four years ago . ''

		In Unknown Seas , '' the modest sheaf of stanzas he now sends us , embodies suggestions of travel and artistic fancies in gracefully-turned phrase , and is a creditable little book .

		Sometimes we come upon a curious semi - Swinburnian metrical effect , as in the following triplet : 41 Hum till I come to you , wild honey bees 1 Bide till I hide in yon , bloom-billowed seas !

		Save but a cave for me , Hesperides I '' More frequently we have such a sensuous nature - cameo as this : '' Majestic hills , whose lofty inspiration Broods o'er the soul until it upward springs ; A languid clime , where passion 's exaltation Like wine the blood to lyric frenzy stings ; And boundless seas that tempt imagination
Afar	LOCATION	from shore to try her petrel wings . ''

		It was only about three years ago that Mr.
Ernest McGaffey	PERSON	published his first book of poems , and revealed a mind in sympathy with many aspects of natural beauty , ' full of the lore of bird , and flower , and forest .

		A second volume from the same hand now recalls the first , and deepens the impression that it made .

		That the author does not take lightly the service of the Muse is evident from such heart - felt couplets as the following : '' Nay !

		dive thou deep in
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's heart , And tear her leaves and grass apart ; '' Wander thou forth in sun and rain To tread the paths of joy and pain ; '' Live , toil , and strive , and keenly scan The mystery of thy fellow-man ; '' And , most of all , know thou the spell Of Love 's high heaven and dungeoned hell , '' And then , if on thy natal morn A singer 's soul was in thee born , '' Perchance the anguish may be thine To touch the lips of song divine . ''

		If Mr.
McGaffey	PERSON	has not quite '' touched the lips of song divine , '' he has at least written gracefully and melodiously upon a considerable variety of themes .

		He is best in his treatment of nature , and there is not as much of nature in this collection as we could wish there had been .

		A favorable exam - ple of his work is this stanza : '' On
summer	DATE	nights the yellow stars Shine through the watches held on high , Suspended from the countless spars Of cloud-fleets anchored in the sky , And wafted past upon the breeze Slow winding down from distant heights There comes the roll of far-off seas On
summer	DATE	nights . ''

		This bit of easy verse is typical of the whole .

		The author is too fluent a writer to touch the deeper chords of feeling , and a large fraction of his work bears no evidence of the labor limce that no poet should spare , even in his least ambitious flights .

		The Rev.
F. W. Gunsaulus	PERSON	, in his `` Songs of
Night	TIME	and Day , '' has experimented in many forms of versification , without attaining to mastery in any of them .

		He is at his best in such a simple strain as '' Harvest and Hope , '' from which these stanzas are taken : '' The tall dry reeds that pipe with tune What time the lyric breezes come , Were erstwhile flower-crowned loves of
June	DATE	, Yet in their richer days were dumb . ''

		Dear days agone , when all my world Of dream and truth and love 's desire Lay like a blossom closely whorled Within a soft green vase of fire 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, '' Freed now by blooming , through the days Of
summer	DATE	sun and
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's need I blame not any strange delays ; Life comes at length to be a seed . ''

		Beyond the white and stormful dearth , Through snows and rain , comes fairy Spring ; Then autumn-seed will greet warm earth , And dear old birds again will sing . ''

		Unfortunately , Mr.
Gunsaulus	PERSON	is not often as good as this .

		Much of his work is mere pretentious ver - biage , with little display of rhythmical art , and some of his pieces are too obviously occasional with all of haste and crudity that the term implies to deserve preservation .

		. '

		The modest disclaimer which prefaces '' Under the Pines and Other Verses '' `` They have no plan , no moral hid , No prize for one who delves ; They came from out a happy heart , And seemed to sing themselves '' is enough to disarm criticism , even with the critic who feels it his first duty to detect flaws of work - manship .

		Having never construed criticism to mean that ungrateful task , we are all the more free to welcome these simple and unaffected lyrics .

		They breathe many a tender sentiment , and point many a minor moral , in verse that is smooth and refined .

		These lines to ''
September	DATE	'' are as good as any - thing that we can select . ''

		While autumn days grew brown and old , A wizard delved in mines of gold ; No idler he , by night , by day , He smiled and sang and worked away .

		And , scorning thrift , with lavish hand He cast his gold across the land . ''

		The maples caught it ere it fell ; Witch-hazel turned before its spell ; The goldenrod 's high plumes of green Were feathered with its yellow sheen ; While barberry bush and bitter-sweet Wore berries golden as the wheat . ''

		A graver note is sounded in an unusually successful paraphrase of the Ninetieth Psalm : '' Lord , thou hast been our dwelling-place Through generations past ; Before the mountains were brought forth , While earth was chaos vast ; Thou art from everlasting known To everlasting God alone . ''

		The imaginative note is boldly sounded in '' The Tower , '' which prefaces Mrs.
Nason	PERSON	's collection of poems , and recurs frequently in the pages that fol - low . ''

		I am the tower of Belus the tower of old am I !

		Under the rifting lines of the gloaming 's tremulant sky , Under the shifting signs of the ages circling by , I stand in the might of the mighty the tower of Belus , I ! ''

		Mrs.
Nason	PERSON	's strains are not all trumpet-blasts like the above , and we soon come upon contrasting pass - ages , such as are offered by a '' Slumber Song '' : '' Calm , un impassioned in thy wide dominions ,
Wilt	PERSON	thou relentless stay , and staying keep The restful shadows of thy purple pinions Aloof from mortals , sweet goddess , Sleep ? ''

		We know the twilight brought thy soft caresses , But toil forbade us , and we might not rest ; We saw white poppies braided in thy tresses , We breathed their fragrance , leaning on thy breast ; '' We dared not stay , lest , drowsy at its coming , We mock the midnight and the watch was set ; We longed to clasp thee , but some chill , benumbing Presence withheld us , and withholds us yet . ''

		We should like to give other examples of the au - thor 's strong and melodious work , particularly the beautiful poem '' Transmigration , '' or a part of the Homeric suggestion entitled `` Two Faces , '' but enough has been quoted to illustrate the quality of a singer who has been happy in the selection of her themes , and singularly effective in finding for them suitable expression .

		The volume is one of the most noteworthy of the season .

		Mention of Mr.
Savage	PERSON	's '' First Poems and Frag - ments '' has been long delayed , but it shall be none the less cordial for that .

		Mr.
Savage	PERSON	is a lover of nature in the truest sense ; other minor poets allow their fancy to play with nature , and attune them - selves to it with more or less of effort , but the pres - ent writer penetrates into its deepest moods , and writes of it with almost Wordsworthian passion .

		Listen to him for a moment : '' I have learned More from the hush of forests than from speech Of many teachers , more of joy at least , And that quick sympathy where joy has birth ; A thousand times called outward from myself By life at every point , ten thousand things Speaking at once in tones so sharp and sweet Their voice was pain , but pain as life is pain Beneath the over-chorus of the sky ; In silence finding joy to know myself Deep in the heart of nature and the world . ''

		Mr.
Savage	PERSON	's poems are sonnets , groups of quat - rains or other stanzas , and snatches of rhymed or unrhymed heroics ; they are carefully wrought , for the most part , and even when they are not , there is always some felicitous phrase to arrest the attention .

		The volume , for a first one , is more than promising ; it represents a considerable measure of solid achieve - ment .

		A sheaf of sonnets , impressions de voyage , and dainty conceits , together with a long poem called '' The Old-Fashioned Garden , '' make up the con - tents of Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	's modest volume .

		It is nearly all good work , albeit conventionalized and literary of inspiration , and the title-piece is really a lovely poem .

		We may find room for a single stanza : '' Nor lacks there music in this lovely close , The music of the oriole 's soft lute , The gush of cadenced melody that flows And echoes from the blue-bird 's fairy flute ; And here beside the fountain 's mossy brink There rings the lilting laughter of the happy bobolink . ''

		This stanzaic form almost amounts to a new discov - ery .

		Its effect , repeated nearly fifty times , is inde - scribable ; the lengthened closing verse seems to react upon the preceding heroics , and to bestow upon them a new and entrancing rhythmic movement .

		The characteristic things in Mr.
Roche	PERSON	's '' Bal -
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 lads of Blue Water '' are long poems descriptive of episodes in naval warfare , and can not be illustrated by a brief quotation .

		Suffice it to say that they are stirring , but not noticeable for finish or poetical dic - tion . ''

		A Business Transaction '' is the amusing story of a sea-fight between the French and the Dutch , in which the Frenchman , having run short of powder , buys a fresh supply from his opponent , and fights merrily on until overpowered . ''

		The great States-General , solemn folk , When old Van Dam came home next day , With his prizes in tow , forgave the joke , Or never perceived it who can say ? ''

		There is some excellent fooling in '' A Sailor 's Yarn , '' which opens with these stanzas : '' ' T was the good ship Gyascutus , All in the
China	LOCATION	seas , With the wind a-lee and the capstan free To catch the
summer	DATE	breeze . '' '

		T was Captain
Porgie	PERSON	on the deck , To his mate in the mizzen hatch , While the boatswain bold , in the forward hold , Was winding his larboard watch . ''

		After this overture we need not be surprised at any - thing .

		Mr.
Joseph O'Connor	PERSON	writes from experience of men and books , and has an eye for a poetic theme , but his treatment does not often rise to the height of the occasion . ''

		Bringing the Fire from
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	, '' for example , is a great subject , and calls for less pedestrian and commonplace verse than this : '' They set within
Diana	PERSON	's fane a simple stone to say Who ran to
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	and returned within a single day : A gallant course !

		Who would not wish for strength and skill so tried ?

		For loyalty and will to hold the path until he died ?

		For powers so disciplined to do the bests of strong desire ?

		And best of all to run for Man and carry sacred fire ! ''

		A number of poems inspired by our Civil War oc - cupy the forefront of this collection , and into them the author has put much of his best work . ''

		Apples of Istakhar '' is the title given by Mr.
William Lindsey	PERSON	to his poems , and explained by the following quatrain : '' Life , like the apples of old Istakhar , A fruit half sweet , half bitter-baned doth bring ; Shade-cursed and sun-caressed by turns they were ; Shade-cursed and sun-caressed the songs I sing . ''

		Writing of '' A Chance Shot , '' the author says : '' I shot an hundred arrows carefully , And hit not once the disk of yellow gold ; I pierced it after , shooting fast and free , With hurried aim an arrow bent and old . ''

		In vain I labored with an earnest pen To tell the truth a sunlit second found ; Long after came a careless mood , and then A few fit words the prisoned truth unbound . ''

		The application of this parable to Mr.
Lindsey	PERSON	's verse is not exactly that he is most successful where least careful , for his pages are often marred by neg - lect of the most elementary principles of verse - writing , but rather that he does not hit the target very frequently .

		It seems to us that he has hit it in '' The Cross , '' a sonnet . ''

		Two rough-hewn timbers , crossed against the sky ; An awful form outside the city gate ; A ghastly sign of vengeance and of hate , To fright the errant slave 's averted eye ; The last harsh
Couch	LOCATION	, whereon pale Crime doth lie , Seeking in vain a glance compassionate ; Symbol of death most dreadful dealt by Fate , Until , one
April day	DATE	, they lift on high '' A thorn-crowned
King	PERSON	, who dies upon a cross , Then bows a world before the sign of death , The curse is changed to blessing in a breath ; Its gleaming red lines knightly shields emboss ; On woman 's breast it lies ; no day dawns bright .

		But gilds a cross-crowned temple with its light . ''

		Many of Mr.
Lindsey	PERSON	's pieces are in light vein , and embody sentimental conceits in a pleasing way .

		And there is a note of sincerity in his work that partly atones for the technical shortcomings . ''

		The Oaten Stop '' series is the title given by the publishers to a collection of small volumes of Amer - ican verse , announced to appear at irregular inter - vals .

		The first two volumes of this series are at hand , being Mr.
Richard Burton	PERSON	's '' Dumb in
June	DATE	'' and Miss
Zitella Cocke	PERSON	's '' A Doric Reed . ''

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	's pieces are for the most part mere snatches of song , in which the graver notes of the '' lyric cry '' are distinctly discernible . ''

		There is only rest and peace In the City of Surcease From the failings and the waitings ` neath the sun , And the wings of the swift years Beat but gently o'er the biers , Making music to the sleepers every one .

		There is only peace and rest ; But to them it seemeth best , For they lie at ease and know that life is done . ''

		The author 's mind is richly resonant to the notes of natural beauty , as the following autumnal stanza will illustrate : '' Now is the year 's recessional , for though Her robes are richer wrought than in the
spring	DATE	, What time the proud procession paced slow Up the vast church of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's fashioning , Soon moans these pulsing pomps left far behind Down unillumined aisles the requiem wind . ''

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	's work is promising , although he has not been quite successful as yet in differentiating the diction of the poet from that of the prosateur .

		Miss
Cocke	PERSON	's verses are upon the level of ordi - nary magazine poetry , dealing with familiar themes in a way too graceful to give offence , yet never arousing more than an emotional ripple .

		A favor - able specimen is `` The Comfort of the Pines . '' ''

		I fain would seek that brotherhood , The monastery of the wood ; Earth-bound and tempest-tossed , yet given The blessed calm and peace of heaven !

		`` Tall hooded monks , in solemn band , Uplifting prayerful arms they stand , Intoning whispered orison And glad triumphant antiphon . ''

		Miss
Cocke	PERSON	, like all other versifiers nowadays , writes sonnets , and a group devoted to several of the great musical composers evinces a genuine love of music .

		She even ventures a sonnet upon the sonnet , comparing it successively with a jewel , a 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, magic flute , a wreathed shell , a rose , and a night - ingale .

		It is very well done , especially the ending , '' A captive nightingale in golden bars , Singing a song of rapture to the stars . ''

		Three Canadian singers come last upon our list .

		The poems of Miss
Johnson	PERSON	derive an adventitious interest from the fact that they are written by an Indian girl , the daughter of a well-known Mohawk chief .

		As might be expected , these poems are dis - tinctly outdoor songs and ballads , and the barbaric strain of passion is not lacking .

		But they have also claims to consideration on their own account , for they display delicacy of sentiment and felicity of expression in a remarkable degree .

		We open the volume almost at random , and come upon such verse as this : '' The velvet air , stirred by some elfin wings , Comes swinging np the waters and then stills Its voice so low that floating by it sings Like distant harps among the distant hills . '' ''

		Velvet air '' is a locution of which any poet might be proud , and it is but typical of the turn of phrase that enables many of these pieces to produce a really striking effect .

		We like particularly '' The Flight of the Crows , '' from which one stanza may be taken . ''

		O'er what vast lakes that stretch superbly dead , Till lashed to life by storm-clouds , have they flown ?

		In what wild lands , in laggard flight have led Their aerial career unseen , unknown , ' Till now with twilight came their cries in lonely mono - tone ? ''

		Mr.
Douglas Campbell Scott	PERSON	's volume deserves far more attention than our space permits upon the present occasion , and a few words of emphatic and cordial praise must stand for the detailed examina - tion of its beauties that it would be a pleasure to make .

		Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's poems are mainly nature-lyrics , and often attain to marked nobility of imaginative diction , as in these lines to Winter : '' Then heap this sombre shoulder of the world With shifting bastions ; let thy storm winds blare ; Drift wide thy pallid gonfalon unfurled ; And arm with daggers all the desperate air . ''

		Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	, too , deserves better of us than this tag-end of an over-grown article , although one feels , in the case of his new volume as in the case of his earlier one , that his best work is still left un - collected .

		What he gives us just now is something less than a score of pieces ; some so lacking in fin - ish and lucidity that it seems a pity they should have been published , others carefully thought out and har - monized , and all charged with poetic energy of high potential .

		`` Beyond the Gamut '' is a long and beautiful poem , musical in theme and treatment , beneath which we should hardly be surprised to see the signature of
Robert Browning	PERSON	.

		This poem will not bear excision , but we may do such violence to '' Hack and Hew '' without serious danger to its vitality : '' Hack and Hew were the sons of God In the earlier earth than now ; One at his right hand , one at his left , To obey as he taught them how . ''

		And Hack was blind , and Hew was dumb , But both had the wild , wild heart ; And God 's calm will was their burning will , And the gist of their toil was art . ''

		They made the moon and the belted stars , They set the sun to ride ; They loosed the girdle and veil of the sea , The wind and the purple tide . ''

		Mr.
Carman	PERSON	has shown himself many times to be possessed of the true afflatus ; he has also shown himself capable of much hasty and ill-considered work .

		The patient toil of the file is what he most needs to practise , and those who wish him well can - not but view with apprehension his willingness to print work that is entirely unworthy of his better enms *

		BRIEFS osr NEW BOOKS .

		For many years past Miss
Eliza Allen Starr	PERSON	has been an important factor in the intellectual life of Chi - cago , having in many ways contributed to the ad - vancement of the city in culture .

		Her work , whether as a writer , a lecturer , or a social influence , has been quietly and unobtrusively performed , but has earned the gratitude not only of the large circle of her personal friends , but also of all who have had at heart the growth of an interest -LRB- so sadly needed in
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- in the things of the spirit .

		As a liter - ary worker , for example , she has published , in '' Songs of a Lifetime , '' one of the most graceful and genuine books of verse that have yet come from this huge human hive .

		It is , however , as a lec - turer upon the history of art , and particularly of Christian art , that her activity has been most note - worthy , and it is in connection with this phase of her work that she has just published the sumptuous volume to which we now wish to call attention .

		All visitors to the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	are of course familiar with the frescoes of
Raphael	PERSON	in the Camera della
Seg	ORGANIZATION	- natura the four symbolical figures representing Theology ,
Poesy	LOCATION	,
Justice	ORGANIZATION	, and Philosophy , with the accompanying paintings of the Dispute , the School of
Athens	LOCATION	,
Parnassus	LOCATION	, and Jurisprudence .

		Miss
Starr	PERSON	's book , which is entitled '' Three Keys to the Camera della Segnatura of the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	, '' and is published by the author , gives us half-tone repro - ductions of these eight frescoes , with descriptive text , and , what is more to the point , includes outline drawings intended to serve as `` keys '' to all of the groups except the Jurisprudence , in which all the figures but two are purely symbolical .

		The author has taken much pains with her identifications , and has followed good authorities for the most part .

		She has accepted a few comparatively recent sug - gestions in this matter of identification , the substitu - tion of
Simonides	PERSON	for the traditional
Ovid	LOCATION	, for ex - ample , in the
Parnassus	LOCATION	, this upon the authority of the late
Heman Allen	PERSON	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		Miss
Starr	PERSON	lays no claim to credit for original investigation in
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 117 her work , '' the discriminating , conscientious follow - ing of acknowledged authorities heing the only ground upon which I could venture to present it to the public or to those who have the care of educa - tional interests everywhere . '' ''

		How many stand be - fore these pictures in the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	, '' she says , '' with - out recognizing more than a few prominent person - ages , and without any clear idea of the intention of the artist in their arrangement , the story of the hu - man mind and the grand march of intellect through all ages , so wonderfully set forth in them , being , in consequence , wholly or almost lost . ''

		The '' keys '' now provided will enable a student to examine the paintings , or reproductions of them , intelligently , and many lovers of art will be grateful to
Miss Starr	LOCATION	for affording them this needed assistance .

		We should add that the work is a quarto , beautifully printed , and highly creditable , from the mechanical standpoint , to Western bookmaking .

		A romance ^ r '
Samuel Hubbard Scudder	PERSON	is from the world widely known in American science of butterfly .

		ag the aut hor of an exhaustive work on the '' Butterflies of the
Eastern United States	ORGANIZATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	. ''

		Its cost necessarily limits its distri - bution and usefulness to the few fortunate ones who are able to obtain it .

		For the benefit of the general reader , the author has recast into a single volume the most interesting and detachable portion of his elaborate treatise , and presented the new work un - der the attractive title of '' Frail Children of the Air '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The sections thus severed from their context are complete in themselves , while each is independent of the rest .

		As a whole , they con - vey a comprehensive idea of the character or history of the most conspicuous and lovely group in the entire insect tribe .

		We are wont to consider but - terflies as stupid creatures , living their lives , pursu - ing their ends , with the smallest stock of sensibility and intelligence .

		But Mr.
Scudder	PERSON	corrects this false opinion , by attributing to them astonishing quali - ties .

		He goes so far as to treat of the psychology of a butterfly , giving an entire chapter to the novel subject .

		He even speaks of their individual tem - perament , and of their ability to become compan - ionable to humankind , or at least of their attempt to become so .

		They have their playful moods , it would seem , in which they sport with each other as lambs and kittens do .

		Some of the species are noted for their pugnacious disposition .

		The Amer - ican Coppers -LRB- Heodes hypophlceas -RRB- Mr.
Scudder	PERSON	pronounces actually vicious .

		Some species are timid by nature , others fearless , and others cunning .

		It excites a desire to begin an immediate study of these flying flowers , to discover for oneself their remarkable capacities .

		The wondrous creatures , it appears , have a keen and delicate sense of smell , detecting odors unperceived by human beings ; but , what is equally strange , their sense of vision is dull .

		They recognize color only in masses , it is supposed ; hence the beauty of their wings can not have resulted from natural selection , as
Darwin	PERSON	argued .

		Certain species are capable of emitting aromatic odors , agreeable and otherwise , and others are able to pro- duce clicking or rustling sounds by striking their wings together when mentally -LRB- ? -RRB-

		excited .

		The eggs of butterflies under the microscope reveal fea - tures of wonderful beauty .

		Mr.
Scudder	PERSON	even talks of the '' butterflies as botanists , '' but then he is an enthusiast and few who read this fascinating book will wish him otherwise .

		Stories and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's complaint of the sketches of profound Gemeinheit of our Amer -
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		j can C j t j e8 must haye been mo difi e d by an emphatic exception had he visited New Or - leans ; for the
Crescent City	ORGANIZATION	certainly possesses a fair measure of the aesthetic charm which is born of a storied past , picturesque traditions , variety and richness of local color , and an exterior not yet ground down to the purely industrial and utilitarian dead level .

		In her ''
New Orleans	LOCATION	: The Place and the People '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Miss Grace King sketches the history of her native place , and sounds its praises with pardonable enthusiasm .

		In the first , and to our thinking decidedly the best , half of the volume the treatment is historical ; after this the writer lapses gradually into the descriptive , anecdotal , and reminiscential , giving her pen the loose rein , and leaving the reader little room for doubt as to her personal leanings during the '' late unpleasantness . ''

		The opening chapters sketch concisely the history of the early
Mississippi River	LOCATION	explorations , the colonization of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, the founding of
New Orleans	LOCATION	, and the rapidly shifting fortunes of the city under the successive French , Spanish , and early American domination .

		An interesting chap - ter is devoted to the buccaneers , and a stirring and graphic , if slightly flamboyant , one to
Jackson	PERSON	's de - feat of the British in
1815	DATE	.

		The story of New Or - leans during the Civil War is entertainingly told , due justice being rendered to
General Butler	ORGANIZATION	's somewhat drastic pacificatory measures from which , it seems , recalcitrant fair ones were by no means exempt , the
General	ORGANIZATION	ungallantly acting up to his famous maxim , '' The venom of the she-adder is as dangerous as that of the he-adder . '' ''

		The little children in
New Orleans	LOCATION	, '' the author says , '' when they are very good , are treated by their grand - mothers , not to the thrilling adventures of
Blue Beard	ORGANIZATION	, but to tales of the
Federal General	ORGANIZATION	in com - mand of the city during the war . ''

		The book is ac - curate and gracefully written , and the illustrations , by Miss
Frances E. Jones	PERSON	, are acceptably done .

		Fallacies of race theories .


William Dalton Babington	PERSON	's ''
Falla	PERSON	- cies of Race Theories '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is a well-written and interesting little book , consisting of seven essays upon historical sub - jects , intended to prove that what are usually called national characteristics are variable and acquired rather than inherited .

		As a whole , the essays are a protest against the extreme view , so well exem - plified in
Mommsen	LOCATION	, that race or national pecu - 118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, liarity is the potent factor in history .

		Babington has died since these essays were written , and Mr.
H. H. G. MacDonnell	PERSON	has arranged the material for publication in hook form .

		In his preface the editor says of the author : '' He denies ... -LSB- that -RSB- the present qualities of groups of men -LSB- are -RSB- almost wholly dependent on those of their ancestors long centuries before , and ... have been transmitted by heredity down to this generation , from the re - mote past .

		It should be observed , however , that he does not enter at all ... into the very different question how far merely physical peculiarities are transmitted . ''

		These statements and quotations suf - ficiently indicate the purpose and character of the book .

		In it , many bright things deserving careful consideration are said .

		The argument is , however , as extreme as the theories opposed , and will as little stand criticism .

		Hatred of German claims -LRB- quite justified , we believe -RRB- leads to constant tacit admis - sion of what in argument he constantly denies viz. , the existence of some true Germanic characteristics .

		The admission by the editor -LRB- and presumably by the author -RRB- that there exist well marked and hered - itary ethnic physical types , necessitates logically the admission of associated ethnic mental types .

		The minds of widely diverse physical types must differ .

		That nation is not a synonym of race , everyone ought to recognize ; almost everyone but Germans do recognize it .

		Not every man born in
England	LOCATION	will present a definite English type .

		Many peoples have dwelt in
England	LOCATION	, and are to-day mingled in its population .

		But the physical types of these peo - ples still exist ; with each is a mental type equally persistent .

		To underrate this is as great a blunder as to overstate it .

		The book is a deserved rebuke to a misused historical method ; but after perusing it , the reader will do well to take a little of
Beddoe	PERSON	and
Miss Simcox	LOCATION	.

		Most readers will turn to
Kenan	PERSON	's short eu lgy of his sister -LRB- '' My Sis - ter Henrietta '' :
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- with more curiosity as to
Kenan	PERSON	than as to her whom the vol - ume especially commemorates .

		And most readers , too , as they go on , will be more interested in
Kenan	LOCATION	than in his sister , and at the end will probably have a more adequate idea of him than of her .

		The book has many of the qualities of his genius : it has touches of his sensibility , of his creative imagina - tion , of his somewhat patronizing analysis ; here and there it has the glow of his style .

		But it quite fails , we must think , to give us a vitalized concep - tion of his sister .

		His sister , he tells us , was an elect soul , a woman of extreme distinction of char - acter and fineness of appreciation , a woman distin - guished , even remarkable , although unknown .

		So much can the historian inform us in black and white ; but it needs more to make us thoroughly realize the character of which he speaks , to make it alive for us with all the sweetness and power which he feels so strongly .

		And here , curiously enough , the great historian has not succeeded .

		He has not , in this short sketch , made his sister live once more for us , the exquisite , high-minded woman whom he remembers .

		She remains an abstraction ; we have here merely a note , a memorandum , which we must take on authority .

		Aside from this one point , the book has a great deal of interest , as we have already remarked , for the picture we have in it of the author himself .

		The reminiscences of his early days , of his studies , and of the development of his ideas , the old - time portrait by
Henri Scheff	PERSON	er , the sketches by
Ary Kenan	PERSON	of his Breton home and of his resting place in
Palestine	LOCATION	, the account of his sister 's last days and of his own illness , these , taken perhaps rather as one would take fiction than as one takes history , will give real pleasure to many who can be content without the fierce and fiery interest of modern ro - mance .

		For such readers there will be a delicate interest in the group of people whom we have here the privilege of seeing for a moment , a group where there was genius both in science and in art , but so very , so curiously , different from anything which we American readers are ever likely to know from experience .

		Mr.
Frank Preston Stearns	PERSON	's `` The Midsummer of Italian Art '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- , contains five scholarly and well-considered appreciations of the works and the distinctive gifts , of
Fra Angelico	LOCATION	,
Michel Angelo	PERSON	,
Leonardo da Vinci	PERSON	,
Raphael	PERSON	, and Corregio , together with an introductory paper on Mediaeval
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Stearns	PERSON	has plainly written con amore , and his work throughout bears the impress of delicate observa - tion and analysis .

		The volume contains five pho - tographic plates , which impress us -LRB- with one excep - tion , a lovely head after
Leonardo	PERSON	-RRB- as being , in point of execution , considerably below the merits and requirements of the text .

		Three brief papers are appended , in one of which the writer breaks a lance , on the subject of the
Sistine Madonna	ORGANIZATION	and the
Reading Madonna of Corregio	ORGANIZATION	, with that inge - nious critic ,
Giovanni Morelli	PERSON	scouting the latter 's statements as to the profuse restorations visible on
Raphael	PERSON	's matchless canvas , and refuting pretty effectually his absurd attribution of the
Reading Madonna to Van Der Werff	ORGANIZATION	.

		With all respect to his almost German erudition and conscientious pur - suit of truth in his special brand of art-criticism ,
Signer Morelli	PERSON	seems to us to have peered into a rather inexcusable number of mares ' - nests .

		Of the spirit of paradox , and ambition to upset long-current beliefs , we note no trace in Mr.
Stearns	PERSON	's pages .

		A , hort account '' Modern German Literature '' -LRB-
Rob	PERSON	- of modern erts -RRB- is the title of a pleasantly writ - em , * literature .

		tgn book by p ro fe
S3	ORGANIZATION	or
Benjamin W. Wells	PERSON	, the purpose of which , to quote the preface , is '' to further literary appreciation and enjoyment . ''

		The book is accordingly addressed , not to the spe - cialist , but '' to the great majority of our college students , '' and attempts to tell what a well-educated man cares to know about German literature .

		Per -
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 119 haps the author has fairly well accomplished this purpose .

		In view of the admirable translation of
Scherer	PERSON	's '' History of German Literature , '' how - ever , the raison d'etre of the first chapter , entitled '' The Origins , '' which in a compass of thirty-seven pages reviews the literary history of
Germany	LOCATION	down to the accession of Frederick the Great , may fairly he questioned .

		The treatment is certainly too hrief to satisfy even the general reader ; and especially , considering the title , the same space devoted to a survey of the political , intellectual , and moral con - dition of
Germany	LOCATION	in
1740	DATE	would have seemed in better proportion .

		The greater part of the book is devoted to Leasing ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and
Schiller	PERSON	.

		The ac - count of them is clear , and shows the author 's knowledge at first hand .

		It is said that
Grimm	PERSON	himself no longer insists upon his theory that the first thought of Iphigenie auf Tauris was due to
Gluck	PERSON	's request for the text of a cantata , and the author might well have emphasized the tragic neces - sity of '' Maria Stuart '' rather than its obvious pa - thos .

		The chapter on '' Faust '' is clear , and should prove to the student a useful analysis of the two parts of the drama .

		The treatment of
Heine	ORGANIZATION	is also satisfactory and suggestive .

		Indeed , it may fairly be said of the whole book that the author has realized his ambition of being '' helpfully suggestive to the lovers of pure literature . ''

		Wild places in
England	LOCATION	.

		The comely volume entitled '' Wild England of To-day '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
C. J. Cornish	PERSON	, is not unworthy of a niche in the library shelves beside the works of
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	; and indeed one could easily select passages from it that might well have come from the pen of the inspired naturalist of Cote Farm .

		There are , even in populous
England	LOCATION	, patches enough of the earth 's surface where Nature bids man keep his distance ; while since the repeal of the Corn Laws , and the consequent rise of what
Ricar	PERSON	- dians call the margin of cultivation , the increase of waste heath and pasture-land has gone on apace .

		The wild places described by Mr.
Cornish	PERSON	, under such chapter-headings as `` The Southern Cliffs , '' '' The Pine and
Heather Country	PERSON	, '' '' Surrey Scenes , '' '' Round the Great White Horse , '' '' In High Suf - folk , '' ''
Somersetshire Coombs	PERSON	, '' '' Climbing In En - gland , '' etc. , range broadly from the
Southern Cliffs	ORGANIZATION	to the
Yorkshire Fen	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr. Speed 's drawings are mostly spirited and well-conceived , while the purely photographic plates are notably good .

		For a friend who loves men like
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	and our own
John Bur	PERSON	- roughs , Mr.
Cornish	PERSON	's book will not be amiss .

		Still another school history of the
United States	LOCATION	is added to the recent excellent manuals of Messrs.
Fiske	PERSON	,
Thomas	PERSON	, and
Montgomery	ORGANIZATION	, by three Southern writ - ers ,
Messrs. Cooper	PERSON	,
Estill	PERSON	, and
Lemmon	PERSON	.

		The present work -LRB-
Ginn	PERSON	-RRB- differs from some of the his - tories used in the schools of the South , being schol - arly , temperate , and usually fair in the treatment A Southern school history .

		of disputed points .

		But the evident desire to avoid wounding the susceptibilities or encountering tha prejudices of Southerners has made the narrative colorless .

		This is , of course , infinitely better than a wrong or partisan coloring .

		Both sides are pre - sented , and presented as if they were both right ; the scholar who learns from this book will be able to be just to the other section , even if his confidence in his own side is not weakened .

		The authors have no special gift at presenting the solid matter of our history in such a way as to win the attention and interest of children ; and in this respect the book suffers by contrast with some of its rivals .

		The style is rather heavy , and the ordinary child of thirteen will be repelled by the dry paragraphs that would be excellent in a book addressed to adults .

		The maps , illustrations , and pedagogical apparatus are good , and will enable the good teacher to get excellent results from the book .

		Tennyson ^ n Professor
Hugh Walker	PERSON	's study
Browning	PERSON	, of three '' Greater Victorian Poets '' and
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- the author estimates
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	along with
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Brown	PERSON	- ing , on the ground that Arnold `` is so exquisite within his range that he can be placed nowhere ex - cept in the first rank . ''

		The order of the book is to follow the chronological consideration of the poe - try of each author , with a treatment of the relation of these poets to the spirit and thought of their time .

		Separate chapters are consequently devoted to illus - trating and discriminating their feeling for nature , the influence of contemporary science upon them , their social and political aspects , and finally the re - ligious faith and doubt of each , as found in their works .

		The method is that of the expositor , not the controversialist nor the appraiser .

		In general , statements are supported by the evidence of liberal quotation .

		The language , too , is clear and suffi - ciently exact .

		There are numerous examples of felicity of phrase , in which the point of view is set forth in a few vivid words .

		While the superior greatness in range , and possibly in power , of Ten - nyson and
Browning	PERSON	is acknowledged ,
Arnold	LOCATION	is discovered to be the poet of the three whose feeling for nature is most unalloyed , who shows most ob - viously the influence of the scientific appeal to rea - son , whose interest in society is always deep and strong , and who reflects most fully the skeptical tendencies of his age .

		He is called '' the poet of doubt , stretching his hands through the dark towards a faint far-away glimmer . ''

		No ordinary student of the Victorian era will fail to find his vision of these poets clearer , and his impressions better defined , after assimilating this book .

		The series of graphic papers on what JtSXSST * may be called the New South , written Southern sketches .

		120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, The book is an exceedingly readable one , lively , anecdotal , and picturesque , and a solidly-informing one withal containing a store of suggestive , well - verified facts as to the economic condition and pros - pects of a section of our country that now seems destined for a career of prosperous industrial activ - ity undreamed of under the past regime .

		The sal - ient aspects of life in this New South are presented by Mr.

		The stories are from the folk-lore and fairy tales of many nations , and take as wide a range as from the English nursery favorite , '' Les Trois Ours , '' to '' Une Drachme de Langue '' the Slavonic version of the an - cient story which appears in another form in Shake - speare 's '' Merchant of

Botanical Seminar of the University of Nebraska	ORGANIZATION	last
May	DATE	upon the subject of '' The Botan - ical Outlook . ''

		The address is now printed in pamph - let form , and in a limited edition , with one of the copies of which we have been favored .

		The main object of the address is to indicate the dangerous and the hope - ful tendencies of modern botanical research .

		The for - mer are described as the tendencies towards narrow - ness , towards certainty , to mistake power of acquisition for power to do something , to immature research , and to what the author calls '' ritualism . ''

		The latter are the tendencies to regard botany as a biological science , to study in the great laboratory of Nature , to specific demonstration , to use the imagination , and to regard plants as resultants .

		Upon each of these topics , the author delivers himself at length , preaching the sound - est of doctrine in the clearest and most forcible way .

		Many students and teachers of history will be grate - ful to the Directors of the Old South Work for repub - lishing their '' Old South Leaflets '' in volume form .

		They are bound together , twenty-five leaflets to a vol - ume , and two volumes have thus far been sent us .

		There will doubtless be enough for a third volume be - fore very long .

		It is an almost priceless boon to the teacher to place in his possession , at so moderate a price , these collections of original documents , and the good work deserves the most cordial recognition .

		Among recent French texts and manuals we note the following : An abridged edition of `` Les Misdrables '' -LRB- '' episodes and detailed descriptions only omitted '' -RRB- , edited by

Phila	LOCATION	- delphia on the thirtieth of
January	DATE	, having reached the great age of ninety-three .

		He was born in
Boston	LOCATION	,
April 20 , 1802	DATE	, and got his education in various '' dame 's schools , '' the Latin School ,
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Cambridge Theological School	ORGANIZATION	.

		As a child , he went to school with
Emerson	PERSON	, one year younger than himself .

		He was ordained in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	in
1825	DATE	, becoming the first regular pastor of the
First Unitarian Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		This pastorate he retained for just half a century , when he retired as pastor emeritus .

		During the troublous years preceding the Civil War , he made himself conspicuous as one of the leading champions of the abolitionist cause .

		His numerous writings were mostly of a religious char - acter , and had for their chief aim an interpretation of the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	which accepted the miracles as natural occurrences .

		He also published several trans - lations of German prose and poetry .

		His children in - cluded
William	PERSON	, an artist who died in early manhood , Dr.
Horace Furness	PERSON	, our great Shakespearian scholar , Mr.
Frank Furness	PERSON	, the architect , and Mrs.
Wister	PERSON	, who has translated and adapted so many German novels .

		In the '' Publishers ' Weekly '' for
January 25	DATE	may be found the annual summary of our literary output that has long been a distinctive feature of that indispensable journal .

		We glean from this laboriously-prepared com - pilation some facts of interest .

		The total number of book-titles for
1895	DATE	is 5469 , nearly a thousand more than for
1894	DATE	, and 335 in excess of
1893	DATE	, the most pro- ductive year hitherto known .

		The year
1895	DATE	was one for publishers rather than for authors , by which is meant that the increase was largely in the direction of reprints of standard literature .

		The figures for the three de - partments of literature proper , as compared with the corresponding figures for
1894	DATE	, make a startling show - ing .

		New fiction grew from 573 to
1050	DATE	, new poetry from 133 to 294 , and new '' literary history and miscel - lany '' from 208 to 455 .

		We are told that the '' new woman '' or '' anti-marriage '' novel '' reached its climax of repulsiveness during the year .

		The tide that carried this hybrid creature to our shores is receding , we are glad to note , as rapidly as it rushed in .

		The American literature of this class is as ephemeral as its writers , whose audacity alone gave them prominence for the moment .

		No American novelist known to fame needs as yet to blush for his literary offspring . ''

JAMES K. HOSMEB	PERSON	, author of '' Young Sir

$ 4.00	MONEY	.

		In this book Dr.
Hosmer	PERSON	adds to the obligations under which he placed us by his excellent works on
Young Sir Henry Vane	ORGANIZATION	and
Samuel Adams	PERSON	.


Hutchinson	PERSON	was the last of the Royal Governors of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and in many important respects the best .

		While loyal to the crown , he was steadfastly true to the best interests of the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	; but because he was a Loyalist he was obliged to withdraw from the country , and very scant justice has been done to his sterling virtues .

		Dr.
Hosmer	PERSON	's book is written with admirable fairness and from full informa - tion ; it adds materially to our knowledge of the Revolutianary era , and restores Governor
Hutchinson	PERSON	to his rightful place , both as a thoroughly capable magistrate and a thoroughly noble man .

		Anyone interested in studies that relate immediately to the highest welfare of mankind , personal and social , can not fail to see at once that here is a book which challenges , nay , most persuasively solicits , his earnest atten - tion ; and whoever knows the quality of Dr.
Harris	PERSON	's thinking , and the forcible grace of his style , will recognize in this announcement the promise of a work of remarkable value and profound attractiveness .

		The immediate impulse to the preparation of this volume arose in connection with a trip to
Greenland	LOCATION	by Professor
Wright	PERSON	in the
summer of 1894	DATE	on the steamer Miranda .

		While preparing to make the most of this excursion , much difficulty was encountered in collecting the facts which one would most like to know concerning this still mysterious land .

		The work , therefore , aims to give within modern limits a com - prehensive view of the scenery , the glacial phenomena , , the natural his - tory , the people , and the explorations of
Greenland	LOCATION	.

		The photographs , some sixty in number , are all original , and the maps have been prepared to show the latest state of knowledge concerning the region .

		His view is that the true remedy against crime is to remove individual defects and social disadvantages where it is possible to remove them .

		He shows that punishment has compara - tively little effect in this direction , and is apt to divert attention from the true remedy the individual and social amelioration of the popu - lation as a whole .

		147 THE CRITIC AS PICKER AND STEALER .

		Certain of the abuses of contemporary peri - odical criticism are energetically set forth by Mr.
William Knight	PERSON	in the
February	DATE	issue of '' The Nineteenth Century . ''

		Mr.
Knight	PERSON	's pa - per is entitled '' Criticism as Theft , '' and dis - cusses the various forms of filching , more or less disguised , by which the journalistic hack gets the attention of the public , and profits at the expense of those upon whom he preys .

		The author sometimes strains a point to bring the abuse with which he is at the moment occupied under the category of robbery , as when he says that the author who makes a valuable contri - bution to literature is entitled to a reward , and adds : `` If the return of that reward is pre - vented by capricious , or ignorant , or reckless criticism , the critic has stolen from the author , quite as truly as if he had robbed him of his purse . ''

		But if this practise is not theft , it is something quite as bad , and deserves all the censure bestowed upon it . ''

		The robbery of a just reputation is much more serious than is the theft of money , or of material property ; and the unjust praise and the false dispraise of the critic is one of the worst kinds of theft that this world has had to endure . ''

		Coleridge took much the same view of this matter when he thus characterized critics of the wantonly malignant type : '' No private grudge they need , no personal spite : The viva sectio is its own delight !

		All enmity , all envy , they disclaim , Disinterested thieves of our good name : Cool , sober murderers of their neighbor 's fame . ''

		The abuse becomes even more serious when not merely ignorance or reckless flippancy , but partisanship or personal bias inspires the review of some book .

		This is what Mr.
Knight	PERSON	says about it : '' Many a review philosophical , political , scientific , theological , and literary has hitherto been tainted with this bias .

		An a priori judgment has been passed on the mer - its of a book which the critic had not read .

		It has been judged by its title , its contents , its preface , or its author 's name .

		Every literary man must have seen scores of such notices , pert , opinionative , shallow , useless ; or , on the other hand , fulsome , and therefore worse than use - less . ''

		We may once more back Mr.
Knight	PERSON	's 130 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, opinion with a passage from
Coleridge	PERSON	this time a prose selection , but for that none the less vigorous in its impeachment . ''

		As soon as the critic betrays that he knows more of his author than the author 's publications could have told him ; as soon as from this more in - timate knowledge , elsewhere obtained , he avails himself of the slightest trait against the au - thor ; his censure instantly becomes personal injury , his sarcasms personal insults .

		He ceases to be a critic and takes on him the most con - temptible character to which a rational crea - ture can be degraded , that of a gossip , back - biter , and pasquillant : but with this heavy aggravation , that he steals the unquiet , the de - forming passions of the world into the museum ; into the very place which , next to the chapel and oratory , should be our sanctuary and se - cure place of refuge ; offers abominations on the altar of the Muses , and makes its sacred paling the very circle in which he conjures up the lying and profane spirit . ''

		Anyone who has occasion to do much reading in contem - porary criticism may often discern between the lines of a review some such syllogism as the following : No person holding certain opinions upon politics , or art , or religion , can possibly say anything worth heeding upon any subject whatsoever .


N. N.	ORGANIZATION	is a person holding such opinions .

		This book of his upon , let us say , hydraulic engineering , must therefore receive short shrift and no mercy .

		This illustrates , it is true , an exaggerated form of the evil under dis - cussion ; a more common form is that in which some unimportant passages in the book , obnox - ious to the critic , is singled out for attack , while the substance of the work is utterly ignored .

		Another form of current '' criticism , '' which comes nearer than those as yet mentioned to being theft in the literal sense , is thus de - scribed by Mr.
Knight	PERSON	: `` A critical ` notice , ' written to display mere deftness or nimble - ness of wit , ingenious repartee , power of sar - casm or rejoinder , is not criticism at all .

		Sup - pose a nimble - witted person skims a book ; turning its pages in a listless mood , he finds some information that is new to him .

		He notes this , and goes on to read more .

		He finds some errors , and then proceeds to use the informa - tion , which he has received from the book itself , against its author ; just as a clever surface society-talker , wholly ignorant of a subject , can often * pick the brains ' of one who knows it , while he is speaking , and give him back in a torrent of verbosity the very ideas he was slowly and modestly expressing . ''

		There is a good deal of this sort of fraudulent criticism afloat , and some writers acquire a critical reputation based almost wholly upon the cleverness with which they succeed in '' showing off '' with the subject of some book for a text .

		The passage just quoted reminds us of an incident recently related .

		A journalist who had seen a good many varieties of life at close quarters spent an evening with an eminent novelist .

		After a while , the novelist said to his guest : `` I want your opinion of a story I have just written . ''

		The story was read , and approval duly ex - pressed . ''

		But , '' said the journalist , '' the sub - stance of your story seems strangely familiar to me . '' ''

		Yes , '' replied the novelist , '' you told me the story yourself . ''

		Perhaps the only sort of '' criticism '' that may in the strictest sense be accounted theft is that in which the reviewer relies mainly upon the reviews already published by others of his craft .

		To parade as one 's own the opinions of others , to catch the drift of criticism as ex - pounded in the more authoritative journals , reproducing its leading ideas in slightly altered form , is a practice for which no defence is pos - sible .

		The critic who takes his profession se - riously will , of course , carefully refrain from reading what others have said of a book until he has framed his own independent judgment of the work in question , and even then will have to be constantly on his guard to resist the natural impulse to make his dicta conform to those which he can not keep from filtering into his consciousness in a hundred insidious ways .

		Even the shifting currents of public opinion upon the larger aspects of literary art are a constant source of danger to the critic , how - ever conscientious he may be .

		When current literature shows a distinct trend toward real - ism , or romanticism , or didacticism , or sexual - ism , it is difficult to avoid being swayed by the movement , however fixed may be the critic 's canons , and however stoutly he may be pre - pared to do battle for the lasting as against the ephemeral .

		We still get a good deal of bell - wether guidance , even from the best-intentioned , for critics are as gregarious as other people , and find it quite as hard to run counter to the prevailing literary fashions .

		With one part of Mr.
Knight	PERSON	's argument we are unable to agree .

		He condemns the review which is frankly descriptive and extractive on the ground that it is a theft from both author and public ; from the former because it injures his sales , from the latter because it deprives of the opportunity of knowing , '' in its integ -
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 131 rity , '' what the author has to say .

		It is a cu - rious logical twist that can find robbery in the act of summarizing a book for readers many of whom are too busy to get at it in any other way .

		As far as our observation goes , such precis-writing stimulates rather than retards the sale of the books selected for treatment ; the persons who are content to accept the part for the whole are mostly those who would never dream of purchasing the book concerned , while , on the other hand , the number of those who are by a skilful summary made curious to know the book , and actually purchase it , make up many times over for the few who might have become purchasers had it not been for the friendly offices of the reviewer in selecting for them enough of its contents to satisfy their curi - osity .

		So far are we from deprecating this form of review , that we wish there might be a great deal more of it .

		More , perhaps , than from any other cause , popular criticism suffers from the feeling of the critic that , however lacking in knowledge , he is bound to take the judicial attitude , and , instead of giving his readers an idea of what the book is really like , he must express a decided opinion upon its merits .

		As it is obviously impossible for the newspaper reviewer , called upon to deal with books upon all sorts of subjects , to have an opinion of any value concerning most of them , it would be a decided improvement for him to remain con - tent with the descriptive summary that almost any fairly intelligent person can make .

		In other words , the work of judicial and authori - tative criticism should be left to the reviews that can command the services of hundreds of specialists , and are known to entrust to com - petent hands the books sent to such reviews for examination .

		THE SONNET .

		As , poised on slender stem , some perfect rose Unfolds its delicate petals to the air , Till lo !

		a little rounded life is there , Amid the sweetness that its breath bestows ; Even thus , within the sonnet 's classic close , Beyond whose limits it may never fare , The thought should shape itself until it wear A rhythmic garb of tumult or repose .

		A sonnet is a lover 's laughing song ; A sigh , a symphony , a lyric brief ; A throb of mighty music from the sea ; It seeks the stars , or brook-like bounds along ; ' T is now a cry of passion-throated grief , And now an epic in epitome .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		`` THE MIDSUMMER OF ITALIAN ART . ''

		- SOME CORRECTIONS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have just finished reading Mr.
Frank Preston Stearns	PERSON	's `` Midsummer of Italian Art , '' a very enter - taining book , noticed in the last issue of THE DIAL .

		I do not wish to criticize the author 's criticisms , though some of them are sufficiently remarkable , for exam - ple , the criticism of
Raphael	PERSON	's '' Miraculous Draught of Fishes '' on the ground that the boat is too close to shore to catch respectable fish : a singular limitation upon our Lord 's miraculous powers .

		But there are some physical facts to which attention may be called .

		On page 50 , and again on page 80 , Mr.
Stearns	PERSON	states that the '' Head of the Medusa , '' attributed to
Leonardo da Vinci	PERSON	, is in the Tribune of the
Uffizi	LOCATION	.

		It is now in the second room you enter , far from the Tribune , and I have never seen it there .

		Was it ever in the Tribune ?

		On page 85 he says that
Michelangelo	PERSON	's ''
David	PERSON	'' was removed into the
Palazzo Vecchio	ORGANIZATION	some twenty years ago .

		The only removal recorded by history was its re - moval in
1873	DATE	to the
Accademia	LOCATION	, where it now stands .

		On page 96 he says that one of Michelangelo 's '' Cap - tives '' is in the
Louvre	LOCATION	and the other in the
Boboli Gar	LOCATION	- dens at
Florence	LOCATION	.

		Both pieces have been in the
Louvre	LOCATION	whenever I visited it , and as far as I can ascertain both have been in
France	LOCATION	since the reign of
Francis	PERSON	I. On pages 130 et seq. he says , in speaking of the Tombs of the Medici , that the statue called '' II Pensieroso '' is
Giuliano	PERSON	and the other
Lorenzo	LOCATION	.

		All other writers reverse this .

		Have the bones of these worthies been changed , or any new light thrown on the subject ?

		On page 233 he states that
Raphael	PERSON	's '' Dispute on the Sacrament '' is on the ceiling of the Stanza , and on page 234 he states that the altar in the picture is in the centre of the ceiling .

		When I was there last , a few months ago , it was still where
Raphael	PERSON	painted it , firmly frescoed on the side wall , while the ceiling was covered with other frescoes equally famous .

		Has an earthquake turned the venerable edifice upon its side ?

		On page 311 he says that from the windows of the Antecollegio in the Doge 's Palace , where are Tintor - etto 's '' Marriage of Bacchus and Ariadne '' and
Paul Veronese	PERSON	's `` Rape of Europa , '' you have a beautiful view of the
Adriatic	LOCATION	and the
Lido	LOCATION	.

		When I was there you could see nothing from the windows except the court-yard of the
Ducal Palace	ORGANIZATION	.

		If the rest of the building were thrown down -LRB- and I have not heard of such a disaster -RRB- you might see the
Adriatic	LOCATION	, but as these windows , which are on one side , turn away from the Lido I do not understand how that could be seen .

		In his preface the author says that he had years of study and experience before beginning to write the book ; but as I read these things , I wonder whether I have been wandering in a dream or the amiable author has written his book in the comfortable seclusion of a
New England	LOCATION	village without troubling himself to visit the places he writes about so well .

		SOME RECENT JAPANESE LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Three or four brief specimens of recent Japanese classic literature may possibly be of interest to the con - stituency of THE DIAL .

		The death of Prince
Kitashira	PERSON	- 132 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, kawa naturally called forth many literary memorials .

		One such production may be translated somewhat as follows : '' Alas !

		the water of ' the White River ' is gone forever , for man 's life is like a floating bubble , which soon disappears .

		We knew such an end would come to men ; but we did not expect it for the noble Prince so soon . ''

		Another lament over the death of that beloved Prince is attributed to the pen of Mr.
Konakamura	PERSON	, '' one of the best living authorities on Japanese classic litera - ture . ''

		This has been roughly translated as follows : '' Pitiable is the life of men .

		It is like the water of a flowing stream , which goes , but never returns .

		Troubles of sickness are common to all .

		Distinctions of rank make no difference here .

		The sad memories of the Prince are too many to be conceived of in our hearts , too great to be uttered by our tongues . ''

		A Japanese , writing in '' The
Japan	LOCATION	Evangelist , '' while commending the style of the original of this , condemns the general tenor of its thoughts as '' quite unsatisfactory as a healthy expression of sentiments awakened by such an occasion '' ; and he goes on to contrast very forcibly the despair and pessimism of these two productions with the optimism and inspiring hopefulness of Tennyson 's '' Ode on the Death of the Duke of

		The first of the

Hallam	PERSON	was then at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and Hunt was editing '' The Tatler . ''

		The former wrote : '' Will you excuse the liberty that a perfect stranger to you takes in sending you two little volumes of Poetry , with which I can not but think you will be pleased ?

		They are the compositions of two brothers , both very young men , and both intimate friends of mine .

		The larger volume was reviewed in the last number of ' The Westminster Review ' -LRB- I believe by Dr.

		Now in this church you have preferment , and what you preach will be considered by the faithful as a sound form of words ... '' The second
Hallam	PERSON	letter -LRB- 1832 -RRB- , thanking Hunt for a copy of the '' Masque of Anarchy , '' contains an allusion to an episode of
Cambridge	LOCATION	life familiar to lovers of
Shelley	LOCATION	, and known as the Revival of
1829	DATE	: '' While at
Cambridge	LOCATION	I partook largely in the en - thusiasm which animated many of my contemporaries , and indeed formed us into a sort of sect in behalf of his character and genius .

		If I have since somewhat tem - pered that enthusiasm in so far as it extended to some of his peculiar opinions , I have not ceased , and shall not , to regard him as one of the most remarkable men and greatest poets whom this country has produced ... '' Of the '' Landor-Blessington Papers '' -LRB- let - ters , and pieces in verse and prose lavished by the poet on his fair correspondent for use in her Annuals -RRB- the chief constituent is a literal transcript from a bundle of papers in
Landor	ORGANIZATION	's autograph .

		On some of these documents biog - raphers have already drawn , and much of the verse has been collected into Landor 's Poetical Works .

		It may be noted here , touching Lan - dor 's '' Citation and Examination of
William Shakespeare	PERSON	, '' the manuscript of which he sent to Lady
Blessington	PERSON	, in care of
N. P. Willis	PERSON	, that while her ladyship derived yearly from her '' Keepsakes '' and '' Books of Beauty '' an in - come of .1000 to 2500 , she was unable to get the '' Citation '' printed except at the au - thor 's cost .

		Some of the letters to Lady Bless - ington are rather in the '' Boy thorn '' vein , notably one giving vent to some explosive views on social progress a theme , be it said , which the writer was singularly unfit to handle : '' ... He -LRB- Dr.
Verity	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- tells us , what I can not think , that civilization has always been progressive .

		I am unde - ceived in the belief that I have powers deeply to inter - est , or substantially to improve , mankind .

		How far my conduct and my opinions have rendered the zeal and ardor with which I have engaged in the attempt inef - fectual , I know not .

Naples	LOCATION	, dated
Dec. 22 , 1818	DATE	,
Shelley	PERSON	draws a comparison between the social and human
Italy	LOCATION	, and what may be termed the Byronic or the
Goethean Italy	LOCATION	, in which the chiaroscuro is amusingly strained : '' ... There are two Italics one composed of the green earth and transparent sea , and the mighty ruins of ancient time , and aerial mountains , and the warm and radiant atmosphere which is interfused through all things ; the other consists of the Italians of the present day , their works and ways .

		The one is the most sub - lime and lovely contemplation that can be conceived by the imagination of man ; the other is the most degraded , disgusting , and odious .

		What do you think ?

		Young women of rank actually eat you will never guess what garlick !

		Our poor friend Lord
Byron	PERSON	is quite cor - rupted by living among these people ; and , in fact , is going on in a way not very worthy of him . ''

		That his lordship added garlic-eating to his other Italian ate iniquities does not appear ; but we find
Shelley	PERSON	declaring in a later letter that '' particular dispositions in Lord
Byron	PERSON	's character render the close and exclusive inti - macy with him in which I find myself intoler - able to me . ''

		Shelley 's insensibility to music -LRB- a strange flaw in one of the most melodious of poets -RRB- is well known ; and one gathers from the following passage that he had , like
Tennyson	PERSON	, an imperfect appreciation of pictorial art : '' ... With respect to
Michael Angelo	PERSON	I dissent , and think with astonishment and indignation of the common notion that he equals , and in some respects exceeds ,
Raffaele	PERSON	.

Sixtine Chapel	LOCATION	seems to me deficient in beauty and majesty , both in the conception and the execution .

		It might have con - tained all the forms of terror and delight and it is a dull and wicked emblem of a dull and wicked thing .

		Jesus Christ is like an angry pot-boy , and God like an old ale-house keeper looking out of window .

		He has been called the Dante of painting ; but if we find some of the gross and strong outlines which are employed in the most distasteful passages of the Inferno , where shall we find your
Francesca	PERSON	where the spirit coming over the sea in a boat , like Mars rising from the vapors of the horizon where Matilda gathering flowers , and all the exquisite tenderness , and sensibility , and ideal beauty , in which
Dante	ORGANIZATION	excelled all poets except Shake - speare ? ''

		The Herculean forms that still loom in their craggy grandeur from the smoke-dimmed vault of the
Sixtine Chapel	ORGANIZATION	certainly have little in common with the exquisite , aBriform shapes which peopled the reveries and haunt the verse of
Shelley	LOCATION	; and one may reasonably find them lacking in grace , and even in beauty .

		But to pronounce the works of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	defi - cient in majesty of conception and execution seems a judgment too hollow to be imputed to imperfect sympathy alone .

Arnold	PERSON	's '' beautiful and ineffectual an - gel '' was erratic

		Home was a man of varied talents , and , while it can scarcely be said of him , as
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	said of Dek - ker , that '' he had poetry enough for anything , '' he wrote some good verse that has been unduly slighted by the anthologists .

		We may perhaps agree with our editors who predict that '' sooner or later he , who enjoyed much well-merited fame of many sorts in his day , will have ' one day more . ' '

		: In the present volume Home 's '' Ballad of
Delora	LOCATION	, or the Passion of
Andrea Como	PERSON	, '' a romantic production greatly praised by
Browning	PERSON	, is printed entire . ''

		Delora '' seems to us a singular mingling of fire and fus - tian , elevation and bathos gold and dross in pretty even proportions .

		But there is a fine ballad ring , a strain of wild harmony and wilder passions , in the quaint stanzas ; and we are glad to see them rescued from obscurity .

Nicoll	PERSON	's work will probably comprise six volumes ; but these will be separately indexed , and each may be regarded as complete in itself .

		Even such unlovely sentiments as French chauvinism and English jingoism , and their German equivalent , are working out for the world beneficent results that may per - haps induce us to view their existence with tol - eration if not with satisfaction .

		What are the questions about which the Great Powers con - tinue to excite themselves the balance of power between the nations of
Europe	LOCATION	, the pos - session of small provinces , tariffs , and commer - cial rivalries but petty and insignificant as compared with the work of opening and pre - paring for civilization the vast regions of the Dark Continent ?

		Twenty years ago there were but two white men in
Central Africa	LOCATION	; to-day it is apportioned among the nations of
Europe	LOCATION	, each in its '' sphere of influence '' opening up routes of commerce , pushing forward railroads , putting steamers upon the lakes and rivers , stamping out the slave-trade , teaching the sav - ages the elements of civilization and order .


South Africa	LOCATION	has seen the same swift progress , mainly under the spur of British hunger for land and gold .

		No part of the continent , ex - cept
Morocco	LOCATION	and a portion of
Sahara	LOCATION	, is left without its European owner or protector .

		Such changes , so great and widespread , fur - nish material for a most interesting volume , and Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	has made good use of her opportunity in her work on ''
Europe	LOCATION	in
Africa	LOCATION	in the

		It would be ungracious to note flaws and deficiencies in the author 's work after the modest disclaimer of her preface ; and the task she set herself is so difficult that we can only be grateful for the useful book she has given us .

		Its usefulness and attractiveness are greatly enhanced by the three maps and twenty-three full-page portraits which the publishers have provided .

		Mr.
Ashe	PERSON	's book on
Uganda	LOCATION	is an excellent complement to Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	's general work .

		It is of about the same size , yet treats only of one little spot under the equator , giving in full detail those events and processes at which the general account can only hint .


Uganda	LOCATION	fur - nishes a typical example of the work of mis - sionaries , traders , explorers , and chartered companies , among a purely savage people .

		Three faiths have contended for supremacy in
Uganda Mohammedan	LOCATION	,
Roman Catholic	ORGANIZATION	, and Protestant ; and the strife of Arabs , French , and English has been keen , if not wholly ex - emplary .

		Heroic service has been performed by
Mackay	ORGANIZATION	,
Hannington	LOCATION	, and their associates , of whom Mr.
Ashe	PERSON	was one ; and much noble Christian character has been developed , faith - ful even unto death .

		Yet the story is almost throughout one of intrigue , cruelty , and war , the weak king and a great number of his fol - lowers becoming Protestant , Catholic , or Mo - hammedan , according as their greed or their passions were most liberally encouraged .

		The study of such a narrative makes one very doubtful whether this people , or any Cen - tral African peoples , can ever reach a high de - gree of civilization , or whether any immigrants to that region who can endure the climate of the torrid zone can maintain such civilization .

		The elements of civilization can supplant sav - agery ; slavery and the slave-trade can be abol - ished ; certain kinds of production can be de - veloped there ; but any large part of the world 's work can hardly be done in
Africa	LOCATION	, except in those regions north of the desert and south of the
Zambezi	LOCATION	.

		An instructive feature of this book is the light that it throws upon the methods of the chartered companies to which some of the pow - ers have committed the development and con - trol of their portions of the
Dark Continent	ORGANIZATION	.

		The irresponsible position of these companies , with the necessity upon their officers of making dividends or displeasing the directors , has led even well-disposed agents into courses of action that have greatly hindered the prime work of introducing civilization .

		It may have been nec - essary under existing conditions , but it was none the less unfortunate .

		Recent events have shown the same results in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		And one can not but feel the absurdity of making treaties , and applying the civilized theories of international relations to blood-thirsty savages , as was done in
Uganda	LOCATION	, and of making great interests depend upon such treaties .

		DANTE IN SPENSERIAN VERSE .

		* Dante is so great in the untranslatable qual - ities of style in musical successions of sylla - bles , in phrases which suggest the true thoughts by their sound that every new version of the
Divine Comedy	ORGANIZATION	needs an apology .

		It requires but a few weeks of easy work to learn enough Italian to read in the original this most stu - pendous art-work of the human spirit .

		Helps of all kinds abound , so that one may begin with no very heavy equipment of grammatical acquirement , and yet be able to appreciate the fine appropriateness in diction , the delicate and noble constructions , and , above all , the singing qualities of the poem .

		The scholar , and the lover of poetry who possesses leisure , will have none of your translations , being well aware that the exquisite essences of a poem can only by the greatest skill and the most remarkable good - luck be transferred from one language to an - other .

		A literal prose rendering they may indeed find useful as a help to understanding difficult passages .

		But for readers ignorant of Italian who wish to feel somewhat of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's beauty and power , a literal prose translation is disenchanting and wholly unsatisfactory .

		The only thing to be done for them is to make an - other poem , reproducing the general effect of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's as far as may be , and containing his thoughts as much as possible , but especially giving an impression of his symphonic move - ment , his volume of harmonious sound .

		Long - fellow 's versified and yet exceedingly literal rendering does not belong to either of these two classes , and it is difficult to see to whom it can be useful now .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 137 scholar who knows Italian .

		Yet to follow the original closely ,
Longfellow	PERSON	has often sacrificed grace and clearness , so that one has to refer to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	to translate the translation .

		Mr. Nor - ton 's prose version should supplant all met - rical ones in the use of scholars .

		And for a popular book , to be in the hands of persons who can not hope ever to taste the incommuni - cable poetical essences which are and must be lost in translation , Mr.
Musgrave	PERSON	has the right idea .

		His intention is to represent
Dante	PERSON	as much in the music of words and lines as in his thoughts .

		This is a translation for people who want to be pleased fully as much as they want to be instructed , and who will not receive in - struction unless it is pleasingly conveyed .

		For a poem which is not only epical but lyr - ical , the Spenserian stanza is a remarkably suitable form .

		It contains possibilities of har - mony within itself , second only to those in the sonnet .

		The oft-recurring and intricately in - terwoven rhymes enable it to ring with the en - during complexity of a musical chord ; while the length of the lines , and the additional syl - lables of the ninth , impart dignity and per - mit of a full slow cadence .

		It is less evident that this stanza is a good form for long narra - tives .

		For its adaptability to this purpose we have the testimony of
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's own successful employment of it , not to mention
Byron	PERSON	's .

		But we might as well admit that while it very well renders the lyrical music of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, it does not so happily reproduce the deep continuous orches - tration of his epical movement .

		The only form of verse which combines both properties is the terza rima which
Dante	ORGANIZATION	himself used .

		It is astonishing that English poets should venture still to try to render him in any other form .

		But the terza rima Mr.
Musgrave	PERSON	has '' dis - carded as too alien to the genius of the English tongue . ''

		Having seen fit to do this , he has made some amends by adopting the next best the one in which the combination of rhymes most nearly approaches terza rima .

		Linked and repeated rhymes are essential to any rep - resentation of the sound-effects of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		A translator in verse can not afford to throw away any means of musical charm , especially when the original is Italian , for by no possibility , using both rhyme and rhythm to the utmost , can he hope to equal the harmony of Italian poetry .

		Moreover , in rendering into verse , a process wherein personal inspiration must often be intermitted , there is needed all the artificial help available , and the constant stimulus of seeking rhymes is one of the two golden spurs with which the rider of the phantom
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	at the service of translators urges forward his unwilling steed .

		And to consider specially the requirements for translating
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, it must be borne in mind that there are certain effects of grotesqueness , and a wide range both of harsh and gentle notes , which the rhyme , because of its concreteness , is better able to express than metre , which bears the same relation to rhyme that

		Blank verse is out of the question .

		When made by an excellent poet in his hours of strength , there is no mightier music than En - glish blank verse .

		But the labor of a trans - lator can in few cases be limited to these rare intervals .

		It must go on through weak moods and strong .

		Rhyme will cheer up the tired spirits and put marching humor into weary feet .

		That which in a work of creation might be a vexatious cause of delay is indispensable in a work of artifice .

		Critics who forget the wants of common , busy people , may deal severely with Mr.
Mus	PERSON	- grave for his occasional expansions or contrac - tions of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's ideas .

		But the strong point of this translation is one which makes it fit for readers on whom minute accuracy would be wasted ; it is a vigorous , musical rendering , in the spirit of mediaeval art .

		The rhymes are abundant and melodious ; the best of Mr.
Musgrave	PERSON	's effects are produced with triplets of feminine rhymes interlinked with the char - acteristic English masculine rhymes .

		The metre is sometimes bad .

		The English language has reached too great fixity for a poet to per - mit himself such licenses of ellipsis as Mr.
Mus	PERSON	- grave occasionally employs .

		There are also infelicitous and even incorrect translations .

		But this was inevitable .

MR. L. A. WADDELL	PERSON	'S work on '' Lamaism '' -LRB-
Allen	PERSON	,
London	LOCATION	-RRB- is one to make scholars of Northern Buddhism the so-called
Mahayana	LOCATION	school nothing less than thankful .

		To extensive personal acquaintance with the people and literature of Thibet , the land of Lamaism , the author adds thorough acquaintance with the
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean authorities on the subject , and has thereby pro- duced a comprehensive treatise not a compilation which simply supersedes all previous ones .

		Noticeable also is the rare and invaluable combination of literature and archseology in elucidation of the theme .

		The nu - merous and very beautiful illustrations are most appro - priate in treating a religion so dominated by ceremo - nial .

		Nothing better need be expected for decades , or until foreigners enjoy the freedom of travel and re - search in Thibet hitherto denied them .

		138 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, SEVEN BOOKS OF TRAVEL .

		* Mr.
Thomas Hughes	PERSON	, the well known and well beloved author of ''
Tom Brown	PERSON	's School - days , '' gives us in `` Vacation Kambles '' a series of letters of travel descriptive of his European and American trips during the last thirty years .

		Most of these letters are reprinted from '' The Spectator , '' the remainder being letters to his wife from
America	LOCATION	; and all are edited for this volume by his son .

		Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	flits so rap - idly from place to place that little consecutive interest is possible ; but when , as at
Dieppe	LOCATION	, he makes some connected description , it is very agreeably done .

		American readers will be most interested in the letters written during his various excursions to '' the States . ''

		He finds us '' the most silent and reserved of any race '' he has visited . ''

		Emerson is perfectly delight - ful : so simple , wise , and full of humor and sun - shine . ''

		Of Lowell he says : '' He has not a grain of vanity in his composition , but is as simple and truthful as the best kind of boy .

		... I found him much better than his books . ''

		The second series of Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	's American letters gives some account of the Rugby colony in
Tennessee	LOCATION	.

		The chief charm of this book is an intimate revelation of a thoroughly hon - est , large-souled , genial Englishman , of the best type .

		The style is the man , brisk , bright , sturdy , and of a healthy and hearty humor .

		There is no sting in this book , and none of that self-conscious intellectual brilliancy and liter - ary smartness that mar even the letters of
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		This volume could be improved by adding a portrait of the author and an index .

New York	LOCATION	:
Edward Arnold	ORGANIZATION	.

		it is a most readable and companionable book , and we hope it is only the first installment of the letters of
Thomas Hughes	PERSON	.

		In the next book on our list , Mr.
A. C. Bick	PERSON	- nell gives an account of his travels in
North	LOCATION	- ern
Queensland	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Bicknell	PERSON	has knocked around the world a good deal , with varied ex - periences ; but not having the gift of style as he himself acknowledges nor yet that of close and trained observation or careful reflec - tion , he produces a book of only mediocre qual - ity .

		His style may be excusably uncultivated , but it has no right to be slangy , which it often is .

		If such Australian terms as '' sundowner , '' '' swagmen , '' '' squatter chairs , '' etc. , must be used , they should be explained .

		Nor can we pardon such carelessness as this , in speaking of a kind of geese as '' rare , and found only in
Northern Queensland	LOCATION	.

		Enormous numbers may sometimes be seen in a single flock . ''

		In this book we get some light on prospecting , mining , and on various phases of Australian frontier life , which much resembles the life in our Far West .

		Much extraneous matter creeps into this book , as the stories of
Nicaragua	LOCATION	life ,
Ecuador	LOCATION	experience , and other tales , sufficiently interesting perhaps , but out of place .

		The vol - ume has neither map nor index .

		It is illus - trated with wood-cuts of slight pretentious .

		In '' An Artist in the Himalayas , '' Mr.
A. D. McCormick	PERSON	, who was a companion of Sir
Martin Conway	PERSON	in his famous tour in the Kash - mir region , gives by pen and pencil his impres - sions of the trip .

		The book is not in any sense a general account of the expedition , but is merely a personal narrative , and that of a rather slight order .

		Notwithstanding the au - thor 's modest disclaimer that his book '' has no pretensions to be literature , an art by no means within my province , '' he yet writes in a very agreeable and bright fashion .

		The real artist in one kind of art is rarely a sloven in another kind .

		Mr.
McCormick	PERSON	describes no very start - ling adventures , but he gives us interesting im - pressions of the beauty and grandeur of the great Himalayas .

		One of the grandest land - scapes he saw '' was composed of valleys with glittering ice walls , their sides ribbed with av - alanche tracks , and away in the hot , hazy dis - tance , peak after peak topped and overtopped each other in bright tones of pure pearl . ''

		Again , he says : '' At the entrance to the
Astor Valley	LOCATION	I learned what the grandeur of the mountains really meant .

		We were in the bottom of a narrow valley , in which great grey rock cliffs rose high up on either hand , and disappeared in the mist at the end of the gorge , across which the
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 139 clouds trailed , when someone shouted '' look up , Mac , '' and away in the heavens above I saw three great ice peaks , like towers of polished silver , which the passing cloud shadows dimmed and brightened as when one breathes on bright metal .

		The colors that played in the depths of this blaze of light can never be imagined nor described .

		I gazed spellbound .

		I never saw anything which had such an effect on me in all our journey as this .

		I had eyes for no other scenery that day , for I had seen heaven , and the great white throne . ''

		The pencil sketches which illustrate the volume are slight enough , but they have some quality .

		The work is pleasantly written and will serve as an agreeable companion for an idle hour .

		In '' Persian Life and Customs , '' Mr.
S. G. Wilson	PERSON	, a Presbyterian missionary in
Persia	LOCATION	, gives a popular and summary sketch of the coun - try , with some account of his travels therein .

		However , as the author 's way was chiefly along well-known routes , and as he does not appear to have had any exceptional sources of infor - mation , his book contains little that is new .

		During one of his journeys Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	sees multitudes of lizards , and this is the rather strange account he gives : '' Lizards , both nu - merous and active , continually dart before the eye .

		There are literally millions of them .

		They are divided into believers and infidels .

		The latter it is lawful to kill . ''

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	found in his travels that a few Persian inns were paying some special attention to the wants of Europeans .

		A Kasvin hotel '' even excelled in providing not only combs , but also tooth - brushes and night-caps for the public use ! ''

		Further , the author elsewhere says : '' The min - ing of coal at
Teheran	LOCATION	, the use of Russian petroleum throughout the country , and gas and electric light in the public squares of the cap - ital , are all signs of progress . ''

		Yet , on the whole , he concludes that '' the present outlook is not favorable to a speedy reception of nine - teenth century ideas in the way of commercial exploitation , or to any marked change in the religious beliefs of the people . ''

		Perhaps the best chapter in the book is that on the little - known sect of the Ali-Allahis .

		This book is rather dry in style , largely because the sen - tences are cut too short and the statements are too bald .

		It has a fair map , and some photo - graphic illustrations of interest .

		Another Presbyterian missionary , Mr.
G. L. MacKay	PERSON	, gives us in '' From Far
Formosa	ORGANIZATION	'' an account of his extended stay in that island , and adds some notes on natural history and anthro - pology .

		This book is concerned almost entirely with
North Formosa	ORGANIZATION	, which is a very distinct division .


Formosa	ORGANIZATION	is a tropical island off the
China	LOCATION	coast about twice the size of
New Jersey	LOCATION	, and contains nearly 2,000,000 inhabitants .

		As a result of the late Chino-Japanese war , it has been annexed to
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
MacKay	PERSON	explored
North Formosa	ORGANIZATION	quite thoroughly , and was very successful in interesting the natives in
Chris	LOCATION	- tianity .

		His drawing card was teeth-extracting .

		At one place his record is : '' Before dark I extracted five hundred and thirteen teeth and addressed an immense throng . ''

		Very vigor - ously , plainly , and piously , he narrates the story of his pioneer missionary experiences .

		As a specimen of his style , we quote a bit of prophetic prose from the chapter on Bang-kah : '' The citizens of Bang-kah , old and young , are daily toiling for money , money-cash , cash .

		They are mate - rialistic , superstitious dollar-seekers .

		At every visit , when passing through their streets , we are maligned , jeered at , and abused .

		Hundreds of children run ahead , yelling with derisive shouts ; others follow , pelting us with orange peel , mud , and rotten eggs .

		For hatred to foreigners , for pride , swaggering ignorance , and con - ceit , for sensual , haughty , double-faced wickedness , Bang-kah takes the palm .

		But remember , O haughty city , even these eyes will yet see thee humble in the dust .

		Thou art mighty now , proud and full of malice ; but thy power shall fall , and thou shalt be brought low .

		Thy filthy streets are indicative of thy moral rottenness ; thy low houses show thy baseness in the face of heaven .

		Repent , O Bang-kah , thou wicked city , or the trump shall blow and thy tears be in vain ! ''

		We may add that Bang-kah did '' repent , '' and the missionary scored a great triumph .

		Mr.
MacKay	PERSON	is a true nineteenth century prophet and apostle .

		On the whole , this book is a very striking and interesting record .

		It is provided with good maps and illustrations .

		In '' Rumbles in
Japan	LOCATION	, ''
Canon Tristram	ORGANIZATION	, a practised traveller and writer , gives us his im - pressions of a short sojourn in that beautiful land .

		The prime object of his '' rambles '' was to investigate missionary work , but he also paid much attention to field botany and zoology and to nature in general .

		We had not thought it possible that a fresh book on
Japan	LOCATION	could be written , but this may fairly be called so , as it shows much original and close observation .


Canon Tristram	ORGANIZATION	's style , while not very viva - cious , is by no means dull .

		Mr.
Whymper	PERSON	's illustrations are well done and interesting .

		Both the secondary title and the preface of his work convey the idea that
Slatin Pasha	PERSON	's book , `` Fire and Sword in the
Sudan	LOCATION	, '' is merely a personal narrative , whereas we find that fully one-half of the material is general history .

		But the commingling of these two subjects is apt to confuse and tire the reader , and as the volume is rather unwieldy , the best 140 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, disposition of the material would have been , one volume to narration of his own experiences , and a second volume to the general history of Mahdism .

		This at least is the division we shall make in this review .


Slatin	PERSON	was a young lieu - tenant in the Austrian army , when in
1879	DATE	, by invitation of General
Gordon	PERSON	, he went to the
Sudan	LOCATION	.

		Here he was soon appointed Gov - ernor of the province of
Darfur	LOCATION	.

		At the open - ing of the Mahdist revolt he held Dara for some time against the insurgents , but after the destruction of the
Hicks Pasha	PERSON	expedition he was obliged to surrender .

		As
Slatin	PERSON	had al - ready made a profession of Mohammedanism , and appeared obedient , he was for some time well treated by the
Mahdi	PERSON	and by
Khalifa Ab	ORGANIZATION	- dullahi , in whose service he was .

		But at length , suspicion having fallen upon him on account of a letter he had written to
Gordon	PERSON	, he was put in chains and rigorously guarded .

		In this condition , and filled with hopes and fears , he lay in his ragged tent during the siege of Khartum by the Mahdists .

		The night of the twenty - fifth of
January , 1885	DATE	, he describes as the '' most excitingly anxious one in my life . '' ''

		If only the attack were repulsed , Khartum would be saved ; otherwise , all would be lost .

		Utterly ex - hausted , I was just dropping off to sleep at early dawn , when I was startled by the deafening discharge of thou - sands of rifles and guns ; this lasted for a few minutes , then only occasional rifle-shots were heard , and all was quiet again ... Soon shouts of rejoicing and victory were heard in the distance ; and my guards ran off to find out the news .

		In a few minutes they were back again , excitedly relating how Khartum had been taken by storm , and was now in the hands of the Mahdists .

		Was it possible the news was false ?

		I crawled out of my tent , and scanned the camp ; a great crowd had col - lected before the quarters of the
Mahdi	PERSON	and
Khalifa	LOCATION	, which were not far off ; then there was a movement in the direction of my tent ; and I could see plainly they were coming towards me .

		In front marched the three black soldiers ; one named
Shatta	PERSON	, who formerly belonged to
Ahmed Bey Dafalla	ORGANIZATION	's slave body-guard , carried in his hands a bloody cloth in which something was wrapped up , and behind him followed a crowd of people weep - ing .

		The slaves had now approached my tent , and stood before me with insulting gestures ;
Shatta	PERSON	undid the cloth and showed me the head of General
Gordon	PERSON	.

		The blood rushed to my head and my heart seemed to stop beating ; but , with a tremendous effort of self - control , I gazed silently at the ghastly spectacle .

		His blue eyes were half-opened , the mouth was perfectly natural ; the hair of his head , and his short whiskers , were almost quite white . ''

		Soon after the fall of Khartum ,
Slatin	PERSON	was re - leased from imprisonment and became one of the body-guard of
Khalifa Abdullahi	PERSON	, who was one of the three
Khalifas	PERSON	or vicegerents of the
Mahdi	PERSON	.

		It was
Slatin	PERSON	's duty to be constantly on guard at
Abdullahi	ORGANIZATION	's door , and when he went out , to follow barefoot .

		However , he was allowed some huts for himself and servants , and on several occasions , to his great distress , was presented with wives by his lord and mas - ter .


Slatin	PERSON	was in this slavery for more than ten years before he escaped in
February , 1895	DATE	.

		On his return to
Egypt	LOCATION	, the Khedive bestowed on him the title of
Pasha	LOCATION	.

		Next to
Slatin	PERSON	the most prominent figures in this book are the
Mahdi	PERSON	and
Khalifa Abdullahi	PERSON	.

		We have much new information concerning the
Mahdi	PERSON	, which corrects such reports as we find in common ref - erence books like
Chambers	ORGANIZATION	's Cyclopaedia .

		A glossary of African and Arabic terms would be a useful addition to this book , and the index might be much improved .

		The author 's style is simple and direct , and in general correct , though it sometimes shows signs of haste . ''

		Re - covered his defeat '' -LRB- `` p. 84 -RRB- is an instance .

		This is so good a book that we only regret it was not bettered by a clear literary plan car - ried out deliberately and artistically .

		But as it is , we have a very interesting narrative of remarkable and thrilling adventures , and a most important contribution to the history of the
Sudan	LOCATION	and to the history of African Mo - hammedanism .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 141 West '' series , which is to be concerned with strictly Western types , such as the Indian , the cowboy , the miner , the soldier , the trapper , and others who have played a prominent part in the history of the trans -
Mississippi	LOCATION	country .

		Mr.
Grinnell	PERSON	, who is an adopted chief of the Pawnees and also of the Blackfeet , and who has published hero-stories and folk-tales of his favorite tribes , tells his story in an attractive man - ner .

		The daily life of the wigwam , the sports , the avocations , the food , the prejudices , and the passions of the Indian , are well brought out , not the least in - teresting being the description of the course of love - making and marriage .

		Perhaps the most striking chapter is that devoted to an account of the com - ing of the white man into the Indian-life , a chapter especially suggestive in connection with the general title of the series , of which this is the initial volume .

		The book is full of interesting stories , and must prove a popular one with young or old who desire to appreciate the part played by the Indians in the history of the
West	LOCATION	.

		A supplementary chapter on the
North American Indians	ORGANIZATION	is furnished by a mem - ber of the
Bureau of Ethnology	ORGANIZATION	, and adds much to the value of the work , because of the information regarding the red men in all stages of our history .

		Every American has some notion of the import - ant labors performed by the Roman Catholic mis - sionaries among the Indians east of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	.


Francis Parkman	PERSON	has told the story in words of great power , which make deep impress upon the mind of the reader who follows him in his descrip - tion of the development of
New France	LOCATION	.

		His '' Jes - uits in
North America	LOCATION	'' covers the ground quite thoroughly , and yet the subject is so interesting that it must have appealed strongly to Mr.
Donohoe	PERSON	, as he delved into the antiquated tomes which contain the '' Relations de la
Nouvelle France	LOCATION	, '' in search of material for his '' The Iroquois and the Jesuits . ''

		But his book contains little not to be found in Mr.
Parkman	PERSON	's works , although there can be nothing but good results from the publication , in simple lan - guage and with devout spirit , of the tales of the pioneers of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	among the Iroquois .

		Recent movements for the establishment of some form of memorial for
Marcus Whitman	PERSON	have greatly increased the interest in the story of his relation to the settlement of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	boundary .

		Dr.
Barrows	PERSON	, in his ''
Oregon	LOCATION	'' -LRB- '' American Common - wealths '' series -RRB- , gave by far the best account of the matter , and later writers have but repeated his story in other words .

		Despite the efforts of those who would eliminate from history everything that seems to indicate providential leading , the work done by
Whitman	PERSON	has become recognized as important in its day , and as far-reaching in its influence .

		The little book by Dr.
Craighead	PERSON	is well worth having , since it gives a succinct account of the early history of the
Northwest Coast	ORGANIZATION	, and puts in convenient com - pass and in clear language much that , otherwise , can not be ascertained , except by examination of numerous volumes .

		There are hundreds of events in our history which afford opportunity for just such simple treatment .

		It is that which makes valuable the monographs by Mr.
Samuel Adams Drake	PERSON	, which he has grouped under the general title , '' Decisive Events of American History . ''

		He has treated the '' Taking of
Louisburg	LOCATION	, '' the ''
Burgoyne Invasion	PERSON	of
1777	DATE	, '' the `` Battle of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	'' ; and now he gives us the '' Campaign of
Trenton	LOCATION	. ''

		The story begins with the movements around New -
York	LOCATION	which forced
Washington	LOCATION	to retreat through the Jerseys , and ends with the rejoicing over the bril - liant achievements amid ice and snow , as the
Ameri	PERSON	- can army at
Trenton	LOCATION	and
Princeton	LOCATION	found the year of
1776	DATE	blending with
1777	DATE	.

		There are various helpful diagrams and footnotes , and the volume , which may easily be read through at a short sitting , will appeal to everyone who examines it as worthy of a place upon the shelf .

		Mr.
Drake	PERSON	has written much for the young , and it is a feature of his writ - ing that , while what he describes is always intelli - gible to the boys and girls , those of more mature mind never fail to find enjoyment and intellectual refreshment as they follow his leading through the fields of American history .

		The campaign of
Trenton	LOCATION	displayed the charac - ter of
George Washington	LOCATION	to better advantage , perhaps , than any other series of movements of the Revolution .

		But everywhere he proved his right to be considered '' an indispensable man , '' as Gold win
Smith	PERSON	has so well put it .

		Turning to the dainty bit of book-making called ''
George Washington	PERSON	Day by Day , '' this idea is emphasized , for in it , classi - fied according to the days of the year , the student may find countless reasons for disagreeing with Mr.
McMaster	PERSON	in his statement , ''
Gaorge Washington	PERSON	is an unknown man . ''

		There are biographical data of pleasing interest , showing the little details of the life of the most illustrious of Americans ; there are important public acts of the great commander ; there are sentiments of a patriotic nature from distin - guished admirers of the Father of his Country ; there are illustrations of famous houses and public buildings connected with our early history , some of the ornamental chapter-headings being as sugges - tive as the more elaborate full-page engravings .

		The book was written primarily for boys and girls , but it is a veritable mine of information , and does not deserve classification with mere juveniles , since it is written in the best style , with each reference carefully identified , and each quotation carefully credited .

		In a certain passage Mr.
Morse	PERSON	says that
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	, under particular conditions , did not hes - itate to speak respectfully of the Constitution and then disregard it .

		This has often been the fate of the
Pilgrim Fathers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Every American is inclined to believe in the great obligation due to the foun - ders of
New England	LOCATION	, but there has been little in - terest in them , except as their quaint and curious lives have furnished materials for writers on social life , who have emphasized the amusing features .

		Those who have attempted description of the foun - dations of the society have too often been so influ - 142 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, enced by the heavy themes of theology that their volumes have not been readable .

		Such criticism can in no way be made of the new work by Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	, '' The Pilgrim Fathers of
New England	LOCATION	. ''

		Long familiar with the homes and haunts of the Mayflower settlers , he has written in charming style of the movements in
Old England	LOCATION	which led event - ually to the establishment of the New .

		The vol - ume readily divides itself into two parts , exactly half of it being devoted to the history of the Pil - grims before the sailing of the
Mayflower	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first half is by far the more important .

		Every sin - gle inch of
New England	LOCATION	history has been traversed again and again ; every stone has been rolled over and over , until some of them , as if to disprove the ancient proverb , have gathered moss .

		But we do not remember to have found elsewhere that familiarity with life in the old world which is afforded by this most admirable work .

		The reader gets accurate im - pressions of the homes and the home life , of the steps toward separation from the established faiths , of the actual beliefs of the leaders of the Pilgrim move - ment ; and he goes on board the Mayflower for the famous epoch-making voyage with clearer notions of the purposes which animated those godly men and women , whose heroic courage and deep-seated devotion have been honored for nearly three cen - turies by all who cherish the heritage of American citizenship .

		The second part is written in the same interesting style , and is necessary to the complete - ness of the monograph .

		It contains many sugges - tions for students of the origin of the Constitution , and is a distinct contribution to the literature of American history .

		It strikes one as a little pecu - liar that , while other secondary sources are men - tioned in the select bibliography which accompanies the volume , the author does not seem to have heard of
Goodwin	PERSON	's '' Pilgrim Republic , '' or of
Ellis	PERSON	's `` The Puritan Age and Rule in the
Colony of Massachu	ORGANIZATION	- setts Bay . ''

		Mr.
Fernando G. Cartland	PERSON	has used a somewhat misleading title in his '' Southern Heroes . ''

		One expects stories of
Robert E. Lee	PERSON	or
Stonewall Jack	PERSON	- son , or of the boys in gray who sadly turned their faces southward after the mournful meeting at Ap - pomattox .

		But the sub-title , '' The Friends in War Time , '' at once calls attention to the fact that not alone are those heroes who actually fight in war .


George Washington	PERSON	was a hero , '' day by day , '' as he carried on the campaign of
Trenton	LOCATION	, but so was
Isaac Jogues	PERSON	, the Jesuit , who gave up his life while preaching to the Iroquois , and
Marcus Whitman	PERSON	, who made the long journey over the mountains to carry to the Flatheads the story of the white man 's God .

		The Pilgrim Fathers were heroes , as they sought a faith 's pure shrine , and so were the Quak - ers , as they raised their voices for Freedom and lived their quiet lives of protest against War . ''

		Southern Heroes '' is a compilation of materials for history , rather than a history itself .

		It is the outcome of a desire to preserve the record of expe - riences of
Southern Friends	ORGANIZATION	, who naturally favored the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, but also found their faith against war at a time when and in a region where every able - bodied man was needed in the service of the Con - federacy , and who were tormented and persecuted in every possible way , many of them suffering un - told horrors under those who had charge of the prison pens at
Andersonville	LOCATION	and
Salisbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are occasional digressions to show the work of the Friends elsewhere , the two chapters devoted to the '' underground railroad '' being a very interesting contribution to the history of that famous highway to freedom .

		The volume is one long protest against war , and it gives the reader a stronger regard for the peace-loving people who , by precept and exam - ple , since the days of
George Fox	PERSON	, have been help - ing to hasten the coming of that glorious day when men shall beat their swords into ploughshares , their spears into pruning-hooks , and learn war no more .


FRANCIS W. SHEPARDSON	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		of
Concord	LOCATION	and
Appledore	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr - Frank P -
Stearns	PERSON	's `` Sketches from
Concord	LOCATION	and Appledore '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- j g a really delightful book , about evenly compounded of reminiscence , anecdote , and criticism .

		There are nine papers in all : '' Con - cord Thirty-odd Years Ago '' ; `` Hawthorne '' ; `` Em - erson Himself '' ; ``
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's Lectures '' ; ''
Whittier	LOCATION	'' ; ''
David A. Wasson	PERSON	'' ; ''
Wendell Phillips	PERSON	, '' etc. .

		Mr.
Stearns	PERSON	says in his preface that his especial object is to attract public attention to the lives and works of Mr.
Wasson	PERSON	and Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	, '' two distinguished men , one of whom has hitherto been little appreciated , and the other greatly misunderstood .

		Mr.
Stearns	PERSON	's plea for his two friends is forcible and sincere , if perhaps not altogether convincing .

		The reminiscential and per - sonal portions of the book are fresh and interesting , affording us some instructive and amusing glimpses of the distinguished coterie of
New England	LOCATION	writ - ers whom it was the author 's privilege to know more or less intimately .

		Hawthorne 's shy , inscrutable face peeps out perhaps most frequently .

		Some ten years after his death , a friend , looking towards the
Hawthorne	PERSON	house , asked Mr.
Bronson Alcott	PERSON	, '' Would you be surprised , Mr.
Alcott	PERSON	, to see Na - thaniel
Hawthorne	PERSON	some day gliding past your rus - tic fence as he used to do ? ''

		`` No , sir , I should not , '' replied the old philosopher , '' for while he lived he seemed to me like an apparition from some other world .

		I used to see him coming down from the woods between five and six o'clock , and if he caught sight of anyone in the road he would go un - der cover like a partridge .

		Those strange , suspi - cious side-glances of his !

		They are not anywhere in his writings . ''

		Alas , the '' getting under cover '' and the '' suspicious side-glances '' may well have been not remotely connected with the approach or proximity of the wordy philosopher himself from
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 143 On things in general .

		whom , it is recorded , even the patient
Emerson	PERSON	would sometimes flee in dismay .

		After the latter 's death , the domestic , doing the honors of the unten - anted homestead to curious pilgrims , used to point to a certain low window and say : '' That is the win - dow Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	used to jump out of , when he saw Mr.
Alcott	PERSON	coming down the garden path . ''

		So , at least , runs the story .

		Mr.
Stearns	PERSON	's volume contains a number of illustrations , comprising Con - cord views , and portraits of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, Miss Al - cott ,
Miss Thaxter	PERSON	, Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	, and others .

		We should be sorry to have conveyed the impression that the book is a mere pleasant medley of chat and reminiscence .

		The author 's appreciations of works and characters are often singularly just and discri - minating .

		Almost everybody has pretty good ideas nowadays , which may be the reason why people always talk when they get together , and especially why they make so many occasions to get together with nothing else to do but talk .

		It may also explain the number of columns and departments in the periodicals , called u Standpoints , '' '' Men and Things , '' and so on .

		Peo - ple read them , not because they want information on any definite topic , but because they assume that the ideas , on whatever subject , will be good ; the particular subject is of minor import .

		Very often they are not disappointed ; if one gets one of the collections of such writing , he generally finds that the author has a good deal that is interesting .

		So it is with `` Cousin Anthony and I '' -LRB-
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		One has no idea to start with as to what Mr.
E. S. Martin	PERSON	and his '' Cousin Anthony '' will talk about , but assumes that there will be some original or amusing ideas , some new things neatly put , some old things newly turned .

		Nor is the book a disappointment to such expectation .

		Mr.
Martin	PERSON	's quality is pretty well known and liked , and this book is quite up to '' Windfalls of Observation . ''

		In one respect , how - ever , this book has a characteristic which , as we re - member it , the other had not , namely , the ingenious way in which bits of writing on diverse topics are dove-tailed in together and made to seem as though they really had some connection .

		It would often puzzle the higher criticism to take the essays apart and tell why and when each separate bit was written .

		The result is , rather unfortunately for some readers perhaps , to emphasize the diffusive effect of such reading .

		It is interesting to think of the mental condition of the reader of such a book .

		He begins with a willingness to think any thoughts that `` Cousin Anthony '' and Mr.
Martin	PERSON	may have had ; the intel - lect is in a state of readiness for anything , blank but on the alert .

		When the reader begins a partic - ular essay he can concentrate a little ; he can get down to '' Civilization and Culture '' or '' Ourselves and Other People . ''

		Still he must be able to gather in the application to one subject of '' English and American Homes , '' '' Tips , '' '' Japanese Manners , '' '' French Traits '' ; he must be mentally ready to get the best out of everything .

		Such a necessity may be rather a strain for some people .

		But then , as we have remarked , whatever one gets is likely to be rather good .

		_ One of our strong literary interests ture , not only in English but in other languages .

		So we have the curious productions of
John Davidson	PERSON	,
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	,
William Sharp	PERSON	, and turn with pleasure to
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	,
Sudermann	PERSON	, and
Mae	ORGANIZATION	- terlinck .

		Ranged now with these last names is that of the
Spaniard Echegaray	ORGANIZATION	.

		Whether he turn out for us English-reading people merely a transitory '' discovery '' or a new planet in our ken , the two plays of his just translated '' The Great Galeoto , '' and '' Folly or Saintliness '' -LRB-
Lamson , Wolffe & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are very striking things .

		The translation is made by
Hannah Lynch	PERSON	, who also supplies a singularly discouraging preface .

		On reading this preface one gets rather a low-toned conception of the merits of the dramatist , and it is with no little rebound that one finishes an act or two of the first play and feels assured that things are on the whole better than the translator seems to imagine .

		Echegaray 's plays are often set in romantic periods , but these two are plays of modern life , which is perhaps one of the reasons why they are more attractive than some of the others on which the translator comments .

		In them
Echegaray	PERSON	handles a subject by no means new , the conflict of the modern conscience with the world .

		But he handles the topic with a sort of vigorous power and much originality .

		There is a refreshing simplicity and directness in the way in which he works straight ahead , without novelties of expression or eccentricities of conception .

		He at - tains his end by what seems really dramatic art .

		Character is not his strong point , nor humor , nor imagination , of the ordinary type at least , things which are good in the drama as elsewhere , but not of its essence .

		His effort seems to be to imagine certain people and certain circumstances , and then so to manipulate them that some idea , some concep - tion , shall be brought to white heat before the spec - tator .

		At any rate this is what he does most suc - cessfully in '' The Great Galeoto , '' but well also in the other .

		Some of his plays have been already translated , but the two in this book are stronger work and probably more representative of their author .

		- Mr.
E. W. Bok	PERSON	's '' Successward Two books of advice and precept -LRB-
F. H. Revell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is addressed to for young men .

		foe avera g e young man the young man , we take it , of office , shop , and '' dry goods '' store ; and we cheerfully assure the average young man that he will find its maxims sound and prac - tical , its ideals within reach of a mental Zaccheus , and its philosophy of life a good , plain , durable fab - ric , that will wear well and suit all seasons .

		The central object of the book is , as its title implies , to point out to the average young man the general line of conduct he is to pursue in order -LRB- to adopt the 144 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, young man 's own phraseology -RRB- to '' get there '' in life , and possibly to become a '' magnate '' of some sort or other .

		Mr.
Bok	PERSON	, however , has a good deal of ad - vice to offer on topics less severely practical , such as `` Social Life and Amusements , '' `` Religious Life , '' `` Attitude towards Women , '' `` Matters of Dress , '' etc. .

		Mr.
Bok	PERSON	's little book contains much sound precept tersely and plainly put ; and it may be read with profit by those for whom it is meant .

		Another book similar in character to Mr.
Bok	PERSON	's is Mr.
Orison Swett Marden	PERSON	's '' Architects of Fate '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , described by its author as `` a book designed to inspire youth to character-building , self - culture , and noble achievements . ''

		It is a compan - ion volume to Mr.
Marden	PERSON	's '' Pushing to the Front , '' which has run through several editions .

		Mr.
Mar	PERSON	- den 's method is largely the time-honored one of teaching by examples ; and of these he has got - ten together , and classified under such headings as `` Dare , '' `` Self-Help , '' `` Clear Grit , '' `` The Will and the Way , '' etc. , a most bewildering variety from sources the most diverse .

		Mr.
Marden	PERSON	's labors , of the excerpting and arranging order , must have been something really appalling ; and one is glad to re - flect that his method was one which relieved him from the additional strain of severe and continuous thought .

		A notable feature of the volume is the portraits of eminent people
Columbus	LOCATION	,
Walter Scott	PERSON	,
Hamilton	LOCATION	,
Lafayette	LOCATION	,
Irving	LOCATION	,
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Blaine	PERSON	,
Edison	ORGANIZATION	,
Clay	ORGANIZATION	, and so on .

		Mr.
Marden	PERSON	's style is rather spasmodic , and his reflections are sometimes trite ; but his book is , in the main , an excellent one for popular reading , and should repeat the success of its predecessor .

		Tnne * ee ' * constitutional ^ n a convenient volume entitled '' Studies in the Constitutional His - tory of
Tennessee	LOCATION	-LRB-
Robert Clarke Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Joshua W. Caldwell	PERSON	of that state presents many of the more prominent features of its consti - tutional development .

		He begins with the early attempts at the establishment of an independent government in the western wilderness :
Watauga	LOCATION	,
1772	DATE	;
Cumberland	LOCATION	,
1780	DATE	; and
Franklin	PERSON	, 1 784 .

		He calls due attention to the distinctive characteristics of these early constitutions , chief among which were general suffrage and religious freedom .

		His criti - cism that the Franklin experiment at state-making in
1784	DATE	is , in historic importance , inferior to its two predecessors , seems hardly justified by the facts which the author presents , showing it to be a step in a continuous evolution .

		In his claim that the
Watauga	LOCATION	settlers '' were the first Americans to estab - lish absolutely free and democratic institutions , '' he seems to ignore the earlier example of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	.

		The causes which led the
New England	ORGANIZATION	settlers to adopt the township system of government , while those of the ''
Virginia	LOCATION	group '' of colonies preferred the county system , are tersely set forth .

		It is a part of Mr.
Caldwell	PERSON	's thesis that , under present conditions , the township system should not only be preferred in the South , but that that region now needs , for its full development , the form of local self-government by which
New England	LOCATION	democracy became so successful ; and he urges that an early constitutional revision in
Tennessee	LOCATION	shall abolish the outgrown county system and erect upon its ruins the township system .

		His account of the early jeal - ousy of the
Tennessee	LOCATION	settlers toward their courts and judges shows that in
Tennessee	LOCATION	, as well as un - der the national constitution , the power of the judi - ciary has been a growth from feeble beginnings .

		Mr.
Caldwell	PERSON	would have made this part of his thesis more clear by reference to the official oath first prescribed for her judges , by which
Tennessee	LOCATION	, in imitation of
North Carolina	LOCATION	, sought to furnish backbone for the development of a truly independ - ent judiciary .

		We do not have much literary criti - on * ut `` a ?

		y ' l t pics .

		cism .

		nowadays , except in homeo - pathic doses .

		Few of our magazines have anything of the sort ; Travel , Art , Politics , Questions of the Day , Biography , Fiction , are more interesting to the public , and so are provided in larger quantity .

		So there is no place to publish long articles , and then it is easier to write short ones .

		In
England	LOCATION	it is still the tradition that some literary articles are to be included in the monthly reviews , but even in
England	LOCATION	much of the best writ - ing goes into the comparatively short articles of the literary weeklies .

		For these reasons we have lately had several collections of short essays , of which `` Im - pressions and Memories , '' by Mr.
J. Ashcroft Noble	PERSON	-LRB- Putnam -RRB- , is a good example .

		Too short for more than a pleasant resum or a judicious noting of a few salient points , such essays are rather unsatis - factory in book form .

		One can hardly put them on the shelf along with more solid literary criticism : one reads them and is apt to forget them .

		But aside from the inevitable disadvantage of form , these particular essays are excellent , a pleasure to read , and , as often as not , with something to re - member .

		There are a few essays on general critical subjects , particularly a very interesting one on '' The Music of Prose . ''

		There are also , though less success - ful in giving a definite idea , one or two bits of direct criticism , as on
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	, or Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	.

		But the greater number are on what would be called in a general way '' literary topics '' '' The Charm of Autobiography , '' `` The Hypocrite of Fiction , '' and so on , and answering probably to the '' mem - ories '' of the title , are several sketches of places pleasant in themselves and made noteworthy by the life of some man of letters .

		No suggestion of its contents is given in the title '' In a Walled Garden '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which is a collection of essays and reminiscences by Mme.
Bessie Rayner Belloc	PERSON	, an advanced woman of her time , a devout Catholic , and the intimate friend of
George Eliot	PERSON	.

		The papers are written in a somewhat disconnected and rambling style , as if they were familiar letters to a friend ; scattered recollections , odds and ends Some bits of literary history .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 145 brought forth from the memory of a woman now nearing the close of her life .

		The essays '' The Modesty of Nature , '' `` On Living Well to the Front , '' and three suggested by the theories of Count Tolstoy are mere suggestions of her thoughts , rather than completed wholes .

		The rem - iniscences , chiefly of people she knew in her early life , have an old-world atmosphere of times not so far gone by , and are full of interest for this gener - ation , particularly the chapters on
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Mary Howitt	PERSON	, Lady
Georgiana Fullerton	PERSON	, and the one entitled '' Montagus and Procters . ''

		One of the more recent characters described is
Catherine Booth	PERSON	, the '' mother of the
Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The paper on '' Dr.
Manning	PERSON	of Bayswater '' is of especial interest in view of Mr. PurcelFs recently published life of the Cardinal . ''

		A Chapter of War '' and '' The
Shoemaker	PERSON	's Story '' deal with the
Franco	PERSON	- Prussian War , of which Mme.
Belloc	PERSON	had personal knowledge , having been driven from her home in
Bougival	LOCATION	by the approach of the Germans .

		The book as a whole forms a pleasant addition to those bits of literary history which serve to throw side - lights on the great people of the world .

		Mr.
John Kendrick Bangs	PERSON	's humor - ous extravaganza entitled `` A
House	ORGANIZATION	- Boat on the Styx '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- has already appeared in serial form , and calls for little in the way of comment or description .

		Mr.
Bangs	PERSON	's device of grouping a lot of more or less celebrated `` shades '' Homer ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, Confucius , Arte - mus
Ward	ORGANIZATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Socrates	LOCATION	,
P. T. Barnum	PERSON	, and so forth on board a Stygian house-boat , surround - ing them with earthly '' modern conveniences , '' and making them talk in a flippant , slangy , up-to-date dialect , is at least a novel one , and the resulting incongruities make us laugh in spite of ourselves .

		Mr.
Bangs	PERSON	shows us , for instance , Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, '' playing pool with
Nero	PERSON	, '' and addressing Shake - speare with : '' Hullo ,
William !	PERSON

		How 's our little Swanlet of
Avon	LOCATION
this afternoon	TIME	? ''

		while Lord
Bacon	PERSON	settles a vexed question by saying : '' Shake - speare was my stenographer , gentlemen .

		If you want to know the whole truth , he did write ' Hamlet , ' literally .

		But it was at my dictation . ''

		Mr.
Bangs	PERSON	's fun is rather enjoyable at times ; but candor com - pels us to say that , in our opinion , a generation which can relish it in book doses is intellectually past praying for .

		The book is a pretty one out - wardly , and contains the quaint original cuts .

		Some men are admitted to the calen - dar of S reat men not on account of the magnitude and number of their achievements , but because of what they have shown themselves to be in the lesser deeds they have had to perform .

		In Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	's life of General
Wolfe	PERSON	, recently added to the '' English Men of Action '' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , we have the story of a great soldier told in a most fascinating way .


Wolfe	PERSON	was only thirty-two when he died , and the
Quebec	LOCATION	expe - dition was his first independent command ; but his success was based upon seventeen years of intense application to his profession , and every duty as - signed him had been perfectly done .

		The ministry that sent the young colonel to take the Canadian stronghold little realized the hopelessness of the un - dertaking .

		Wolfe himself was at the point of despair .

		But he would not fail .

		To have failed in accom - plishing the impossible , if that were set him to do , would have broken his heart .

		He succeeded , and by one stroke put his name on the short list of great English soldiers .

		This little book is a hero-tale that stirs one 's enthusiasm .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The new edition of Professor
C. A. Young	PERSON	's `` The Sun '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- acquaints its readers with the remark - able results of the
last fifteen years	DATE	of investigation , and brings the subject fully up to date .

		We have given the latest solar parallax determinations , the spectro - scopic work of Professors
Hale	PERSON	and Deslandres , accounts of prominence photography and coronal observation , Professor
Langley	PERSON	's infra-red spectrum investigations , and even so new a subject as the discovery of terrestrial helium .

		It is one of the best books of popular science ever written , and deserves to find a host of readers .

		Karma , a Story of Early Buddhism , '' by Dr.
Paul Carus	PERSON	, is a recent publication of
The Open Court Pub	ORGANIZATION	- lishing Co. .

		It is a prettily-written moral apologue , issued in a form that is sure to attract attention .

		The booklet is manufactured in
Tokyo	LOCATION	, printed on a curious kind of Crepe paper , and illustrated in colors by
Japan	LOCATION	- ese artists .

		The drawings are very charming , and will repay close study ; some of them are full-page designs , while others share their pages with the text .

		A new and beautifully-printed edition of '' The Mar - vellous Adventures of Sir
John Maundevile	PERSON	, Kt. , '' ed - ited and strikingly illustrated by Mr.
Arthur Layard	PERSON	, having also a preface by Mr.
John Cameron Grant	PERSON	, comes to us from
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		We hope that this edition may acquaint a good many people , who have hitherto thought of the work as possessing only antiquarian interest , with the fact that it offers delight - fully entertaining reading for both young and old .

		A more fetching dress than this , at least , the work could not easily have , with its rich covers , its clear type , and its quaintly sympathetic designs .

		We note the publication of two very helpful guides for the reading of the young .

		One is a '' List of Books for Girls and Women and their Clubs , '' edited by Miss
Augusta H. Leypoldt	PERSON	and Mr.
George	PERSON	lies , and pub - lished by the
Boston Library Bureau	ORGANIZATION	.

		Over two thou - sand works are enumerated , classified , and briefly char - acterized .

		Each section of the work is prepared by a specialist , Mr.
Krehbiel	PERSON	, for example , writing of music , Mrs.
Olive Thorne Miller	PERSON	of natural history , and Mr.
Russell Sturgis	PERSON	of fine art .

		The comments on books of fiction are by `` a reviewer for the ` Nation ' '' .

		The characterizations are terse and usually trustworthy .

		Our other book of this class is Mr.
W. M. Griswold	PERSON	's '' De - scriptive List of Books for the Young '' -LRB- '' descriptiv '' is the perverse way in which Mr.
Griswold	PERSON	spells it -RRB- .

		History and fiction are the chief groups in this bibli - ography .

		Both of these works are simply invaluable .

		A fourth volume , which the author hopes '' will not be long de - layed , '' will complete the work . ''

		Coriolanus '' and '' Troilus and Cressida '' are added by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	to their '' Temple '' Shake - speare .

		The Roman Forum and the Swan Theatre are the subjects of the etched frontispieces .

		The same pub - lishers send us ''
Enoch Arden	PERSON	'' and the second half of '' The Princess '' in the '' People 's ''
Tennyson	PERSON	.

		The beautiful edition of the ''
Faerie Queene	PERSON	, '' now publishing in parts , is progressing apace .

		Part XL , in - cluding Cantos 5 to 8 of the Fourth Book , is the latest to appear .

		Mr.

		The founders of ''
McClure	PERSON	's Magazine '' have under - taken to establish at
Knox College	ORGANIZATION	a new department , to be known as '' The

		It is expected that an en - dowment fund of a quarter of a
million dollars	MONEY	will be raised for this purpose .


Knox College	ORGANIZATION	will celebrate in
October	DATE	the anniversary of the Lincoln and
Douglas	PERSON	debate .

		Professor
Cowell	PERSON	, of
Cambridge	LOCATION	, who has just com - pleted his seventieth year , was presented on his birth - day with his portrait , which has been painted at the cost of fifty-six of his old pupils and others who in maturer years have continued to work with him at any of the numerous languages Sanskrit ,
Persian	LOCATION	,
Pali	ORGANIZATION	,
Old Welsh	LOCATION	, to say nothing of Italian and Spanish in which the veteran professor is thoroughly versed .

		Messrs.
Way & Williams	ORGANIZATION	announce for early publi - cation '' The Lamp of Gold , '' a sonnet sequence com - posed of forty-nine sonnets divided into seven parts of seven sonnets each , by Miss
Florence L. Snow	PERSON	, with dec - orations by Mr.
E. H. Garrett	PERSON	; a collection of stories by Mrs.
E. W. Peattie	PERSON	, entitled '' A Mountain Woman '' ; and a new Irish novel by Mr.
Frank Matthew	PERSON	, called '' The Apostle of Temperance . ''

		The same publishers say that the interest in Mrs.
Wynne	PERSON	's book , '' The Little Room and Other Stories , '' now in its second thousand , is on the increase .

		The MS. of '' Trilby '' is preserved in a locked glass case at the rooms of the Fine Art Society of
London	LOCATION	.

		It is written in little exercise-books , each of which cost a penny , and is not entirely in Mr.
Du Manner	PERSON	's hand .

		That author has a pet superstition to the effect that all the members of his family should take a small part in the work of writing out his imaginings .

		Consequently the MS. exhibits various calligraphies .

		A translation of '' Trilby '' has lately appeared in
Russia	LOCATION	, with Mr.
Du Maurier	PERSON	's illustrations .

		It is printed under the title of ''
Katia	PERSON	, '' and is ascribed to one Teminoff '' ; and all the names are altered to Russian ones the three immortal Companions of the Brush being turned into Russians .

		The
New York State Library	ORGANIZATION	has just issued its sixth annual comparative summary and index of state legisla - tion , covering the laws passed in
1895	DATE	by thirty-seven states and two territories .

		Each law is briefly de - scribed or summarized and classified under its proper subject-head , with a full alphabetic index to the
4847	DATE	entries .

		There is steadily growing appreciation of this Bulletin by all persons interested in improving state legislation .

		It is already widely used and helps ma - terially in raising standards and promoting uniformity in the laws of the different states .

		This year additional intermediate marginal heads give closer classification and make it much easier to grasp the contents rapidly .

		The great problems of municipal government have re - ceived special attention .

		Mr.
Charles Sprague-Smith	PERSON	is conducting in
New York	LOCATION	a series of weekly '' conferences upon literature . ''

		Each conference opens with a paper by Mr.
Sprague	PERSON	-
Smith	PERSON	, which is followed by supplementary papers and a general discussion .

		The method is thus described : `` Starting with a great epic poem , which voiced the thought of a primitive age and civilization , the litera - ture of which this poem formed the centre is followed in its evolution .

		Where it has inspired some greater production , that all recognize as belonging to universal literature , the attention is centred upon this , and a comparison made between the new and old expressions of the ideal .

		In every conference one of these supreme moments is considered , and the monument it produced placed in its historical and literary setting , with the lines of development traced up to and away from it . ''

FRANCES HODGSON BURNETT	PERSON	'S NEW NOVEL , A LADY OF QUALITY .

FRANCES HODGSON BURNETT	PERSON	.

$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		FROM AN ADVANCE REVIEW IN THE
CHICAGO	LOCATION	TRIBUNE : '' In this new novel Mrs. TZurnett bas returned to her older manner .

		Here we find the author of ' That Lass o '
Lowrie	PERSON	's . '

		It is decidedly the best story Mrs.
` Burnett	PERSON	has written since ' That Lass o '
Lowrie	PERSON	's / and is marked by the same virility .

		It is in an entirely new vein for Mrs.
Burnett	PERSON	.

		The scene is laid in
England	LOCATION	, and the action takes place at the
end of the seventeenth century	DATE	, hut the newest of ` new women ' might envy the independence of
Clorinda Wildairs	PERSON	.

		The story is one of the most original and vigorous that we have read in many a long day .

		Clorinda is a character that will live , for she is of real flesh and blood .

		The story of
Clorinda	PERSON	' s birth , and the death of her unhappy mother , is a touching one , and leaves a picture on the mother 's mind that will not be forgotten .

		In Clorinda Mrs.
Burnett	PERSON	has drawn an orig - inal character , and one that is not disappointing , in that she is consistent . ''

		By
ANTHONY HOPE	PERSON	.

		12mo ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	. ''

		His ' comedies ' are real comedies , and are played out by sundry young people in a way that would simply paralyze the old-fashioned hero and heroine .

		The first story , The Wheel of Love , ' is perhaps the best of the half-dozen by reason of its unexpectedness .

		Mr.
Hope	PERSON	's style is too well known to need illustration .

		The stories are without exception bright , racy , readable , clever . ''

Nicaragua	LOCATION	Canal can be built , should be built , and will be built .

Nicaragua	LOCATION	Canal route , and carefully studied the various prob - lems involved in the building of the canal .

		In a matter of such vast importance we need all the light we can get , and above all we need the opinions of independent engineers , under no obligations to take rosy '' On all the questions involved in the proposal to construct the Nic - aragua Canal , we are disposed to trust his judgment and his conclu - sions ... `` The first five chapters are devoted to a rapid historical survey , ... concise , comprehensive , and accurate ... Four chapters treat in a competent manner of social , political , and geographical
Nicaragua	LOCATION	, and her resources .

		The remainder of the book is taken up with a dis - cussion of the canal proper and its effects ... The illustrations are all that need be asked .

		184 A CRISIS IN PUBLIC EDUCATION .

		The public schools of
Chicago	LOCATION	have , on the whole , approved themselves to the intelligent educational opinion of the country .

		They have shared in the defects of all large city systems of education , but , relatively to other systems of similar magnitude , they have done well , and their management has been liberal , progressive , and fruitful of good results .

		They constitute a well-organized system , fitting their students both for the practical demands of life and for the prosecution of work along higher educa - tional lines .

		They have construed education to mean something more than mechanical in - struction and text-book memorizing , to mean rather the development of the whole nature of the child , physical , moral , and intellectual .

		They have enriched their curricula in a note - worthy degree with those elements of culture of which the older public education had slight knowledge , and which the saner modern view holds no less essential than the time-honored fundamentals .

		They have developed the ob - servant faculties by substituting objects to be seen and handled for pages of print to be learned .

		They have encouraged the study of nature , and have sought to train the mind , in large part , at least , through training of the eye and the hand .

		They have done much , by the provision of libraries and supplementary read - ing-books , to make of reading a pleasure instead of a dull formal exercise .

		They have done away with the old break between the grammar school and the high school by placing the be - ginnings of the higher studies in the lower grades .

		And they have done all these things , and done them fairly well , for a population that has been increasing more rapidly than in any other large city of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Even in the matter of providing accommodations for all applicants , the
Chicago	LOCATION	schools have done as much as could reasonably have been expected .

		It is true that some buildings are rented , and that others are lacking in modern improvments , but the frequently reiterated charge that ele - mentary education is not provided for all appli - cants is true only in the sense that some of the lower grades have '' double divisions '' ; in other words , that some children six or seven years of 158 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, age go to school for three hours a day instead of going for five .

		The
Common Council of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, in making its appropriations from the taxes of
1896	DATE	, has just seen fit to reduce the estimates of the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	by more than
two millions of dollars	MONEY	.

		Since the taxes for one year are not collected until the year following , this re - duction applies to the school expenses of
1897	DATE	.

		The greater part of the reduction is made in the estimate for new sites and school buildings , but a considerable fraction of it falls upon the estimate for '' educational purposes '' ; that is , for salaries and supplies .

		It is doubtless un - fortunate that the work of providing new build - ings should be thus arrested , for it will make the task of '' catching up '' all the harder in the future ; but its only immediate effect will be to increase the number of '' double divisions , '' which is not , after all , a very serious evil .

		The reduced estimate for '' educational purposes '' is , unfortunately , made absolutely unavoidable by the constitutional limitation and the dis - graceful condition into which the assessment system has fallen in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The tendency to lower assessments in order to lower the basis of state and municipal taxation is at work every - where in the
United States	LOCATION	, but is not often carried as far as it has recently been carried in this city .

		For several years past , the assessed value of
Chicago	LOCATION	property has been declining -LRB- while the real value has , of course , been grow - ing -RRB- , until it now amounts to about one-tenth of what the law directs it to be .

		That is , prop - erty actually worth in the neighborhood of twenty-five hundred millions is estimated , for purposes of taxation , as worth less than two hundred and fifty millions .

		Now , the
Illinois Constitution	ORGANIZATION	limits the expenditure of the city for '' educational purposes '' to a two per cent rate upon this assessment ; the appropriation for such purposes has at last reached the full amount allowed by this rate , and we are con - fronted with the fact that it is not enough for the educational needs of the city .

		Hence , it may be said without exaggeration that a crisis in public-school education is upon the city , and that the problem of making the wisest use of the inadequate amount provided is not easy of solution .

		When educational affairs become a subject of popular discussion it is nearly always found that a certain undercurrent of narrow and pre - judiced or ignorant thought comes to the sur - face , and has considerable influence in shaping the final decision .

		The newspapers may too often be counted upon to lead the attack upon whatever is most valuable in a public - school system .

		In
Chicago	LOCATION	, at least , and probably elsewhere , the chief points of popular attack upon the public schools are three in number : 1 .

		The salaries paid for the higher kinds of work .

		2 .

		The new subjects of instruction that the more enlightened educational ideals of re - cent years have added to the curriculum .

		3 .

		The high schools .

		The educational interests of every large city are always peculiarly in dan - ger of being crippled by an attack at these three points , and what we have to say about them , although illustrated by the problem as now existing in
Chicago	LOCATION	, has a far wider applica - tion than to the situation in any one city .

		That the compensation bestowed upon those who do the higher grades of work should be singled out for popular attack simply offers one more illustration of an intellectual defect that seems inherent in democracy , of the inability to understand why one man 's services should be so much more valuable than another 's .

		The lev - elling tendency that results from this misappre - hension is conspicuous in all departments of our public life , from the school service of a city to the national service of the capital .

		Almost everywhere it is found that the lower grades of work receive compensation at a rate relatively too high , while the higher grades are relatively underpaid .

		We fail thereby to command the best leadership and executive ability , while , on the other hand , the evil of place-hunting be - comes greatly magnified .

		Yet when , for ex - ample , the cry of retrenchment in the school expenses of a city is heard , an outcry is at once made that the burden should fall chiefly or wholly upon those who , while receiving the larger salaries , are still relatively underpaid in proportion to the importance of their work .

		It thus often happens that a burden which would be trifling if equitably distributed , becomes intolerable when loaded upon the shoulders of the few , and the educational work of the city is forced to depend for leadership upon a still lower grade of ability than before , thus becom - ing weakened at the very points where strength is most needed .

		Of all the forms of the socialist propaganda , that which takes the shape of a graduated tax is the most insidious and the most dangerous .

		It is the most insidious be - cause its effect is so disguised that compara - tively few people take the trouble to think for themselves what it really means , the most dan - gerous because it subverts a fundamental prin - ciple of justice .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 159 The popular attack upon the enriched mod - ern curriculum usually begins with stigmatiz - ing all the new subjects and methods by apply - ing to them collectively some such epithet as '' fads , '' a term especially chosen that the argu - ment may start with a prejudice in its favor .

		The cost of each `` fad , '' such as drawing -LRB- Heaven save the mark ! -RRB-

		, singing , or the study of nature , is then carefully figured out , and the public is invited to contemplate the frightful waste of good money upon ornamental work .

		The fact that skilled educators are practically unanimous in regarding such subjects as equal in educational value to any others is carefully con - cealed from the readers to whom the young men who carry on the newspaper crusades appeal ; and the other fact that to reduce a school cur - riculum to the simple old-fashioned terms would reduce expenses slightly , if at all , is concealed with even greater care .

		Of course , anyone who stops long enough to do a little elementary thinking upon the subject can see that the whole question is not one of expense , but simply one of educational theory and method .

		A certain subject , it is said , costs the city so many thou - sands of dollars annually .

		Yes , but to do away with that subject would not result in any con - siderable saving .

		It would simply release a certain number of hours to be applied to other kinds of work in the charge of other instruc - tors .

		In any public school system the unit of cost is the schoolroom with its teacher .

		For every fifty children , say , there must be a room and a teacher .

		Multiply the number of rooms by the average salary paid , add from five to ten per cent for supervision , and the result is the total cost for instruction .

		Starve or enrich the curriculum as much as you please , the total cost will be but slightly affected by either course .

		The question is wholly one of educational theory , not in any sense one of public policy , and the public at large is not entitled to an effective opinion upon a question that nowise concerns the pocket .

		Last of all , we wish to say a few words about high schools .

		The high school is perhaps the most characteristic product of American ideals of education , and is so firmly intrenched in the good-will and sympathy of the vast majority of taxpayers that it may safely be counted upon to hold its own .

		Yet there is no doubt that in our larger cities a certain numerically small but active element of antagonism to the high school as an institution makes itself felt upon critical occasions , and succeeds in weakening the influence and efficiency of high-school work .

		The arguments directed against the high school may be reduced to three .

		1 .

		Its work is orna - mental and therefore superfluous .

		2 .

		Only a small percentage of the school population re - ceives its benefits , while all are taxed for its support .

		3 .

		It is mainly an institution for the wealthy classes , who alone send their children to it .

		To the first of these arguments we may re - ply that the question involved is one of degree and not of kind .

		No one , not invincible in his own ignorance , can safely divide school work into two sorts , the useful and the ornamental ; nor can anyone , subject to the exception before noted , intelligently assert that the leaven of good citizenship -LRB- which it is the chief object of all public schools to produce -RRB- , is less suc - cessfully cultivated in the high school than in the school of lower grade .

		The only question suitable for the public to consider is that of the number of years for which it is proposed to support a school system , and the answer will depend upon the economic condition of the com - munity concerned .

		If the majority decides for a twelve-year course , those who would have pre - ferred eight years , or six , or ten , can not fairly claim that any question of principle is involved in their disagreement .

		The argument that high schools being for the few , the many should not be taxed for their support , may be disposed of in a similar way .

		Here again we have merely a question of degree .

		If a public-school sys - tem covered only two years of study , there would be fewer children in the second year than in the first .

		Whatever the length of the course , there will be fewer students in each year than in the year preceding .

		Or , taking the argument of '' the few and the many , '' as it is sometimes put , it would be just as fair to select any one school , high or low , in a city system , and say : '' This school only accommo - dates five per cent of the children of the com - munity , yet all the community is taxed for its support .

		Behold the monstrous injustice ! ''

		Such is the logic with which the friends of public education sometimes have to contend .

		As for the final argument of the enemies of the high school , it more often than not rests upon a falsehood .

		We do not know how it is in all other cities , but we assert that in
Chicago	LOCATION	, at least -LRB- and the assertion is based upon a quarter-century of intimate acquaintance with the facts -RRB- , the high schools are not institutions for the wealthy and well-to-do classes .

		It might very reasonably be argued that if they were , there would be no inherent injustice in the ar - rangement , since the wealthy classes pay taxes 160 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, in a proportion greatly exceeding the number of their children ; but there is no necessity for resorting to this plea .

		The truth of the mat - ter is that in
Chicago	LOCATION	parents of all classes very generally send their children to the public schools of primary and grammar grade , but that when these children reach the high school grade a considerable fraction of them are taken out of the public schools and sent to private institutions .

		Hence , as far as any class dis - tinction of patronage exists at all , it operates in the direction of restricting the benefits of the high schools to the poorer classes , of mak - ing them , in the phrase of a popular rhetoric , the `` poor man 's colleges . ''

		Moreover , the high schools of a compact and well-organized system like that of
Chicago	LOCATION	are in a very real sense the most important part of the whole .

		They not only perform the usual function of higher schools in holding up the lower schools to a fair standard of efficiency , in acting as the keystone of the whole educational arch ; but they also perform the far more important ser - vice of training for their work nearly all the teachers of the lower grades .

		The expanding educational system of
Chicago	LOCATION	requires every year some three or four hundred new teachers , and the great majority of them are selected from the graduates of the high schools .

		With this fact in view , it is simply amazing that anyone should seriously think the high-school system of the city either unimportant or orna - mental , that anyone having the interests of education at heart should not realize that a weakening of the high-school work would be the most serious disaster possible , making its unfor - tunate consequences felt , not merely at the time when it occurred , but for long years to come .

		A SONNET OF OBLIVION .

		The earth hath holy places , unadorned With sculpture or commemorative brass ; Across whose ways unheeding footsteps pass , Whose memories by forgetfulness are scorned .

		Well were it if some solemn voice had warned , '' Tread softly ; in this dewy , velvet grass The daisy grew that Chaucer plucked .

		Alas , Such blossoms

		Nature 's true heart alone doth now enfold The tree where

Keats	PERSON	' '' little hill '' forgotten long ago .

		Yet would that we could bind in grateful gold The bank of thyme that shares in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's fame , The path
Vittoria	PERSON	trod with Angelo .

DUFFIELD GOODWIN	PERSON	.

		THE NEW `` KING ARTHUR . ''

		In selecting the old story of
King Arthur	PERSON	and his Knights of the Round Table as a good subject for stage treatment , Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	has followed in the footsteps of many previous stage managers , in - cluding
Garrick	PERSON	,
Kemble	LOCATION	, and
Macready	PERSON	; and Mr.
J. Comyns Carr	PERSON	, in writing the play , has had as predecessors
William Rowley	PERSON	,
John Dryden	PERSON	, and many less - known dramatists .

		How far back we should have to go in dramatic history to find the first play founded on this popular theme is some - thing only to be conjectured .

		That there was an exhibition of mingled archery and pageantry called ''
Arthur	PERSON	's Show '' in the time of
Henry VIII	PERSON	.

		is known , and that it continued until
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's time and was seen by him is probable from his allu - sion to it in the
Second Part of King Henry IV.	ORGANIZATION	, where
Justice Shallow	ORGANIZATION	says to Falstaff , '' I remem - ber at Mile End Green -LRB- when I lay at
Clement	ORGANIZATION	's Inn -RRB- I was then Sir Dagonet in
Arthur	PERSON	's Show . ''

		Mile End Green was a training-ground near Lon - don , and the troupe consisted of an association of archers who personated characters taken from the old romance of '' Morte d'Arthur , '' a magnificent prose poem written by Sir
Thomas Mallory	PERSON	in
1461	DATE	.

		But neither was
Mallory	PERSON	himself the originator of these knightly tales .

		He wrought his narrative from old Welsh and Breton ballads and from the '' Chan - sons de Geste , '' as Homer wrought his '' Iliad '' from the preceding warlike ballads , or as the un - known compiler of the '' Niebelungenlied '' wrought his poem from similar ancient sources .

		Living when men still wore armor , and so near to the ac - tual age of chivalry as to be in full sympathy with the spirit of its fiction , the good knight gave to these stories an epic completeness which they lacked be - fore , and created a group of real men and women , and not a series of lay figures on a background of romance , as were his originals .

		Tbe characteristics with which he endowed these individualities have persisted throughout all the centuries since .

		Kay is still the man of satirical tongue ,
Lancelot	PERSON	is bold and chivalrous ,
Elaine	PERSON	tender and trusting ,
Arthur	PERSON	kingly but adventurous , Guinevere jealous but queenly , when they step upon the stage to-day as when they first received the breath of life from
Mallory	PERSON	.

		To speak of Mr.
Carr	PERSON	's new play as a dramati - zation of
Tennyson	PERSON	's '' Idylls of the King , '' or to judge it , as many seem inclined to do , according as it follows or departs from that delightful poem , is to show a very inadequate understanding of the sit - uation .

		The fact is that the mystical figures of
Arthur	PERSON	and his knights have quite stepped out of the historic page and are recognized as the common property of all imaginative writers .

		It is no exag - geration when it is said of
Mallory	ORGANIZATION	's '' Morte d'Ar - thur '' that '' it is as truly the epic of the English mind as the ' Iliad ' is the epic of the Greek mind . ''

		Whether there ever was an actual
Arthur	PERSON	, King of
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 161
Britain	LOCATION	, or not is nothing to the purpose ; but the truth remains that he has appealed to the imagina - tion of English writers oftener , probably , than any other figure , real or fictitious .

		Milton long had in mind an epic with
King Arthur	PERSON	as hero , but aban - doned it for '' Paradise Lost '' ;
Spenser	PERSON	took his ma - chinery for the '' Faerie Queene '' from the popular legends about King
Arthur ; Dryden	PERSON	wrote a drama and projected an epic on the theme ;
Bulwer	PERSON	wrote a heavy '' King Arthur '' which nobody reads ; Ten - nyson wrote a series of splendid poems which every - body reads , and thus to most people
King Arthur	PERSON	is the
Arthur	PERSON	of the '' Idylls of the King . ''

		Mr.
Carr	PERSON	, like his predecessors , has allowed his imagination to have its way with the old material , and has felt at liberty to use such portions as seemed to him best suited to his own purposes .

		This pur - pose being to make a good stage play , the proper test to apply to his work is his success or failure in this respect .

		At least this must be said of it , that it is much more satisfactory than the effort of any previous playwright , as may be seen by passing the others hastily in review .

		It is interesting to note that it is exactly 309 years ago namely , on the 28th of
February , 1587	DATE	that the earliest instance of which we have any record , a play called '' The Misfortunes of
Arthur	PERSON	-LRB-
Uther Pendragon	ORGANIZATION	's Son -RRB- '' was presented before Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	at the court in
Greenwich	LOCATION	.

		Then , as now , the cast included
Arthur	PERSON	,
Guinevere	LOCATION	,
Mordred	LOCATION	, and the train of valiant knights .

		The play was preceded by a prologue , and each act had an argu - ment , a dumb show , and a chorus .

		A curious cir - cumstance in connection therewith is that
Francis Bacon	PERSON	's name occurs in the list of writers by whom the dumb shows and additional speeches were `` partly devised . ''

		So , whatever may be assumed concerning the Baconian authorship of the Shake - speare plays , it is reasonably certain that Sir
Francis	PERSON	had something to do with the production and com - position of at least one Elizabethan play .

		During the same year , it was '' reduced into tragicall notes '' by
Thomas Hughes	PERSON	, one of the Society of Gray 's Inn by whom the play had been presented , and afterwards printed .

		Copies of this book are now extremely rare ; a more accessible reprint may be found in the little volume edited by
John Payne Collier	PERSON	, under the title '' Five Old Plays . ''

		There is no indication that the play ever became popular ; nor was
Richard Hathawaye	PERSON	's play , '' The Life of
Arthur	PERSON	, King of
England	LOCATION	, ''
two years later	DATE	, more successful .

		One other Elizabethan dramatist
William Row	PERSON	- ley was attracted by the Arthurian legends .

		He called his play '' The Birth of Merlin . ''

		For many years this play was attributed to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Translated into German , it may be found in the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, included in the first volume of the complete works of Shakespeare in German .

		The first of the
King Arthur	ORGANIZATION	plays to become really popular was the '' dramatic opera '' of
John Dryden	PERSON	in
1691	DATE	, called ''
King Arthur	PERSON	, or the Brit - ish Worthy . ''

		It was received with great applause at its first appearance , was often repeated , and held its place on the stage longer than any other of Dry - den 's numerous plays .

		Doubtless a considerable part of its success on its first presentation was due to the fact that its cast included such actors as Bet - terton ,
Kynaston	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Bracegirdle	PERSON	, and that the music was written by the foremost composer of his time ,
Henry Purcell	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Burney	PERSON	in his '' His - tory of Music '' says of this work of
Purcell	PERSON	's , '' A century has not injured it , and especially the duet of Sirens in the enchanted forest , ' Two Daughters of this Aged Stream , ' and the ' Fairest Isle all Isles Excelling , ' contain not a single passage that the best composers of the present times , if it presented itself to their imaginations , would reject . ''

		Strange as it seems , although the text of the play was published in
1691	DATE	, this delightful music , with the exception of a few songs , remained unpublished until
1843	DATE	, when all that could be collected was issued by the
Musical Antiquarian Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		A copy of this volume , which includes text , music , and his - tory of the play , is in the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		The most important revivals of the play have been , in
1770	DATE	, under
Garrick	PERSON	, with
Bannister	PERSON	, Mrs.
Baddeley	PERSON	, and
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	-LRB- ancestor of our much-loved actor -RRB- in the cast , and with additional music by another eminent composer , Dr.
Arne	PERSON	; in
1784	DATE	, under
Kemble	PERSON	, with Mr.
Kemble	PERSON	as
King Arthur	PERSON	and
Miss Farren	PERSON	as leading lady ; in
1842	DATE	, under
Macready	PERSON	, when it had a run of thirty - three successive nights at
Drury Lane Theatre	ORGANIZATION	.

		As for the play itself , it has little to do with the king and his knights .

		The scene is laid in Kent , and the story resembles a fairy extravaganza ; there is an enchanted wood with a
Saxon	PERSON	magician and a British enchanter , an '' airy '' spirit and an '' earthly '' spirit , and many dances .

		In
1776	DATE	,
William Hilton	PERSON	, a poet of little merit , wrote a tragedy called ''
Arthur	PERSON	, Monarch of the Britens , '' which he never succeeded in getting ac - cepted at any theatre , and there is a record of a tragedy by
E. J. Riethmuller	PERSON	, published in
London	LOCATION	in
1841	DATE	, which seems to have been equally unfortu - nate .

		Thus the ''
King Arthur	PERSON	'' of Mr.
Carr	PERSON	, first pre - sented at the Lyceum Theatre in
London	LOCATION	on
Jan.	DATE	.

		15 ,
1895	DATE	, and with the cast much the same as now playing in
America	LOCATION	, is easily chief among the stage
King Arthurs	PERSON	.

		He is a flesh-and-blood hero , sur - rounded by knights and ladies clearly individual - ized , who , while moving in a world whose manners are remote from our own , yet appeal to our modern taste and serve to make us realize why this chival - ric romance was the favorite fictitious literature of
Europe	LOCATION	during the three or four mediaeval centuries , and why it has been such a favorite theme from those days until now .

		The action is conceived on true dra - matic principles .

		There are no anti-climaxes , no superfluous lines , but all the incidents bear upon the development of the story and push it towards a con - 162 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, elusion which is both unexpected and thoroughly effective .

		It sweeps through a wide range of pas - sions ; love , jealousy , falsehood , revenge , a manly and heroic forgiveness , are deftly woven together and compel the interest from start to finish .

		Less satisfactory poetically than dramatically , it yet con - tains many fine passages , and the last scene between
Arthur	PERSON	and Guinevere will even bear comparison with
Tennyson	PERSON	's treatment of their parting .

		Guin - evere having called for a champion to do battle against
Mordred	ORGANIZATION	, her accuser ,
Arthur	PERSON	, who is sup - posed to have been killed , enters with lowered helm .

		Disclosing himself to
Mordred	LOCATION	, they fight , and Ar - thur falls wounded to the earth .

		Guinevere re - enters , sees the face of
Arthur	PERSON	, and falls at his feet , crying , '' My lord !

		my lord ! ''


Arth	PERSON	.

		Whose face - was there ?

		I pray you some one say , For all grows dark : I know not where I am .

		Guin .

		UNIVERSITY CHANGES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The future development of our universities is a very fruitful subject , but I am surprised to see by your ar - ticle of
Feb. 16	DATE	that you concur with the views of some of the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	faculty that it is likely to be after the English model .

		It is plain enough why
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	men would incline to that idea .

		Eastern universities generally have not the democratic idea of education .

		Their endowments are never turned towards making education more accessible to the masses .

		In that re - spect there is already much similarity between some of our institutions and the English .

		It is as impos - sible for a poor American to go to
Harvard	LOCATION	or
Yale	ORGANIZATION	without some kind of assistance as it is for a poor Eng - lishman to take his degree at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	or
Cambridge	LOCATION	with - out assistance .

		There is an evident purpose to make them exclusive .

		But there are many reasons why these ideas will not now become widely diffused .

		In the first place
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, while progressive along some lines , no longer set the pattern for the country .

		Our ideals have become , what they should be , cosmopolitan and democratic , that is , the ideals of the growing in - stitutions , which are in the West mostly , but some are also in the
East	LOCATION	.

		The state universities have generally but a nominal fee , and the great
Leland Stanford Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity , in
California	LOCATION	, has no fees .

		But you are right in assuming that we are on the eve of changes to meet changed conditions ; we are , in fact , in the midst of such changes .

		The larger institutions are adding three years to the undergraduate courses leading up to the degree of Ph.D. , and the
A.B.	LOCATION	is no longer the stopping place in academic life .

		The recitation system is almost antiquated in what is beginning to be known as the university proper .

		The lecture and seminary sys - tems are coming into universal vogue .

		These are the most characteristic changes of the time , and they are not after the English but the German model .

		If pres - ent developments continue , the time is not far distant when our universities will very closely correspond to the German type .

		It will only be when the graduate de - partments have grown to such size that what we are beginning to call the college part of the university may be completely segregated from it , as the preparatory departments have been segregated from our colleges .

		This development seems inevitable for a number of reasons .

		Great numbers of our professors are being and have been trained in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		But the principle rea - son is because
Germany	LOCATION	has both reached the highest scholarship yet attained and the most perfect facilities for imparting it .

		Her system is designed for mature , self-respecting men .

		The scholarly temper takes the place of the English boating , cricket , and horse-play .

		There seems to me to be more doubt about what form the future college will take than the university , whether it be large or small , and where it will leave off and the university begin .

		But our universities will have an opportunity to im - prove upon the German type .

		We may expect the secur - ity of tenure of professorial positions , and their grading into three ranks , something like the ordinary , extra - ordinary , and docent of the Germans , the salaries being supplemented by fees according to the number of stu - dents a professor may attract appointments always coming from the class below to the next higher .

		But we may improve upon their plan by making it easy for stu - dents to come .

		Free dormitories may be considered as legitimate a use for endowments as that for professorial chairs is considered now .

		The ideal of the greatest possible dissemination of higher education will be kept constantly in view , and the fact that universities are designed to serve society and not a class .

		THE MOTHER 'S INFLUENCE AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING POETICAL LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I trust you will allow a mother to add a corollary to your discussion in respect to the best method of teach - ing literature , even if it is but an expression of individ - ual opinion .

		Bishop Spalding has said , '' I have little hesitation in affirming that our home life , our social and political life , and our religious life have contributed far more to make us what we are than any and all of our schools , '' and with his words in our minds , it might be pertinent to inquire , What was the home life of the last generation , the generation which is responsible for our present home and social life ?

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has recorded that in simpler days it was thought quite a proper thing for young men to read poetry to young women when they made an evening call , if they happened to be upon intimate terms with the family .

		To-day , a young man who would do such an unheard-of thing would be jeered at throughout his whole set .

		Yet I know that at least one-third of my early knowledge of the poets was un - consciously acquired in this pretty fashion .

		I was for -
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 163 tunate enough to have several masculine cousins some - what older than myself who led me in this wise to
Shel	PERSON	- ley ,
Keats	PERSON	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and
Alfred de Musset	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of the accomplishments expected in those days of the edu - cated young man in
New York City	LOCATION	was the ability to read some quotations from his favorite poets with fair rhetorical effect .

		This training was due to the influence of the mothers , sisters , and wives .

		For some reason , I know not what , although the sexes are educated together , the old literary and musical sym - pathy between them which existed in the days just after the Civil War is gone .

		The average business man of to-day neither loves poetry nor music .

		His whole time and energy are absorbed in the accumulation of money .

		If he collects a library , it is largely composed of the gossip of the courts of the times of Charles II .

		and
George IV.	PERSON	, for the modern book-collector is a little too fond of gossip , and he admits the poets simply be - cause he is ashamed to leave them out .

		How much of this is due to the loss of mother-training at the fireside , and how much to worldly influences over which mothers and sisters hare no control , it is impossible to say .

		But so far as my personal knowledge goes , outside of the literati , the average woman of to-day is no more fond of poetry than the average man .

		But a few weeks since a woman-editor wrote me , '' I can not conceive of anyone buying a volume of poems simply for the pleasure of reading it . ''

		This remark shocked me , not so much as the expression of an individual opinion , for we have scores of writers among us who have no inherent taste for poetry , but because it voiced the great majority of women .

		On the other hand , the minority , headed by a few of our women poets , such as Mrs.
Dorr	PERSON	in
Vermont	LOCATION	,
Miss Ina D. Coolbrith	ORGANIZATION	in
California	LOCATION	, Miss
Harriet Mon	PERSON	- roe and Mrs.
Coonley	PERSON	in
Chicago	LOCATION	, are working tirelessly in the women 's clubs to revive poetical taste .

		What a paradoxical age is ours !

		The era of women-poets and the era in which women , for the most part , have ceased to love and be inspired by poetry .

		Women read too much in their clubs about
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and the Brownings , and devote too little attention to the words of the great masters .

		One club I know of in a small Western town , after studying for three weeks all that could be found in the one free library in respect to the man ,
Dante	PERSON	, concluded that the '' Divine Comedy '' and '' The New Life '' were a little bit too hard for them to '' tackle , '' and went on to some - thing easier .

		If we would revive this lost poetical instinct and ap - preciation , we must take a few lessons from primitive times .

		It may be a myth that Alfred the Great re - ceived his first incitement to learning from his step - mother , or that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's teacher in fairy lore was
Mary Arden	PERSON	; but the stories illustrate the good old
Saxon	PERSON	and
Norman	PERSON	customs , which made the mother light the first spark of inspiration ; and perhaps there could have been no Provencal literature if women had not invented , for the encouragement of poetical art , the '' Courts of Love '' where the Trouveur or Troubadour was encouraged to express his hidden thought in fault - less measure .

		Mothers can scarcely begin to instruct their children in merry jingles at too early an age .

		Many a restless baby will let a nurse handle him without crying if she will but babble the Mother Goose melodies .

		Mother Goose should be systematically followed up by the child - verses of , say ,
Eugene Field	PERSON	, Miss
Edith M. Thomas	PERSON	, or Mrs.
Mary Mapes Dodge	PERSON	; then the American and British poets , as the child 's mind develops .

		Emerson 's idea quoted in a recent number of THE DIAL -LRB-
Feb. 16 , 1896	DATE	-RRB- , '' Would you inspire in a young man a taste for Chau - cer and
Bacon	LOCATION	?

		Quote them , '' is the ideal method .

		The mother who can describe the
Canterbury Pilgrims	ORGANIZATION	to her child , can relate the quaint tale of
Palamon	LOCATION	and Arcite , or the
Clerk of Oxenford	ORGANIZATION	's story of the patient
Griselda	LOCATION	, has given her child a glimpse of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's time which the teacher might not be able to picture .

		Also some of the clean stories from
Boccaccio	PERSON	can be told the child in the version found in
Tennyson	LOCATION	's '' The Lover 's Tale '' or
Keats	PERSON	's '' Isabelle ; or , the Pot of Basil . ''

		If to this were added the story of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's life , dwelling more upon his tastes as a bibliophile and expounder of the text of
Cicero	PERSON	than upon the story of
Laura	LOCATION	, the three prominent literary figures of the fourteenth century would be indellibly stamped upon the child 's mind years before it would be possible to send him to the volumes .

		When the mother allows the teacher to be the sole quick - ener of the child 's imagination , part of the instinctive mother-love of the child is transferred to the teacher , as in the notable case of Lady
Jane Grey	PERSON	.

		Yet I happen to know that the young teachers are doing very efficient work in the right direction in the public schools .

		In a family I know and love , a youngster of eight has for sup - plementary reading Longfellow 's '' Hiawatha . ''

		He can quote more of the verses upon
Hiawatha	LOCATION	's childhood than any other member of the family .

		Another boy acquired a love of
Lowell	LOCATION	in the public schools , but the eldest -LRB- the one who always has the greatest influence in forming the literary taste of a family -RRB- , has passion - ately loved Shakespeare ever since his mother read with him the trial scene of the '' Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' the first reading taking place when he was but ten years old .

		A
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	quotation combat , to which might by added a small prize to the successful competitor ; a famile reading in
Plumptre	LOCATION	's translation of Sophocles ' '' Anti- gone , '' or Euripides ' '' Iphigenia in Aulis , '' are not diffi - cult things for mothers to manage , and have an untold educational advantage .

		If these suggestions are scarcely feasible , what might a mother not accomplish with Sted - man 's '' Victorian Anthology '' as a guide ? ''

		The Land of Wonder - Wander '' ; the ballads ; the fresh revelations of our time from the Dominion of
Canada	LOCATION	;
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's '' Sohrab and Rustum '' and '' Balder Dead '' ;
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	's poems , so attractive to the young ; and
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's fantastic ballades may all be found in this wonderful collection .

		If parents would allow their children to express their preferences for the poets -LRB- however crude -RRB- at the fam - ily board ; with the idea that it does not make much dif - ference which side the young person takes in an argu - ment , so long as he has original ideas , and can clearly state the whys and wherefores of the faith that is in him , the young person would be tempted to read more .

		The American pater-familias , whatever his virtues else - where , is apt to be a stern , bigoted creature at home .

		He has very fixed ideas upon all sorts of subjects , and he does not like to be opposed in his own family .

		But the mother should hold her little courts with her chil - dren , if she would preserve the '' inner light , '' to use the quaint
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	phrase .

		I believe that the vestal vir - gins keeping watch over the sacred fires in the Roman temples , and
Vesta	ORGANIZATION	's close association with the home as goddess of the hearth , were but symbols of the watch which women must ever keep over the sacred fire of poetry .

		* The biographical literature of the current year is not likely to include any work more fas - cinating in theme and richer in varied personal interest than the two handsome volumes con - taining severally a Memoir of
Dante Gabriel Rossetti	PERSON	, by Mr.
William Michael Rossetti	PERSON	, and a collection of the former 's '' Family-Letters . ''

		Mr.
Rossetti	PERSON	's Life of his brother is a frank and rather discursive Boswellian record , pro- fuse of fact and sparing of disquisition , which may fairly be said to leave no reasonable ques - tion as to
Dante Rossetti	PERSON	's career and person - ality unanswered .


Gabriele Rossetti	PERSON	, father of
Dante Gabriel	PERSON	and
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	, was born at Vasto on the
Adriatic	LOCATION	coast of the then Kingdom of Na - ples ,
Feb. 28 , 1783	DATE	.

		Proscribed for Carbon - arism , he fled from
Italy	LOCATION	in
1821	DATE	, and in
1824	DATE	settled in
London	LOCATION	as a teacher of Italian , where he married a Miss
Polidori	PERSON	, and in
1831	DATE	was appointed Professor of Italian in
King	LOCATION	's Col - lege .


Gabriele Rossetti	PERSON	is described as a man of energetic and lively temper , sensitive to slight and quick to resent it , devoted to his family , a fervent apostle of Italian freedom and unity , and effusively grateful to those who had befriended him in his darker hour of exile .

		One of the author 's most vivid memories is of the day when the death of his father 's benefac - tor ,
John Hookham Frere	PERSON	, was announced : '' With tears in his half-sightless eyes and the passionate fervor of a southern Italian , my father fell on his knees , and exclaimed , ' An - ima bella , benedetta sii tu , dovunque sei I ' -LRB- ' Noble soul , blessed be thou wherever thou art ! ' -RRB- ''

		The
Rossetti	PERSON	household was of Italian , not English , environment .

		The renown won by
Gabriele	PERSON	in his own country as an
Impro	PERSON	- visatore and writer of fervid political lyrics -LRB- '' singable '' is the term
Carducci	PERSON	applied to his verses -RRB- , followed him oversea ; and the
Charlotte	LOCATION	Street home in
London	LOCATION	became a no - table rendezvous for his compatriots of all so - cial grades , from the titled refugee to the lib - eralized maccaroni-man and plaster-cast vendor waifs and strays , largely , cast up and stranded by the sea of expatriation .

		were commonplace -LRB- rather tedious ones -RRB- in the lives of the young Rossettis .

		The special po - litical bete noire of the excitable guests was the French king ,
Louis Philippe	PERSON	or ''
Luigi Fil	PERSON	- ippo , '' as they called him .

		Says the author : '' The number of times I have heard '
Luigi Filippo	PERSON	' denounced would tax the resources of the Calculating Boy .

		My mind 's eye presents a curious group , though , it seemed natural enough at the time .

		My father and three or four foreigners engaged in animated talk on the affairs of
Europe	LOCATION	, from the point of view of patriotic aspiration and hope deferred until it had become hope - less , with frequent recitations of poetry intervening ; my mother , quiet but interested , and sometimes taking her mild womanly part in the conversation ; and we four children
Maria	PERSON	more especially , with her dark Italian countenance and rapt eyes drinking it all in as a sort of necessary atmosphere of the daily life , yet with our own little interests and occupations as well reading , coloring prints , nursing the cat , or whatever came up - permost ...
Gabriele Rossetti	PERSON	's noble declamation , taken along with his subject-matter , was indeed enough to carry any sympathizers away on the wave of excite - ment .

		His auditors hardly appeared to have any fleshly appetites .

		Such a thing as a solid supper was never in question , neither did they ever propose to smoke .

		They would come into our small sitting-room , greet the ' Sig - nora
Francesca	PERSON	, ' and sit down , as the chance offered , amid the whole family , adult and semi-infantine .

		A cup of tea or of coffee , with a slice of bread and butter , was all the provender wont to be forthcoming . ''

		The grand concern and magnum opus of the elder
Rossetti	PERSON	was of course his Dante com - mentary -LRB- in which he proposed to show that the '' Commedia '' is chiefly political and anti-papal in its inner meaning -RRB- ; and at this task he was to be found daily grinding away , '' surrounded by ponderous folios in italic type , * libri mys - tici , ' and the like , often about alchemy , free - masonry ,
Brahminism	PERSON	,
Swedenborg	PERSON	, the Ca - balla , etc. '' These labors were contemplated by the juniors with a certain awe not untinged with levity ; and our author notes that
Dante Gabriel	PERSON	, so far from being , as fancifully stated , from childhood a lover of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, had not , up to the age of sixteen , read twenty consecutive lines of him .

		In fact , the abstruse turn of the father 's Dantesque talk and labors bred in his children an a priori distaste for the mighty
Alighieri	ORGANIZATION	, and even led them to regard him a a kind of household bogey second only in malign potency to '' Luigi Filippo '' himself .

		Says the author : '' The Convito was always a name of dread to us , a * being the very essence of arid unreadableness .


Dante Alighieri	PERSON	was a sort of banshee in the
Charlotte	LOCATION	Street house ; his shriek audible even to familiarity , but the message of it not scrutinized . ''


Gabriele Rossetti	PERSON	's four children were born in four successive years :

Gabriel Charles Dante	PERSON	-LRB-
Dante Gabriel	ORGANIZATION	,
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 165 he chose to style himself -RRB- , in
1828	DATE	;
William Michael	PERSON	, in
1829	DATE	; and
Christina Georgina	PERSON	, in
1830	DATE	.

		In
1836	DATE
Dante Eossetti	ORGANIZATION	, then '' a pleas - ing , spirited-looking boy , with bright eyes , au - burn hair , and fresh complexion , '' was sent to the day-school of a Mr.
Paul	PERSON	, and thence , in
1837	DATE	, to
King 's College School	ORGANIZATION	, where he re - mained five years , gaining a fair knowledge of Latin and a smattering of Greek , and evincing a turn for drawing and rhyming that won him a degree of mild popularity , despite his '' un - schoolboylike '' ways and rather maidenly avoidance of the rough sports and Homeric bat - tles of his schoolmates .

		Mr.
Rossetti	PERSON	notes that he can not remember any date at which it was not understood in the family that '' Gabriel meant to be a painter '' ; and so in
1842	DATE	, on leaving school , he at once entered the drawing academy of Mr.
F. S. Gary	PERSON	, where he remained till
1846	DATE	, drawing from the antique , dabbling a little in anatomy , and , as always , following mainly his own bent and fancy . ''

		He liked to do what he himself chose , and , even if he did what someone else pre - scribed , he liked to do that in his own way . ''

		Prom
Gary	PERSON	's ,
Rossetti	PERSON	went to the Royal Acad - emy School ; and here , as before , he went on working with much enthusiasm as to the main nd , and with equal laxity as to the prescribed means .

		Holman Hunt has left a graphic sketch of him as an Academy student : '' A young man of decidedly foreign aspect , with long brown hair touching his shoulders , not taking care to walk erect , but rolling carelessly as he slouched along , * pouting with parted lips , staring with dreaming eyes .

		... He was careless in his dress .

		So superior was he to the ordinary vanities of young men that he would allow the spots of mud to remain dry on his legs for several days ... With his pushing stride and loud voice , a special scrutiny would have been needed to dis - cern the reserved tenderness that dwelt in the breast of the apparently careless and defiant youth .

		... In these early days , with all his headstrongness and a certain want of consideration , his life within was untainted to an exemplary degree , and he worthily rejoiced in the poetic atmosphere of the sacred and spiritual dreams that encircled him , however some of his noisy demon - strations at the time might hinder this from being rec - ognized by a hasty judgment . ''

		In
1848	DATE	,
Rossetti	PERSON	entered the studio of Mr.
Ford Madox Brown	PERSON	, whose somewhat abstruse canvases he greatly admired .

		It is related that he had previously penned a note to
Brown	PERSON	-LRB- asking to be received as a pupil -RRB- so lavish of praise that the recipient , believing himself twitted , seized a stout stick and set out to chas - tise the unknown joker .

		Arrived at
Rossetti	PERSON	's *
James Smetham	PERSON	somewhere describes
Rossetti	PERSON	as `` lolling about , and behaving like a seal on a sandbank . ''

		room and finding the occupant within , he asked fiercely , '' Is your name
Rossetti	PERSON	, and is this your writing ? ''

		An affirmative reply was fol - lowed by , '' What do you mean by it ? ''

		To this the startled
Rossetti	PERSON	mildly answered that he '' meant precisely what he had said , '' where - upon the touchy painter , seeing his error , warmly granted his admirer 's request , taking him as a pupil gratis , and thus founding an intimacy that led up to the companionship with
Holman Hunt	PERSON	and
Millais	PERSON	, and so to the fa - mous
Praeraphaelite Brotherhood	ORGANIZATION	, of which , however ,
Madox Brown	PERSON	was never a member .

		Of this much - canvassed coterie the author gives an interesting account ; but we shall only note in passing that
Dante Rossetti	PERSON	, after the fervor of youth was past , wearied exceedingly of the
P. R. B.	PERSON	, and was disposed to resent any allusion to it .

		In
1880	DATE	he said to Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	, '' As for all the prattle about Praeraphaelitism , I con - fess to you I am weary of it , and long have been .

		Why should we go on talking about the vision - ary vanities of half-a-dozen boys ?

		What you call the movement was serious enough , but the banding together under that title was all a joke . ''

		To a lady who asked him if he were `` the
Prseraphaelite Rossetti	PERSON	, '' he replied curtly , '' Madame , I am not an ' ite ' of any kind ; I am only a painter . ''

		Rossetti 's first exhibited picture was '' The Girlhood of
Mary Virgin	PERSON	'' -LRB- signed ''
Dante Gabriel Rossetti	PERSON	, P. R. B. '' -RRB- , which he sent to the Free Exhibition in
1849	DATE	.

		The work was well received by the critics -LRB- the storm against Prseraphaelitism began in the following year -RRB- , and was promptly sold at the painter 's own price of ,80 .

		Turning to our author 's account of the liter - ary side of
Rossetti	PERSON	's career , we find that his first printed poem was '' Sir
Hugh the Heron	PERSON	, '' a boyish attempt imitative of
Scott	LOCATION	, begun when the author was twelve , and printed
two years later	DATE	at his grandfather
Polidori	PERSON	's private press .

		In
1861	DATE	appeared his unsurpassed translations from '' The Early Italian Poets . ''

		In
1867	DATE	he was attacked by insomnia , accompanied by par - tial failure of eyesight .

		Disabled thus from the practice of one art , he turned his thoughts more exclusively to the other ; and his former vague project of one day issuing a volume of poems quickly took shape .

		Those familiar with
Rossetti	PERSON	's life will recall a romantic incident connected with the preparation of this volume .

		His wife , to whom he was tenderly attached , died in
1862	DATE	, after two years of wedded life .

		This loss seemed to the stricken painter to cover life with a funeral pall ; and in his early trans - 166 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, ports of despair he went into the room where his dead wife lay , and placed his cherished book of MS. poems in her coffin putting , says Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	, '' the volume between her cheek and beautiful hair , and it was that day buried with her in
Highgate	LOCATION	Cemetery . '' ''

		I have often , '' he said , '' been writing at those poems when
Lizzie	PERSON	was ill and suffering , and I might have been attending to her , and now they shall go . ''

		In
1869	DATE	he yielded to his friends ' solicitations that his wife 's coffin be exhumed , and the MS. recovered .

		This was done on
October 10	DATE	; and he was thus again put in possession of the cor - rect form of his old poems , and also of some pieces of which he had retained no fragments .

		The volume was published on
April 25 , 1870	DATE	; and the chorus of praise for it was '' eager , loud , and prolonged . ''

		But there was presently a bitterly dissentient voice .

		In the '' Contem - porary Review '' for
October , 1871	DATE	, appeared an abusive article headed '' The Fleshly School of Poetry Mr.
D. G. Rossetti	PERSON	, '' and signed ''
Thomas Maitland	PERSON	'' ''
Maitland	PERSON	'' soon prov - ing to be Mr.
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	.

		As Mr.
Ros	PERSON	- setti lays great stress on this deplorable epi - sode , owing to its averred serious effect on his brother , we shall briefly review his version of it .

		The animus of the ''
Maitland	PERSON	'' article is , he states , primarily traceable to a review he himself had written in
1866	DATE	.

		It was in that year that Mr.
Buchanan	PERSON	's burlesque poem , '' The Session of the Poets , '' appeared in the '' Spectator , '' following the issue of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' Poems and Ballads . ''

		It contained these lines : '' Up jumped , with his neck stretching out like a gander ,
Master Swinburne	ORGANIZATION	, and squealed , glaring out through his hair , ' All virtue is bosh 1 Hallelujah for Landor !

		I disbelieve wholly in everything !

		There 1 ' With language so awful he dared then to treat 'em , Miss Ingelow faulted in
Tennyson	LOCATION	's arms ; Poor Arnold rushed out , crying ' Saed ' inficetum ! '

		And great bards and small bards were full of alarms : Till
Tennyson	PERSON	, flaming and red as a gipsy , Struck his fist on the table , and uttered a shout : 4 To the door with the boy !

		Call a cab I He is tipsy ! '

		And they carried the naughty young gentleman out . ''

		At about this time Mr.
William Rossetti	PERSON	was writing a review of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's book ; and the above lines moved him to open his critique as follows : '' The advent of a great poet is sure to cause a com - motion of one kind or another ; and it would be hard were this otherwise in times like ours , when the advent of even so poor and pretentious a poetaster as a
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	stirs storms in teapots . ''

		So scored , Mr.
Buchanan	PERSON	soon found occasion to '' pitch into '' an edition of
Shelley	PERSON	prepared by his assailant , amiably affirming it to be '' the very worst edition of Shelley which has ever seen the light '' ; and thus was the battle joined .

		Rossetti was not much cast down , it seems , by the ''
Maitland	PERSON	'' article ; but it was far otherwise when this piece reappeared -LRB- 1872 -RRB- much enlarged and trebly charged with venom , in a pamphlet volume entitled '' The Fleshly School of Poetry , and other Phenomena of the Day , by
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	. ''

		As to
Rossetti	PERSON	's Poems , the pamphlet avers : '' ... There is thorough nastiness in many pieces .

		A sickening desire is evinced to reproduce the sensual mood .

		Rossetti has not given us one rounded and note - worthy piece of art .

		He is fleshly all over , from the roots of his hair to the tips of his toes .

		Bad rhymea become the rule , and not the exception ... Sonnets 11 to 20 are one profuse sweat of animalism .

		<
The House of Life	ORGANIZATION	' is a very hotbed of nasty phrases ... In
Rossetti	PERSON	's poetry there is a veritably stupendous pre - ponderance of sensuality and sickly animalism .

		He and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	merely echo what is vile '' etc. .

		It may be charitably assumed that the writer of this precious '' appreciation '' was not aware when he wrote it that many of the compositions which he thus characterized as deliberate and unredeemed filth had once been placed by their author as a pious sacrifice in his dead wife 's coffin .

		When the pamphlet appeared
Rossetti	PERSON	was in a distressing state , mentally and bodily , partly from insomnia , but chiefly through over - dosing with chloral .

		He had resorted to the drug as a soporific in
1870	DATE	; and from eighteen grains nightly , he had rapidly increased his allowance to 180 grains !

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	states that '' no case has been recorded in the annals of medicine in which one patient has taken so much , or even half so much , chloral as
Rossetti	PERSON	took . ''

		Thus , domestic grief and the strain of a restless , teeming imagination had brought on insomnia ; insomnia had led to chloral ; and chloral to depression , with a turmoil of distem - pered fears and fantasies .

		When Mr.
Bu	PERSON	- chanan 's pamphlet appeared ,
Rossetti	PERSON	was on the verge of mental collapse ; and this unhappy screed seems to have finished the work .

		His fancies , says the author , '' now ran away with him , and he thought the pamphlet was a first symptom in a widespread ' conspiracy ' for crushing his fair fame as an artist and a man , and for hounding him out of honest society . ''

		His manifold delusions were thenceforth tinged with this notion .

		Having received , for instance , from Mr.
Browning	PERSON	a copy of his '' Fifine at the Fair , '' he at once fastened upon some lines at the end as being a spiteful attack upon him - self ; and Mr.
Browning	PERSON	was thereupon set down as a leading member of the '' conspiracy . ''

		Rossetti was never able to quite rid himself of
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 167 this fancy .

		To Mr.
Browning	PERSON	was soon joined , as a fellow-conspirator , Mr.
Dodgson	PERSON	, whose wildly absurd nonsense-poem , '' The Hunting of the Snark , '' the unhappy man declared to be a pasquinade against himself .

		Another delu - sion may be recorded , if only as a curiosity in mental pathology .

		While staying at Broad - lands , a friend 's seat in
Hampshire	LOCATION	,
Rossetti	PERSON	one day became angered at a thrush which trilled its lay in an adjoining garden , conceiv - ing that the bird had been trained by the con - spirers against his peace '' to ejaculate some - thing insulting to him '' !

		Rossetti 's illness culminated in the attempt at suicide -LRB- at the house of a Dr.
Hake	PERSON	-RRB- to which Mr.
Bell Scott	PERSON	has vaguely alluded , and of which the author , '' rather than leave the matter open to dubious conjecture , '' gives a frankly detailed account , saying that his brother 's despair impelled him finally to swallow the contents of a bottle of laudanum . ''

		Of course his intention was sui - cide . ''

		Mr.
Rossetti	PERSON	, as we have seen , inclines to view the
Buchanan	PERSON	attack upon his brother as contributing largely to his mental upset ; and his tone throughout the chapter treating of the matter -LRB- even where he mentions Mr.
Buchan	PERSON	- an 's final retraction -RRB- is charged with bitterness . ''

		It is , '' he avers , '' a simple fact , that from the time when the pamphlet had begun to work into the inner tissue of his feelings ,
Dante Ros	PERSON	- setti was a changed man , and so continued till the close of his life . ''

		It seems clear that the pamphlet , appearing when it did , inflamed Ros - setti 's malady , and determined the peculiar drift of his hallucinations ; but we must con - clude , on our author 's own showing , that had Mr.
Buchanan	PERSON	never written of the '' Fleshly School , '' insomnia and chloral , acting upon so sensitive and delicately balanced an organism , must have wrought approximately as they did .

		Mr.
Rossetti	PERSON	's narrative is a little jumbled , but it is eminently candid , and full of telling color and detail .

		It sets before us most vividly the true
Dante Rossetti	PERSON	a widely different figure , let us add , from the affected , fantastic
Rossetti	PERSON	, half coxcomb , half mystic , as painted by the popular fancy .

		The letters are famil - iar , rather off-hand compositions , valuable mainly as reflecting the personality of the writer .

		The volumes form a desirable memo - rial of that rare genius whose distinction it is to have furnished his time with new and worthy pictorial and poetical ideals , and to have left the world appreciably richer in two arts .

		THE
PARIS	LOCATION	COMMUNE OF
1871	DATE	.

		* The Commune of
1871	DATE	can never impress our imagination as does her terrible elder sis - ter of
' 89	DATE	.

		The events are perhaps too near us and the personal insignificance and selfish pusillanimity of the chief actors stand out too clearly in the pitiless glare of modern publicity .

		Moreover , the Revolution was a justified revolt against an organized system of political oppres - sion and caste privilege , and amid all its ex - travagances and atrocities pursued a definite policy to a successful result .

		The leaders of the Commune never made it quite clear to them - selves , their adherents , or the world , whether they were contending for municipal autonomy , for the social revolution , or for the temporary command of the luxuries of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		And the vague social distress and discontent which found vent through them is a phenomenon concern - ing the causes , the justification , and the possi - ble cure of which we are still in the dark .

		Their sole contribution to the problem has been to strengthen the deep distrust with which so - ber men regard any attempts at reform that begin by weakening the restraints which the present organization of society enforces upon the brute beast within the man .

		But though the higher historical imagina - tion is not deeply stirred , there is a certain hor - rible fascination in reading of events like these taking place , not in the dimly conceived pre -
Haussmannic Paris	LOCATION	, but in the streets and squares of that very capital of pleasure and happy hunting-ground of the
Cook	ORGANIZATION	's tourist that we know so well how the Place de la Con - corde shelled the Arc de Triomphe , and the Arc de Triomphe swept with grape-shot the Champs Elysees , how fiends in the shape of women fired the
Rue Royale	ORGANIZATION	with petroleum , how the dead lay in heaps on the floor of La Madeleine , while the
Louvre	LOCATION	was encircled with a cordon of fire , and frenzied horsemen gal - loped from the fortress of the
Hotel de Ville	ORGANIZATION	to the armed camp in the
Place Vendome	ORGANIZATION	with orders to '' blow up everything . ''

		It is as hard for us to realize as it was for the dazed French trooper whom
Ludovic Halevy	PERSON	in his amusing reminiscences speaks of meeting at the gates of the city , and who to all inquiries could only reply breathlessly : '' It 's jess paralyzin ' in
Paris	LOCATION	barricades all over the place , and bombs , and gun-shots , and pistols going off , it 's jess paralyzin ' , even if nothin ' hits you . ''

		* THE HISTORY OF THE
PARIS	LOCATION	COMMUNE OF
1871	DATE	.

		Thomas
March	DATE	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		By 168 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, This story has just been told by Mr.
Thomas March	PERSON	in his '' History of the
Paris	LOCATION	Commune of
1871	DATE	. ''

		The book is a somewhat amateur - ish performance , but merits attention as the first attempt in English to present a systematic impartial narration of these events based on a study of the sources .

		Mr.
March	PERSON	cites as his authorities , and conscientiously uses , the offi - cial reports of the French Commission of En - qifiry , the military report of
Marshall Mac	ORGANIZATION	-
Mahon	PERSON	, the proceedings of the
Conseils de Guerre	ORGANIZATION	and a number of other minor French treatises apologetic or explanatory .

		But his main reliance has evidently been the classical work of Maxime du Camp '' Les Convulsions de
Paris	LOCATION	, '' first published in the form of arti - cles in the `` Revue des Deux Mondes . ''

		A brief introductory chapter sketches the rise of the International and the fomentation of rad - ical sentiment by the repressive regime and the injustices of the
Third Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		The narration proper begins with the arrival of the news of the Capitulation of Sedan , and the consequent deposition of the Emperor by an infuriated Parisian mob on the
4th of September	DATE	.

		Three or four chapters are devoted to the history of the siege , including a full description of the unsuccessful attempt of the revolutionary party on the
31st of October	DATE	to oust the
Government of National Defence	ORGANIZATION	from the
Hotel de Ville	ORGANIZATION	.

		We are then shown the gradual growth and consolidation of this party , the federation of the national guards , the organization of the
Central Committee	ORGANIZATION	, the daily increasing popu - lar distrust and discontent , and the final exas - peration of the populace by the terms of the truce and the German occupation of the Champs Elysees .

		Only a spark was needed to ignite this inflammable material .

		It was struck from a collision of the mob with the forces of the government in a blundering attempt of the lat - ter to seize the cannon which the guards had dragged up to
Montmartre	LOCATION	for fear that
Thiers	PERSON	would abandon them to
Bismarck	LOCATION	.

		The failure of this attempt , and the consequent withdrawal of
Thiers	ORGANIZATION	to
Versailles	LOCATION	, delivered
Paris	LOCATION	over to the revolutionary leaders , somewhat to their own surprise and embarrassment .

		Of their rule , or misrule , from
March 18	DATE	to
May 21	DATE	, when the reorganized army of
Versailles	LOCATION	reen - tered the city , Mr.
March	PERSON	gives a full , clear , and impartial account .

		It would not be easy to lend artistic unity to this part of the story .

		For among these improvised rulers no man and no party possessing a definite policy exercised effective predominancy ; and so the narration of their actions breaks up into a fragmentary history of committees , departments , and the sterile agitations of individual greed or ambi - tion .

		Any member of the Commune who could get control of one of the great departmental buildings was practically master there , unless he interfered overmuch with his colleagues , or seemed to be compromising the safety of the whole .

		The ultimate test of a man 's influence was his power of '' bluff , '' or perhaps rather the number of federated battalions that it was believed would rise at his bidding .

		Mr.
March	PERSON	confines himself to a plain nar - rative of the military operations , if they may be so called , and the legislative action of the Commune .

		He would have made a far more readable book if he had availed himself more freely of the stores of interesting anecdote and amusing character-sketches accessible in
Max	LOCATION	- ime du Camp and his other sources .

		Of the real aims and motives of the more serious - minded among the leaders , of their justification in their own eyes , he tells us little , and his por - traits of their characters are slight and not always discriminating .

		He recognizes the es - sential integrity of purpose of Delescluze and
Varlin	PERSON	, whom he calls , '' in honor , modesty , and sincerity the noblest ... of the entire Com - mune . ''

		He does more than justice to that con - temptible dandified bully ,
Raoul Rigault	PERSON	, when he pronounces him '' the one strong-willed man of the Commune , '' and perhaps something less than justice to
Jourde	PERSON	, who probably saved the
Bank of France	ORGANIZATION	, and who at any rate handled millions without a suspicion attaching to his honesty .

		The most readable part of the book is the full vivid description in the last hundred pages of the terrible eight days of fighting in the streets , which gradually strained the nerves of the soldiers as well as of the insurgents to the point where men become more or less than men , and culminated in wholesale cold-blooded butchery on both sides .

		A brief conclusion sketches the dealings of the French courts with the 36 , - 000 prisoners taken , and the fate of some of the prominent leaders of the movement .

		The author 's style , though straightforward and not unpleasant , is unformed and at times incorrect .

		He abuses the historic present a form of vi - vacity in which only a
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	may safely in - dulge and now and then relieves his emotions by naive apostrophes and ejaculatory moraliz - ings , such as : '' Alarmed , no !

		disgusted and humiliated , '' '' Take heed , ye men of strong per - suasions ! '' ''

		Speed ye ,
Versaillais	PERSON	, if ye would

		THE DIAL 169 save your idolized city from a frightful calam - ity . ''

		There is a more than Thucydidean license of anacoluthon in the syntax of '' and
Paris	LOCATION	was shut in upon herself for a few days only partially but presently to be absolute . ''

		And what Mr.
March	PERSON	would call an '' undisciplin - ary '' imagination expresses itself in such met - aphors as : '' The hot-headed youthdom which studies in
Paris	LOCATION	and becomes the feeding-trough of successive revolutions , '' or '' the Commune borne into existence by a current of supposed patriotism which was only a cloak '' etc. .

		And in addition to these oddities of expression , the reader 's attention is now and then startled by such freaks or monstrosities as : '' inflamma - gent , '' '' infuriated simples , '' '' arson as a prin - ciple of practiques , '' '' light-souled bouncers , '' ''
Rigault	PERSON	's body was lain beside a barricade , '' '' punctilious for his own safety , '' '' la deche - anse '' -LSB- #ic -RSB- , `` a motley and disorderly parapher - nalia . ''

		General ideas and illuminating phil - osophic criticism are wanting , unless we can accept as such the sapient observation that '' hasty retributions are swift and often irre - mediable iniquities , '' or the aphorism `` the intolerance of one sect is and ever shall be com - pensated by that of another , '' or the apocalyp - tic final utterance that '' only the dumb have a universal language , and only the outcasts actual or prospective of society can own a uni - versal republic . ''

		Perhaps no very definite lesson can as yet be derived from this casual outburst of the ap - petites and envies that are always seething be - neath the thin crust of civilization .

		We can see that , even apart from the peculiar conditions created by the siege ,
Paris	LOCATION	was the predestined theatre of this uprising .

		For
Paris	LOCATION	is the one city in which the pleasures of Vhomme sensuel moyen are most persistently and tantalizingly dangled before the eyes of the disinherited .

		And there is no other city in which a little money is so easily and obviously convertible into those pleasures as
Paris	LOCATION	.

		I mean that the poor devil in the street of
Paris	LOCATION	has a much more vivid conception of what it would be like to descend from his garret to a first floor apart - ment , to sip his absinthe at the Cafe Eiche , dine at the
Cafe Anglais	LOCATION	, and enjoy the other de - lights obtruded upon his notice by the capital of pleasure , than his
Chicago	LOCATION	counterpart can possibly have of the discreet and sheltered lux - ury of a home on the
Lake Shore Drive	ORGANIZATION	or on Prairie Avenue .

		He would know better how to transmute a purse of money into the pleas - ures he covets .

		And frequent revolutions have familiarized him with the idea that the shortest way to this consummation is the seizure of po - litical power .

		This reflection will not explain the action of the few honest fanatics of the Commune , but it contains the entire '' psychol - ogy '' of a majority of its '' colonels '' and '' generals '' and minor officials .

		The chief lesson of the miserable story for the student of history after the obvious warning that our civilization is only skin deep is the ruinous folly of procrastination , of half measures , of drifting with the tide in matters that con - cern the passions of the unthinking masses of men .

		Neither the revolutionary nor the gov - ernmental leaders intended or foresaw in the beginning the horrors of the final week .

		But both , while playing with the passions of their supporters , allowed affairs to drift until con - cession and retreat were impossible .

		A series of blunders and untoward accidents intensified the exasperation of the combatants on either side , and so , to apply a phrase of Mr.
Raskin	PERSON	, they saw '' The resolved arbitration of the des - tinies conclude into precision of doom what they blindly and feebly began . ''

Manning	PERSON	'' was less a man of letters than a very astute man of business . ''

		But
Manning	PERSON	was much more than even a very astute man of business , because just as surely as his con - sumate diplomacy in ecclesiastical affairs rose at times to the dignity of statesmanship was
Manning	PERSON	a great ecclesiastical statesman .

		His life was , indeed , so complete that he once inti - mated it would require at least three biogra - phers to write it adequately : '' an Oxford man for the first period ; a priest for dogmas and councils and diocesan business -LRB- though I doubt if the same one could do the Roman part and the Westminster part -RRB- ; and for the political and social questions of my latter days a third , ' in rebus vitce publicce apprime versatus . ' ''

		If Mr. Pur cell , therefore , in his new '' Life of Cardinal
Manning	PERSON	, '' was called upon to per - form the work of three men , he was , on the other hand , given an abundance of material sufficient for at least three ordinary biographies .

		Besides having access to diaries , journals , au - * LIFE OF CARDINAL

Westmin	ORGANIZATION	- ster .

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		170 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, tobiographical notes , and a multitude of letters , he had constant opportunities of learning from Cardinal
Manning	PERSON	himself the story of his life and the motives of his action .

		Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	, than whom no one was more intimately asso - ciated with
Manning	PERSON	in his Anglican days , was also an inspiring source of information .

		This invaluable material -LRB- and it should be added that in his private diaries the Cardinal had revealed the inner workings of his mind with unusual clearness -RRB- Mr.
Purcell	PERSON	has used with utmost liberality , allowing Cardinal
Manning	PERSON	to relate , in so far as was possible , his own life in his own words .

		The truth is , Mr.
Purcell	PERSON	has been generous with his material to the point of indiscretion , and , not content with this , he has lingered over the weaknesses of his hero , while he does not seem to have emphasized his greatnesses .

		But if this be undeniable , it is just as undeniable that Mr.
Purcell	PERSON	's book throws a flood of light on matters of importance hitherto hidden in obscurity .

		One of these is the conversion of
Archdea	LOCATION	- con
Manning	PERSON	to Catholicism .

		It has always been supposed that
Manning	PERSON	seceded from the English Church because of the acceptance by that church of royal supremacy on doctrinal matters , resulting from the decision in
March , 1850	DATE	, which permitted its priests to deny the doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration .

		But the extracts from
Manning	PERSON	's diary , and from his letters to
Charles Laprimaudaye	PERSON	and
Robert Wilberforce	PERSON	, prove beyond a doubt that as early as
May , 1846	DATE	, he had intellectually broken from the Anglican Church , although there is not a trace of this rupture in his public utter - ances until after the
Gorham Judgment	ORGANIZATION	.

		Af - flicted all these years by conflicting claims of conscience , his faith in the Catholic Church steadily increasing ,
Manning	PERSON	still preached with as much apparent assurance and author - ity as ever .

		The only explanation of this seem - ing duplicity lies in what Cardinal
Vaughan	PERSON	, the present
Archbishop of Westminster	ORGANIZATION	, has said about
Manning	PERSON	. ''

		Those who knew the Cardinal well , '' he observes , `` knew that he had two moods of character .

		One of great cau - tion and self-restraint when he spoke or wrote in public .

		Measure and prudence were then dictated by a high sense of responsibility .

		An - other , of singular freedom and playfulness of speech , when he thoroughly unbent with those whom he trusted in private . ''

		Mr.
Purcell	PERSON	fur - thermore suggests : ''
Manning	PERSON	had , to put it broadly , two sets of people to deal with : the one set , those who put their trust in him the ecclesiastical authorities and his own peni - tents ; the other set , those in whom he put his trust his intimate friends and confessors .

		He dealt with each set from different standpoints : from the one he consid - ered it his duty to conceal his religious doubts aud dif - ficulties ; to the other he laid bare , as in conscience bound , the secrets of his soul . ''

		Although Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	belonged to the former of these sets , there existed between the statesman and the churchman a very ardent friendship .

		Until
Manning	PERSON	's conversion they were , according to Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's own ac - count , '' in close and constant communication '' ; in many of the battles of belief they fought side by side .

		In
1838	DATE	they were together in
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

		Ask
Gladstone	PERSON	, ' the Cardinal once said , ' whether he remembers standing side by side with me in the Church of 8 .

		Luigi dei Francesi , listening to the sermon of a Dominican friar , and saying to me , ' Such preachers we want at home eloquent and impassioned , yet sin - gularly dogmatic in their teachings . '

		This incident Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	remembered well . '

		Ask the Cardinal , ' he said in retort , ' if he remembers how , when we were walking together one
Sunday	DATE	morning in the
Piazza dei Fiore	PERSON	, he rebuked me for buying apples on a
Sunday	DATE	.

		The Cardinal Archbishop , ' he added with a smile , ' is , I fancy , far more tolerant than the straitlaced parson of that day . ' ''

		After
Manning	PERSON	was received into the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	in
1851	DATE	he and
Gladstone	PERSON	did not meet for twelve years ; their interrupted correspond - ence was then renewed , but it was without the warmth that marked their early friendship .

		However , the friendship between
Gladstone	PERSON	and
Manning	PERSON	was much more sincere and last - ing than that between
Newman	PERSON	and
Manning	PERSON	.

		Between these men a mutual mistrust seems to have arisen after
Manning	PERSON	, who at no time was very strongly influenced by the Oxford Move - ment , and had , indeed , withdrawn from the Movement upon becoming
Archdeacon	PERSON	of Chi - chester , attacked the Tracterians in his Fifth of
November	DATE	Sermon ,
1843	DATE	.

		This distressing mistrust was never overcome on the part of either , and a conciliatory correspondence begun in
1867	DATE	resulted in each expressing the not un - humorous resolution of saying a series of masses for the friendly intentions of the other .

		Two years later
Newman	PERSON	wrote to Manning : '' I do not know whether I am on my head or my heels when I have active relations with you . ''

		After they became cardinals they met but twice .

		Yet such is the eloquent complexity of man 's char - acter that at Cardinal
Newman	PERSON	's death Man - ning spoke of him as his '' brother and friend of more than sixty years '' !

		As a churchman
Manning	PERSON	's work was three -
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 171 fold , that of the author , of the preacher , and of the spiritual guide .

		As an author , his style was sometimes obscure , seldom distinctive , al - ways unpolished .

		He was not an original thinker , nor a profoundly read theologian ; he was not logical enough to be a successful con - troversialist , nor imaginative enough to pro- duce literature of lasting merit .

		As a pulpit orator , a clear penetrating voice added to a dig - nified and impressive manner .

		But with Man - ning , even more than with
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, conscience was three-fourths of life , and the rules of conduct which he prescribed as a spir - itual guide were often extremely rigorous .

		In the fulness of his piety he thought more of the spirit than of beauty .

		In the larger sphere of public action Man - ning was , with his tact , his diplomatic skill , his persuasive and conciliatory manners , and his great tenacity of purpose , everywhere so emi - nently successful , that he was once likened to '' a pawn on the ecclesiastical chessboard , push - ing his way through hostile lines to the goal of his desires . ''

		If his methods were sometimes open to criticism , as in the
Errington	PERSON	case -LRB- upon which Mr.
Purcell	PERSON	dwells much too minutely _ -RRB- , his conduct was always inspired by pure and exalted motives .

		His most brilliant honors as an ecclesiastical statesman were won as a Father of the
Vatican Council	ORGANIZATION	, where , turning aside all opposition , he brought about the definition of
Papal Infallibility	ORGANIZATION	.

		The meeting of the
Vatican Council	ORGANIZATION	at which this definition was carried is vividly described by Mr.
Purcell	PERSON	: On
Monday the 18th of July , 1870	DATE	-LSB- the
Vatican Council	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- held its fourth and last public session .

		The excitement was intense .

		The moral as well as the ma - terial atmosphere was charged with electricity .

		Men to whom the Faith of the Church was as a breath to their nostrils stood in that hour trembling on the verge of future events , they knew not what revolt , schism , apostacy , perhaps the fall , if not of nations and peoples , as the prophets of ill had predicted , of individuals , bishops , priests , and even whole communities .

		The thunder-storm , the lightnings from
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	which burst over the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	, as the
Council	ORGANIZATION	received and ratified the Papal Decree , was but a pale reflex or faint whisper of the moral storm which agitated the hearts of men , and shook for a time from their balance the minds of but too many .

		The more subdued the excitement , the more intense .

		The white-mitred Fathers of the Coun - cil , as they took part in the last scene of the moving drama , were subdued into a silence by a feeling akin to awe .

		Manning was , perhaps , the most silent ; but , as an eye-witness related , his face was flushed with ex - citement and transfigured with an indescribable look of triumph at the unanimity with which the
Council	ORGANIZATION	, in obedience to the Divine Will , ratified , as he had pre - dicted , the dogma of Papal Infallibility .

		... On the day after the Definition
Tuesday , 19th of July	DATE	War was declared between
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		And War , the great proroguer of Councils , prorogued the
Vatican Council	ORGANIZATION	for an indefinite period . ''

		Unfortunately , all the chapters of Mr.
Pur	PERSON	- cell 's work do not show the really masterful treatment of that from which I have just quoted .

		The value of the work is seriously marred by an unusual quantity of misprints and oversights , and by mistakes in matters of fact which might have been remedied by a careful revision .

		Mr.
Purcell	PERSON	, moreover , has shown little skill in the treatment of his material , and almost no sense of proportion .

		There are many needless repe - titions .

		Further than this , Mr.
Purcell	PERSON	is un - justly severe with his hero , and frequently im - putes to Cardinal
Manning	PERSON	motives utterly unworthy of so good and great a man .

		RECENT BIBLICAL , CRITICISM .

		* American interest in matters of Biblical criticism , instead of waning , is constantly growing .

		The the - ories of German scholars have not merely become known to technical students , but they are perme - ating also the atmosphere of popular knowledge .

		Books are being prepared which the ordinarily in - telligent person can read with profit , and which will enable him to thread his way through the somewhat devious paths of the Higher Criticism with clearer view and surer step .

		As a result , some clearly de - fined attitudes on the part of a larger company than that of the scholars are easily discernible .

		There is , first of all , a small number of those who have ac - cepted , without much study , the most radical conclu - sions of the most radical of German scholars .

		These are for the most part clergymen who are proud to be numbered among the favorers of all new things , who have accepted these views , not because they have become convinced by careful study that here is the only safe ground , but because these theories are destructive of much that has been for a long time accepted among us .

		At the other extreme stands the class of rigidly orthodox persons , who are equally ignorant with the former class of the real facts in the case , but who are always against any - thing that is new .

		Between these are several other classes standing at varying distances from one or the other .

		172 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, in some degree these topics and perceiving their extreme difficulty , are inclined to leave the matter alone until more definite conclusions have been reached .

		Some , having given careful study to the subject , feel that the orthodox position has not been seriously disturbed ; others recognize that new points of view must be taken , but are not prepared to take them .

		There are still others who hold that the re - sults of Biblical criticism , while affecting the out - ward form of the Biblical revelation , have not at all changed the essential truth of it .

		They either reduce the discredited material to moral teaching through symbolism , or hold faith and science strictly apart from one another .

		Meanwhile , the field is being cleared somewhat by the examination of fundamental principles .

		A little book by Professor
A. C. Zenos	PERSON	, entitled '' The Elements of the Higher Criticism , '' is of exceeding value in this respect .

		With steady judicial balance the true meaning and proper methods of the Higher Criticism are set forth , as well as the relation of this science to other associated sciences , and the dangers that threaten the scholar in his employ - ment of this instrument .

		The book is a model of clearness , and , coming as it does from one who is recognized as belonging to the conservative wing of the Presbyterian church , will be of great influence in opening the eyes and clarifying the judgment of those who are associated with that party , while it is of real service to their opponents to have pointed out to them in so reasonable a manner the difficul - ties and extravagances into which one may fall by an unwarranted use of the Higher Criticism .

		It is interesting to notice that Professor Zenos draws all his illustrations of the methods of Higher Criticism from its abuses .

		One reading his book would be inclined to think that the higher critics have been constantly making mistakes , and that the method has accomplished little or nothing .

		We can under - stand the hindrances under which Professor Zenos labored , and , on the whole , think him eminently wise in the cautious way in which he has proceeded .

		It would be of inestimable benefit to any intelligent student of the
Bible	LOCATION	to read and digest this clear and valuable manual .

		Professor
William Henry Green	PERSON	is recognized as the champion of the conservative school in Biblical study , and from no other writings can one gain so clear an understanding of the merits and the de - fects of this school than from his two books now before us .

		In '' The Higher Criticism of the Pen - tateuch '' he has set forth the general principles which should govern any proper study of this por - tion of the Old Testament and his criticisms of the methods and results of the progressive school .

		He starts with the acceptance of the unity of the
Bible	LOCATION	, and has here done excellent service in bringing for - ward an often forgotten fact , namely , that the
Bible	LOCATION	, as it stands , has a single message , an organized character .

		But it seems to us that the conclusion which he has drawn from this important fact , namely , that therefore there is presumptive evidence that the
Bible	LOCATION	was originally a unity in all its parts , can not but be regarded as unwarrantable .

		His whole discussion is vitiated by this begging of the question ; and , indeed , we find it difficult to follow him , since he is constantly making those assump - tions which should not precede , but follow , a study of the material itself .

		The question , e.g. , in what respect the
Bible	LOCATION	is the Word of God , is answered in the
Bible	LOCATION	itself , by a study of its own statements and contents ; one particular theory on this point can not be accepted beforehand and made the basis of argument .

		In his second work , `` The Unity of the Book of Genesis , '' Dr.
Green	PERSON	has done some most excellent service by testing in detail the hypotheses of the ad - vanced critics concerning the formation of the
Book of Genesis	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is not one suited for pop - ular reading , but demands a knowledge of Hebrew .

		To anyone who is willing to give time and patience to the examination of this book in connection with a book of the other school there will come a clearer and juster view of the scope and the results of the work of the Higher Criticism as it has dealt with the book of Genesis .

		Such a work of the advanced school is found in the translation of
Kittel	PERSON	's '' The History of the He - brews . ''

		Professor
Kittel	PERSON	is a representative of the so-called
Dillmann	PERSON	school of Old Testament criti - cism , not the most radical of the German schools .

		His mediating attitude has been severely criticized by some modern scholars -LRB- notably in a fierce review of the '' History '' by the late
W. Robertson Smith	PERSON	-RRB- , but without reason .

		The book requires the same detailed study that is demanded by Professor Green 's '' Genesis , '' and anyone who hopes to find in it an interesting story , such as
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	gave us in his lectures on the Jewish Church , will be disap - pointed .

		It is a book for scholars and for those who can give time to the study of processes .

		We are not especially impressed with the excellence of the translation .

		Some passages , fortunately not many , are made quite unintelligible , and the whole is not up to the standard required of modern trans - lations .

		Still , we hail this book with great satisfac - tion , because now for the first time is presented to students the opportunity of studying in English speech a History of
Israel	LOCATION	, based on the most ap - proved results of Higher Criticism and written by a learned , devout and candid scholar .

		Few people know that there was another class of teachers in Ancient
Israel	LOCATION	besides the prophets and the priests , but so we learn from Professor Kent 's '' The Wise Men of Ancient
Israel	LOCATION	and Their Pro- verbs . ''

		Merely to call attention to the work of the wise men of the Old Testament is a sufficient rea - son for this book .

		The kernel of its usefulness is found in a classification of the precepts of the Book of Proverbs according to their significance rather than on the helter-skelter method of the original collection .

		Dr.
Kent	PERSON	has also furnished a series of introductory studies in which he discusses fully and very satisfactorily the work of the wise men , the
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 173 wisdom literature of the Old Testament , and the peculiarities of the Book of Proverbs .

		Two supple - mental studies are also added , the first dealing with that inevitable topic contained in every book nowadays , '' the ' social teachings ' of the Wise Men , '' and the second handling in a fresh way Jesus ' use of the Book of Proverbs .

		While there is nothing especially original in the book , it is a clever and instructive presentation of material which one hith - erto would have had to go far to find .

		SHORT STORIES BY
AMERICAN WRITERS	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Every season brings to the library-table a num - ber of books which serve particularly to illustrate how wide a field is offered the story-writer by the diversified geography of our continent and the het - erogeneous population by which it is inhabited .

		This literature of the locality and the lesser community , taking for the most part the form of the short story , swells rapidly in volume , but its possibilities are al - most infinite , and the staid city-dweller is only be - ginning to realize the variety of the life that finds shelter within the broad confines of the Republic .

		Mr.
John Fox , Jr.	PERSON	is one of the newest workers in this field of the distinctly localized tale or charac - ter-study , and his first book , '' A
Cumberland Ven	ORGANIZATION	- detta and Other Stories , '' exhibits strength of con - ception and finished workmanship .

		only two pages , but is a masterpiece of condensed dramatic narrative .

		There is a great deal of dia - lect in these stories , but they would be impossible without it , and we never feel that it is used out of pure wantonness .

		Mr.
Fox	PERSON	has , in this volume , achieved a distinct success , and it will not take much more of such work to give him high rank among our story-writers .

		Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	's '' Red Men and White '' is a collection of frontier sketches and stories , eight in number , which present with vividness of portrayal the various types of civilized and uncivilized human - ity to be found in the far West .


Arizona	LOCATION	and
Idaho	LOCATION	are the scenes of most of these sketches , and the pages are peopled with Indians , cowboys , miners , barroom-loafers , tenderfeet , and soldiers , all drawn to the life , and all participating in picturesque , ad - venturous , or humorous situations .

		Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's story of '' The Second
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise '' is one of the best short stories that have ever been told of our frontier life .

		It deals with the unreconstructed members of the Territorial Legislature of
Idaho	LOCATION	in the year
1867	DATE	, and is a story of allegiance to the Lost Cause brought into conflict with the very hu - man yearning to draw a periodical stipend from the money-chest of the despised but victorious govern - ment .

		Another of the stories '' The General 's Bluff '' contains some excellent Indian strategy , and has General Crook for a central figure .

		These stories have a moral , two morals in fact .

		One bf them is the danger to our civilization resulting from the lawlessness of the frontier ; the other is the dif - ficulty of dealing with Indian affairs at long range , by a lot of wiseacres at
Washington	LOCATION	who have never seen an Indian in his native haunts .

		Both morals are impressively put , and we should as a nation do well to heed them . ''

		There are gentlemen vagabonds and vagabond gentlemen .

		Here and there one finds a vagabond pure and simple , and once in a lifetime one meets a gentleman simple and pure .

		Without premedi - tated intent , or mental bias , I have unconsciously to myself chosen some one of these several types entangling them in the threads of the stories between these covers . ''

		Thus Mr.
Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	prefaces his new volume of nine stories and sketches , and thus we are to interpret their lesson .

		The fine al - though decayed Southern gentleman of the titular story , and the physician who is the unconscious hero of '' A Knight of the Legion of Honor , '' are the most carefully studied types of gentleman to be found in these pages , and their conduct speaks well for the ideals of character that most appeal to the author .

		Slight as some of these sketches are , they are all informed with a kindliness of spirit that can not fail to touch the heart of the reader , while their pictur - esque observation and shrewd humor give them a charm that almost makes one forget how fragment - ary they are .

		Five other stories go with `` The Bachelor 's Christ - mas '' to round out Mr.
Robert Grant	PERSON	's new book .

		These stories are studies in light comedy , based upon 174 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, incidents frequently improbable , and not notable for constructive skill , yet easy , graceful , and entertain - ing .

		Mr.
Grant	PERSON	's powers of invention are consid - erable , and his themes are therefore less hackneyed than with most writers .

		Humor and pathos alter - nately appeal to our attention , the one never bois - terous , the other carefully subdued .

		The stories are of the approved '' magazine '' type , and their col - lection results rather in a magazine than in a book .

		It is greatly to be hoped that the popularity of ''
Chimmie Fadden	PERSON	'' will not result in swamping us with Bowery literature for the next few years , but when we think of the way in which the floodgates of Scotch dialect have been opened upon us by the chroniclers of Thrums and Drumtochty , we realize that almost anything may happen .

		For the present , at all events , without taking overmuch thought for what is to come , we may find a tempered delight in Mr.
Townsend	PERSON	's work , and in that of one of the best of his rivals , Mr.
Julian Ralph	PERSON	, whose '' People We Pass '' is a collection of eight Bowery sketches , written from intimate acquaintance with the scenes and types of that unique slum .

		But a few more books of the sort would make the Bowery a burden .

		Mr.
Ralph	PERSON	's work is excellent journalism , hardly more than that .

		It entertains , touches the senti - ment , and appeals to the sense of humor ; which means that it attains a certain degree of success .

		In '' A Mad
Madonna	ORGANIZATION	and Other Stories '' Mr.
Whitelock	PERSON	developes an idea which , although not exactly new , is sufficiently unhackneyed to be worthy of treatment .

		The notion is that of a picture or statue coming to life , the myth of
Galatea	LOCATION	, in short .

		It is the central theme of two out of the six stories , and one or two of the others play about the fancy .

		Unfortunately , the author does not possess the im - agination necessary to deal successfully with mate - rial so elusive , his treatment being rather common - place and unimpressive .

		He fails to get the right atmosphere , and atmosphere is everything in such dealings with the supernatural .

		The title-story is the best of the half-dozen .

		Six mites of stories , mostly uncanny in subject - matter , make up Mrs.
Wynne	PERSON	's pretty volume , of which we must make some such criticism as was given to Mr.
Whitelock	PERSON	's collection .

		The imagin - ative atmosphere is lacking , and without it a ghost - story is naught .

		The tale of '' The Little Room , '' together with the sequel thereto , fails to stimulate more than a languid curiosity , it is all so obviously impossible .

		The mystery is mechanically contrived , with but the faintest suggestion of a psychological explanation .

		We are far from asserting that mys - teries should always be cleared up , but the fancy should be given some clue upon which to work , else are we merely baffled at the end , to say nothing of being irritated by mere invention without verisimilitude .

		There are but three stories in
Miss Murfree	LOCATION	's volume , and they take us as usual to the
Tennessee	LOCATION	mountains .

		While there is something of novelty about the incidents with which they are concerned , the stories impress one , on the whole , as very famil - iar .

		The scenery , the types of character , and the motives , are those which the writer has employed many times before , as well as the style , which has all of the old almost magical quality .

		We think so well of this style that we are all the more pained by the false note occasionally sounded . ''

		The blue ribbon decorated cattle and horses were bred within ten miles of the flaunting flag on the judges ' stand , and the foaming mountain-torrents and the placid stream in the valley beheld no cerulean hues save those of the sky which they reflected . ''

		There is such a thing as going too far in search of synonyms , and repetitions are not to be avoided at any cost .

		Mrs.
Foote	PERSON	's new volume contains four stories , all upon Western themes , and all displaying the felic - ity of constructive design and the effective reserve of language that we have come to expect from this strong writer as a matter of course .

		Mrs.
Foote	PERSON	has a way of getting inside her characters , of think - ing with them from their own points of view , that is really remarkable , and that sets her work upon a high plane . ''

		The Cup of Trembling '' seems to us rather the best of these four admirable stories , and outlines a tragic situation not easily to be shaken from the memory .

		There is a distinction of style in
Miss Guiney	LOCATION	's four stories that goes far to make up for the ama - teurish art by which they are otherwise character - ized , which the writer , indeed , frankly admits when she says that '' they stand for apprentice-work in fiction , and are my only attempts of that kind . ''

		One of them is based upon an incident so similar to the story of little Father Time in Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's latest novel that
Miss Guiney	LOCATION	feels it necessary to state that the incident was got by her from a news - paper some years ago , and worked into its present shape before the serial publication of '' Heart 's In - surgent . ''

		The first of the four stories , '' Lovers ' Saint Ruth 's , '' for which the author seems to care the least , appears to us the most charming of them all .

		It is a sad sweet chronicle of seventeenth cen - tury
England	LOCATION	, deeply felt , and infused with some measure of the historical imagination .

		This book is artistically made , and very attractive externally .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's work is familiar to * & readers of current literary criti - cism .

		It is characterized by good sense and good temper ; it exhibits wide reading and a retentive memory ; its judgments are worded in a style that is often pretentious and affected but rarely obscure ; it carries the reaction against ped - antry so far as to care little for minor inaccuracy of statement ; it makes pleasant and stimulating reading .

		It is not great criticism because it plays about the surface of the subject discussed instead of divulging the inner significance , because it lacks the quality of inevitableness except where the most
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 175 obvious things are concerned .

		But it conceals its lack of the deeper qualities of criticism beneath a brilliant display of '' points , '' often acutely made , the product of a marked intellectual agility .

		The second series of Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's '' Essays in En - glish Literature , 1780-1860 '' -LRB- Imported by
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- abundantly illustrates the characteristics above enumerated .

		The subjects of these essays include
Southey	LOCATION	,
Cobbett	PERSON	,
Landor	ORGANIZATION	,
Hood	LOCATION	,
Miss Ferrier	PERSON	, and
Madame D' Arblay	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are also essays on '' Three Humorists , '' '' Some Great Biographies , '' '' The His - torical Novel , '' and '' Twenty Years of Political Satire . ''

		The author disports himself nimbly in these diverse fields of investigation , and is always entertaining .

		But why does he persist in writing such English as this ? ''

		For who can praise enough , or read enough , or enjoy enough , those forty-eight volumes of such a reader 's paradise as nowhere else exists ?

		The very abundance and relish of their pure delightsomeness has obscured in them qualities which would have made a score of reputations . ''

		These sentiments are admirable , for
Scott	PERSON	is their subject , but we can not say much for the form in which they are expressed .

		The other book by Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	to which we now have to call attention is '' A History of Nineteenth Century Literature , 1780-1895 '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This is the fourth vol - ume of the series projected some years ago , to cover the whole field of English literature .

		Mr.
Saints	PERSON	- bury has already dealt with the Elizabethan period in a volume of this series , while Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	has treated of the period intermediate between the Eliz - abethans and our own time .

		The first volume of the work remains to be written .

		The Rev. Stop - ford
Brooke	PERSON	was to have done it , but has been pre - vented by illness .

		Meanwhile , his '' History of Early English Literature '' covers half the period of the unwritten first volume , although its scale is much larger than that upon which the volumes by Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	and Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	are prepared .

		In discussing the literature of the nineteenth century , Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	has excluded all authors now living , with the one exception of Mr.
Buskin	PERSON	.

		The task of summarizing the literary product of
England	LOCATION	dur - ing the past hundred years was no trifling one , and has meant an enormous amount of reading on the part of the author .

		He has been called upon to express critical judgments by the hundreds , if not by the thousands , a fact to be borne in mind be - fore one says overharsh things about the airy parade of omniscience so characteristic of the work .

		It is a little startling , no doubt , to be told that
Moliere	PERSON	was no poet at all , that
Coleridge	PERSON	's ''
Wallenstein	PERSON	'' is better than the original , and that the letters of
Shelley	LOCATION	,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, and
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	are of distinctly lower rank than those of Gray ,
Walpole	LOCATION	,
Cowper	PERSON	, and
Byron	PERSON	.

		But we expect startling dicta now and then from Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	, and need not take them very seriously .

		On the whole , we are thankful for this extremely readable history of our nineteenth century literature , and predict for it a marked pop - ular success .

		We have often spoken of the school '' reader '' as an evil because of the scrappy nature of its contents , and because its use frequently means tiresome repeti - tions and the exclusion of children from the wid - est possible range in their reading .

		But we have never denied that the '' reader '' may have its value , or that the preparation of '' readers '' is an educa - tional task well worth undertaking .

		The difficulty is that few persons who have sought to compile such volumes of selections have possessed the requisite taste and knowledge of literature ; that most of them have disregarded the fundamental principle which declares that nothing should be admitted which is not marked by distinct literary value .

		We have recently received what may fairly be called an ideal set of '' readers , '' the '' Heart of Oak '' books , in six numbers , prepared by Professor
Charles Eliot	PERSON	Nor - ton , and published by
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Beginning with a volume of nursery jingles and Mother Goose melodies , continuing with classical fairy-tales , hero-stories , and poetry that is simple yet noble , ending with such authors as Mr.
Buskin	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and Ten - nyson , these books , from first to last , contain noth - ing but good literature .

		We may even say more than that .

		Coming upon each successive selection , we say not merely : '' This is a good thing for chil - dren to read , and deserves a place in the volume , '' but rather we say : '' What a singularly happy thought it was to include this particular piece . ''

		When we have said this a hundred times or so we begin to realize something of the toil and good taste that have gone to the making of this series .

		Two other features of the editing deserve to be noticed .

		One of them is that the selections are often very long ; in volume three , for example , we have Lamb 's '' Adventures of Ulysses '' entire .

		The other is the frequent grouping of pieces relating to a given sub - ject .

		We find in one place , for example , the fol - lowing selections : a prose passage on '' The Bird '' from Mr.
Buskin	PERSON	,
Frere	PERSON	's translation of the great chorus from
Aristophanes	LOCATION	,
Arnold	LOCATION	's `` Poor Mat - thias , ''
Milton	PERSON	's sonnet to a nightingale and the ode of
Keats	PERSON	, Arnold 's '' Philomela , ''
Wordsworth	PERSON	's and
Shelley	PERSON	's To a Skylark , '' and
Wordsworth	PERSON	's To the Cuckoo . ''

		Such groups as this occur in many places , each selection in a group not only making its own impression , but also deepening the impres - sion made by the others .

		We should also give a few words of praise to the notes at the close of each volume , and to the accuracy of the texts printed .

		And besides saying all these things , we must find space for a quotation or two from Professor Nor - ton 's preface . ''

		Poetry is one of the most efficient means of education of the moral sentiment , as well as of the intelligence .

		It is the source of the best culture .

		A man may know all science and yet re - main uneducated .

		But let him truly possess him - self of the work of any one of the great poets , and no matter what else he may fail to know , he is not without education . '' ''

		The youth who shall become 176 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, acquainted with the contents of these volumes will share in the common stock of the intellectual life of the race to which he belongs ; and will have the door opened to him of all the vast and noble re - sources of that life . ''

		The greatest dramas of the world King
Arthur	PERSON	.

		have a11 been sha P ed from tales ' legends , or myths , already in some degree known to those who heard or read .

		In fact , it is perhaps one of the conditions of great dramatic art that it should be free from the requirement of ordinary curiosity as to the end and upshot of the matter , which is rather a mark of modern literature than a universal necessity .

		The great poet worked with material not unfamiliar to his audience , and so could count upon an appreciation of his art and an interest in his own creation made possible by famil - iarity with the traditional guise of the subject mat - ter which gave him opportunity .

		Such is also the case with Mr.
J. Comyns Carr	PERSON	's play , '' King Ar - thur '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , but in almost inverted wise .

		For while
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	took what they would from common tradition or the work of lesser men before them , this play is founded on material which has been fashioned into shape , into a form that for most of us is final , by one of the great poets of the century .

		It would be hard if all the associa - tions which attach themselves to the names even of
Lancelot	LOCATION	,
Guinevere	LOCATION	,
Elaine	PERSON	, to the mere mention of the
Round Table	ORGANIZATION	and the Holy Grail , if all these feelings would not carry us on with interest to the end ; and so they do .

		But the play has not a strong character of its own .

		Mr.
Carr	PERSON	, while blending a number of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's motives into a dramatic whole , has here and there gone back to
Malory	LOCATION	, and here and there in the good old custom has trusted to himself .

		His play doubtless gives an excellent opportunity to Irving in more ways than one .

		But the great tradition and the well-known figures stand unchanged , and except for now and then a striking phrase , literature is never the richer .

		The old story has no more for us than it had a year ago : perhaps it was all that could have been asked , that it should mean no less .


Charles Frangois Gounod	PERSON	's `` Me - irs of an Artist '' -LRB-
Rand	ORGANIZATION	, Me -
Nally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is a readable little book , eminently wholesome and stimulating in tone , which narrates briefly and unaffectedly the events bearing upon the writer 's artistic career and devel - opment , from early childhood down to the period of the production of '' Faust '' at which point the recital unaccountably breaks off .

		M.
Gounod	ORGANIZATION	's pages are strewn with memories of his more or less distinguished friends and preceptors ,
M. Reicha	PERSON	,
Cherubini	LOCATION	, Ingres the painter ,
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	, and
Madam Henzel	PERSON	, etc. .

		Ingres he met at
Rome	LOCATION	, whither he -LRB- M. Gounod -RRB- was sent in
1834	DATE	, after winning at the
Paris	LOCATION	Conservatory the grand prix de Home .

		He paints an engaging portrait of this artist , then director of the
Academy of France	ORGANIZATION	, at
Rome	LOCATION	, and tells a pretty story illustrative of his devotion to artistic truth .

		M. Ingres was then at work on his fine '' Vierge a 1 ` Hostie , '' destined for the Demidoff collection ; and
M. Gounod	PERSON	states that in the origi - nal composition the foreground was not occupied , as now , by the mystic ciborium , but by an exquisite figure of the infant Jesus lying asleep , his head rest - ing upon a cushion , one tassel of which he seemed to be playing with .

		M. Ingres , he continues , seemed well satisfied , and when the waning light obliged him to suspend work , he was delighted with the day 's performance .

		But , adds
M. Gounod	PERSON	, '' in the afternoon of the next day I ascended again to his studio .

		No more infant Jesus !

		The figure had disappeared , scraped off entirely with a palette - knife , not a trace of it remaining . '

		Ah !

		M. Ingres ! '

		cried I , in consternation .

		And he , with a triumph - ant air , replied : ' Man Dieu , yes ! '

		And then again , with stronger emphasis , ' Yes ! '

		The splendor of the divine symbol had just appeared to him superior to the radiant human reality , and , therefore , more worthy of the homage of the Virgin adoring her Son . ''

		It is interesting to note that
M. Gounod	PERSON	's favorite employment at
Rome	LOCATION	was the reading of Goethe 's '' Faust '' ; and that his first idea of the
Walpurgis Night	ORGANIZATION	, of the opera composed seventeen years later , came to him during a nocturnal excur - sion to Capri .

		Aside from its purely narrative ele - ment , the memoir contains some valuable comment and criticism ; and it deserves to be read and pon - dered by students of music .

		But the best of the book , to our notion , is the impression it leaves of the author 's singularly pure and genuine character .

		The translation is acceptably done by Miss
Annette E. Crocker	PERSON	, and the publishers have displayed due taste as to externals , the emblematic cover being espe - cially well done .

		The future ^ - verv readable and suggestive little American book , albeit rather more abstractive literary type .

		m j. one t nan jfg title seems to imply , is '' Types of American Character '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
Gamaliel Bradford	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Of the seven essays contained in the volume , three , '' The American Pes - simist , '' '' The American Idealist , '' and '' The
Ameri	PERSON	- can Out of Doors , '' have already appeared in the `` At - lantic Monthly '' ; while the others , '' The American Epicurean , '' `` The American Philanthropist , '' `` The American Man of Letters , '' and '' The Scholar , '' are now printed for the first time .

		Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	's book is fresh , thoughtful , and stimulating , and its style is indicative throughout of the excellent literary company its author has kept .

		Among the many interesting questions touched upon is the moot one : What will be the first really great original literary development of this country ?

		The still lacking , though not impossible one , who is to shape the course of our impending distinctively national literature , and be its herald and morning star , will prove to be not the novelist , not the dramatist , not even the threatened far - Western bard , fresh from the
1896	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL 177 ploughtails , free as the unyoked steer , and redolent of the virgin soil of his own billowy prairies but , Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	thinks , the humorist , some '' true son of Aristophanes and Rabelais and
Cervantes	PERSON	, who will prick the bubble of our vast self-satisfaction , without bitterness , without harshness , with none of the cynical satire of the French pessimistic school . ''

		His first principle will be laughter , but his second will be love ; he will ridicule many things ; he will tread on a great many people 's toes ; but he will do it all with such a charming grace , and with so plainly benevolent an intent , that his victims will smile at their own smarts .

		He will love those whom he chastens as the true humorist must ; and , says Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	, '' I should advise him to inscribe on his title-page these charming verses , which I borrow from
M. Anatole France	PERSON	, who has himself borrowed them from I know not where , ' Les petites marionettes Font , font , font , Trois petits tours Et puis s ` en vont . ' ''

		Let us admit that our coming
Cervantes	PERSON	will find no lack of butts for his shafts .

		A wen-edited
The University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	inaugu - edition of an rates a new series of monographs , to old poem .

		be k nown as English Studies , '' with the publication of an edition of
Lydgate	PERSON	's `` The Assembly of Gods . ''

		Dr.
Oscar Lovell Triggs	PERSON	is the editor of this text , and the work was offered to the
University	ORGANIZATION	in support of his candidacy for the doctor 's degree .

		It will also be published in Lon - don , in the series of the
Early English Text Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		In his introductory chapters , the editor describes the manuscripts and the prints of the work , and dis - cusses the questions of title , date and authorship , metre , rhyme , and language .

		Then follows a lit - erary analysis of the poem , and a series of special '' literary studies '' of its more salient features .

		The text follows , in 61 pages and
2107	DATE	numbered lines .

		Some thirty pages of notes , a catalogue of persons , a glossary , and a collection of '' special phrases and proverbs '' complete the apparatus of this remarka - bly well-edited book .

		The poem itself is not ex - actly readable , but Dr.
Triggs	PERSON	has done his best to make it so .

		His treatment has a marked literary character , very noticeable in the special studies and the notes , which sets it in refreshing contrast to most studies in
Middle	LOCATION	or Old English literature .

		He brings a wide range of reading to bear upon his work at every point , and his collection of parallel - isms is extremely interesting .

		Altogether , his work is distinctly creditable to English scholarship , and justifies the great quantity of labor that must have been expended upon it .

		Jusserand .

		American readers , and his new vol - ume , '' English Essays from a French Pen '' -LRB- Putnams -RRB- , will not diminish his reputation .

		It is not an especially noteworthy book by reason of its subject-matter , for it gathers together five essays which have no particular importance and no very definite connection .

		But each subject the author has handled in an entertaining way , so that one reads everything with pleasure ; indeed , he seems to possess to a great degree the art of telling a story .

		So , although three of his essays are of that very un - promising kind , running summaries of the con - tents of books , yet all have something at least of the power of attracting the attention and of holding the interest .

		Two of the essays are rather slight , one an account of the dangers besetting the life of a nun in the twelfth century , and the other a note on
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's visit to
England	LOCATION	, both drawn from some - what recondite sources .

		The more extended pieces of work are accounts of
Girard	ORGANIZATION	's journey to
Scot	PERSON	- land in
1435	DATE	, and of Sorbiere 's journey to
England	LOCATION	in
1663	DATE	, and a very entertaining study of the life and work of Scarron .

		These have been published before ; the first two in the '' Nineteenth Century , '' the last as introduction to a translation of Scarron 's '' Roman Comique . ''

		There is more body to these three than to the two shorter ones , which come as curtain-raiser and after-piece .

		But all five will be found good reading -LRB- a Frenchman is almost always amusing -RRB- and full of curious information , so that there is not much more to ask of them .

		The book has several good illustrations , some from sources contemporary with the topics , some otherwise ap - propriate .

		Persons and '' Colonial Dames and Good Wives '' pictures of -LRB-

		guesg > ft new book by th & t i ndefat i g .

		able student of early American manners , Mrs.
Alice Morse Earle	PERSON	.

		To those familiar with the author 's work , and most of us are , the drift of the vol - ume is sufficiently indicated by such chapter head - ings as '' Consorts and Relicts , '' `` Women of Affairs , '' `` The Colonial Adventuresses , '' `` Their Amuse - ments and Accomplishments , '' '' Daughters of Lib - erty , '' '' Fireside Industries , '' etc. .

		Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	writes in her usual pleasant vein , interlarding her work with copious extracts from old-time records , and lighting up with her sedate humor a subject in itself not an especially engaging or stimulating one .

		Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	has a light touch and a sense of style ; and her friends would perhaps be glad should she allow her pen to range afield occasionally , and to stray from a theme wherein her manner tends to stereotype itself .

		A charming tribute to
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		It is a little late to call attention to the study of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	by
A. B.	PERSON	, with a prelude and a post - lude by
L. I. G.	PERSON	, that was privately printed by
Messrs. Copeland & Day	ORGANIZATION	some months ago , but the booklet should not pass unmentioned .

		The initials of the writers are so transparent that we do not feel that we are violating the ethics of criticism in speak - ing of Miss
Brown	PERSON	and
Miss Guiney	PERSON	as the authors of this charming tribute to a beloved memory .

		Miss
Guiney	PERSON	's part of the work is in verse , a little labored , 178 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, but full of fine feeling ;
Miss Brown	PERSON	's essay is a graceful criticism in part a mosaic of anecdote and citation of the life and work of
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		The note of enthusiasm is pitched in a higher key than the temperate judgment of a later day will , in our opinion , allow , and we can not admit that it was ever '' a commonplace of criticism to name him the greatest living master of English style , sharing the unvexed throne with
Ruskin	PERSON	only . ''

		But he was a noble writer and a beautiful soul , deserving , in both aspects , of most good things that his friends may find it in .

		their hearts to write .

		The curious thing about Miss
Brown	PERSON	's essay is that the writer 's hand has become so subdued to what it works in that
Stevenson	PERSON	's own prose style is in many a passage unconsciously reproduced .

		Over and over again , we come upon paragraphs that might have been written by the subject of the appreciation , so felici - tous is the phrase and so Stevensonian the choice of epithet .

		Those who are fortunate enough to get possession of this little volume wiH be sure to treas - ure it highly . ''

		Longmans 's Gazetteer of the w rld ' '' edited b y Mr - Geor s e c -
Chisholm	LOCATION	, is one of those monument - al works of reference that characterize the latter - day enterprises of the publishing craft , and command admiration for the solidity of their performance .

		The book is a quarto of about eighteen hundred double-columned pages , with subjects in heavy-faced type , and descriptions so condensed as to require only a minimum of space .

		Our own ''
Lippincott	PERSON	's Gazetteer , '' with its three thousand odd pages , is much the bigger book of the two , although mechan - ically not quite so well proportioned .

		In the '' Long - mans , '' of course , British names get relatively more attention than in the ''
Lippincott	PERSON	, '' and possibly for that reason some persons will have to keep both works upon their shelves .

		The larger articles in the present work have been written by specialists , and are initialed .

		The general rule of orthography for foreign names is to employ the native spelling of languages which use roman characters ; for exam - ple , Trondhjem is not given as Drontheim .

		Reason - able precautions seem to have been taken to secure accurate up-to-date information , and the coopera - tion of a host of special correspondents all over the world has given a singular degree of reliability to the contents of this noteworthy volume .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Volume III .

		of `` The Life and Correspondence of
Rufus King	PERSON	, '' edited by his grandson , Dr.
Charles R. King	PERSON	, has just appeared from the press of Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		It covers the years 1799-1801 , and '' takes up the correspondence at the point of time when President
Adams	PERSON	had proposed to send a new embassy to
France	LOCATION	to take advantage of what appeared to him an opportunity to settle the questions which had caused the breaking off the amicable relations with
France	LOCATION	and the annulling of the treaty with that country . ''

		This subject and the disputed election of
1800	DATE	mainly oc - cupy the new volume , which is a rich mine of materials for the future historian .

		Renan 's '' Life of Jesus '' has been reissued by Messrs.
Roberts Brothers	PERSON	in a '' translation newly revised from the twenty-third and final edition . ''

		Mr.
Joseph Henry Allen	PERSON	, who appears to be responsible for the present -LRB- and presumably definitive -RRB- form of the English text , tells us , in a preface , that '' the two best known English translations have been freely used , while nearly every sentence has been recast , and the whole has been scru - pulously weighed , phrase by phrase , with the original . ''

		An examination of the text , as far as we have made it , bears out this claim of careful workmanship , and it is not likely that Renan 's beautiful French will ever get a more nearly satisfactory English reproduction than this .

		The
Field Columbian Museum	ORGANIZATION	has already entered the publishing field with a number of scientific mono - graphs of much value .

		Series of publications in history , geology , botany , and zoology , have been started , and now a new series has been added with anthropology for its general subject .

		The first volume in this series is a work upon the '' Monuments of Yucatan , '' by Mr.
Will	PERSON	- iam
H. Holmes	PERSON	.

		The author , who is Curator of the De - partment of Anthropology in the Museum , was one of a party of scientific men who spent three months of last year in
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		The present work is a report , illus - trated with numerous plates , of the author 's investiga - tion of the Yucatan remains , and makes a valuable con - tribution to American archaeological science .

		There is no question that
Marie Corelli	PERSON	is one of the strongest writers now living .

		She is endowed with a wonderfully clear and vigorous imagination , the prime qualification for a novelist , and yet , strangely enough , one in which so many novelists of the present day are sadly deficient .

		This of itself gives her stories a sweep and power seldom attained , and although she does write with a purpose , it is never obtruded upon the reader .

		Her '' Barabbas '' made a most profound sensation , and it is unquestionably one of the strongest , most graphic , and most vivid books of this decade .

		Her '' Sorrows of Satan '' is another romance of thrilling , almost startling , power .

		In this new novel she has chosen a subject of remarkable interest , and has treated it in a most individual and stimulating way .

		There is a flavor of
Dumas	PERSON	's Musketeers in the life of the redoubtable
Brigadier Gerard	PERSON	, a typical Napoleonic soldier , more fortunate than many of his compeers because some of his Homeric exploits were accomplished under the personal obser - vation of the Emperor .

		His delightfully romantic career in - cluded an oddly characteristic glimpse of
England	LOCATION	, and his adventures ranged from the battle-field to secret service .

		In picturing the experiences of his fearless , hard-fighting , and hard-drinking hero , the author of `` The White Company '' has given us a book which absorbs the interest and quickens the pulse of every reader .

		The popularity of these stories when they were published serially , each one securely protected by copyright , insures the success of this book .

		216 THE ARNOLD AFTERMATH .

		The Book par excellence of the year
1895	DATE	was the one that gave to the world the familiar letters of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		Addressed , for the most part , to the members of his own house - hold group , these letters were yet seen to have so varied a bearing , to touch with delicate sure hand upon so many of the subjects more for - mally discussed in his books , to throw side - lights so suggestive upon the distinguished in - tellectual personality of their writer , that they were promptly hailed as being far more than a charming contribution to epistolary literature , as outstretching once more a hand previously found helpful to men and women wandering amid the perplexities of the selva oscura of modern thought .

		Since their publication , they have called forth tributes of affectionate ap - preciation from some of the keenest critics and finest spirits of our time , and in all the chorus of grateful praise there have been but few discordant notes .

		One of the most gener - ous and eloquent estimates of
Arnold	LOCATION	's work in its totality is that just contributed to '' The Nineteenth Century '' by Mr.
Frederic Harri	PERSON	- son , an estimate not made with particular ref - erence to the '' Letters , '' yet doubtless prompted by their publication , and by the feeling that it is time to make at least a tentative effort to de - termine the position of their writer in the liter - ature which he adorned for so many years .

		In our epoch , opinion concerning the dead crystal - lizes more rapidly than it used to , and the judg - ment of posterity may be anticipated with some - thing more of confidence than formerly .

		Recurring for a moment to the '' Letters '' themselves , it may be said that they have done much to fix for us a personality more gracious than was at all times reflected from the '' Works . ''

		We see more clearly than before the simple and lovable core of the man 's char - acter ; we see that the heart was unaffected if the intellect sometimes found expression in mannerisms ; we see how mythical is the notion that anything like superciliousness was charac - teristic of his attitude toward his fellows ; we see how unreservedly his life was given to the service of mankind , how little he thought of himself and how much he thought of his ideals .

		This kindly lover of beasts and birds and flow - 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, ers , this affectionate son and tender father , this gentle critic who dealt so urbanely with every form of rhetorical and political and ethical humbug , this whole image of the man himself as he appears in his letters , is as unlike as pos - sible to the counterfeit presentment which the newspapers so sedulously sought to impose upon their readers as genuine portraiture .

		One thing , in particular , was never clearly understood before the appearance of the '' Let - ters . ''

		The public knew
Arnold	PERSON	as the brilliant essayist and exquisite poet , as the apostle of culture and the ardent advocate of the things of the spirit ; it knew him hardly at all as the hard-working inspector of schools .

		It knew that , like
Milton	PERSON	's , his '' soul was like a star and dwelt apart '' ; it did not realize that also , for all this spiritual isolation , his heart '' the lowliest duties on herself did lay . ''

		When we read of the years of incessant drudgery conse - quent upon his inspectorship , of his visits to countless schools and his marking of countless examination papers , it does seem as if
England	LOCATION	might have found a worthier use for the talents of so exceptional a man .

		But we quickly re - flect , on the other hand , that it is precisely such thankless work as this that calls most im - peratively for the finest qualities of mind and heart , that the supreme test of social usefulness is met only by those who are content to do the work that lies at hand , the work that escapes careless observation , yet endures because of the single-hearted faithfulness of its performance .

		The world is slowly coming to recognize how important were
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's contributions to polit - ical and religious discussion , although many writers are still found to carp at his methods and results .

		Even Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	, who does ample justice to the literary critic and the poet , can not refrain from bringing against Arnold the old charge of dilettantism in these other matters , from pretending that he was without a '' scheme of dominant ideas . ''

		We refuse to believe that Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	has been so imposed upon by
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's playfulness of manner as really to think that the great critic was only taking a few random shots when he entered the field of political and religious controversy .

		Be - cause Arnold refused to talk about theology and politics in a dull pedantic fashion , and thereby defeat his main object , he must , for - sooth , be treated with condescension by men whose influence upon thought in these very do - mains has been far inferior to his own .

		The implication is an amusing one .

		As for Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's attempt to prove Arnold an uncon - scious Comtist , it is provocative of something broader than the mere smile of amusement .

		On the other hand , Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	does ample justice to Arnold the poet and critic , voicing what we can not but believe will prove substan - tially the estimate of the future .

		Arnold 's poetry , we are told , '' is almost certain to gain a wider audience , and to grow in popularity and influence . ''

		These are just words of the poet , and equally just is Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's ac - count of the critic .

		`` Not that
Arnold	LOCATION	was invariably right , or that all his judgments are unassailable .

		His canons were always right ; but it is not in mortals to apply them unerringly to men and to things .

		... I accept his decis - ions in the main for all English poetry , and on general questions of style ... Arnold 's piece on ' The Study of Poetry ' ... should be pre - served in our literature as the norma or canon of right opinion about poetry , as we preserve the standard coins in the Pyx , or the standard yard in the old Jewel-house at Westminster . ''

		This is not saying too much , if it be understood that allowance is made for the errors of the personal equation .

		A few of these errors crept into
Arnold	LOCATION	's books , and a number of others are to be detected in his letters .

		As Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	aptly remarks of the latter , '' a great critic , like the Pope , is infallible only when he is speak - ing ex cathedra , on matters of faith . ''

		American feeling for Arnold has always been affected by the sense that he was not alto - gether just to our civilization .

		He seemed to detect our faults more readily than our virtues .

		It is true that his attitude became noticeably modified after he had seen
America	LOCATION	with his own eyes , but his earlier utterances had excited a hostility that was not so easily to be allayed .

		There is some slight justification for the resent - ment that Americans have felt for his attitude , although there is none for the manner in which they have given expression to the failing .

		The publication of the '' Letters , '' also , was some - thing of an indiscretion as far as the American section of the correspondence is concerned .

		The editor was not as careful in expunging allusions that might prove irritating to Amer - icans as he was in the case of allusions to liv - ing Englishmen .

		The instances are trivial enough , yet Arnold himself would never in the world have permitted some of these things to get into print .

		As for his general estimate of American civilization , we are minded to repro - duce a significant passage from a letter dated
1877	DATE	. ''

		That wonderful creature , the British Philistine , has been splashing about during this

		That is what is peculiar to
England	LOCATION	and what misleads foreigners ; there is no country in the world where so much nonsense becomes so pub - lic , and so appears to stand for the general voice of the nation , determining the government . ''

		Unfortunately for us , the situation here de - scribed is not peculiar to
England	LOCATION	, for it is even more characteristic of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		What a pity that
Arnold	PERSON	did not recognize this fact , and keep it constantly in mind when he set out to discuss American civilization !

		Had he done so , many heart-burnings would have been spared , and the few vulnerable points in his critical armor would have been one the less .

		AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN SECOND - ARY SCHOOLS COMPARED * The recent report made by the
Committee on Composition	ORGANIZATION	and Rhetoric to the
Board	ORGANIZATION	of Over - seers of
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	, and the comments that it has called out in the press , have again directed the public attention to the comparative merits of sec - ondary education in the
United States	LOCATION	and in the leading countries of
Western Europe	LOCATION	.

		There ap - pears to be no doubt that the average American student , at the age of nineteen , brought up in the secondary schools , is behind the English or
Conti	PERSON	- nental student of the same age in ability to compose in his mother tongue and in ability to perform other scholastic work .

		Professor
Goodwin	PERSON	says that boys of that age who come to
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	in most cases '' are barely prepared to pass an examination which boys of sixteen or seventeen would find easy work in
England	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, or
Switzer	PERSON	- land . ''

		He says , further , that at `` Westminster School ,
London	LOCATION	, boys of from fifteen to eighteen are studying Homer , JEschylus ,

		Much of this work is not required for admission to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	, but it counts for honors .

		The Professor says further : '' There is no hope of a substantial change for the better until the elementary studies which now occupy the time from fifteen to nineteen are put back where they belong , so that young men can devote them - selves in earnest to studies which belong to their age . ''

		From this point of view , therefore , the ques - tion , Why is the English teaching in our secondary * Report of the

		schools bad ?

		is expanded into the broader one , Why is our secondary education as a whole bad ?

		This question has been much discussed the last few years , and in the course of the discussion it has been discovered that , in large part , the trouble lies below the secondary-school level .

		The Har -
vard Committee	ORGANIZATION	and Professor
Goodwin	PERSON	tend to ex - cuse the secondary teachers from blame for the bad preparation of students for college .

		The trouble , they say , is with the '' system . ''

		This is extending the investigation to the elementary schools , which leads to the remark that the shortening and enrich - ening of the elementary course has been a favorite topic at educational meetings and in educational journals for some time past .

		I shall set down very briefly what appear to me to be the principal reasons why the American boy of nineteen , consid - ered as a scholar , is two years in the rear of the German , French , or English boy of the same age .

		1 .

		The courses of study that lead French and German boys to the university have been brought to a high degree of perfection .

		The studies have been so selected and so coordinated that time is saved all along the line .

		For example , in the German gym - nasium Latin begins at ten and Greek at twelve , while modern languages are brought in at an early stage , thus assisting materially the mastery of Ger - man .

		The gymnasium is not a finishing school , but every step from the first one is bent toward the uni - versity .

		Practically the same may be said of the French and English schools .

		In the
United States	LOCATION	, on the other hand , secondary courses of study have not been as well thought out and tested .

		Moreover , the double function of many of our schools , and par - ticularly of high schools , has impaired their effi - ciency in both spheres .

		Reference is made , of course , to the fact that these schools are at the same time finishing schools for life and fitting schools for college .

		To be sure , the courses of study intended for the two purposes more or less vary .

		Whether this impairment of the American school is inherent in the system or is due to defective coordination , need not be considered here .

		The facts may be put in another way .

		In Eu - ropean countries schools are based on the existing social organization .

		The aim is to provide educa - tion for those youths who will pass out of school at thirteen or fourteen years of age , for those who will pass out of it at eighteen or nineteen , and for those who are destined for the higher institutions of in - struction .

		These pupils are not all taught together as far as the first class go , and the remainder are not all taught together as far as the second class go , but to a great extent are separate almost from the time that they go to school , and are taught with refer - ence to their supposed destination .

		All kinds of pupils may be taught together for the first three years , but this is not necessarily , or indeed com - monly , the case .

		This is what may be called the '' three-pyramid plan '' of organizing schools . ''

		The three courses of instruction , '' says Dr.
Fitch	PERSON	, '' pri - mary , secondary , and higher , may be compared to 196 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, three pyramids of different sizes , though all in their way symmetrical and perfect ; but you can not take the apex of the larger pyramid and set it on the top of the smaller .

		You may indeed fit on , with a certain practical convenience , the top of the higher scheme of education to the truncated system of the lower , provided you go low enough , '' etc. .

		Our State school systems are organized on the one-pyramid plan .

		The comparative merits of the two plans for general purposes is a topic aside from the present purpose .

		But the three-pyramid plan has two ob - vious advantages .

		One is that courses of instruc - tion can be made out with sole reference to com - pleteness in themselves , and the other that the abler pupils , who are the ones destined for college as a rule , are put by themselves , and so can move , even in elementary studies , at their own natural rate of speed .

		How far our social conditions would justify an attempt to reorganize our schools on this plan , and how far studies that are now taught exclusively in the secondary schools can be brought down into the elementary grades , are very interesting ques - tions .

		For one , I look with confidence to the expe - riments now being made in the second direction .

		2 .

		The teachers in the foreign schools , as a class , are superior to ours .

		They are better prepared to do their work , and they do it better .

		This prepara - tion includes better scholarship , more distinct ideals , and superior teaching ability .

		These teachers know just what is expected of them , and know they will be held responsible for the result .

		It is needless almost to refer to the fact that , as an average , they pursue their work for a much longer period of time than our teachers .

		3 .

		National tone is a not unimportant factor in the question .

		The industrial , commercial , and po - litical tension of American society is the highest known in the world .

		In this respect we are keyed up to the highest note .

		But in science , philosophy , and literature that is , in the intellectual sphere proper our tension is distinctly lower than that of
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, or
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The average intelligence may be as high in this country , or even higher , but our higher culture , so called , is of a lower grade .

		The high intellectual tension of the educated class abroad is felt in the schools .

		There now lies before me a description of a German gym - nasium written by a student of my acquaintance who passed through it , and I doubt whether there is a city in the
United States	LOCATION	where a school with such a regimen could be maintained .

		What has been said about general culture is par - ticularly applicable to the language-arts , speech , reading , and composition , which are a very delicate test of personal cultivation ; and I do not hesitate to avow the opinion that the relatively low standard of culture prevailing in the country , including teach - ers as well as pupils , is in large measure the cause of the low state of these arts in the schools .

		There is perhaps reason to think that the average cultiva - tion of college students , including English , is lower than it was fifty years ago .

		Were not college stu - dents a more select body then than they are now ?

		Did they not better represent the highest cultivation of the country ?

		Have not the great increase of wealth , the enormous material improvements that have been effected , and the growth of population , together with the democratizing of society , tended appreciably to make American college students , as a whole , a more heterogeneous class of persons ?

		To my mind there is some reason for answering these questions in the affirmative .

		MR.
LAURENCE IRVINQ	PERSON	'S NEW PLAY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The ethics of the drama is a subject which , in spite of the popularity of the stage from the days of ancient
Greece	LOCATION	down to our own time , has not become trite , for whenever the subject seems to have been worn thread - bare , some new play of more than passing merit brings the question again to the front .

		Such a drama is ''
Godefroi	PERSON	and
Yolande	PERSON	. ''

		The highest function of the drama is to educate to be a moral factor in society .

		A play which is merely serving the ends of art may be very admirable in its way , but it is not rising to the highest privilege of the drama .

		Still , no objection could reasonably be made .

		But when the art of the drama is used to create a wrong moral effect , it is right to protest .

		Nothing is now said as to the morale of the play ; that is not the matter in question .

		The point is , that when the stage holds the mirror up to history , and then does not reflect the facts of history but distorts the truth , it is perverting the legitimate purposes of the drama .

		The only exception can be in case of no moral complication in the event , or when the higher motive is conveyed through a species of moral me - tonymy or symbolism .

		If Mr.
Laurence Irving	PERSON	, who is the author of ''
Godefroi	PERSON	and
Yolande	PERSON	, '' intended the physical affliction of the beautiful courtesan to be sym - bolic of moral leprosy , then , perhaps , objection might be stayed ; but unfortunately such intention if it were intended is out-pointed by other issues of the drama .

		The plot of the play in question , which is laid in mediaeval
France	LOCATION	in the reign of
Philippe	LOCATION	le Bel -LRB-
1285	DATE	-
1314	DATE	-RRB- is briefly this :
Yolande	PERSON	, a beautiful woman of the court , is loved by her secretary ,
Godefroi	PERSON	.

		But in an evil hour she is discovered to be a leper .

		This dis - covery is made by accident and in the presence of the king and his brother , who is an archbishop .

		A scene of consternation ensues .

		The unhappy woman is deserted by all her friends , even by her waiting-women , and is driven forth into the world with the curse of the king and the anathema of the Church upon her .

		Her lover , preferring a living death to life apart from her , follows her to join the unhappy ranks of the '' unclean . ''

		The dramatic in - tensity , the almost obtrusive realism , so impress the be - holder that he is , unless he be upon his guard , likely to be filled with horror for an age so harsh .

		The Middle Ages were narrow , bigoted , intolerant , but this partic - ular form of intolerance can not be charged against them .

		This conception of the attitude of the Middle Ages towards lepers is neither warranted by the facts of gen - eral history , nor by the particular episode upon which ''
Godefroi	PERSON	and Yolande '' is based , and in the interest of truth the play ought not to pass without explanation .

		The immediate source whence the plot is derived is
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 197 an event related in the
Grandes Chroniques de France	LOCATION	for the
year 1505	DATE	as follows : '' En ce temps-la estoyt dans ce pays grand nombre de ladres et de meseaulx , ce dont le roy eut grand desplaisir , veu que Dieu dust en estre moult griefvement courrouce ' .

		Ores il ad - Tint qu 1 une noble damoyselle appele `` e Yolande de Sallieres estant atteincte et touste guaste ^ de ce vilain mal , tous ses amys et ses parens ayant devant leurs yeux la paonr de Dieu la firent issir fors de leurs maisons et oncques ne voulurent recepvoir ni reconf orter chose mauldicte de Dieu et a tous les homines puante et abhominable ...

		* This is a frail foundation upon which to base so elab - orate a movement .

		It might , however , be allowed , if no greater violence to history were done than this .

		But this is not the case , and it is for this reason that a positive wrong is inflicted .

		If '' history is philosophy teaching by example , '' then ought we of to-day to profit by the teaching : because the men of that day were narrow , so ought we to be broad ; because they were in - tolerant , so ought we to be tolerant ; because they were bigoted , so ought we to be catholic .

		`` Godefroi and Yolande '' violates the moral facts of history , and the world can not afford , even in the interests of art , to falsify such truths ; moral ideas are too great and too potent to be translated to a lower plane , and this must needs be so in case of a drama founded upon history , in which the truth is sacrificed to art , for after all , art is artificial , truth is natural , and it is the truth that shall set us free .

		The mediaeval Church , far from anathematizing the leper-class , afforded them protection and support .

		The monasteries and convents were both hospitals and char - itable institutions , where the sick were cared for , or food and clothing distributed to the poor .

		In
France	LOCATION	in the eleventh and twelfth centuries , the number of charitable houses rapidly increased , not alone in the towns , but in the rural districts as well .

		The general movement which determined such foundations was es - sentially a religious one .

		Seigneurs , bishops , bourgeois , founded a house of God or a hospital for the safety of their souls .

		Such houses were generally erected near a church or by the gate of a monastery .

		Others , which en - joyed the role of an inn , were located along the grand routes of travel , by ferries or in mountain passes .

		When leprosy became prevalent in
Western Europe	LOCATION	, owing to the Crusades , special institutions for the accommodation of lepers were provided .

		Neither the Church nor the government was intolerant of them , but on the contrary looked to their comfort and protection more than in the case of other dependent classes .

		Louis le Gros in the twelfth century founded the leper-house of
St. Lazarus	LOCATION	, under the direction of the Bishop of
Paris	LOCATION	, which for centuries afterwards was favored by king and pope .

		The chronicles of the time afford many instances of the interest of kings in the welfare of lepers .


Guillaume de Nangis	PERSON	, the biographer of
St. Louis	LOCATION	, tells of the good king 's visit to a monk of the abbey of
Royaumont	LOCATION	who was a leper ; * Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	has appropriated this episode in `` The Leper , '' but the poet has conformed to the truth of history more than has the playright .

		the monastery of Bee , in
Normandy	LOCATION	, in the time of Anselm , was the retreat of a powerful noble of
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	, who was suffering from leprosy .

		Louis VI .

		made no less than twelve grants of money or of land for the sup - port of leper colonies .

		In
1201	DATE	Philip Augustus legis - lated in favor of the lepers of Meulan and
Corbeil	PERSON	, and instances might be multiplied of kings so doing in En - gland and
Italy	LOCATION	also .

		St.
Francis	PERSON	established two leper hospitals , and their betterment was an avowed object of the Order .

		To wash the feet of lepers , in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	, was considered to be an act of supreme self - humiliation .

		To one acquainted with the character of mediaeval thought this is not strange .

		Everything in that day was looked at from the point of view of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the eyes of the men of that time lepers were pauperes
Christi Christ	ORGANIZATION	's poor , the heirs of the afflic - tion of the
Lazarus	PERSON	of Christ 's parable , whose malady as that of Job also the popular idea confounded with leprosy .

		The extent to which this conception was carried may be appreciated when the reader is made aware that in the mediaeval version ,
Isaiah 53:4	PERSON	, '' We did esteem Him stricken , smitten of God and afflicted , '' is rendered , '' Nos putavimus Eum leprosum , percussum a Deo et humiliatum . ''

		Throughout the
Middle Ages	ORGANIZATION	, we find Church and government cooperating in the interest of lepers .

		As beggers they were a privileged class , recognized by royal writ , while ordinary beggars were proscribed .

		There are instances in which lepers were confounded with the Jews , and persecuted accordingly ; a notable case of this sort was in the reign of
Philip VI.	LOCATION	, but this occurrence was an exception and not the rule .

		Acts against lepers were ordinarily dictated by sanitary con - siderations , and were not the result of popular prejudice .

		Miss
Terry	PERSON	can not afford to sanction with the seal of her art a work which conveys so unjust an impression . ''

		Godefroi and
Yolande	PERSON	'' is based upon a fundamental error , and that a moral misconception .

		The mediaeval Church , for all its imperfections and evil , was quite the grandest institution that the world has ever seen in ideal conception , in breadth of application , in efficiency of administration .

		If it be true , as
Young	PERSON	said , that '' The course of Nature is the art of God , '' then the cultiva - tion of truth should be the practice of men .

		Every crea - tion is the product of a development from the low to the high , from the general to the special , from the plain to the complex .

		The true lesson of the drama , as it is of life , is a lesson of moral evolution .

March 17 , 1896	DATE	, 198 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, `` A CRISIS IN PUBLIC EDUCATION . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have been much interested in your editorial , '' A Crisis in Public Education , '' in THE DIAL for
March 16	DATE	, and while I recognize in it much that is true , some statements are made to which I can not subscribe .

		Pass - ing its mere local reference to school affairs in
Chicago	LOCATION	, with which I am not familiar , let us examine some of its more general statements .

		You suggest that '' when educational affairs become a subject of popular discussion , it is nearly always found that a certain undercurrent of narrow and prejudiced or ignorant thought comes to the surface , and has con - siderable influence in shaping the final decision .

		The newspapers may too often be counted upon to lead the attack upon whatever is most valuable in a public-school system . ''

		It may be conceded that `` narrow , '' '' prejudiced , '' and '' ignorant thought , '' when it enters the domain of pub - lic affairs , is always unfortunate , prima facie .

		But I shall contend that it is far better to have this so than to shut off the '' popular discussion '' of any question pertaining to public matters in whatever branch of our government .

		For what is a Democracy without such '' discussions '' ?

		It should be the particular business of the broad-minded , unprejudiced , and wise to see that '' the final decision '' is not so '' shaped '' as to unfavor - ably affect the largest and best interests of the public .

		The fact that the latter are more fully and completely in touch with all phases of the question under discussion ought to assure them an easy victory .

		I can not believe that , as a rule , '' newspapers lead in the attack upon whatever is most valuable in a public - school system . ''

		Indeed , I am of the firm faith that the very reverse is true , as a rule .

		I am aware that the political press is guilty of enough mistakes , but I do not believe that one of its sins is that charged in the foregoing remark .

		I have in mind several instances where newspapers took the initiative in effecting gen - uine school reform , and this was done , in some cases , in the very face of a strong adverse sentiment .

		I believe the friends of public education have less to fear from the intelligently conducted newspaper than they have from a large number of their own class , who may be sincere and honest , but are impractical , over-zealous , and ofttimes '' narrow . ''

		You say that one of the chief points of popular attack is upon the salaries paid for the higher kinds of work in the public schools .

		And you add that it is an '' illus - tration of an intellectual defect that seems inherent in democracy , of the inability to understand why one man 's services should be so much more valuable than an - other 's . ''

		There is some truth in the comments you offer on this question .

		But it is not the whole truth .

		In my judg - ment , '' higher kinds '' of educational work can be and are often done in the very lowest and primary grades of school work .

		And this '' higher kind of school work '' should be paid accordingly , because of the high quality of the work performed .

		But `` a graduated tax , '' which you justly term `` insidious '' and `` most dangerous , '' makes such compensation impossible .

		I am one who should be glad to see , and will hail with supreme satis - faction , the day when the largest excellence and the greatest proficiency is attained in the lower grades of school work .

		For this is that part of our public school system nearest to the masses ; is the part most used by the largest numbers ; and is , in an especial sense , the particular school for the people and the whole people .

		It is fit that for the highest excellence in the instruc - tional force in this particular field the compensation should be commensurate with the work .

		It may , as you say , be done anywhere in the course .

		Nor did we say that , '' as a rule , '' newspapers attack what is best in a school system .

		We said that they '' may too often he counted upon '' to do so .

		In
Chicago	LOCATION	, they have done it over and over again , with a disastrous effect upon public opinion .

		For example , in dis - cussing the very editorial upon which you comment , they have treated it as if it were mainly a defence of the high school , whereas it is so only incidentally ; then , having produced this false impression , they have deliberately suppressed the leading argument for the high schools , which is that these schools pro- vide the teachers in the lower schools with nearly all the pedagogical training they get before enter - ing upon their profession .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have read Mr.
G. B. Rose	PERSON	's criticisms on my book in your issue for
March 1	DATE	, and I trust you will accord me a sufficient space in self-defence .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	once said to
Boswell	PERSON	: `` If I tell you there are no apples in that orchard , and there comes a prying fellow who finds half a dozen on different trees , he does not , for all that , controvert my statement . ''

		The experience of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Freeman	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Emer	PERSON	- son , and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, besides a host of lesser writ - ers , would seem to prove that it is impossible to write history and biography without making mistakes in mat - ters of fact .

		Among the host of lesser writers we shall be obliged to place Mr.
Rose	PERSON	, who has made more mis - takes in his short letter to THE DIAL than I believe can be found in three hundred pages of my book on the great masters ; but even if his statement were all cor - rect , they are of such an unimportant kind that the won - der is that he should have wasted ink and paper upon them .

		In the first place , he considers my criticism of the Miraculous Draft of Fishes , that is , that the boat is too near the shore for catching sizable fish , as a sin - gular limitation on our Lord 's miraculous powers .

		Now , I do not question the power of Christ to make fish walk out of the water ; but the problem is , where were
Christ	ORGANIZATION	's disciples likely to cast their nets .

		If they had expected a miracle , or any exceptional occurrence , would Peter have said , '' Lord I am a miserable sinner . ''

		To make a mistake of fact is one thing ; to try to prove a mistake of fact by a flimsy and sophistical argument is quite another thing .

		Mr.
Rose	PERSON	states that the windows of the Antecollegio in the Ducal palace look out on a court-yard , and that the
Adriatic	LOCATION	is not visible from them .

		One would doubt , from this , if Mr.
Rose	PERSON	had ever been in
Venice	LOCATION	.

		The windows of the Antecollegio look out on the piazetta , and there is nothing between them and the
Lido	LOCATION	.

		As all the
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 199 buildings on that side are on a line with the Ducal pal - ace , the reader will perceive that some small portion of the
Adriatic	LOCATION	must be visible from it .

		Mr.
Rose	PERSON	's supposition that the statue called II Pen - seroso was a portrait of Lorenzo dei Medici is an old error that was corrected by Professor
Grimm	PERSON	thirty years ago .

		If he will examine
Grimm	PERSON	's Life of
Michel Angelo	PERSON	he will find a full explanation of the matter , and the conclusive reasons for the true facts of the case .

		After refuting two such blunders , why should I take time to make any further reply to Mr.
Rose	PERSON	?

		I am ready to admit , however , that I may be somewhat in error with regard to
Raphael 's Disputa	ORGANIZATION	.

		That and the
Madonna	PERSON	of the Grand Duke are two important pic - tures which I happened to overlook .

		Of late years the works of art in Italian cities have been greatly changed about .

		I can obtain the testimony of many witnesses to prove that
Leonardo	PERSON	's Medusa was formerly in the Tri - buna .

		In regard to the
David	PERSON	of
Michel Angelo	PERSON	, I have only said that about twenty years ago the statue was placed within the Palazzo Vecchio for its better pre - servation .

		This is the truth , and who can tell what the Italian government will do with it next ?

		Neither have I stated that one of
Michel Angelo	PERSON	's Captives is in the
Boboli	LOCATION	gardens .

		I said it was there formerly ; and if Mr.
Rose	PERSON	will look in Black 's biography of Angelo he will find a corroboration of my statement . ''

		My lords , I am amazed at the attack the noble duke has made upon me . ''

		Why should a man in
Arkansas	LOCATION	feel such a lively animosity against a man in
Massa	LOCATION	- chusetts , whom he has never seen , and in regard to a subject four thousand miles away ?

		We fly to art and poetry to escape the disagreeableness of politics in prac - tical affairs .

		There can not be anything in my book that has so excited Mr.
Rose	PERSON	's ire . ''

		The Midsummer of Italian Art '' was purchased by the
National Library of Florence	ORGANIZATION	, at the suggestion of an Italian scholar , before I was aware that the book was for sale in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		I can assure Mr.
Rose	PERSON	that not one word of my book was written in a
New England	LOCATION	village .

		THE DEPARTMENT ORGANIZATION AT
STANFORD UNIVERSITY	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Your suggestive editorial on '' A University
Sympo	PERSON	- sium '' in THE DIAL -LRB-
Feb. 16	DATE	-RRB- assumes perhaps a little too readily that the solution of our educational prob - lem , in the matter of administration , must come through the adaptation of the college idea , or not at all .

		Is it not quite possible that American experience may strike out some wholly new idea , which shall provide for us a much better system than any form of old world organ - ization can give ?

		Many of us believe that
Leland Stan	PERSON	- ford
Junior University	ORGANIZATION	is working out an experiment along that line full of significance for the future .

		The organization of this institution rests on two prin - ciples .

		In the first place , the unit of organization is the department .

		The courses of study are wholly elective .

		Each student , however , must elect one branch of learn - ing as his major subject .

		And that election at once fixes his relations to the university .

		The department in which he takes his major study becomes the centre of all his work ; his '' major professor '' is his chief ad - viser , and has large discretion in shaping his course of study and overseeing his interests in all respects .

		Thus the department stands for the student in the place of a college .

		He graduates from the department , as the English university man from his college .

		And so far as can be seen , the system conserves every good ele - ment of the English system , while it avoids many of the dangers inherent in the college plan .

		The personal relations between teacher and student are most direct and intimate .

		There is no waste of forces through du - plication of equipment or instruction .

		There is no need to parcel out endowments , since the department in its entirety is but an integral factor of the whole university .

		There is no weakening of loyalty to the university .

		The gain , through the unity thus imparted to the stu - dent 's course , through the sponsorship which the depart - ment exercises on his behalf , is very great .

		The other fundamental principle of the system here in force is the creation of a genuine university spirit through the use of administrative committees drawn from all departments .

		All questions of policy and dis - cipline and outside relations fall into the hands of such committees .

		Through their activities , as well as through other means , department keeps in touch with depart - ment , and a strong sense of oneness is created .

		The time is perhaps yet too short to predict the pos - sibilities of this system , but its practical workings thus far tend to make those acquainted with it very sanguine .

		It is doubtful if any institution in the land with an en - rollment of a thousand students operates so smoothly and satisfactorily .

		Many believe that this experiment points out the most feasible lines of progress for the future administrative system of the American university .

		200 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, W & t Books * Two VIEWS or
BISMARCK	LOCATION	.

		* Two volumes before us , Mr.
Lowe	PERSON	's ''
Bis	ORGANIZATION	- marck 's Table Talk '' and '' Studies in Diplo - macy , '' from the French of
Count Benedetti	LOCATION	, interesting in themselves , are doubly interest - ing when read together , for they interpret the history of the last third of a century from ex - actly opposite points of view .

		Each author makes
Bismarck	PERSON	the central figure in that his - tory , his brain and craft the source of the plans that have led
Europe	LOCATION	into three wars , created a German nation , brought about one combina - tion after another on the diplomatic chess - board .

		But while one sees in him not only genius and success but also a beneficent patriot and friend of peace and civilization , the other sees in him the evil genius of
Europe	LOCATION	whose dark ambition and selfish craft have needlessly caused the death of tens of thousands of men , and brought upon not only
Germany	LOCATION	but all the nations of the Continent the burdens be - neath which they are staggering to-day , the tax - ation and militarism that are crushing their peoples .

		Mr.
Lowe	PERSON	's volume is a selection from the four bulky volumes of
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	's table-talk by
Herr von Poschinger	PERSON	, edited and annotated .

		It follows the lines of his biographies of
Bismarck	LOCATION	, from the chancellor 's boyhood to his fall in
1890	DATE	.

		Another volume is promised which will contain the complaints , criticisms , and revela - tions of the dethroned statesman .

		Bismarck has been a famous talker .

		His intense mental activity and unbounded confidence in his own opinions , his keen observation and insight , his high position and great success , his cynical frankness , and his impulse to the free expres - sion of whatever was in his mind , have made his conversation full of interest and individu - ality .

		Rarely has his table been without guests , and as rarely have his guests departed without some new insight into public affairs and into their host 's many-sided genius .

		Like the con - versation of other great talkers ,
Bismarck	PERSON	's was more a monologue than an interchange of thought , a sparkling , rippling stream of fact , thought , fancy , and wit .

New York	LOCATION	:
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		of
Metternich	ORGANIZATION	, one needed only to jog the bell occasionally to keep it ringing .

		Some of
Bismarck	PERSON	's judgments of his con - temporaries are interesting .

		Of
Gladstone	PERSON	he said that he had so long played with words that now the words played with him ; and at another time , that if , in the course of his whole life , he had inflicted upon
Germany	LOCATION	half the ignoring and weakness which Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	inflicted upon
England	LOCATION	in the course of four years , he would not have had the courage to look his countrymen in the face again .

		Of
Napoleon III	ORGANIZATION	.

		he said : '' He was not lacking in intelli - gence , but this intelligence wanted edge .

		He possessed a source of great power an unshak - able belief in himself , in his star .

		He deemed himself equal to anything , and brooded over the most fantastic schemes . ''

		Gambetta he spoke of as `` this briefless barrister , whose whole political outfit consists of some coffee - house cackle and three Chamber speeches stuffed with liberal phrases . '' ''

		Of professors in politics
Bismarck	PERSON	had a holy horror . '

		You must not take me for a
Heidelberg	LOCATION	professor , ' he once said to Prince
Napoleon	PERSON	. ''

		He once restrained a guest from refuting one of these gentlemen . ''

		Pray do n't trouble yourself ; if you will only have patience for two or three minutes , the learned
Herr Professor	ORGANIZATION	will con - tradict himself in the most brilliant manner . ''

		And the history of
Germany	LOCATION	shows that he as a practical statesman was not without reason in regarding the professors as impracticable idealists .

		Bismarck , in his moments of depression , pro- tested his hatred for politics , though it is evi - dent that politics was his passion throughout his active life . ''

		I never thought that in my riper years I should be obliged to carry on such an unworthy trade as that of Parliamentary Minister .

		I have come down in the world , I hardly know how . ''

		And late in life he lamented that he had found but small pleasure or satis - faction from his political activity . ''

		Had it not been for me , there would have been three great wars the less , the lives of eighty thousand men would not have been sacrificed ; and many parents , brothers , sisters , and widows , would not now be mourners .

		That , however , I have settled with my Maker . ''

		Though one can hardly conceive it possible , he often expressed a longing for the work of the soldier rather than that of the civilian .

		He is a thorough believer in monarchy .

		Uni - versal suffrage he once described as '' the gov - ernment of a house by its nursery , '' adding ,
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 201 `` You can do anything with children if you only play with them . ''

		It is evident that he could not have done what he did if he had been fine-grained and sensitive , yet the coarse bully - ing to which he has often resorted in his treat - ment of individuals , of weaker states and their diplomatic representatives , and of the repre - sentatives of the people in
Parliament	LOCATION	, necessa - rily take from our respect for his character .

		Nor has his career been free from vulgar deceit , to say nothing of the deep craft bordering on deceit that has characterized his whole inter - national policy .

		One can not but join in
Bene	LOCATION	- detti 's denunciation , rather than in
Bismarck	LOCATION	's chuckles of satisfaction , in the matter of the garbling of
King William	LOCATION	's despatch that pre - cipitated the Franco-Prussian War .

		Yet his craftiness often took the form of the frankest truth-telling , so frank and so opposite to all the traditions of diplomacy that his rivals deceived themselves . ''

		What danger can there be in a man who notoriously thinks aloud ? ''


Louis Napoleon	PERSON	once exclaimed ; to which reply was made , '' Count
Bismarck	PERSON	has a genius for con - veying false impressions by telling the naked truth .

		His frankness is like the inky fluid which the cuttle-fish at
Biarritz	LOCATION	throw round them the more truthful he is , the less one sees into him . ''

		His pride in success won by a policy tainted by duplicity is seen in this re - mark : `` When I was made a Prince the
King	ORGANIZATION	insisted on putting
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	into my coat-of-arms .

		But I would much rather have had
Schleswig-Holstein	LOCATION	, for that is the cam - paign , politically speaking , of which I am proudest . ''

		Count Benedetti 's account of
Bismarck	LOCATION	's career is bitterly hostile , that of a man with a grievance .

		But though biased by personal as well as national hostility , it gives a wholesome view of the opposite side to which it is easy to be blinded by the splendid successes of
Bis	ORGANIZATION	- marck 's policy .

		And the French diplomatist has a right to his grievance .

		He was the im - mediate victim of the garbling of the above - mentioned despatch , for he was made to appear a bungler and to have brought about the breach by his bungling , while he seems to have carried out skilfully instructions from
Paris	LOCATION	of which he did not approve and which his superiors afterwards declined to acknowledge .

		The '' Studies in Diplomacy '' are five in number .

		The first is in the form of a preface , but is really a long and elaborate piece of invective against Prince
Bismarck	PERSON	as the cause of most of the evils that press upon
Europe	LOCATION	, in having violently overthrown the old and natural rela - tions between the states , and having arrayed them in hostile and suspicious groups , making necessary the military burdens they are now carrying .

		`` False , '' `` perfidious , '' `` intrigue , '' '' far-sighted duplicity , '' '' morality in tears , '' are some of the expressions he applies to Will - iam and
Bismarck	PERSON	and their policy .

		The sec - ond study is entitled '' The Emperor and Prince
Bismarck	PERSON	, '' and here he tries to show , '' simply in the interest of historical truth , '' that it was
William	PERSON	and not
Bismarck	LOCATION	, after all , that was the supreme director of Prussian policy , that at critical moments he overruled his chancellor .

		He attacks what he calls the legend that
Bis	ORGANIZATION	- marck devised and controlled everything , while his gentle and generous sovereign only ap - proved his plans . ''

		Have not contemporaries been deceived by the clangorous clatter of the one , by the impenetrable silence of the other ?

		Will not impartial history give the Sovereign a share equal to that of the Chancellor , if not greater ? ''

		It may be interesting here to quote
Bismarck	PERSON	's opinion of Benedetti as a '' dancing dog without a collar , '' '' I am scarcely sure of my life with this rabid Corsican . '' ''

		But in saying this he gave a smile , '' said the narrator , and we too broke out into a laugh when we thought of a northern oak of our Chancellor 's calibre being in danger from a little Italian cactus . ''

		The next two of the studies are really upon the same subject , '' The Triple Alliance '' and `` The Armed Peace and Its Consequences . '' ''

		The
Triple Alliance	ORGANIZATION	is a deed of defiance and hatred ; facts prove this superabundantly at present .

		It will produce what it has had within it in germ since its origin : ruin or war , perhaps both scourges together .

		If those who formed it , or who have become its guard - ians , are not convinced , it is because
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	has turned them silly in order to chastise them the better . ''

		The last study , '' My Mission to
Ems	ORGANIZATION	, '' is a dignified personal vindication from the charges of diplomatic mismanagement and incompetency under which the author has suf - fered .

		These have become a commonplace of the history which has been written in English from the German standpoint .

		Incidentally we have a vivid account of the events that imme - diately preceded the outbreak of the war .

		202 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, EAKL.Y WRITING IN CRETE NEIGHBORING LANDS .

		* Mr.
Arthur J. Evans	PERSON	's `` Cretan Picto - graphs '' consists of two distinct and not very closely related essays .

		The former -LRB- pp. 1-103 -RRB- is reprinted from the `` Journal of Hellenic Studies '' for
1894	DATE	.

		The latter is now published for the first time .

		The object of the principal essay is to prove that there once existed in
Crete	LOCATION	a system of hieroglyphic writing , which can be traced back to as early as
2500	DATE	B.C. ; and that a system of linear signs , probably developed from the hieroglyphic , was extensively used , not merely in
Crete	LOCATION	, but in
Peloponnesus	LOCATION	and elsewhere , during the period of the '' Mycenaean '' civili - zation , which civilization was at its height , according to the author 's chronology , about
1500	DATE	B.C. .

		The great importance of this essay may best be brought out by first summarizing the pre - vious state of opinion on the subject with which it deals .

		With regard to picture-writing , the passage in the Sixth Book of the '' Iliad '' which tells how Bellerophon was sent from Ephyre -LRB-
Corinth	LOCATION	-RRB- to Lycia with a tablet containing '' fatal signs , '' sometimes gave occasion for the remark that a mode of communication anal - ogous to that in use among the North Amer - ican Indians may have been known in Homeric times ; but nobody professed to be able to point to any specimen of such picture-writing .

		With regard to alphabetic writing , the conviction was until lately universal that no such thing existed in Greek lands before the introduction of the Phoenician characters .

		Then attention began to be called to marks , suggestively like letters in appearance , incised on objects of very early date in the ^ Egean region .

		In an appen - dix to
Schliemann	PERSON	's '' Ilios , '' published toward the end of
1880	DATE	, Professor Sayce attempted to show that certain marks on terra-cotta whorls from
Hissarlik	LOCATION	were syllabic characters .

		Early in
1881	DATE	our countryman , Mr.
W. J. Stillman	PERSON	, probably still unaware of Professor
Sayce	PERSON	's the - ory , observed and copied a series of six marks inscribed on the walls of a pre-historic build - ing on the site of the ancient Cnosus in
Crete	LOCATION	.

		But , while in doubt as to the significance of these characters , Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	thought that they belonged '' to a period prior to the use * CRETAN PICTOGRAPHS AND

		of letters or any complete system of numeral record . ''

		His brief account of the matter , pub - lished in the Second Annual Report of the
Archaeological Institute of America	ORGANIZATION	, seems to have attracted little attention .

		Within the last four or five years , the discovery of similar signs on objects of '' Mycenaean '' date has led to more remark .

		Dr.
Tsountas	PERSON	, the scholarly and sagacious Greek explorer , in his valuable vol - ume on
Mycenae	LOCATION	-LRB-
Athens	LOCATION	,
1893	DATE	-RRB- , publishes two vase-handles , on one of which are incised three characters resembling letters , on the other four or five .

		In connection with these and other less striking examples from
Greece	LOCATION	, as well as with marks observed by Mr.
Petrie	PERSON	on pottery found by him at Gurob and
Kahun	PERSON	in
Egypt	LOCATION	, but believed to have been imported from the islands or coasts of the 2Egean , Mr.
Tsountas	PERSON	raised the question whether a system of writ - ing existed in '' Mycenaean '' times ; but he thought that the facts then known did not favor an affirmative answer .

		Finally , with all the evidence then available before him ,
M. Perrot	PERSON	, in the latest volume of his great history of an - cient art -LRB- `` La Grece Primitive , ''
Paris	LOCATION	,
1894	DATE	-RRB- , declared : '' The first characteristic which at - tracts the historian 's notice when he tries to de - fine the pre-Homeric civilization is that it is a stranger to the use of writing .

		It knows neither the ideographic signs possessed by
Egypt	LOCATION	nor the alphabet properly so called which
Greece	LOCATION	was afterward to borrow from
Phoenicia	LOCATION	'' -LRB- quoted and translated by Mr.
Evans	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The above account will give a sufficient no - tion of the state of opinion at the time Mr.
Evans	PERSON	began the researches which have re - sulted in the present volume .

		He is the keeper of the Ashmolean Museum at
Oxford	LOCATION	, and is not only a scholar of wide and thorough learn - ing in the field of archaeology , but also a keen - scented collector and an intrepid explorer .

		He says : '' In the course of a visit to
Greece	LOCATION	in the
spring of 1893	DATE	, I came across some three - and four-sided stones perforated along their axis , upon which had been en - graved a series of remarkable symbols .

		These symbols occurred in groups on the facets of the stones , and it struck me at once that they belonged to a hieroglyphic system ... My inquiries succeeded in tracing these to a Cretan source . ''

		The next thing was to follow up the clue by searching for additional specimens in
Crete	LOCATION	itself . ''

		Landing at
Candia	ORGANIZATION	in
March , 1894	DATE	, 1 made my way round the whole centre and east of the island , includ - ing the mountainous districts of Ida and Dikta , the ex - tensive central plain of Messara , and the sites of over twenty ancient cities ... My researches were well
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 203 rewarded by the discovery in situ of traces of a prse - Phceuician system of writing in the island , in which two distinct phases were perceptible , one pictorial and hiero - glyphic , the other linear and quasi-alphabetic . ''

		The evidence thus gathered is presented in the copiously illustrated essay now before us , to - gether with kindred evidence from other sources .

		Mr.
Evans	PERSON	has unquestionably established his main contentions .

		And what makes his results the more important is that , while the hieroglyphic system '' seems to have been prin - cipally at home in
Crete	LOCATION	, '' the linear system can already be seen to have had a wide exten - sion in the '' Mycenaean '' world .

		The chief - tains , then , who built and occupied in the sec - ond millennium before the Christian era the palaces of Tiryns and
Mycenae	LOCATION	, were not with - out means of written communication and record .

		The specimens of script in use in their time will surely accumulate , as new sites come to be ex - cavated .

		But whether the material will be such as to enable some future
Champollion	PERSON	to de - cipher the inscriptions , it is impossible now to predict .

		Mr.
Evans	PERSON	further makes it highly probable that the '' Mycenaean '' linear system of writing stands in close connection with the syllabary in use in historic times among the Greeks of
Cyprus	LOCATION	.

		More than this , he re-opens the ques - tion of the origin of the Phrenician alphabet , that prolific mother of all alphabets now in use save the Chinese and Indian -LRB- Hindoo -RRB- , if in - deed the Indian be an exception .

		According to the theory most in vogue , the Phoenician alphabet was derived from
Egypt	LOCATION	; but Mr.
Evans	PERSON	shows by a few examples that `` it is at least worth while to weigh the possibility that the rudiments of the Phoenician writing may after all have come in part at least from the - ZEgean side . ''

		Here are matters enough for further study .

		Other workers will doubtless enter the field opened up by Mr.
Evans	PERSON	, but he will always have the distinction of having been the chief pioneer .

		It may be mentioned , as a matter of special interest to Americans , that Professor
Halbherr	PERSON	, the eminent Italian epigraphist who conducted explorations in
Crete	LOCATION	for the Ar - chaeological
Institute of America	ORGANIZATION	from
Novem	DATE	- ber ,

November , 1894	DATE	, promises to de - vote a chapter to `` Island Stones and other Stones inscribed with Writing belonging to a pre-Hellenic System , '' in the account of his re - searches to be published in '' The American Journal of Archaeology . ''

		The second essay in Mr.
Evans	PERSON	's volume deals with a group of objects found near the site of the ancient Phsestos in
central Crete	LOCATION	, and believed to date from the third millennium
B.C.	LOCATION	.

		These are discussed with the author 's usual learning and ingenuity .

		The two opposing forces , Catholic tradition and Puritan earnest - ness , were contending within the arena of church life , and the two opposing forces of abso - lutism and the desire for popular government were at the same time at war in the political sphere -LRB- p. 41 -RRB- .

		But the important influence lying behind the success of popular rights and the growth of religious freedom was the power of industry and commerce .

		The heroic age of English exploration and discovery was followed by one of settlement and trading progress , when the nation of
Raleigh	LOCATION	and the
Pilgrim Fathers	ORGANIZATION	becomes a great colonizing state , and begins the foundation of what was to be the
United States of America	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- p. 51 -RRB- .

		Progress in man - ufactures and in commerce , in banking and expanding trade , made possible both the Com - monwealth and the Revolution of
1688	DATE	.

		A great social change had been taking place in
England	LOCATION	.

		The overthrow of the Stuarts is therefore to be regarded as something more than the
fall	DATE	of a dynasty .

		It represents in a striking manner the fundamental change in social institutions , and revealed the entirely dif - ferent basis of political power which the expan - sion of commerce , the growth of manufactures , and the increase of colonization had brought .

		The sovereignty and divine right of the king , dependent on the landed aristocracy and the church for support , is replaced by the sover - eignty and divine right of the people , and in - stead of the feudal idea of monarchy there arose the notion of constitutional royalty , dependent on the will of the people .

		204 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, Interest naturally centres in the period be - tween the meeting of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	in
November , 1640	DATE	, and the execution of the King in Janu - ary ,
1649	DATE	, a time in which the constitutional position of the Crown and its relation to Par - liament passed through startling phases .

		The
Long Parliament	LOCATION	began its work by abolishing the exceptional powers conferred temporarily on the Tudors to enable them to complete the overthrow of the mediaeval nobility , to carry through the struggle with
Rome	LOCATION	, to maintain order at home , and to avert the risk of foreign invasion : particularly the
Star Chamber	ORGANIZATION	's power to sentence without a jury , and the power by extra customs duties to raise a revenue with - out
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		It then asked the King to appoint '' such ministers as
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	could confide in , '' and to accept the '' course that the Lords and Commons have appointed for the ordering of the militia . ''

		But the scheme was at once too tolerant , too democratic , and too balanced , for an age of religious hatreds , of aristocratic and bourgeois prejudices , and of unfitness for delicate political machinery .

		In Stuart times the feudal monarchy had ceased to perform the social function required of it ; it had ceased to be useful to the English people .

		It was therefore destined to disappear .

		But if the members of the
Stuart	PERSON	family , on the one hand , were not equal to the task of yielding just enough to the new movement , and adapting themselves to the new social environment , it is equally true that the religious enthusiasts and political leaders of '' the third estate , '' on the other hand , were decidedly premature in many of their schemes and demands .

		James the First may have been weak to the point of childish - ness ; '' have loved bawbles as a child loves its rattle ; loved bright feathers , too to dress his cap withal ; have been afraid of a drawn sword and of hobgoblins , '' and besides have chosen as his sole confidants greedy , unscrupulous adven - turers -LRB- p. 157 -RRB- .

		His son ,
Charles I.	PERSON	, may have had an obstinate temper and absurd notions about his kingly prerogative .

		James the
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- ond may have been as bigoted and obstinate as Charles the Second was profligate and suave .

		Yet on the other hand the extreme character of the demands and programme of the Puritans and the Republicans had everything to do with rendering the Civil War '' inevitable . ''

		Much of the work proposed under the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	remained even to the present century to be accomplished , in the Reform Bill of
1832	DATE	, Catholic emancipation , and so forth .

		Before the end of the reign of Charles II .

		arbitrary taxation had ceased and the respon - sibility of ministers been finally established .

		The Habeas Corpus act protected the liberty of the individual , and no army could be kept in time of peace .

		The reign , too , had witnessed the growth of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its right of impeachment had been recognized , the principles of appropriation , of supply , and audit of accounts , had been secured , while its claims to initiate money bills had been placed beyond dispute -LRB- p. 351 -RRB- .

		The right of petition , the right of freedom of debate in
Parliament	LOCATION	, the necessity of frequent parliaments , the right of free choice of representatives , were hencefor - ward recognized .

		The Revolution of
1688	DATE	com - pleted the work of the
Long Parliament	LOCATION	, and the Bill of Rights confirmed the advantages gained by the nation during the great Rebellion .

		But the reigns of
William	PERSON	and his successor ,
Anne	PERSON	, only saw the new system thoroughly in - augurated ; it was not until the reigns of the first two
Georges	PERSON	that it was firmly established .

		It is the character of these social and polit - ical changes which give the period special inter - est to Americans .

		Much that we take for granted as the basis of our democratic institu - tions was worked out in the bourgeois revolution in
England	LOCATION	in the
seventeenth century	DATE	.

		Pro- gress was distinctly confined , however , to the middle class .

		The vast majority of the popu - lation gained little , either in wealth or freedom .

		Tenant-farmers and yeoman freeholders , as well as merchant traders , were growing rich ; but the lot of the agricultural laborer did not change for the better .

		Wages rose no faster than the prices of the necessaries of life .

		The agrarian partnerships of open village farms , where the enterprise of twenty farmers might be checked by the apathy or caution of one , were giving place to large estates and individual ownership ; but markets were few , communication difficult , and traditional methods were guarded as agri - cultural heirlooms .

		Each village was self - sufficing , raised only enough food for its own inhabitants , and was not concerned with the affairs of the next parish .

		It was not until the new body of wants and a new market had been created by the rapid growth of population which resulted from the development of manufactur - ing industries , that there was any improve - ment in the condition of the masses and increase in their political power .

		Consideration of this last fact naturally sug - gests the query as to whether Mr.
Traill	PERSON	and his co-laborers are really making '' Social En - gland '' '' a record of the progress of the peo -

		Do not these things reveal the progress of the people ?

		ance exceeds any anticipation in which we had in - dulged , so large is the amount and so noble the qual - ity of the collection of pieces now brought together by the painstaking devotion of the only surviving brother of the poet .

		Once more we are impressed with the fact that
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	was , if not dis - tinctly the first , assuredly not the second among Englishwomen dowered with the gift of numbers , and once more we are called upon to seek for terms that shall not be entirely inadequate to express the gratitude which all lovers of poetry must feel toward the singer of so many perfect songs .

		Mr.
Rossetti	PERSON	has here brought together , partly from the manu - scripts left by his sister , and partly from published sources not readily accessible , nearly four hundred pages of verse , ranging from the earliest juvenilia to the maturest and most spiritual expression of her genius .

		Some of the poems stand upon the highest plane of her achievement ; others are simply beau - tiful without being noteworthy ; a few are of the nature of exercises in verse or attempts at flight ere the wings were grown .

		The collection as a whole is an unspeakably precious and fragrant gift , a per - manent enrichment of our literature .

		Miss Ros - setti 's genius was astonishingly precocious in devel - opment , and there is no better work in this or in the earlier volumes than some of that dating from her girlhood .

		The following beautiful if irregular sonnet , '' Life Hidden , '' was written at the age of nineteen : '' Roses and lilies grow above the place Where she sleeps the long sleep that doth not dream .

		If we could look upon her hidden face , Nor shadow would be there , nor garish gleam Of light , her life is lapsing like a stream That makes no noise but floweth on apace
Seawards	LOCATION	, while many a shade and shady beam Vary the ripples in their gliding chase .

		She doth not see , but knows ; she doth not feel , And yet is sensible ; she hears no sound , Yet counts the flight of time and doth not err .

		Peace far and near , peace to ourselves and her : Her body is at peace in holy ground , Her spirit is at peace where Angels kneel . ''

		Dated only
four years later	DATE	is this exquisite set of couplets , '' Whitsun Eve , '' a symphony in white : '' The white dove cooeth in her downy nest , Keeping her young ones warm beneath her breast : The white moon saileth through the cool clear sky , Screened by a tender mist in passing by : The white rose buds , with thorns upon its stem , All the more precious and more dear for them : The stream shines silver in the tufted grass , The white clouds scarcely dim it as they pass ; Deep in the valleys lily cups are white , They send up incense all the holy night : Our souls are white , made clean in Blood once shed : White blessed Angels watch around our bed : spotless Lamb of God , still keep us so , Thou who wert born for us in time of snow . ''

		If we set against these poems the lyric called `` Heaven Overarches , '' dated
1893	DATE	, and probably the last composition of
Miss Rossetti	LOCATION	, we find essen - tially the same style , a little chastened perhaps , and simplified to the point of austerity , but in no way distinctly marking the lapse of forty years .

		206 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, '' Heaven overarches earth and sea , Earth-sadness and sea-bitterness .

		Heaven overarches you and me : A little while and we shall be Please God where there is no more sea Nor barren wilderness . ''

		Heaven overarches yon and me , And all earth 's gardens and her graves .

		Look up with me , until we see The day break and the shadows flee .

		What though to-night wrecks you and me If so to-morrow saves . ''

		An unexpected feature of this volume is found in the nearly forty pages of Italian lyrics .

		`` The Italian verses were kept by
Christina	PERSON	in the jealous seclusion of her writing-desk , '' says her brother , '' and I suppose no human eye had looked upon them until I found them there after her death . ''

		We may find space for one short song , '' Kipetizione '' : '' Credea di rivederti e ancor ti aspetto ; Di giorno in giorno ognor ti vo braruando : Quando ti rivedr6 , cor mio diletto , Quando ma quando ? ''

		Dissi e ridissi con perenne sete , E lo ridico e vo ' ridirlo ancora , Qual usignol che canta e si ripete Fino all ' aurora . ''

		Some of these Italian pieces , and a few of the En - glish ones , are expressions of a passion to be dealt with by the critic , if at all , with tender and reverent touch .

		Mr.
Rossetti	PERSON	says all that is needed by way of explanation in a brief note .

		`` My sister was twice sought in marriage ; and in each instance was well disposed to her suitor , but was withheld by re - ligious considerations .

		The first suitor , a painter , was a Christian , but not in the Anglican commun - ion ; the second , a scholar and literary man and this was far the most serious affair of the two either was not a Christian at all , or else was a
Chris	PERSON	- tian of undefined and heterodox views .

		The first matter terminated towards
1850	DATE	, the second towards
1864	DATE	.

		Both the men died during
Christina	PERSON	's life - time . ''

		This is deeply interesting , and it is well that so much of the truth should be made public ; yet it jars a little with our conception of the woman , and suggests a narrowness from which we would gladly have believed her free .

		There is no such suggestion of intolerance in her work , although that work is throughout pervaded by religious emotion of the deepest and purest type .

		The suggestion made by Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	that
Chris	PERSON	-
tina Rossetti	PERSON	deserved to succeed
Tennyson	PERSON	in the laureateship was followed , after
Miss Rossetti	PERSON	's death , by a suggestion from Mr.
Coventry Patmore	PERSON	naming Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	for that honor .

		If anything can soften the sense of our loss in the death of the former of these women , it is that the latter still re - mains with us .

		The little volume of her poems now published is largely a reprint of the '' Preludes '' of
1875	DATE	-LRB- when the writer was Miss
Alice Thompson	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Some of the early poems are , however , omitted , and their place is taken by '' the few verses written in maturer years . ''

		The volume is a very slender one .

		but its contents are pure gold . ''

		A poet of one mood in all my lays , '' Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	styles herself , and the characterization seems apt if we remember that into this one mood of spiritual aspiration is distilled the very essence of poetic feeling for nature and the human heart , that it is a mood in which vision becomes clairvoyant in its refinement , and expression fits itself to emotion as by a sort of pre - established harmony .

		The world will be unworthy of poetry that can ever forget such work as '' Re - nouncement , '' '' The Modern Poet , '' and '' My Heart Shall Be Thy Garden . ''

		For the latter of these three perfect poems we may find space . ''

		My heart shall be thy garden .

		Come , my own , Into thy garden ; thine be happy hours Among my fairest thoughts , my tallest flowers , From root to crowning petal , thine alone .

		Thine is the place from where the seeds are sown Up to the sky enclosed , with all its showers .

		But ah , the birds , the birds !

		Who shall build bowers To keep these thine ?

		O friend , the birds have flown .

		For as these come and go , and quit our pine To follow the sweet season , or , new-comers , Sing one song only from our alder-trees .

		My heart has thoughts , which , though thine eyes hold mine , Flit to the silent world and other summers , With wings that dip beyond the silver seas . ''

		Among recent examples of American book-making there are few to vie with the series of '' English Love Sonnets '' begun with '' The House of Life '' a year or two ago , now continued with a volume contain - ing Mr.
W. S. Blunt	PERSON	's '' Esther '' and '' The Love Sonnets of Proteus , '' and soon to include the '' Son - nets from the Portuguese '' as a third number .

		These beautiful volumes are printed on Dutch hand - made paper , with borders and initial letters by Mr.
Bertram Goodhue	PERSON	, are in shape square octavos , and are published in limited editions .

		As for the work of Mr.
Blunt	PERSON	now published , description is hardly called for . ''

		Esther '' is a sequence of fifty-four son - nets , including a dedication '' to the Best-Beloved '' ; the '' Proteus '' sonnets number one hundred and forty-two .

		All of these '' sonnets '' are irregular in form , some of them having sixteen , and even fifteen , verses , while those not thus audaciously lengthened take all sorts of liberties with the scheme of rhymes .

		Some verses have no rhymes at all , and many others rhyme but imperfectly .

		A general tendency toward the Shakespearian form is to be discerned , but hardly more than this can be said in the way of met - rical characterization .

		Of the poetry itself , it must be said that it offers a veritable transcript of life , glowing and passionate : '' This is the book .

		For evil and for good , What my life was in it is written plain .

		These are no dreams , but things of flesh and blood , The past that lived and shall not live again . ''

		The irregularity of form is symbolic of a wayward - ness of feeling that has not learned the wholesome lesson of restraint ; the verse is often diffuse , impul - sive , and roughly-wrought .

		It is not often , for ex - ample , that so finished and organic a sonnet results as that we are about to copy :
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 207 '' Yes ,
spring	DATE	is come , but joy alas is gone , Gone ere we knew it , while our foolish eyes , Which should have watched its motions every one Were looking elsewhere , at the hills , the skies , Chasing vain thoughts , as children butterflies , Until the hour struck and the day was done , And we looked up in passionate surprise To find that clouds had blotted out our sun .

		Our joys are gone and what is left to us , Who loved not even love when it was here ?

		What but a voice which sobs monotonous As these sad waves upon the rocks , the dear Fond voice which once made music with our own , And which our hearts now ache to think upon . ''

		If Mr.
Blunt	PERSON	's fulfilment often comes short of his aim , that aim is at least a high one .

		It finds beau - tiful expression at the close of one of the last son - nets of the sequence : '' Oh , if there be Still in this world of vanished creeds and kings Some faith in royal blood and right divine , Some lingering reverence paid to majesty , Here seek it and here find it , for it clings To each hushed verse like incense to a shrine . ''

		While on the subject of reprints , we may take occasion to say a few words of a curious poem dat - ing from
1831	DATE	, which Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	has thought it worth while to introduce to modern read - ers , and which has just been published in attractive form by
London	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	houses .

		It is a boy - ish work of
Thomas T. Stoddart	PERSON	, who died as re - cently as
1880	DATE	, and was best known as a disciple of
Walton	LOCATION	, and as a writer of some very charming angling lyrics .

		The poem is called '' The Death - Wake ; or , Lunacy , '' and is further described as '' a necromaunt in three chimeras . ''

		It is a narrative in rhymed couplets upon a ghastly theme .

		A young monk , enamored in secret of a nun , is driven to dis - traction by her death , digs up her body at dead of
night	TIME	, carries it off in a boat to a remote rocky coast , and gloats over the corpse while corruption is doing its loathsome work .

		The poem can not be read without a shudder , even in this age of Zolaism , and yet it includes passages of rare poetic beauty , and those who begin it will hardly put the book aside until they have come to the grisly end .

		As an illustration of the extravagances of roman - ticism , it occupies a place in English poetry almost unique .

		The wildest imaginings of
Scott	PERSON	and of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	seem commonplace beside this daring conception .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	does not overstate the ar - gument for this poem when he ascribes to its au - thor '' an accent original , distinct , strangely musical , and really replete with promise .

		He has a fresh unborrowed melody and mastery of words , the first indispensable sign of a true poet . ''

		Such a passage as this in which the frenzied monk , adrift upon the waves , likens himself to the sea , attests the music and vivid imaginative quality of the poem : '' For we are , In feature , as the sun is to a star , So are we like , and we are touch ' d in tune With lunacy as music ; and the moon , That setteth the tides sentinel before Thy camp of waters , on the pebbled shore , And measures their great footsteps to and fro , Hath lifted up into my brain the flow Of this mad tide of blood . ''

		The book is strangely fascinating , in spite of its morbid quality , and was well worth reprinting .

		A few short poems by the author are appended , and deepen the impression made by the '' necromaunt '' that precedes them .


Stoddard	PERSON	was a poet by nature , if '' he only blossomed once , '' and a poet of marked individuality at that .

		Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	is only thirty years of age , but he has been prolific of verse , and is now enabled to select from the considerable mass of his work those parts which he deems worthy of preservation in a definitive edition .

		The volume of '' Poems '' result - ing from this selection includes three larger works in dramatic or semi-dramatic form '' The Wan - derings of Usheen , '' '' The
Countess Cathleen	PERSON	, '' and '' The Land of Heart 's Desire '' and nearly two score shorter pieces .

		The peculiar Celtic form of imagination , and the note of mysticism which so often pervades expressions of the Celtic temper , are everywhere noticeable in this volume .

		We do not always know what the author means , and we do not always care to know , so absolute are the terms of his art at its best .

		It would be difficult to make a log - ical analysis of such lines as those inscribed to '' The Rose of Battles , '' for example : '' Rose of all Roses , Rose of all theVWorld !

		You , too , have come where the dim tides are hurled Upon the wharves of sorrow , and heard ring The bell that calls us on : the sweet far thing .

		Beauty grown sad with its eternity Made you of us , and of the dim grey sea .

		Our long ships loose thought-woven sails and wait , For God has bid them share an equal fate ; And when at last defeated in His wars , They have gone down under the same white stars , We shall no longer hear the little cry Of our sad hearts , that may not live nor die . ''

		But then , it would be difficult to formulate the thought of '' Kubla Khan '' or '' The Blessed Dam - ozel . ''

		These things are simply beautiful , and we accept them as such without question .

		That Mr.
Blackmore	PERSON	is a poet a sort of poet his readers know well .

		His novels are filled with lyric passages that are evidently struggling to escape from the trammels of prose , and sometimes do es - cape for a brief flight . ''


Lorna Doone	PERSON	'' is written largely in broken hexameters that even the least musical of readers must discover after a while .

		So it is not wholly a surprise to receive a volume of acknowledged verse from Mr.
Blackmore	PERSON	's pen , a volume consisting , in the main , of four long narra - tive poems upon classical and oriental themes .

		What calls for particular mention is the freakish way in which these poems are printed , and which is best illustrated by a specimen | stanza from ''
Lita	PERSON	of the Nile '' the priest 's prayer for the rising of the waters . ''

		King and Father , gift and giver , God revealed in form of river , Issuing perfect and sublime From the fountain-head of time , Whom eternal mystery shroudeth , Unapproached , un - track 'd , unknown ; Whom the Lord of heaven enclondeth 208 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, With the curtains of His throne , From the throne of heaven descending ,
Glory	ORGANIZATION	, power , and goodness blending , Grant us , ere the daylight dies , Token of thy rapid rise . ''

		A prefatory note accounts for the modest title of this volume . ''

		-LRB- Fringilla loquitur -RRB- ' What means your finch ? '

		Being well aware that he can not sing like a nightingale , He flits about from tree to tree , and twitters a little tale . ''

		We must find room to quote entire the epilogue , '' To Fame , '' which is the best piece of verse in the volume .

		It is not a great poem , but it is pleasing in its simple sincerity . ''

		Bright Fairy of the morn , with flowers arrayed , Whose beauties to thy young pursuer seem Beyond the ecstasy of poet 's dream Shall I o'ertake thee ere thy lustre fade ? ''

		Ripe glory of the noon ,
august	DATE	and proud , A vision of high purpose , power , and skill , Dissolving into mirage of good-will Do I o'ertake thee , or embrace a cloud ?

		u Gray shadow of the
evening	TIME	, gaunt and bare , At random cast , beyond me or above , And cold as memory in the arms of love If I o'ertook thee now what should I care ? '' '

		No morn , or noon , or eve am I , ' she said , ' But night the depth of night behind the sun , By all mankind pursued ; but never won , Until my shadow falls upon a shade . ' ''

		This book is beautifully printed , and made doubly attractive by Mr.
W. H. Bradley	PERSON	's '' decorative pic - turings '' in the form of cover design , borders , ini - tials , and full-page drawings .

		It is printed on hand - made paper , and the edition is limited .

		There are only about forty pages of verse in Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's new volume , but it outweighs most of the other volumes examined in this review .

		An `` Apo - logia '' in blank verse , two lyrics , three sonnets , and three long poems , make up the entire contents .

		The '' Apologia '' should not have been printed , for it only emphasizes once more Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's most con - spicuous fault self-consciousness .

		The lyrics are trifles , as are likewise two of the sonnets .

		The third sonnet , '' The Turk in
Armenia	LOCATION	, '' will bear compar - ison with the noblest in the English language , and more specifically challenges comparison with Mil - ton 's sonnet on the
Piedmont	LOCATION	massacres , and Ros - setti 's '' On the Refusal of Aid between Nations . ''

		The three long poems are a '' Hymn to the Sea , '' a set of stanzas on '' The Tomb of
Burns	PERSON	, '' and the poem that gives the volume its title .

		Of the first of these three , we may say that it has been praised out of all proportion to its merits , yet remains a noteworthy production .

		It is forced and turgid , yet when all is said , it must still be accounted one of the most remarkable of experiments in English elegiacs .

		The real strength of Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's vol - ume is in the two poems that we have left to the last .

		How happily he can write literary criticism in verse is known to all who have read his Words - worth ,
Tennyson	PERSON	, and
Shelley	PERSON	poems .

		His
Burns	PERSON	poem belongs to this group , and is perhaps the finest of the four .

		The form is as follows : '' He came when poets had forgot How rich and strange the human lot ; How warm the tents of Life , how hot Are Love and Hate ; And what makes Truth divine , and what Makes Manhood great . ''

		Here is another stanza one of the best : '' A dreamer of the common dreams , A fisher in familiar streams , He chased the transitory gleams That all pursue ; But on his lips the eternal themes Again were new . ''

		This is very nobly put and impressive , yet , when we come to examine it closely , its virtue appears a trifle too `` literary '' ; it is the virtue of rhetoric or critical prose rather than of song .

		How it falls short of the higher poetical excellence may be shown by the test of the touchstone in this case happily provided by the greatest of living poets , who has published in '' The Nineteenth Century '' for Feb - ruary a poem upon the same subject , written in ex - actly the same stanza .

		Here is an extract from Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's poem : '' Earth , and the snow-dimmed heights of air , And waters winding soft and fair Through still sweet places , bright and bare , By bent and byre Taught him what hearts within them were : But his was fire . ''

		Here is , after all , the true spontaneous utterance , the art wherein art is most concealed , the sublima - tion of poetical expression .

		A similar test , could one so exactly fitting be found , would lead to the same judgment upon '' The Father of the Forest , '' which is , on the whole , the finest of Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's new poems .

		A venerable yew is apostrophized , and the pageant of English history , unrolled through the centuries that the tree has stood , is brought into retrospect .

		Of the many felicitous descriptions and characterizations we may select a few . ''

		On that proud morn when
England	LOCATION	's eyes , Wet with tempestuous joy , beheld Round her rough coasts the thundering main Strewn with the ruined dream of
Spain	LOCATION	. '' ''

		The sweet queen of a tragic hour Crowned with her snow-white memory The crimson legend of the Tower . '' ''

		The Conqueror , in our soil who set This stem of Kinghood flowering yet . '' ''

		His battles o'er , he takes his ease , Glory put by , and sceptered toil .

		Round him the carven centuries Like forest branches arch and coil .

		In that dim fame , he is not sure Who lost or won at Azincour ! ''

		This seems to us nearly , if not quite , as good as the foreshadowings of English history in Gray 's great ode , and the dignity of the poem is sustained through - out at the elevation suggested by these extracts .

		There can be no doubt that the volume which we have just sought to characterize has brought Mr.
Watson	PERSON	a long step nearer to the goal of his ambi - tion .

		It seems more nearly possible than ever be - fore that he may in time secure recognition among the greater English poets of the century .

		At all events , he now stands far to the front in the group of the younger singers .

		Mr.
John Davidson	PERSON	, also , is a young poet of sin - gular promise , although a fluent versatility is more
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 209 than likely to prove his bane .

		In his '' Fleet Street Eclogues '' he has done something almost new in kind .

		A knot of
London	LOCATION	journalists come together on the chief holidays of the year , and compare notes upon the chief subjects of human concern , discours - ing in easy and often striking verse upon such sub - jects as nature -LRB- pp. 31 , 43 , 83 -RRB- , politics -LRB- p. 124 -RRB- , economics -LRB- p. 123 -RRB- , literature -LRB- p. 113 -RRB- , love -LRB- p. 27 -RRB- , heredity -LRB- p. 148 -RRB- , and theology of a rather ama - teurish and pantheistic sort -LRB- pp. 153 , 201 -RRB- . ''

		Fancy where it lists Breathes like the wind : he who resists His wanton moods forever , ends In being moodless . ''

		Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	, certainly , does not allow fancy to resist any mood , however wanton , and his '' ec - logues '' offer the strangest medley of prosaic themes touched by poetic feeling , and of poetry suggested by the commonest incidents .

		The passion for na - ture , as it rushes upon the hearts of men toiling amid the unlovely environment of the city , is the predominant note of these poems , and finds vent in many a rapturous lyric strain . ''

		Heaven is to tread unpaven ground , And care no more for prose or rhyme , '' remarks
Sandy	PERSON	, and calls upon his brother - journalist to '' make us feel the blossom-time . ''

		Whereupon Menzies responds : '' The patchwork sunshine nets the lea ; The flitting shadows halt and pass ; Forlorn , the mossy humble-bee Lounges along the flowerless grass . ''

		With unseen smoke as pure as dew , Sweeter than love or lovers are , Wood - violets of watchet hue Their secret hearths betray afar . ''

		The vanguards of the daisies come ,
Summer	ORGANIZATION	's crusaders sanguine-stained , The only flowers that left their home When happiness in Eden reigned . ''

		They strayed abroad , old writers tell ,
Hardy	PERSON	and bold , east , west , south , north ; Our guilty parents , when they fell , And flaming vengeance drove them forth , '' Their haggard eyes in vain to God , To all the stars of heaven turned ; But when they saw where in the sod The golden-hearted daisies burned , `` Sweet thoughts that still within them dwelt Awoke , and tears embalmed their smart ; On
Eden	PERSON	's daisies couched they felt They carried Eden in their heart . ''

		It is easy to pick flaws in these verses , but difficult to avoid being swept away by their emotional cur - rent .

		If now and then we come upon such an infe - licitous phrase as `` cabbage blade , '' we are soon more than rewarded by such bits as the '' husky whisper of the corn , '' '' the blackbirds with their oboe voices , '' the '' avenues of latticed light , '' and '' The grass-green turf Where primroses by secret alchemy Distil from buried treasure golden leaves . ''

		One more extract , in substance a confession of faith , must suffice us . ''

		I said within : Three things are worthiest knowing , And when I know them nothing else I know .

		I know unboundedly , what needs no showing , That women are most beautiful ; and then I know I love them ; and I know again Herein alone true science lies , for , lo !

		Old
Rome	LOCATION	's a ruin ;
Cassar	PERSON	is a name ; The Church ?

		alas !

		a life boat , warped and sunk ; God , a disputed title : but the fame Of those who sang of love , fresher than
spring	DATE	, Blossoms forever with the tree of life , Whose boughs are generations ; and its trunk Love ; and its flowers , lovers . ''

		Two new volumes by Mrs.
Marriott	PERSON	-
Watson	PERSON	are among the more noteworthy collections of recent verse .

		The author , who is perhaps better known as ''
Graham R. Tomson	PERSON	, '' stands high among the liv - ing women who have approved themselves poets , for her work is always pure and elevated in thought , felicitious in diction , and artistic in form .

		The ded - ication of one of these collections to Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	is suggestive , since the author is not unlike the wo - man to whom she pays this tribute in the delicate spirituality and elusive charm of her work .

		Mrs.
Marriott	ORGANIZATION	-
Watson	PERSON	has perhaps a little more of color and of epic quality ; the latter illustrated by the ad - mirable ballads contained in the present and pre - viously published volumes , the former by such stan - zas as these from ''
Hesternse Rosse	PERSON	'' : '' Between the bounds of
night	TIME	and day , Far out into the west they lie , More sweet than any song may say , The red rose-gardens of the sky . ''

		Beyond the sunset wreck forlorn , Of tower and temple overthrown , Of fallen fort and banner torn ,
Burns	PERSON	the red flame of roses blown . ''

		Through jewelled jalousies ajar , That ruddy lustre shines aslant From terraced vistas stretching far , The mellow light of old romaunt . ''

		'T is there the vanished roses blow In splendour of eternal prime , That graced the summers long ago , The royal revels of old time . ''

		A sheaf of sweet unpretentious lyrics and a few pieces in lighter vein make up the '' Songs and Other Verses '' of Miss
Dollie Radford	PERSON	.

		The following lines are a good example of her work : '' Because I built my nest so high , Must I despair If a fierce wind , with bitter cry .

		Passes the lower branches by , And mine makes bare ? ''

		Because I hung it , in my pride , So near the skies , Higher than other nests abide , Must I lament if far and wide It scattered lies ? ''

		I shall but build , and build my best , Till , safety won , I hang aloft my new-made nest , High as of old , and see it rest , As near the sun . ''

		Miss Blind justifies the title given her volume of poems by a `` Prelude '' in `` Locksley Hall '' couplets .

		210 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, `` On and on , along old Nilus , seeking still an ampler light , O'er its monumental mountains , Birds of Passage take their flight . ''

		Where the sacred Isle of Fhilae , twinned within the sacred stream , Floats , like some rapt Opium-eater 's labyrinthine lotos dream , '' Birds on birds take up their quarters in each creviced capital , In each crack of frieze and cornice , in each cleft of roof and wall . ''

		About half of the poems are upon Egyptian themes , the others come nearer home .

		We may select an `` Evensong '' in Holy
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Stratford	LOCATION	-LRB- one of a group of '' Shakespeare Sonnets '' -RRB- , in illus - tration of Miss Blind 's most careful workmanship . ''

		The hectic autumn 's dilatory fire Has turned this lime tree to a sevenfold brand , Which , self-consuming , lights the sunless land , A death to which all poet souls aspire .

		Above the graves , where all men 's vain desire Is hushed at last as by a Mother 's hand , And ,
Time	ORGANIZATION	confounded , Love 's blank records stand , The Evensong swells from the pulsing choir .

		`` What incommunicable presence clings To this grey church and willowy twilight stream ?

		Am I the dupe of some delusive dream ?

		Or , like faint fluid phosphorescent rings On refluent seas , doth
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's spirit gleam Pervasive round these old familiar things ? ''

		The poetic elevation of this volume is fairly con - stant , but the diction is far from perfect , revealing many flaws that a little more care might have pol - ished away .

		Mr.
Francis Thompson	PERSON	's '' Sister-Songs , '' the au - thor tells us in a note , were written at about the same time as the chief poems in his earlier-published volume .

		Examination shows them to be , not a col - lection of pieces , but a single poem in sections , irregular in form , and characterized by all '' the illuminous and volute redundance '' of '' The Hound of Heaven '' and its companion compositions .

		That we have here , as in the previous volume , the stun * of poetry in a high sense is evident to the most cas - ual inspection .

		The following excerpt will amply illustrate the statement : '' In all I work , my hand include th thine ; Thou rnshest down in every stream Whose passion frets my spirit 's deepening gorge ; Unhood ` st mine eyas-heart , and fliest my dream ; Thou swing ` st the hammers of my forge ; As the innocent moon , that nothing does but shine , Moves all the labouring surges of the world . ''

		But it is equally evident that the mannerisms , the obscurity , and the forced expression that seem insep - arable from Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's work forbid its inclu - sion in the body of poetry accepted by the world as great .

		It may become the subject of a cult ; it can never win the unqualified suffrage of sane opinion trained in the school of
Milton	LOCATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Charles Newton-Robinson	PERSON	's songs , named by a pretty fancy '' The Viol of Love '' -LRB- reference being had to the harmonies and sympathetic vibrations characteristic of that instrument -RRB- , are musical enough , and suffused with passion ; they err at times , as do Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's although not in like de - gree from excessive indulgence in conceits , and the striving for effect by strange verbal devices .

		We reproduce the first and last stanzas of '' Love 's Messengers . '' ''

		Wind , happy river !

		to the sea , Whereby she dwells who loves not me , And waft her from this inner moat The spoils that on thy waters float , My messengers to be 1 '' Wind , happy river !

		to the sea , And bear these messengers for me .

		But if no kind reply comes back Ere swallows take their southern track , Myself thy spoil will be ! ''

		A few translations close the volume , whereby the author shows himself a bold man , for he ventures on
Horace	PERSON	, Book I. , Ode 5 , and
Villon	PERSON	's '' Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis , '' challenging comparison with
Milton	PERSON	and
Rossetti	PERSON	.

		A real Laureate and a would-have-been Laureate contribute to the verse of the year , Mr.
Alfred Austin	PERSON	publishing ''
England	LOCATION	's Darling , '' a dramatic poem concerned with
Alfred the Great	PERSON	, while Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	gives us '' The Tenth Muse '' -LRB- being the
Muse of Journalism	ORGANIZATION	, hight Ephemera -RRB- with other poems .

		Mr.
Austin	PERSON	has chosen to deal with the great king of the West Saxons because he has always been the chosen hero of the English people , although hitherto unsung in fitting measures .

		We may also shrewdly suspect that Mr.
Austin	PERSON	has not been un - mindful of the `` Harold '' and `` Becket '' of his great predecessor , and has sought to emulate so noble an example .

		The best to be said of '' En - gland 's Darling '' is that it is the conscientious ex - pression of a genuine enthusiasm .

		But the verse is unfailingly pedestrian , and a single page of '' Har - old '' outweighs the whole of the later work .

		We may quote the closing words of
Alfred	LOCATION	, spoken after he has come to terms with the heathen , and made the settlement of the Danelagh in 878 . ''

		In this strong isle sequestered by the sea From tread outlandish , victory upon ground Our own to keep or lose , is half defeat ; For why on English soil should foe 's foot stand ?

		The battlemented Sea will beat him off , So we but man it , and our bounding prows Scatter him flying deathward o'er the foam , Like loose leaves harried by autumnal wind .

		Aye , and in those bright bodings that high Heaven Vouchsafes at times to man , my ken foresees That once this land , inviolably free From threat without , its billow-suckled breed , Yearning beyond the narrow bonds of birth , Wherever shine the stars or rolls the tide , Will lay their lordship on the waves , and be Ilulers and rovers of the widening world . ''

		Mr.
Austin	PERSON	's poem upon the death of Lord
Tenny	PERSON	- son also appears in this volume .

		Of Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	's volume there is not much to say .

		It includes some widely-reprinted verses upon the death of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, a number of Oriental pieces , mostly translations , and the ode which gives
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 211 to the collection a title .

		Of the
Muse Ephemera	ORGANIZATION	the author writes in this top-lofty fashion : '' And if , indeed , her hand Wieldeth no fiery brand To strike oppression down , stay the wrong-doer , Chastise the wicked law , And guilty plunder draw From wealthy robbers , and be swift pursuer Of crime and guile ; alway , To seize , and smite , and slay , Muses !

		this plumed quill which she doth bear Is keener in the strife , Strikes closer to the life , Than sword of Themis , or Athene 's spear . ''

		This is not poetry , of course , nor is anything else contained in the volume , but it passes for such with some readers , and will not , in all probability , go quite unadmired .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Sketches of
Paris	LOCATION	under the Terror . ''

		The Journal of a Spy in
Paris	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is the partly conjectural title affixed by the publishers to what we presume to be a newly discovered , or at least hitherto unpublished , fragment of a diary kept by an eye-witness of the dramatic scenes in
Paris	LOCATION	under the Terror , during the awful months of
January	DATE	to
July , 1794	DATE	, or from the enactment of the Maximum Laws down to within a week of the 9th of Thermi - dor .

		The fragment seems to be genuine , and the publishers assure us that it is so .

		Assuming this to be the case , the little book is of considerable interest to students of the period . ''

		Raoul Hesdin '' is the name written upon the brown-paper cover of the original ; and
Hesdin	PERSON	seems to have been employed as an engraver , under the
Committee of Public Safety	ORGANIZATION	, occupying a room in the
Tuileries	LOCATION	, near to that in which the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	itself sat .

		That he was a secret agent of the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	seems probable .

		Hesdin 's diary is brimful of vivid little pen-sketches of the ruling spirits of the day , Robe - spierre , St. Just ,
Collot	PERSON	,
Billaud	PERSON	, Bare 're ,
Hubert	PERSON	, and so on , and his trenchant comments , and bits of floating political gossip , seem to bring us wonder - fully near to the times .

		That he '' supped full of horrors '' during those wild days , his pages often testify .

		Here is a statement which the reader may usefully compare with Chapter X. of Volume II .

		of Mr.
Morse Stephens	PERSON	's in many respects admirable `` History of the French Revolution '' : `` I often wonder if people outside
France	LOCATION	are aware of the utter disappearance of gaiety which has accom - panied this Revolution . ''

		It may be remembered that Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	's work contains the following re - markable sentence : '' It is most essential to grasp the fact that there was no particular difference , for the vast majority of the population , in living in
Paris	LOCATION	during the Reign of Terror and at other times . ''

		Speaking of
Robespierre	LOCATION	's manner in the tribune ,
Hesdin	PERSON	says that his discourses '' are always of interminable length and dulness , only relieved by vague threats levelled at some group of persons , seldom or never at an individual .

		He has a terrible habit of stopping ; just as you think him about to descend , he fixes his lenses to his eyes more firmly , takes a furtive look round , and goes on again . ''

		De - scribing the crowning Utopian gambol of that strange era , the Feast of the
Supreme Being	ORGANIZATION	, the diarist concludes : '' If , when the Statue was unveiled ,
Robespierre	LOCATION	had sprung onto its pedestal , declared the Revolution closed , and claimed the crown of
St. Louis	LOCATION	from over a bristling hedge of
General Hanriot	ORGANIZATION	's bayonets , the day would have been his .

		I know that many persons fully believed he would do so . ''

		The political information in
Hesdin	LOCATION	's book is meagre and unimportant ; but as a picture by an intelligent eye-witness , whose special business was to see and hear , of the social condition of
Paris	LOCATION	dur - ing the period treated , it is of no little value .

		Two important Two books on Church history are books on of special interest to the
New Testa	ORGANIZATION	- church history .

		ment student > Dr > R g. Moxom 's '' From
Jerusalem	LOCATION	to Nicea '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- is one of a class with which the
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	lectures to which it belongs have already acquainted the reading public .

		It is neither a text-book nor does it embody the fruit of any large original investigations .

		Nevertheless , it is written in an entertaining , simple style , and shows wide reading and admirable arrangement .

		Especially in its chapter upon the organization of the early Church has the author given an exceed - ingly compact and distinct r6sum6 .

		The latter por - tion of the period is covered with considerable de - tail , the Christian school of
Alexandria	LOCATION	coming in for an entire lecture .

		Such an arrangement may be justified by the importance of
Clement	PERSON	of Alexan - dria and Origen , but it is a question as to whether or not the perspective and the proportion of the treatment have not somewhat suffered .

		The chapter upon the struggle between heretical sects is , per - haps , the least satisfactory , being hardly more than a series of short , disconnected articles upon heretics of greater or less importance .

		Also , in describing the struggle of the Church with heathenism , the au - thor has allowed the necessity of the lecturer 's interesting his audience to lead him , perhaps , to treat Tertullian at a little too considerable length .

		Nevertheless , the work is admirably conceived , and in the concluding lecture upon the
Council of Nicaea	ORGANIZATION	gives probably as good an account of that remark - able Council as is to be found within equal compass .

		A little hand-book by Professor
Rudolph Sohm	PERSON	, entitled '' Outlines of Church History '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has a peculiar excellence of being a
Church	ORGANIZATION	history written by a Professor of Law .

		Such a prepara - tion for the
Church	ORGANIZATION	historian is unique , yet altogether necessary if one would have a correct comprehen - sion of those tremendous struggles through which the
Church	ORGANIZATION	has passed and in which the points at issue were hardly more often theological than legal .

		The fact that this work has passed through eight editions in less than six years is in itself testimony 212 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, to its worth , and , in fact , it is especially in the Mid - dle Ages and in the Reformation period that it is possessed of singular excellence as a text-book .

		It is a matter of regret , both in the case of Dr.
Moxom	PERSON	and in this of Professor
Sohm	PERSON	, that we have no references to authorities , and that , therefore , the reader and the student are given no means of deter - mining the worth of a judgment or the basis of a statement .

		Professor
Sohm	PERSON	seems further , in his paragraph upon the society of our day , to take a somewhat pessimistic view of affairs .

		But we can - not help agreeing with him that the forces of re - form , and , indeed , those forces which are to preserve what is good in our civilization , are to be found not in a culture based upon a materialistic conception of life , but in those other forces which are religious , and , more particularly , which are the expression of the Gospel .

		And it is upon this basis that both his - tory and criticism are enabling faith to found itself .

		A certain great art-critic wrote in his 2L earlier da y s something aboutthe man who has treated life in the spirit of art . ''

		He did not have in mind the exuberance or ex - cess which his expression might suggest to some peo - ple ; he was thinking of a thoughtful effort after a fine personality , of an exquisite regard to one 's own har - monies , of a view of life as a chance for a '' master - piece , '' in the old-time sense .

		He thought , perhaps , though he was long before them , of such triumphs as Lord
Reggie	PERSON	of '' Green Carnation '' fame , of that book-billed narcissus , of our friend
Tubby	PERSON	, of Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	's man of fine negations .

		Of no such fan - tasies , however , was Mr.
Robert Grant	PERSON	thinking when he wrote `` The Art of Living '' -LRB-
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , but rather of the far more practical matters of in - come , dwelling , children ,
summer	DATE	vacations .

		The aesthetic soul will look at the book with a bitter sneer . ''

		The Art of Living , '' says Mr.
Grant	PERSON	, '' writ - ten without a notion of what Art is , or what is Life . ''

		In a way , certainly , the very idea of ex - pounding the Art of Living to a man with an income of from seven to eleven thousand dollars , excites a slight smile .

		Or else it seems a little sad that a clever man like Mr.
Grant	PERSON	should have so misun - derstood Art and Life as to imagine that house - furnishing and the
summer	DATE	problem had any con - nection with either of them .

		But when one glances at his book one begins to have a certain altruistic pleasure that at last someone should have taken pity on that awful creature , the
Philistine	LOCATION	with the eleven-thousand dollar income .

		Of course he is too limited to do anything in the way of living , or of art either , and of course , with his painful misunder - standings , Mr.
Grant	PERSON	could not tell him anything about either of them ; but when one thinks of what his real state must be , one can see that this book offers practical amelioration .

		So even the aesthete , if he really have that philanthropic warmth which does so much to give a fine toning to an artistic character , may well be glad at this attempt to hold out to a neglected middle class some aims which are not in the wrong direction , some ideals which will not seem too high .

		We have much in American life , to-day , that should be otherwise ; it makes one uncomfortable to think of it all .

		One way of deal - ing with it is by going abroad .

		Another way is by woman 's clubs , art interchanges , popular magazines ,
summer	DATE	schools .

		Another way , namely , that of Mr.
Grant	PERSON	, a man whose vision has a pretty broad range , is to indicate without nonsense or cant certain ways in which even a man with an income of from seven to
eleven thousand dollars	MONEY	can rid himself of some of the grasping and hindering clutches of custom and convention , and infuse into his existence some little whiffs of what he will soon come to recognize as life . ''

		That Dome in Air '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- is the ha ?

		py title of a volume of e88avs '' thoughts on poetry and the poets '' by Mr.
John Vance Cheney	PERSON	.

		In the intro - ductory chapter , Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	says some good and true things about the relation of poetry to life .

		He then proceeds to a series of special studies , their subjects being
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Longfel	PERSON	- low ,
Bryant	PERSON	,
Whitman	PERSON	,
Blake	PERSON	,
Cowper	PERSON	, and Words - worth .

		These papers are pleasant , discursive , almost familiar in tone , the reflection of a cultivated mind that loves literature , and likes to talk over with friends the books it has been engaged upon .

		Pi - quancy of style and a wide range of illustrative ma - terial are noticeable throughout this volume , while the criticism is usually sane and genial .

		We must , however , except from this general statement a part of what Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	says concerning Whitman .

		When we consider some of the extravagant things that English critics have said of
Whitman	LOCATION	, a certain amount of exasperation is pardonable in an Amer - ican critic with some sense of literary values , but Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	carries it too far .

		Whitman is vulner - able enough at other points , surely , to make unneces - sary an attack upon the immortal '' When lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed . ''

		Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	gives us a bald prose paraphrase of the first lines of that mag - nificent song , and then asks : '' Tried by any test or standard , what is there of poetry in the magisterial dithyrambs not in the prose version ? ''

		We can only rub our eyes in amazement at such a saying .

		But it is almost the only serious lapse of judgment in Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	's volume , and is offset by many a felicitous critical hit , all the more praiseworthy be - cause most of his subjects are well-worn , and the difficulty of finding new things to say correspond - ingly great .

		A successful Every serious student of Greek art handbook of has reason to be grateful to Mr.
E. A. Greek	PERSON	sculpture .


Gardner	PERSON	for his Handbook of Greek Sculpture '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , of which the first half has now appeared , while the remainder is expected to follow within the present year .

		The work is on a comparatively small scale , the present volume con - taining only 266 small octavo pages , but it is as far as possible from being slight in character .

		Mr.
Gardner	PERSON	1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 213 is a young English archaeologist -LRB- but not too young -RRB- , whose training was of the rigorous
Cambridge	LOCATION	type , and whose opportunities , as Director for several years of the British School of Archaeology at
Athens	LOCATION	, added to great natural gifts , have qualified him in an eminent degree for his task .

		His conception of the office of a historian of Greek sculpture is a some - what severe one .

		The reader must not expect to be entertained by pleasant chat about the pieces of sculpture passed in review ; he will find a compact treatment of the technical and historical aspects of the subject , a treatment in which the line is sternly drawn between what is certainly known or highly probable and the audacious guesses of brilliant spec - ulators in archaeology .

		Such a book as this has been urgently needed .

		Mrs.
Mitchell	PERSON	's `` History of Animal Sculpture '' is already , after thirteen years , somewhat out of date ; moreover , praise - worthy and useful as her work was , it was after all the work of a conscientious compiler rather than of an independent authority .

		Murray 's '' History of Geerk Sculpture '' was partially revised for a second edition , published in
1890	DATE	, but it is expensive and its merits were never preeminent .

		As for other competing books in English , the less said about them the better .

		Mr.
Gardner	PERSON	's Handbook ought therefore to meet with great success .

		It should be added that the fifty-five carefully chosen illustra - tions contained in Part I. are most successful , so that the study of them is both instructive and enjoy - able .

		Even
Collignon	PERSON	's '' Histoire de la Sculpture Grecque '' does not , except for its heliogravures , reach so high a standard of excellence in this respect .

		The ^ ast ^ ve volumes of the
Stedman	PERSON	and
Woodberry	PERSON	edition of the com - plete WQrks of p oe ^ ^ & K j m _ ball -RRB- contain the literary criticism '' Eureka , '' and the poems .

		While much of Foe 's comment on the current writing of his day is of only temporary in - trinsic interest , Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	truly says that '' to the student of our native literature , and to the young American writer who would realize the conditions of the ' rude forefathers ' of his guild , an acquaint - ance with the following essays and sketches is little short of indispensable . ''

		To this definitive edition , with its index , its twelve portraits , and Mr.
Ster	PERSON	- ner 's numerous illustrations , Professor
G. E. Wood	PERSON	- berry has contributed the rather unsympathetic memoir and the valuable notes , the latter including an account of some of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's sources , references to the magazines in which the writings originally ap - peared , and , best of all , the variant readings of all the poems , as they grew more and more polished under their maker 's hand .

		The bibliography , too , needs only the addition of the host of critical arti - cles upon Poe to take rank with those models from the British Museum found in the '' Great Writers '' series .

		Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's essays introductory to the grand divisions of the work are justly appreciative , besides glittering with gems of expression .

		The essay upon the poems , with its sly thrust at the Completion of the definitive editionofPoe . ''

		down-east verdict '' of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's limitations , is mani - festly the work of a poet-critic , so fine is its discrim - ination , so happy its phrasing .

		To speak broadly of this editorial co-partnership , one member fur - nishes cultivated literary sensitiveness , and the other hard facts , the latter contribution being quite as use - ful as the former in work of this kind .

		On the whole ,
Poe	PERSON	is fortunate in having waited so long for an edition of his works that must please his con - scious shade , for nothing is here omitted or added for mere friendship 's sake , and we are fain to believe that this author needs no favors .

		A soldier and martyr of the Revolution .

		`` The Revolution , '' says
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, '' by the side of youthful figures of giants such as
Danton	LOCATION	, Saint-Just , and
Robespierre	LOCATION	, has young ideal figures , like Hoche and
Marceau	PERSON	. ''

		The `` Life of Francois-SeVerm Mar - ceau '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Captain
T. G. Johnson	PERSON	, is a pleasing , sympathetic sketch of the career of the brilliant , humane young soldier of the Revolution who sleeps at
Coblentz	PERSON	, his ashes honored alike by friend and foe .


Marceau	PERSON	, a soldier at sixteen , a gen - eral at twenty-three , a martyr to the liberties of his country at twenty-seven , was the
Sidney	PERSON	of his time , the
Bayard	PERSON	of the Revolution , meriting well the noble stanzas in which
Byron	PERSON	has enshrined the epitome of his deeds , the high tradition of his char - acter as one who in those stormy times `` had kept The whiteness of his soul ; and thus men o'er him wept . ''

		Captain
Johnson	PERSON	's sketch shows a right appreciation of his hero 's character , and a fair knowledge of events though the critical reader will note an oc - casional loose judgment , such as the unpardonable statement that the popular branch of the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	was composed of men '' actuated only by sordid hopes and a selfish ambition . ''

		To judge thus is to miss the essential drift and spirit of the epoch .

		With all their faults of self-confidence , inexperience , and boundless faith in the efficacy of legislation , no more disinterested and public-spirited elective body ever met to mend the affairs of a nation than the deputies of the
Third Estate	ORGANIZATION	in
' 89	DATE	.

		Captain
John	PERSON	- son gives an interesting sketch of
Marceau	PERSON	's cam - paigns , notably of those in La Vende * e , and shows a good knowledge of military matters .

		There are several maps , and a good portrait of
Marceau	PERSON	forms the frontispiece .

		_ Mr.
Greenough White	PERSON	is the author x English Literature -LRB- Gmn -RRB- , of which the first part , covering the period from Old English times to the accession of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, has just been published . ''

		To describe the process of mental de - velopment ; to determine the limits and character of literary ages ; to get at the basal principle of each successive age and trace its derivation from that which preceded it , '' have been the aims of the author , as stated in his own words .

		This programme at once suggests the work recently done by M. Jus - serand , for both writers conceive literature in a 214 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, larger sense than literary biography and criticism .

		It must be confessed that , in spite of the excellence of this fundamental conception , Mr.
White	PERSON	has not made a very readable book .

		When we think of
M. Jusserand	ORGANIZATION	's sprightly and charming style , we can realize something of the opportunity that the younger writer has missed .

		Mr.
White	PERSON	roams over the whole field of mediaeval history and literature in search of illustrative material , but does not seem to have the ability to make out of his facts , when collected , an organic structure .

		We are inclined to say that such a work , to accomplish its purpose , must be planned upon a far larger scale than has been selected in the present instance .

		Sir
Charles Lawson	PERSON	's '' Private Life pf
Warren Hastings	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an elaborate vindication of the character of the great ruler of
India	LOCATION	from the odium cast upon it by
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's brilliant but unfair essay , by the partisan history of Mill , by the famous invec - tives of
Burke	PERSON	and
Sheridan	PERSON	, and by the malignant charges of
Philip Francis	PERSON	.

		His public career has been examined by such competent men as Sir
John Strachey	PERSON	, Sir
James Stephen	PERSON	, Colonel
Malleson	PERSON	, and others , and the favorable judgments of these have fixed
Warren Hastings	PERSON	's honorable place in history .

		The present work is loaded with antiquarian lore that has very little interest for the general reader , and some of it very little connection with
Warren Hastings	PERSON	, but it is adorned with fine portraits and engravings , and with a multitude of smaller illus - trations and fac similes .

		Some of the chapters , es - pecially those on
Philip Francis	PERSON	,
Hastings	PERSON	's arch - enemy , and on the famous trial , are of great inter - est ; and the whole book shows the subject of it to have been an upright , generous , public-spirited man , though not without faults , whose life was embittered by the machinations of those whose evil doings he exposed , or whose plans he blocked .

		A new treat - Broad margins , white and gold cover , ment of the and clear print , make the Rev.
T. A. Song of Solomon	ORGANIZATION	.

		Goodwin 's
Lovers Three Thousand Years Ago	ORGANIZATION	, as Indicated by the Song of Solomon '' a delightful little volume externally .

		The author had a good purpose in his endeavor to rescue the Song of Solomon from the spiritualists and the alle - gorists who have disfigured it in the past .

		He takes away the immediate and direct religious element in the writing , and regards it as a love song simply , whose moral lesson is the triumph of pure love over lust .

		We must , however , confess that the writer 's biblical scholarship is poor .

		His introduction , ap - parently gotten second-hand from various radical critics , is a diatribe against what he calls '' plenary inspiration , '' by which he seems to mean '' verbal inspiration '' ; and he falls into such historical errors as assigning to
Ezra	PERSON	and
Nehemiah	PERSON	the rebuilding of the temple .

		With the main contention of the book , however , no lover of true biblical knowledge can fail to be in sympathy .

		-LRB-
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Dr.
Tille	PERSON	's '' German Songs of To - da y '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- gives a selection of the lyrics produced under the New Empire so far as they represent new conditions , new tendencies , new philosophies .

		It does not pre - tend , the editor admits , to picture the average taste of
Germany	LOCATION	for lyric poetry in these twenty-five years .

		Such a picture would include the mass of new production along old lines , together with the statistics of reading and consumption of the poetry previously in existence .

		But it will furnish students an opportunity to read as to how the distinctive features of modern life are trying to express them - selves in German poetry , and incidentally it will give some readers for the first time a view of cer - tain of these tendencies in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Tille	PERSON	's exposition and criticism of these tendencies in his Introduction is admirable .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Philosophers and critics will be glad to have Dr.
Paul Carus	PERSON	's selection of the best of Goethe and
Schiller	PERSON	's Xenions -LRB-
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and students of German literature will be grateful to one who thus ex - cuses them from reading all the product of the great poets ' little fight .

		But lovers of poetry will not now , any more than then , find refreshment in the Xenions .

		Dr.
Carus	PERSON	has translated well , and furnished a good brief Introduction .

		Can it be true , however , that the Xenions `` have become household words , '' and that '' there is no poetry more frequently quoted '' ?

		Mr.
G. Thorn Drury	PERSON	's edition of the '' Poems of
John Keats	PERSON	'' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , prepared for the '' Muses Library , '' is made singularly acceptable by its convenient form and tasteful manufacture , and its value for students of poetry is furthermore enhanced by the elaborate and thoughtful introduction contributed by Mr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	, a writer peculiarly fitted by tem - perament and poetical achievement to pluck out the heart of
Keats	PERSON	's mystery .

		The work is in two volumes . ''

		Considerations on Painting '' is the collective title of a series of lectures given by Mr.
John La Farge	PERSON	in
1893	DATE	at the Metropolitan Museum of
New York	LOCATION	, and now issued in a neat volume of 260 odd pages -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		It is a pleasure to find a professional painter discussing the various schools and theories and more or less burning questions connected with his art in so en - tirely critical and catholic a spirit as that shown by Mr. La Farge in these admirable lectures .

		Some interest - ing notes and memoranda of lessons are appended .

		The book will be largely read by intelligent art students and amateurs ; and the general reader will find it lucid and entertaining .

		The
Chautauqua-Century Press	ORGANIZATION	has begun the pub - lication of two series of pamphlets entitled the '' Way - side Course '' series and the '' New Education in the Church '' series .

		Each number in these series is a short study of some special subject , made with educational intent .

		In the first series we have '' Studies in Amer - ican Colonial Life , '' by Dr.
E. E. Hale	PERSON	; `` Studies in Physical Culture , '' by Dr.
J. M. Buckley	PERSON	; a booklet of selections from American literature , and a tract entitled '' How to Study History , Literature , the Fine Arts . ''

W. F. Moulton	PERSON	; and `` The Golden Rule in Busi - ness , '' by Mr.

		Mr.
E. W. Coy	PERSON	's '' Latin Lessons '' -LRB-
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- combines elementary grammar with selections from ''
Viri Romse	PERSON	, ''
Nepos	PERSON	, and Csesar .

		The same publishers also send '' Stories from Aulus Gellius , '' edited by Dr.
Charles Knapp	PERSON	.

		Mr.
H. Heathcote Statham	PERSON	's '' Architecture for Gen - eral Readers '' -LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has passed into a second and revised edition .

		It is an admirable book for the general reader , treating of theory and history in about equal measure .

Alfred Edersheim	PERSON	's '' History of the
Jewish Nation	ORGANIZATION	after the Destruction of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	under Titus '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- has been prepared under the supervision of the Rev.
Henry A. White	PERSON	.

		The work , in its original form , dates from

		A third edition of Messrs.
Lindley	PERSON	and
Widney	PERSON	's ''
California	LOCATION	of the South , '' first published in the days of the great '' boom '' of
1887	DATE	, brings the work up to date , and affords the visitor or intending settler an invaluable compendium of facts , presented in readable and attract - ive arrangement .

		Messrs.

Philip J. A. Harper	PERSON	, the senior member of the firm of
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, died at his home in
Hempstead	LOCATION	,
L. I.	PERSON	, on the 6th of
March	DATE	.

		He was born in
1824	DATE	, and had been connected with the firm which bears his name since
1842	DATE	, having been a partner in the house since
1869	DATE	, when he took the place of his father ,
James Har	PERSON	- per .

		Mr.
Harper	PERSON	retired from active business life some years ago .

		An extremely attractive new edition of the '' Decline and Fall , '' edited by Professor
J. B. Bury	PERSON	, is to mark the
Gibbon Centenary	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work will occupy seven volumes , and the editor 's name warrants the belief that it will be at all points abreast with the latest and most accurate scholarship .

		The volume now published -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- is delightful in paper , print , and binding , and in every way worthy of the masterwork of literature which it sets out to reprint .

		Judge
Hughes	PERSON	, the well-known and widely-beloved author of ''
Tom Brown	PERSON	's Schooldays , '' died on the 22d of
March	DATE	, at the age of seventy-three .

		Everyone knows that he was a boy at Rugby , and that he established the Rugby colony in
Tennessee	LOCATION	.

		Not so many are acquainted with his career as a member of Parliament from
1865	DATE	to
1874	DATE	, and as an occupant of the bench from
1882	DATE	to the time of his death .


Chicago	LOCATION	owes him a peculiar debt of gratitude for his collection from English authors and publishers of the several thousands of volumes that formed the beginning of her great Public Library .

		His service in this matter , coming just after the Great Fire of
1871	DATE	, was as timely as it was graceful , and has always been warmly appreciated .

		His writings include , besides the
Tom Brown	PERSON	books , '' The Scouring of the White Horse , '' '' Alfred the Great , '' '' A Layman 's Faith , '' and several other publications .

		In an editorial article in its issue of
March 21	DATE	, '' The Publishers ' Weekly '' says : '' There is no name in the annals of the American book trade more justly honored than that of Putnam .

		The founder of the publishing house bearing that name
George Palmer Putnam	PERSON	may not , in the ordinary acceptation of the term , have been a very successful business man ; measured , how - ever , by the devotion of his whole life to the encourage - ment and development of literature and to its dissem - ination , his was an eminently successful career ... 216 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, The missionary spirit which dominated the elder Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's life he transmitted in full measure to his children .

		Few American families can show in the sec - ond generation a more useful working altruism than that which dominates the lives of these children
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	and his brothers in the firm ;
Herbert Putnam	PERSON	, now at the head of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	; Mrs.
Mary Putnam-Jacobi	PERSON	, one of the two women who first stormed the doors of the French Academy of Medi - cine , and opened them to her sex , and whose career in the practice of medicine and as a writer has been most noteworthy ; and Miss
Ruth Putnam	PERSON	, whose literary work has been much more extended and helpful than the volumes bearing her name would show not to speak of other brothers and sisters whose names are less publicly known . ''

		Apropos of the literary work of the elder son , the article adds : '' Already the author of an authoritative work on
The Question of Copyright	ORGANIZATION	' a subject on which his father in
1840	DATE	published what is regarded as the first pamphlet written by an Ameri - can on the subject as well as a practical manual for authors and publishers ,
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	has more recently , through an important work on ' Authors and Their Public in Ancient Times , ' and a forthcoming work on Books and Their Makers During the Middle Ages , ' become the historian of the book trade from its earliest beginning . ''

		248 THE TRIUMPH OF THE NOVELIST .

		During the greater part of the nineteenth century the novel has been the most distinctive of literary forms .

		Historians of literature have so amply recognized the fact and critics have so copiously moralized over it that the subject has become almost as hackneyed as that of the weather .

		The Puritan prejudice against novel - reading , once almost as potent as the
Moham	PERSON	- medan injunction against graphic portrayal of the human form , has so completely vanished from the general consciousness of the public that we look with curious wonder at the belated preacher who still here and there voices a pro- test that would have found much support a generation or two ago , and that now falls upon absolutely unheeding ears .

		We read novels nowadays as a matter of course , just as we go to the theatre and eat mince pies , although all of these practices were condemned by the sterner morality of our forefathers .

		And not only do we read novels without compunctions of con - science , but we are actually encouraged to read them by those to whom we look for intellectual and spiritual guidance .

		Our high schools and colleges prescribe courses in novel-reading , and our clergymen take them as texts for their ser - mons in a sense very different from that in which they used to be taken by gentlemen of the cloth trained in the traditions of an older school .

		While nineteenth-century readers have been , as a class , almost universally addicted to the fiction-habit , there is no reason for thinking that the readers of the twentieth century will be any the less so addicted .

		Philosophical critics sometimes tell us that the novel will run its course and be replaced by something else , just as the drama and the poem and the essay have at other times and in other lands run their respective courses , and lapsed from favor .

		But these critics do not give us any very definite forecast of what the coming literary fashion is to be , and the novelist meanwhile snaps his fin - gers at all such iconoclasts .

		He simply keeps on producing what the public wants , with small regard for the opinions of those who tell us what the public ought to want .

		He has ridden upon the top wave of prosperity to the very verge of a new century , and it is his evident intention to carry into that century the prac - 226 -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, tice of the arts whereby his conspicuous for - tunes have heretofore been achieved .

		Nearly all the prizes of the literary life come to him , and he finds it very pleasant to have them .

		Yachts and villas and other expensive luxuries are within his reach , and he looks down with patrician pride upon the poor poet in his garret , or upon the mere thinker whose intellectual work is done in the hours that can be spared from the uncongenial toil upon which he must depend for subsistance .

		A reflective person , contrasting the posi - tion of the popular novelist with that occupied by the scholar whose strenuous pursuit of truth receives but slight recognition from his gener - ation , can hardly refrain from a certain indig - nation at so unequal a distribution of the gifts of fortune .

		The fiction-writer who succeeds in catching the popular ear finds his path made easy ever thereafter .

		Intellectually he may be one of the feeblest of mortals , yet the halo of fame encircles his head for the time , and he may with comparative impunity wax oracular even upon subjects of which he is most densely ignorant .

		On the other hand the quiet thinker must struggle to get an audience , even for ideas which he is perhaps the best-qualified man in the world to express , and may count himself fortunate if his laborious days earn for him an existence of the most precarious and exiguous sort .

		He does , indeed , take comfort in the as - surance that his work is done for a posterity that will have forgotten the very name of the writer who now basks in the sun of popular favor , and in this faith may find strength to scorn the delights of the present day , but his task is none the less a thankless one , and the age is none the less dishonored that makes it such .

		Think , for example , of what the world has done for Mr. Rider Haggard and Mr.
Her	PERSON	- bert
Spencer	PERSON	.

		A few novels , considered as lit - erature almost beneath contempt , have earned for the one many times over what has been earned for the other by the forty years that have gone to the building up of one of the most imposing and substantial edifices of thought ever added to the possessions of mankind .

		Doubtless , this material view of the reward of effort is not the only view that should be taken , but the lives of most men are so hedged about by material limitations and conditioned by ma - terial necessities that it must be reckoned with in determining the balance of justice between every man and his contemporaries .

		If the triumph of the novelist were a condi - tion that concerned only the best producers , there would not be so much cause to rail at the degeneracy of an age that exalts the writer of fiction over literary workers of other classes .

		Fiction , at its highest , is one of the noblest of the arts , and it would be difficult to bestow recog - nition too generous upon a Scott or a Thack - eray , a Balzac or a Tourguenieff , a
George Eliot	PERSON	or a George Sand .

		But the deserved triumph of such writers is attended by an ab - surdly exaggerated estimate of the hosts of the undeserving .

		The whole mass of contemporary fiction benefits by the lift given the art by its masters , few in number as they are .

		And the best writers are by no means the most success - ful .

		Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	and Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	are far less popular than Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	and Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	, although the latter are mere bunglers , while the former , for all their perversities , are artists of distinctive genius .

		The attitude of our present-day public towards fiction-writers as a class encourages the notion that anybody knows enough to write a novel , and this notion , which might otherwise be harmless enough , is made perniciously effective by the publishers , who make it possible for almost anybody to get a novel printed .

		And so we have every year new novels by the hundreds , by the thousands , novels that have not the slightest claim upon any gen - uine intellectual interest , preposterous inven - tions that can only blunt the artistic sense of those who are foolish enough to read them , exploitations of every variety of diseased fancy and perverted imagination , guides to the con - duct of life by young persons who know noth - ing of life themselves , books written with no higher aim than amusement that are too dull even to achieve that aim , productions of incom - petent scribblers who might have found honest employment in farming or in housekeeping , and made their activities of some real use to society .

		Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, in a recent magazine article , draws an ingenious parallel between the art of novel-writing and the game of whist .

		Dr. Pole recognizes four stages in the evolution of whist , the Primitive Game , the
Game of Hoyle	ORGANIZATION	, the Philosophical Game , and the Latter-day Improvements .

		Four stages , not dissimilar to these , may be recognized in the evolution of the novel .

		Professor
Matthews	PERSON	dubs them the Impossible , the Improbable , the Probable , and the Inevitable stages .

		The `` Arabian Nights , '' `` Les Trois Mousque - taires , '' '' Vanity Fair , '' and '' The Scarlet Let - ter , '' are given as examples of the four kinds of fiction .

		But , just as all four forms of the game are still practised by different sets of
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 227 players , the later having failed to displace the earlier ones , so all the four forms of fiction are still produced by different sets of writers , and each still finds its own public .

		The parallel is interesting , and reasonably justified by the facts , but its formulator should have added that there is , and always has been , a fifth kind of fiction , corresponding to the variety of whist known as bumblepuppy .

		And our pride in the developments that the art of fiction has unques - tionably made during the last half - century must be considerably tempered when we reflect that the great mass of modern novels comes from writers who do not play the game in accordance with the rules of any system , primitive or phi - losophical .

		In a word , the ascendancy of fiction in our latter-day literary production is not alto - gether the mark of a heightened appreciation of art .

		The triumph of the novelist is , to a consid - erable degree , a triumph of ineptitude over abil - ity , of lower over higher ideals , of slovenly over painstaking workmanship , of incoherence and disproportion over measured and organic art .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		THE RED BADGE OF HYSTERIA .

		-LRB- To the Editor of
THK	ORGANIZATION	DIAL . -RRB-

		Must we come to judge of books only by what the newspapers have said of them , and must we abandon all the old standards of criticism ?

		Can a book and an au - thor , utterly without merit , be puffed into success by entirely undeserved praise , even if that praise come from English periodicals ?

		One must ask these questions after he has been se - duced into reading a book recently reprinted in this country entitled '' The Red Badge of Courage , an
Epi	ORGANIZATION	- sode of the American Civil War . ''

		The chorus of praise in the English papers has been very extravagant , but it is noticeable that so far , at least , the
American pa	ORGANIZATION	- pers have said very little about the merits or demerits of the book itself .

		They simply allude to the noise made over it abroad , and therefore treat its author as a , coming factor in our literature .

		Even THE DIAL 'S very acute and usually very discerning critic of contem - porary fiction -LRB- Mr.
Payne	PERSON	-RRB- treats the book and the au - thor -LRB- in your issue of
Feb. 1	DATE	-RRB- in very much this way that is , as a book and an author to be reckoned with , not because of any good which he himself finds in them , but because they have been so much talked about .

		The book has very recently been reprinted in
America	LOCATION	, and would seem to be an American book , on an Amer - ican theme , and by an American author , yet originally issued in
England	LOCATION	.

		If it is really an American produc - tion one must suppose it to have been promptly and properly rejected by any American publishers to whom it may have been submitted , and afterward more natur - ally taken up by an English publisher .

		It is only too well known that English writers have had a very low opinion of American soldiers , and have always , as a rule , assumed to ridicule them . ''

		Black - wood 's Magazine '' is quoted by a recent writer as saying during the War : '' We can not even pretend to keep our countenance when the exploits of the
Grand Army	ORGANIZATION	of the Potomac are filling all
Europe	LOCATION	with inextinguishable laughter , '' and adds '' we know not whether to pity most the officers who lead such men , or the men who are led by such officers '' -LRB- Vol .

		90 , pp. 395-6 -RRB- .

		And again , in
January , 1862	DATE	: '' Englishmen are unable to see anything peculiarly tragical in the fact that half a million of men have been brought together in arms to hurl big words at each other across a river '' -LRB- Vol .

		91 , p. 118 -RRB- .

		Again , in
April , 1862	DATE	, '' Blackwood '' tells us that Americans '' do not demand our respect because of their achievements in art , or in literature , or in science , or philosophy .

		They can make no pretence to the no less real , though less beneficent , reputation of .

		having proved themselves a great military power '' -LRB- Vol .

		91 , p. 534 -RRB- .

		And in Oc - tober ,
1861	DATE	, `` Blackwood '' said exultantly : `` The ven - erable Lincoln , the respectable
Seward	PERSON	, the raving editors , the gibbering mob , and the swift-footed warriors of Bull 's Run , are no malicious tricks of fortune , played off on an unwary nation , but are all of them the legiti - mate offspring of the Great Republic , '' and is '' glad that the end of the
Union	LOCATION	seems more likely to be ridic - ulous than terrible '' -LRB- Vol .

		90 , p. 396 -RRB- .

		We all know with what bitterness and spitefulness the ``
Saturday	DATE	Review '' always treats Americans ; and with what special vindictiveness it reviews any book upon our late struggle written from the Northern stand - point .

		And so it is with all British periodicals and all British writers .

		They are so puffed up with vain-glory over their own soldiers who seldom meet men of their own strength , but are used in every part of the world for attacking and butchering defenseless savages , who happen to possess some property that Englishmen covet , that they can not believe that there can be among any peoples well-disciplined soldiers as gallant and cour - ageous as their own .

		Under such circumstances we can not doubt that '' The Red Badge of Courage '' would be just such a book as the English would grow enthusiastic over , and we can not wonder that the redoubtable ''
Saturday	DATE	Re - view '' greeted it with the highest encomiums , and de - clared it the actual experiences of a veteran of our War , when it was really the vain imaginings of a young man born long since that war , a piece of intended real - ism based entirely on unreality .

		The book is a vicious satire upon American soldiers and American armies .

		The hero of the book -LRB- if such he can be called '' the youth '' the author styles him -RRB- is an ignorant and stupid country lad , who , without a spark of patriotic feeling , or even of soldierly ambition , has enlisted in the army from no definite motive that the reader can discover , unless it be because other boys are doing so ; and the whole book , in which there is absolutely no story , is occupied with giving what are supposed to be his emotions and his actions in the first two days of battle .

		His poor weak intellect , if indeed he has any , seems to be at once and entirely overthrown by the din and move - ment of the field , and he acts throughout like a mad - man .

		Under the influence of mere excitement , for he does not even appear to be frightened , he first rushes madly to the rear in a crazy panic , and afterward plunges forward to the rescue of the colors under exactly the same influences .

		In neither case has reason or any intelligent motive any influence on his action .

		He is throughout an idiot or a maniac , and betrays no trace of the reasoning being .

		No thrill of patriotic devotion to cause or country erer moves his breast , and not even an emotion of manly courage .

		Even a wound which he 228 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, finally gets comes from a comrade who strikes him on the head with his musket to get rid of him ; and this is the only '' Red Badge of Courage '' -LRB- ! -RRB-

		which we dis - cover in the book .

		A number of other characters come in to fill out the two hundred and thirty-three pages of the book , such as '' the loud soldier , '' '' the tall sol - dier , '' '' the tattered soldier , '' etc. , but not one of them betrays any more sense , self-possession , or courage than does '' the youth . ''

		On the field all is chaos and con - fusion . ''

		The young lieutenant , '' '' the mounted offi - cer , '' even '' the general , '' are all utterly demented be - ings , raving and talking alike in an unintelligible and hitherto unheard-of jargon , rushing about in a very de - lirium of madness .

		No intelligent orders are given ; no intelligent movements are made .

		There is no evi - dence of drill , none of discipline .

		There is a constant , senseless , and profane babbling going on , such as one could hear nowhere but in a madhouse .

		Nowhere are seen the quiet , manly , self-respecting , and patriotic men , influenced by the highest sense of duty , who in reality fought our battles .

		It can be said most confidently that no soldier who fought in our recent War ever saw any approach to the battle scenes in this book but what wonder ?

		We are told that it is the work of a young man of twenty-three or twenty-four years of age , and so of course must be a mere work of diseased imagination .

		And yet it con - stantly strains after so-called realism .

		The result is a mere riot of words .

		Although its burlesques and caricatures are quite enough to dismiss it from attention , it is worth while to give some samples of its diction to show that there is in it an entire lack of any literary quality .

		Notice the vio - lent straining after effect in the mere unusual associa - tion of words , in the forced and distorted use of adjec - tives .

		Notice , too , the absurd similes , and even the bad grammar .

		Startling sentences are so frequent they might be quoted indefinitely ; but here are a few : '' A brigade ahead of them and on the right went into action with a rending roar .

		It was as if it had exploded '' -LRB- p. 45 . -RRB- ''

		The lieutenant of the youth 's company was shot in the hand .

		He began to swear so wondrously that a nervous laugh went along the regimental line .

		The officer 's profanity sounded con - ventional .

		It relieved the tightened senses of the new men .

		It was as if he had hit his fingers with a tack hammer at home '' -LRB- p49 -RRB- . ''

		Another -LSB- mounted officer -RSB- was galloping about bawling .

		His hat was gone , and his clothes were awry .

		He resembled a man who has come from bed to go to afire .

		The hoofs of his horse often threatened the heads of the running men , but they scam - pered with singular fortune .

		In this rush they were apparently all deaf and blind .

		They heeded not the largest and longest of oaths which were thrown at them from all directions '' -LRB- p. 51 -RRB- .

		`` The battle reflection that shone for an instant in the faces on the mad current made the youth feel that forceful hands from heaven would not have been able to have held him in place if he could have got intelligent control of his legs '' -LRB- p. 52 -RRB- . ''

		A small thrillful boy '' -LRB- p. 53 -RRB- . ''

		The cartridge-boxes were pulled around into various po - sitions , and adjusted with great care .

		It was as if seven hun - dred new bonnets were being tried on '' -LRB- p. 53 -RRB- . ''

		Buried in the smoke of many rifles , his anger was directed not so much against the men whom he knew were rushing to - ward him as against the swishing battle phantoms which were choking him , stuffing their smoke robes down his parched throat '' -LRB- p. 57 -RRB- . ''

		There was a blare of heated rage '' -LRB- p. 58 -RRB- . ''

		The officers at their intervals rearward ... were bobbing to and fro roaring directions .

		The dimensions of their howls were extraordinary '' -LRB- p. 59 -RRB- .

		`` To the youth it was like an onslaught of redoubtable dragons .

		He became like the man who lost his legs at the approach of the red and green monster .

		He waited in a sort of horrified , listening attitude .

		He seemed to shut his eyes , and wait to be gobbled '' -LRB- p. 68 -RRB- .

		`` A crimson roar came from a distance '' -LRB- p. 82 -RRB- . ''

		With the courageous words of the artillery and the spite - ful sentences of the musketry mingled red cheers '' -LRB- p. 85 -RRB- . ''

		The youth had reached an anguish when the sobs scorched him '' -LRB- p. 94 -RRB- . ''

		They were ever up-raising the ghost of shame on the stick of their curiosity '' -LRB- p. 104 -RRB- .

		`` The new silence of his wound made much worryment ' r -LRB- P. 124 -RRB- .

		`` The distance was splintering and blaring with the noise of fighting '' -LRB- p. 139 -RRB- . ''

		... began to mutter softly in black curses '' -LRB- p. 201 -RRB- . ''

		His corpse would be for those eyes a great and salt re - proach '' -LRB- p. 215 -RRB- .

		It is extraordinary that even a prejudiced animus could have led English writers to lavish extravagant praise on such a book ; it is still more extraordinary that an attempt should be made to foist it upon the long - suffering American public , and to push it into popularity here .

		Respect for our own people should have pre - vented its issue in this country .

		There may have been a moderate number of men in our service who felt and acted in battle like those in thia book ; but of such deserters were made .

		They did not stay when they could get away : why should they ?

		The army was no healthy place for them , and they had no reason to stay ; there was no moral motive .

		After they had deserted , however , they remained '' loud soldiers , '' energetic , and blatant , and they are possibly now en - joying good pensions .

		It must have been some of these fellows who got the ear of Mr.
Crane	PERSON	and told him how they felt and acted in battle .

		EXTENSION AND INTENSION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The sole purpose of the present brief screed is to suggest a modification in the general method of con - ducting Summer Schools , and in the work of those Ex - tension centres which give several courses during a sin - gle year ; possibly , also , in the reading system of the Chautauqua circles .

		Would it not be practicable , and wise , to concentrate the studies of such a student-body , for at least a year , upon a single large but sufficiently limited topic in literature , history , or science ?

		The query is no doubt a mere familiar echo , but I hope to give it a more definite and practical tone .

		A syllabus might be carefully prepared as a guide for two or three months ' previous reading .

		The sum - mer 's -LRB- or winter 's -RRB- lecture courses should be given by men who are competent specialists , but still men of suf - ficiently wide and , let us add , sufficiently harmonious views .

		Each lecturer would , of course , offer his stu - dents a bibliography far more than sufficient for six months ' subsequent reading .

		In all cases where ex - tended reading is suggested , the varying needs of the trained or untrained , elementary and advanced students , should be carefully considered .

		Two books might suf - fice for some , while others could master twenty .

		A final examination -LRB- perhaps usually at Easter -RRB- , and a certificate for those passing it , should crown the work .

		This test might well consist in a goodly number of far-reaching general questions , from which the student need select but a small proportion .

		These could best be answered in the form of briefer or more sustained theses , prepared with the freest use of all the books or other assistance available .

		Personal correspondence ,
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 229 the travelling libraries , and every other aid possible , should be invoked by the isolated workers .

		This proposal is in the line of a familiar educational maxim : '' Know one thing thoroughly , and refer every - thing else to that . ''

		Certainly a year is all too brief for the full attainment of any such ideal : but a far greater continuity would be reached than is now even attempted .

		In some cases a second year 's work would grow naturally out of the first ; e. g. , in history , after a study of the French Revolution and Napoleonic era , the present conditions in European political life might be out - lined in a second campaign .

		Similarly , ''
Rome	LOCATION	under the triumvirates '' would lead naturally to `` The condition of mankind as organized under the early Roman empire . ''

		Possibly a truly encyclopaedic course , continued through a long series of years , might measurably cover at least the chief lessons of the past , as handed on to the life of the present .

		Thus , for belles lettres , in eight or ten succes - sive years , Homer , Greek drama , Latin poetry of the first century B. c. ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, French classical drama , the school of
Weimar	LOCATION	, and the other greatest masterpieces of foreign literatures , might be read carefully by all , in translation , and discussed in philosophic spirit by those who best know each poet in his own especial en - vironment , and in his original voice .

		Those who realize most fully the continuity of his - tory , also , may be no less willing to throw a brighter light , in succession , upon the heroic , the picturesque , the car - dinal epochs in the long story of man 's life on earth .

		Perhaps three or more widely diverse courses let us say one in literature , one in history , one in science might be presented simultaneously , and a few students , exceptionally well prepared by previous training , or enjoying a larger leisure , might be free to elect two , or even three .

		The working out of such a scheme in de - tail , and the preparation of the courses , would require the united efforts of an entire academic faculty , at least , if not a selected national body of scholars .

		Yet it seems necessary even here to add tentatively a few illustra - tions , if only to bring the proposed plan fairly under discussion .

		In science , such a general topic as origin of species , or the theory of heredity , aerial navigation , or the ap - plications of electricity in locomotion , or the possibility of organic life on the other planets , could perhaps be made the centre about which much general instruction in biology , physics , or descriptive astronomy could be given , even to students not trained for advanced special studies .

		Competent teachers of those branches must decide how far they can be profitably pursued outside the laboratories of a fully equipped university .

		The writer confesses , however , that he shares the feeling in favor of history -LRB- including civics , sociology , etc. -RRB- , and literature , as above all else the common ground for gen - eral interest and popular culture .

		These two subjects could indeed be pursued jointly , so as to throw a con - stant cross-light upon each other .

		Thus the Greek trag - edy and comedy , and the political life of
Athens	LOCATION	in the fifth century , or , still better , mediaeval
Italy	LOCATION	and
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's poem , might well be studied together .

		On the whole , however , a complete divorce might here be still better than union : for while the historical topics would perhaps be better chosen from modern epochs , literature must in every sense begin with the Greeks .

		If , however , as is natural , Homer were the centre of a first year 's work , a special series of lectures on pre - historic archaeological data , possibly another on the his - torical and chronological deductions from the poems , would be no less essential than some comparative dis - cussion of the '' Niebelungen '' and other early epics .

		We might well call to our aid all the scholars of
America	LOCATION	, in composing an adequate syllabus for every such course , and especially in preparing the thirty topics from which five to ten might be selected for the pass examination .

		These topics should be such as to encourage wide read - ing , carried on for definite ends .

		They should appeal skilfully also to the most varied interests and special predilections .

		Let me venture , in closing , to offer a few suggestions for such questions .

		They may serve also to illustrate the kind of specialism here advocated .

		No excuse will be needed for returning once again to the writer 's favorite field to seek examples .

		Thus a study of
Helen	PERSON	's character as she appears in the '' Iliad '' and '' Odyssey , '' in
Euripides	LOCATION	's tragedy , and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's ''
Faust	PERSON	, '' while quite large enough for the ma - turest specialist in comparative literature , could yet be attempted by any intelligent man or woman with
Palmer	PERSON	or Butcher and
Lang	PERSON	,
E. P. Coleridge	PERSON	's prose or Way 's verse for Euripides , and
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	's masterly echo of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, in his hands .

		The use of the precious metals in Homer might interest the student of ethnology , of art , or of metallurgy .

		The comparative moral eleva - tion of gods and men in the '' Iliad '' might run into a discussion how far the divine element in the poem is mere tradition accepted from more savage ancestors , while Andromache and Hector are drawn with free hand as the refined poet 's own ideals .

		A thesis on the posi - tion of woman in epic , in tragedy , in real Athenian life , might reach down to a discussion of the new American woman of the present decade .

		It is not , I think , peculiarly important to limit the range of thought , at least in the popular education of adults ; but it certainly is desirable to focalize the atten - tion , to give a more robust and prolonged unity to home - study of every sort , to devise dignified and scholarly means to show the real progress made and the benefits derived .

		These pleonasms , blunders in the use of the relative , and similar results of haste , are sprinkled thickly throughout the book ; they characterize it .

		The arrange - ment of the matter is confused and repetitious .

		230 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, Nefo THE LETTERS OF ERNEST AND HENRIETTE REN AN .

		*
The Memoir of Henriette Renan	ORGANIZATION	which Lady
Mary Loyd	PERSON	has prefixed to her graceful trans - lation of
Henriette	ORGANIZATION	's correspondence with her brother is the reproduction of a pamphlet of which
Ernest Renan	PERSON	had a hundred copies printed in
1862	DATE	under the title , ''
Henriette Renan	PERSON	: A Memorial for those who knew her . ''

		Touching this pamphlet
M. Renan	PERSON	observes in his '' Souvenirs d'Enfance et de Jeunesse '' : '' The person who has had most influence on my life my sister Henriette scarcely appears in this work of mine .

		A year after the death of that beloved being I wrote a little pamphlet , consecrated to her memory , for the benefit of the few who had known her .

		My sister was so modest , her aversion to the bustle of the world was so extreme , that if I had offered these pages to the general public I should have fancied her casting re - proaches on me from the grave .

		... It seemed to me I should do as wrong by the insertion of these pages in a book placed on the open market , as if I exhibited her portrait in an auction room .

		The pamphlet will not be reprinted , therefore , till after I am dead . ''

		In a codicil to his will M. Renan authorized the present reprint , which was prepared by
Madame Renan	ORGANIZATION	, who also selected the letters .

		The Memoir is a beautiful and touching record of sisterly devotion and self-effacement , tinged perhaps with a little fond exaggeration of gifts and qualities to which the writer owed much .

		Henriette Renan was what may be termed a moral genius ; for genius is not of the intellect alone .

		Had circumstances permitted her to indulge her early bent towards the conventual life , the aureola of sainthood might well have been hers . ''

		She never , '' says her brother , '' knew any pleasures save those she drew from the practice of virtue and from the heart 's affections . ''

		Hers , in fine , was one of those rare souls which seem created to assure us that the moral impulse , the saving human capacity or tendency to make the pains and the joys of others one 's own , however lowly in its origin and as yet confined and imperfect in its manifesta - tion , is still capable of a boundless development that points to a hopeful future for the race .


Henriette Renan	PERSON	was born at Treguier in the year
1811	DATE	, her brother twelve years later .

		Her life was shadowed early ; and the natural mel - ancholy of her temperament left her little taste for lighter amusements , and even inspired her * BHOTHBK AJJD SISTER : A Memoir and the
Letters of Ernest	ORGANIZATION	and

		with a certain inclination to shun the world and its delights .

		Yet her modest withdrawal from the bustle and levities of life was remote enough from the ascetic Christian 's sour renunciation of the flesh .

		For her keenest pleasures -LRB- aside from those resting in good works and self - denial -RRB- still sprang from a rich appreciation of nature a fine day , a sunbeam , a flower , suf - ficing to delight her .

		And she had to the last , says her brother , despite a life replete with tears and toil and serious thought , now and then her charming womanly flashes . ''

		Her youth would return to her for the nonce ; she would seem to smile at life , and the veil that parted her from it would drop .

		These passing moments of en - chanting weakness , fleeting gleams of a dawn long past , were full of melancholy tenderness ... She loved life , she was full of good taste , she could smile over some womanly trifle as she would smile over a flower . ''

		At seventeen
Henriette	PERSON	embraced the career of a professional teacher '' the bitterest of all others . ''

		The tragic death of her father in
1828	DATE	-LRB- a sailor of the Republic , he met the fate of his calling , and lies buried beneath the sands near
Erqui	LOCATION	where the sea cast him up -RRB- left the little family in poverty .

		From that time forth , says
M. Renan	PERSON	, '' she looked upon herself as responsible for my future . '' ''

		Noticing my awkward movements one day , she per - ceived I was striving shyly to conceal the rents in a worn-out garment .

		She burst into tears .

		The sight of the poor child , destined to such black poverty , with in - stincts so removed therefrom , wrung her heart .

		She resolved to face the struggle with life , and undertook the task of filling up , by her unaided efforts , the abyss our father 's misfortunes had opened at our feet . ''

		How nobly she faced that struggle ; how her efforts were crowned at last with the modest triumph she craved the independence of those she loved ; how solely through her toil and self - sacrifice her brother was enabled to tread the path that led to his future fame , the Memoir eloquently sets forth .

		Constant study ,
M. Renan	ORGANIZATION	tells us , produced in his sister '' a prodigious mental develop - ment , '' and a corresponding modification of her early religious ideas .

		`` From history she learnt the insufficiency of any dogma ; but the fundamental religious sentiment , which was hers by nature , as well as by reason of her early education , was too deeply rooted to be shaken . ''

		Perhaps she passed into a phase of exalted deism , like that of the ''
Savoyard Vicar	ORGANIZATION	, '' which has singular attractions for natures like hers ; but her Catholic convictions certainly soon tot - tered to their fall .

		She inclined , says
M. Renan	PERSON	, '' to view the very clerical bent of my educa - tion with some regret . ''

		How soon she was
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 231 destined to learn from her brother the baseless - ness of that regret , the story of his own pain - ful progress in the thorny path of doubt in which she had outstripped him , and of his step - by-step relinquishment of the ecclesiastical ca - reer , those who have read his charming '' Sou - venirs '' already know .

		For ten years , from
1840	DATE	to
1850	DATE	,
Henriette	PERSON	was governess in a noble family in
Poland	LOCATION	; and it was during this period that most of the letters in the present collection were written .

		In them one may trace the progress of the mental change that finally impelled
M. Renan	PERSON	to renounce a career he could not in conscience follow .

		So early as
1844	DATE	he writes , after confessing the scruples that beset him regarding an impending step in his ecclesiastical advance : '' Amidst the lively controversies now occupying pub - lic opinion in this country , and which I look on as part of the frivolous pabulum indispensable to those whose passions need some special stimulant , ... I have suc - ceeded in forming an opinion -LRB- on religious societies -RRB- as far removed from the frantic declamation of those who love to see mystery where none exists , as from the ab - surd panegyrics lavished by those small minds who see the type of sovereign perfection in a very human insti - tution .

		Both parties seem to me equally ignorant of the two great laws of human nature : 1st .

		That whoever thinks to find a human work under whatever name , be it even that of Jesus Christ whatever its avowed object , even the saintliest whatever means , even the purest , serve its ends in which the human passions , their influence and their action , have no share , seeks the impossible .

		2nd .

		That whereas humanity eternally pro- gresses , and such institutions remain stationary , it inev - itably follows that those of one century must be out of harmony with the next , and that to attempt to keep them going is like trying to warm a corpse , and is a proof of extreme folly . ''

		In a letter of the following year he informs his sister that he has refused , for the time , to take the irrevocable step of becoming a sub - deacon .

		He continues : '' I do not remember ever having set forth the reasons which have made me cease to incline towards the eccle - siastical career ... Well , here it is in a nutshell .

		I do not believe enough .

		While the Catholic faith was the incarnation of all truth to me , its priesthood was in - vested in my eyes with a brilliant fascination , compact of dignity and beauty ... But all this time my brain was working desperately .

		Once roused , my reason de - manded its legitimate rights , which every time and every school have granted .

		Then I fell to verifying Christian truth on rational grounds .

		God , who sees the secrets of my heart , knows whether I did it faithfully and can - didly .

		Who , indeed , would dare to pass light and tri - fling judgments on doctrines before which eighteen cen - turies have knelt ?

		If I had any weakness to contend with , it was that I was favorably rather than hostilely inclined towards them ... But all had to give way when once I saw the truth .

		God forbid I should say Christianity is false ; that word would prove my intel - ligence very limited .

		Untruth could never bear so fair a fruit .

		But it is one thing to say it is not false , and quite another to assert its absolute truth , at least as those who profess to be its interpreters understand it .

		I shall always love it and admire it .

		... But when from this pure Christianity -LRB- which really is reason personified -RRB- we come down to the narrow shabby ideas , to all the mythical stories , that fall to pieces at the touch of can - did criticism ... '' In
1860	DATE	M. Renan accepted a scientific mis - sion to
Syria	LOCATION	, and his sister accompanied him thither .

		The journey was a source of keen en - joyment to her ; and the year , in fact , spent in the garden of the Orient where the perfumed atmosphere seems to thrill every living thing with its own buoyancy , spent , above all , in the hourly companionship of the brother who was as her other self , and from whom long years of exile had parted her , was '' the only one in her life which brought her no actual sorrow , and it was almost the only real reward she ever knew . ''

		But it was as the sunset glow before the dark ; for the night soon fell , and '' the harvest-hour , wherein men sit them down to rest and look back over the weariness and suffering of by - gone days , never struck for her . ''

		The stay in
Syria	LOCATION	was incautiously prolonged over the season dangerous to Europeans , and brother and sister were stricken with the deadly fever that haunts the coast .

		For one the end was come .


Henriette Renan	PERSON	died at
Amschit	LOCATION	, in the great room of a little native house where her brother lay the while unconscious , his life trembling in the balance .

		A grain of dust would have turned the scale against him .

		He woke from the long delirium only to learn of his loss that she who had dried his childish tears in distant
Brittany	PERSON	; who had smoothed his path from youth to manhood ; who had freely sacrificed her youth , her ease , her beauty , that he might live and thrive , was gone .

		To his re - peated questions they long replied , '' She is very ill '' ; at last they told him , * She is dead . ''

		Then his delirium came again , and with it kindly oblivion . ''

		I thought I was with her , as in a burning vision , at
Aphaca	LOCATION	, where the river Adonis rises under the huge walnut trees which hang above the waterfall .

		She was sitting by my side on the cool sward , I held a glass of icy water to her failing lips , and together we plunged into the life-giving
spring	DATE	, weeping , and borne down with over-mastering sadness .

		It was not till
two days later	DATE	that I recovered full consciousness , and that my disaster broke upon me in all its fearful reality . ''

		Henriette Renan rests in the little Syrian village where she died , near a pretty chapel shaded by palm-trees .

		Says her brother : '' I shrink from the idea of taking her from the beau - tiful mountains where she had been so happy ... Some day , of course , she must come back to me , but who 232 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, can tell what corner of the world shall hold my grave ?

		Let her wait for me then under the palms at
Amschit	LOCATION	, in the land of antique mysteries , by sacred By bios ! ''

		M. Renan eloquently concludes that God will not permit His saints to see corruption . ''

		Oh , heart that ever nursed a flame of tenderest love !

		Oh , brain , the seat of thought so exquisitely pure !

		Oh , lovely eyes , shining with tender light !

		Oh , long and dainty hand , so often clasped in mine !

		the thought that you are fallen away to dust thrills me with horror !

		... But sublunary things are all but types and shad - ows ... Personally I have never doubted the reality of the Moral Law .

		But now I see clearly that all the logic of the universal system must come to naught if such lives as hers were nothing but a delusion and a snare . ''

		Are , then , sainted lives like Henriette Re - nan 's indeed so rare ?

		Perhaps the earthly visits of such ministering angels are not so few and far between as we fancy ; for , alas , they usually remain unsung .

		* What multiplication of tasks can exhaust Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's superabundant leisure ?

		At his age , after his labors he might be expected to fold his hands and be thankful .

		Yet pile what you will on his shoulders , this aged Titan confesses no weariness , cheerily stoops to
Pelion	LOCATION	, makes no objection to Ossa , and holds out his hands for new burdens , dancing lightly and gaily under them all .

		It is an athlete 's triumph .

		Only a curmudgeon would question if such end - less tasks can all be well done , if the '' old par - liamentary hand '' may not busy itself beyond its power , if the whilome Prime Minister may not stuff his portfolio fuller than it can bear , if he may not go too far in making all knowl - edge his province , and run risk of incurring the modified epigram , Finance was his forte and omniscience his foible .

		But what a gallant spectacle it is of a brave fight against decrepi - tude , of one who has well earned rest , finding it in serious persistent labor .

		Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's present work is very obvi - ously useful .

		It is never too late for a better edition of a classic .

		There can be no doubt that this is the best extant edition of
Bishop Butler	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		hard to understand that it should have been left for anyone to undertake one hundred and fifty years after
Butler	PERSON	's death .

		The notes are per - haps none of them especially illuminative , Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's is not a profoundly philosophic mind ; but they are brief and unobtrusive , and point to the sources of
Butler	PERSON	's thought , or to the unnamed writers whom
Butler	PERSON	refuted .

		The editor is not anxious to parade himself but to elucidate a favorite author .

		The preface is in admirable taste , simply setting forth what the editor has sought to accomplish .

		Students of
Butler	PERSON	may well be grateful .

		When may we Americans hope for an edition of
Berkeley	LOCATION	or Pascal or
Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	from some ex - President of the
United States	LOCATION	or ex-Speaker of the
Lower House	ORGANIZATION	?

		This is hardly the arena , nor is the present reviewer the person , for any strictly theolog - ical discussion .

		But a classic in theology , like a classic in any other department , has its place in literary history .

		And whatever the precise merits of
Bishop Butler	PERSON	's arguments , his posi - tion as a theological classic is secure .

		Men of all schools pay him willing or reluctant tri - bute .

		They like to quote him and claim his authority .

		Platonists like
Martineau	PERSON	feel called upon to deal with the Aristotelian mind of But - ler .

		Roman divines like
Newman	PERSON	do not hes - itate to point to the reading of
Butler	PERSON	as a turn - ing point in their history .

		Men like
Mark Pattison	PERSON	and
John Hunt	PERSON	and
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	yield him a foremost place among the thinkers of his age .

		Wits like
Walter Bagehot	PERSON	, wits and poets like
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, can not feel that the path is quite clear for the presentation of the most modern thinking until they have made a joust at this doughty champion and struck one ringing blow upon his shield .

		That must be solid work which affords shelter and tempts attack , which suggests fresh buttress - ing or bold battering to such various minds , after a century and a half since its original con - struction .

		The facts of Bishop
Butler	PERSON	's life may be briefly enumerated .

		It was in
1692	DATE	, the year of the battles of La
Hogue	PERSON	and of Steenkirk and of the massacre of
Glencoe	LOCATION	, that
Joseph Butler	PERSON	, the son of a dissenting shopkeeper at
Wantage	LOCATION	in
Berkshire	LOCATION	, came to his birth .


William III	PERSON	.

		was on the throne .

		There was as yet no
National Debt	ORGANIZATION	, which began in
1693	DATE	, and no
Bank of England	ORGANIZATION	, which was founded one year later .

		Newton 's '' Principia '' had been but a few years before the world .


John Bunyan	PERSON	had lately died .


John Locke	PERSON	had just
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 233 issued the third Letter on Toleration .

		Gay , Pope , and
Richardson	PERSON	were in the nursery .

		La
Fontaine	PERSON	was still living and
Voltaire	PERSON	was not yet born when
Butler	PERSON	entered on the world .

		It was rather a dismal world for a thoughtful and melancholy mind to enter .

		It was a period of perfunctory service in the Church and of corruption in the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Public affairs were unsettled , the succession to the English throne hardly secured .

		The lax morals of the restora - tion period had infected all society , and effaced the strong impress which Puritanism had left upon the national conscience .

		The melancholy of
Butler	PERSON	's mind may well have been intensified by the narrow lot and perverse age in which he found himself .

		From an early period he evinced rare gifts .

		Before leaving school at
Gloucester	LOCATION	, he entered into correspondence with the leading theologian of his time , acutely criticising his proof of the ex - istence of God .

		Already he had seen his course before him and designed `` the search after truth to be the business of his life . ''

		In such a quest the broad roominess of the English es - tablishment attracted him , and after prepara - tion in a Presbyterian school , where the future Archbishop
Seeker	PERSON	was his companion , he over - came his father 's scruples , and in 1714-15 en - tered
Oriel College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
University	ORGANIZATION	had not altogether emerged from mediaeval influences , and
Butler	PERSON	complained of the '' friv - olous lectures and unintelligible disputations '' which he encountered there , and had thoughts of migrating to
Cambridge	LOCATION	where he might fancy tradition would be less oppressive .

		Grad - uated , and ordained both Deacon and Priest in
1718	DATE	, he was soon appointed preacher at the Rolls .

		There he remained seven years , part of the time being also Rector of
Houghton	LOCATION	.

		He was seven years more in the rich living of Stan - hope , then Chaplain to Lord Chancellor Tal - bot , and in
1736	DATE	Clerk of the Closet to Queen
Caroline	PERSON	.

		In that year he published the Anal - ogy .

		The Queen , a woman of vigorous mind and lively intellectual curiosity , was especially interested in theological speculation .


Horace Walpole	PERSON	says , '' Her understanding was uncom - mon strong .

		She wished to be a patroness of learned men , and her chief study was divinity . ''

		At her death she commended
Butler	PERSON	to
George the Second	ORGANIZATION	, who made him Clerk of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's Closet , then Bishop of
Bristol	LOCATION	, and also Dean of
St. Paul 's	ORGANIZATION	, and finally in
1750	DATE	raised him to the richest of the English sees , that of
Durham	LOCATION	.

		It was a little earlier that the prim - acy of
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	was offered him , which he de - clined on the ground that it was too late for him to try to prop a falling Church .

		At
Durham Butler	ORGANIZATION	delivered a charge to his clergy , which urged upon them decent reverence for the out - ward forms of religion , and the preservation of the sacred fabrics in which religion is enshrined .

		As he had ventured also to erect a marble cross in his chancel , it seemed good to the narrow protestantism of his time to suspect him of Romish tendencies , and even to set on foot a rumor , absolutely without foundation , that he had died in the
Roman Communion	ORGANIZATION	.

		His some - what melancholy mood , his somewhat ascetic habit , his readings in the lives of the Saints , were confirmatory evidence .

		It was easy to slander a court favorite , after he was gone .

		He died in
June , 1752	DATE	.

		He was unmarried , and
Bagehot	PERSON	humorously declares that the only wo - man he is known to have spoken to was Queen
Caroline	PERSON	.

		Few persons so high in station , so remark - able in endowments , are so little known .

		The correspondence with Dr.
Clarke	PERSON	, the Sermons , the Analogy , the Charge , the successive ecclesi - astical promotions , these are his history .

		Pre - ferments tumbled upon him without his effort or concern .

		He had a certain sense of his worth , and rather indicated in his acceptance of the see of
Bristol	LOCATION	, that it was not altogether equal to his deserts .

		It is hard to picture him at the Queen 's suppers or about the
King 's Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		His native melancholy was mildly tem - pered by a love of building and of stained glass .

		His house at
Hampstead	LOCATION	was gay and even ele - gant .

		He spent more than he could well afford on his first rectory , and on his palace at
Durham	LOCATION	laid out the greater part of his income .

		He was a generous and cheerful giver .

		The peculiar madness of
Butler	PERSON	's time was a widespread conviction that the Christian Church was a decrepit survival and the
Chris	PERSON	- tian religion a confessed fraud or delusion .

		The age was corrupt and unimaginative .

		It had nothing but eyes to see with .

		Its very poetry was witty and sparkling prose .

		Its morals were pure utilitarianism .

		Its bald mo - tive was self-interest .

		It was an age of hard drinking and hard swearing and hard living .

		So far as it believed in religion at all , it was in a religion denuded of its mysteries , its awful sanctions , its redemptive forces .

		It was what was called natural religion by philosophers .

		It was called '' the religion of men of sense '' by men about town .

		It admitted God as con - structor of the universe and remote manager of events .

		Even
Voltaire	PERSON	felt the need of in - 234 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, venting a God if none existed , and took credit to himself for erecting a temple in his honor .

		But it was a God deprived of his highest attri - butes , a good-natured divinity , who meddled little with decent people 's business and could keep on terms with
Madame du Chatelet	ORGANIZATION	, a God who had once set the machine in motion and was disposed not to concern himself very closely as to how it ran , a faineant sovereign , who would think twice before damning people of distinction , a Judge whose Hell burnt low and whose Heaven was a realm of snug and comfortable self-indulgence , where the respect - able classes were admitted pretty much at their pleasure .

		Religion was not really extinct , the mass of mankind had some sense of Christian living , but what we have depicted seemed a sufficient religion for the gentlemen of the pe - riod even though these gentlemen were in orders .

		There was perhaps no time in English history when the clergy were held in so deserv - edly low esteem .

		If they were good they were ignorant of the world and slightly absurd , like
Parson Adams	LOCATION	; if they were bad they were coarse and brutal , like
Parson Trulliber	ORGANIZATION	.

		They might be keen politicians and more or less or - thodox divines , like Swift or
Atterbury	PERSON	.

		They might be triflers and would-be men of pleasure , like
Laurence Sterne	PERSON	.

		They might be bullies armed with polemic cudgels , like Bishop War - burton .

		But they were hardly expected to be spiritual and earnest , or valiant for the faith to which they owed their revenues .

		Zeal was out of place ; high enthusiasm , as in
Wesley	LOCATION	, fell under suspicion .

		Into that grotesque world
Butler	PERSON	found him - self launched with a very unusual outfit , a solid intellect , a sensitive conscience , sufficient learn - ing , and an ineradicable tendency to see things as they were .

		One great fact stared him in the face .

		How it might be in the rural districts , among the humbler folk , he did not perhaps stop to consider .

		His vision was penetrating , but its range was not wide .

		But in the upper class , among the courtiers and the men of the universities , the wits , the poets , the country squires , religion , as
Butler	PERSON	understood it , the religion of Christ as disciples in all ages have believed it , was ceasing to exist .

		Its moribund condition was less asserted than assumed , less argued about than taken for granted .

		To be sure , Swift in his cynical fashion could give certain reasons why it might not be best imme - diately to abolish it .

		But that it only existed by sufferance , for lack of strength gallantly to die , that it was '' now at length discovered to be fictitious , '' was '' an agreed point among peo - ple of discernment . ''

		Even
Butler	PERSON	's grave pen grows unconsciously humorous as he undertakes to prove simply '' that it is not so clear a case that there is nothing in it . ''

		Did ever theolo - gian set before him a more modest endeavor ?

		It is almost impossible not to see a twinkle in his eye as he adds that '' the practical conse - quence to be drawn from this is not attended to by everyone who is concerned in it , '' the purchasable politicians , the loose-living states - men , the worldly divines , the ribald rhymsters , or the hollow pleasure-loving women of society .

		Yet there was no twinkle in the eye or pucker about the lips at a dry pleasantry .

		Butler was dead in earnest , and the humor , however grim , was in the situation , not in the writer .

		The simplest statement was the deadliest satire .

		Butler is no enthusiast .

		When he confronted enthusiasm in the person of
John Wesley	PERSON	he found it '' a horid thing , '' and inhibited that great reviver of moribund religion from offi - ciating in his diocese .

		He is a man of cold sluggish intelligence , distrustful of the emo - tions , cautious to a fault , to whom the only access is along the avenue of reason , not the intuitive reason of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	, but the faculty that deduces exact conclusions from admitted premises , the strict logical and dialectical fac - ulty which employs observation , selection , judg - ment , and invention , but keeps under foot fancy , imagination , and feeling . ''

		Things are as they are , and the consequences of them will be what they will be .

		Why then should we desire to be deceived ? ''

		Butler never desired to be deceived , however gloomy and awful re - ality might be .

		There was little play to his mind or healthy diversity to its activity .

		If he ever read anything but ethics and theology and the lives of the saints , if he ever indulged a flight of fancy or an iridescent dream , if he ever employed the penetrative or discursive imagin - ation , if he ever gave loose to one ill-regulated emotion , or stepped a hair 's breadth beyond '' the diocese of the strict conscience , '' we have no record of any such excursion or divagation .

		If he ever wrote anything but letters and ser - mons , a charge and the Analogy , it was de - stroyed by his express order at his death .

		He rarely quotes , is rarely quotable .

		He scarcely ventures upon a figure .

		He is quite devoid of grace of style .

		He is never eloquent nor fer - vid .

		He rarely kindles your thought or fires your feeling .

		But he strikes straight at your conscience and goes home to your reason .

		Yet as you stand there and feel the sureness of your footing , you are disposed to resent the narrowness and aridness of the prospect .

		You are ready to confess and main - tain '' that it is not so clear a case about

		We are speaking of the Analogy , for , valua - ble as the Sermons are , the Analogy is
Butler	PERSON	's great monument .

		It is not to be judged as an abstract structure displaying ideal truth .

		It is an argument to the time and the men of the time .

		Its method is probable reasoning from analogy .

		Its assumption is that on which the skeptical thinkers of his time were agreed , the existence of an intelligent Author and Ruler of the outer world .

		Its audience is '' the gener - ality of those who profess themselves dissatis - fied with the evidences of religion , '' the aver - age man or woman of the world who will consent to follow a close argument couched in everyday language .

		It does not establish a demonstration , but only a presumption , that Christianity may be true .

		Its work is exposure of over-confident error .

		It deals not with the refined difficulties conceivable in a philosopher 's library , but with the objections encountered on the street , in the loose talk at the Queen 's little suppers , where great questions were always coming up and were apt to be insufficiently dealt with , and wrong conclusions suffered to pass by default .

		It is the well-pondered answer .

		to wild conjectures and witty sneers and half - earnest questions that
Butler	PERSON	had been often compelled to let go unnoticed , to the grief of his insistent conscience troubled by the idle strife of tongues .

		It is heavy artillery brought in play to disperse a hovering cloud of horse - men .

		Its aim is wholly practical , to meet the immediate peril of religion , as a bond between men and God , being set aside without sufficient consideration ; as
Bishop Halifax	LOCATION	well said , '' not to vindicate the character of God but to show the obligations of man . ''

		What
Wesley	PERSON	did by an appeal to the heart ,
Butler	PERSON	does by an appeal to the sober judgment and common conscience .

		His concern , like that of
Wesley	LOCATION	, is that religion may not perish from the earth .

		Butler is a classic in his kind .

		The Analogy is a masterpiece of reasoning , and will continue to train generation after generation of careful and just thinkers .

		The problems and methods of Aristotle are not precisely ours , but the Ethics and the Politics will not become obso - lete for some time to come .

		The '' circuitous and apparently awkward '' style of
Butler	PERSON	will continue to attract minds of a certain calibre .

		They will own that it is pedestrian always , with no flights of the eagle , not even impetuous trot - tings of the black pony , that it is sober toe-and - heel progression , one foot safely planted before the other is lifted to go on , but that it is pithy , condensed , idiomatic , and , to all patient stu - dents , clear .

		They will find themselves braced and disciplined by the perusal of works , '' so close in tissue , so profoundly charged with vital matter . ''

		They will cordially recognize that a recluse of the eighteenth century has still a mission for thoughtful men perhaps of the twentieth century also .

		They will imitate his method even if they have outgrown his conclu - sions .

		They will seek to be as candid , as pa - tient , as unconcerned as he to all personal con - troversy .

		They will hope to care as little for mere polemical victories .

		For nothing '' hurt ''
Butler	PERSON	'' but an abstract idea , '' and he returns its impersonal blows with only a sound ethical conviction .

		He made the search for truth , not for triumph , the business of his life .

Macmillaii & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		236 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, edition , struck the keynote of the movement that tends to the more sympathetic study of the masterpieces of English literature in our colleges .

		The little volume just published , en - titled '' The Voice and Spiritual Education , '' is an expansion of some of the ideas suggested in the previous book .

		With all the power that comes from a life-long study of the best litera - ture and a long experience of teaching , Profes - sor
Corson	PERSON	speaks to the educators of this country in no uncertain tones .

		He has a face - tiousness of expression that reminds one of
Lowell	LOCATION	; and in this book there are many bril - liant statements that might be quoted , but which must be omitted in this brief review .

		Spiritual education is necessary for the high - est vocal culture .

		Without this ability to re - spond to and assimilate the informing life of any product of literary genius , mere vocal train - ing avails little or nothing .

		This education is the very opposite of what generally passes for education : '' He would be the ideal teacher who could induce a maximum amount of edu - cation on the basis of a minimum amount of requirement . ''

		Knowledge may be developed at the expense of the interior divinity .

		Spir - itual education must be begun early . ''

		The child must fed before it can know '' The child must be considered as an impressionable being , and home-life must minister to his spiritual nature .

		Some very suggestive remarks are made on the reading of children . ''

		Upon the closed bud of reason , while it is not yet ready to be unfolded , must be brought to bear the genial warmth of sensibility , sympathy , and enthusi - asm . ''

		In the colleges and universities there must be the same appeal to man 's higher life ; all acquisition of knowledge must be made sub - ordinate to the one great aim of quickening life . ''

		To fit the soul to be spoken to by the eternal word , is the true , the ultimate object of spiritual education . ''

		With this spiritual training received in the home and college , with the power to see the hidden meanings of the author , the man or woman is prepared to undertake vocal culture .

		The author is very severe in his denunciation of modern `` elocutionary spouting '' `` The voice instead of being the organ of the soul is the betrayer of soullessness . ''

		He gives several amusing incidents of extreme elocution of the present day .

		There is nothing in the average elocutionist that is '' clamorous for expression , not even a very still small voice urging him to express something . ''

		The true vocal training can only be begun by one who is '' impelled to cultivate vocal power because of his desire to express what he has sympathetically and lov - ingly assimilated , of a work of genius . ''

		With this purpose in view , '' it is possible for the heaviest , clumsiest voice to be trained to the light touch . ''

		The student of vocal culture must by long years of study and practice get the mas - tery of articulation , wide range of pitch , all degrees of force , every variety of inflection , accelerated and retarded utterance , many qual - ities of voice , etc. .

		The author gives an inter - esting practical exercise in the '' light touch '' by marking a long passage from the Book of
Daniel	PERSON	.

		The writer of this review heard Professor
Corson	PERSON	say that twenty years of diligent prac - tice were required to give him the control over his voice that he now has .

		No one who has heard him read the plays of Shakespeare can fail to see how much there is in his contention for the highest kind of vocal culture .

		To hear him read is to remove all doubts as to his thorough knowledge of the subject which he treats in this book .

		The book will doubtless be widely read , and will have a wide influence in calling attention to the evils of so-called elo - cution and the need for a more rational culture of the human voice . ''

		The sweetest music is not in the oratorio , but in the human voice when it speaks from its instant life tones of tender - ness , truth , or courage . ''

		THE DIAL 237 friends awarded him hearty praise ; and the abuse of envious enemies enlisted the warmer attachment of his friends .

		But not in his gen - eration could a just discrimination assign to his labors , or to those of his co-laborers , their relative or comparative value or importance .

		Who could then have foreseen , for instance , the subsequent decision in the
Dartmouth College	ORGANIZATION	case , to be followed by a long train of adjudi - cations establishing corporate rights under char - ters ?

		Who could then have anticipated the desirability of ascertaining and locating the earliest assertion of the constitutional principle that a legislative contract is protected against legislative encroachment ?

		Who could have foreseen the judicial career of a
Marshall	LOCATION	, or have believed possible a civil war between the adherents of
Webster	PERSON	's constitutional views and the partisans of Calhounism ?

		The great crea - tive work of
Wilson	PERSON	as a constitutional jurist could scarcely have been assigned its true posi - tion in our juridical edifice at any time prior to the late war ; now , it may be .


James Wilson	PERSON	was a pioneer in more senses than one , and he planted the advanced posts of our modern jurisprudence in more than one field .

		His published works consist chiefly of his lectures on general American Jurispru - dence , delivered in the Law School of
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia in 1790-92 .

		These lectures are a body of general commentaries on the whole field of law ; anticipating
Kent	PERSON	's work as an American commentator , though not so minute or detailed as Kent 's .

		He was a philosophical jurist , given to a priori investigation , tracing principles to their sources , and testing them by the touch - stone of truth ; in this respect he anticipated not only
Austin	LOCATION	, but
Bentham	PERSON	also , with whom he was contemporaneously engaged in criticis - ing
Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	's praises of the English Consti - tution .

		The acknowledged ability of Mr.
Jus	PERSON	- tice
Wilson	PERSON	ensured him , as a lecturer , a large audience , among whom was the first President .

		His well-known views as to the essentially na - tional character of the Federal government , then a doubtful experiment in the minds of most Americans , were enforced in these lectures with a convincing logic that may well reassure the wavering now as it did then .

		Among our con - stitutional historians ,
Curtis	PERSON	assigns him a place '' as one of the first jurists in
America	LOCATION	'' ; and
Landon	PERSON	says , '' he surpassed all others in his exact knowledge of the civil and common law , and the law of nations . ''

		Such was no doubt the estimate made of him by the first President , who appointed him one of
the Justices of the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	at its organization ; for Wash - ington had long before sent to him his nephew ,
Bushrod Washington	LOCATION	, as a law student , ignor - ing in so doing the eminent lawyers of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		When
Wilson	PERSON	's untimely death checked pre - maturely the career of a great constitutional jurist , it was his former student , Bushrod Wash - ington , who was appointed to succeed him , by the second President , who thereby evinced his own appreciation of the preceptor as a jurist .

		More than any other of the Revolutionary leaders ,
Wilson	PERSON	seems now to have been the pioneer constitutional jurist , the first to clearly apprehend and to distinctly state many of the fundamental principles of the new political sys - tem .

		As early as
1774	DATE	, he declared that '' all men are by nature equal and free , '' in a pub - lished pamphlet on '' The Legislative Authority of the British Parliament , '' in which he demon - strated in a masterly way the want of such au - thority to legislate for the
American Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, fortifying his position by both historical and judicial precedents , and outlining the whole constitutional claim of the colonists to exemp - tion from Parliamentary taxation , and to recog - nition as fellow-subjects with the English , in allegiance to the same prince , and entitled to the same rights under the British Constitution .

		In a speech delivered in
January , 1775	DATE	, he enunciated the doctrine of the Declaration of Independence , that the King had violated the British Constitution by conniving at the usurpa - tions of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and proposed for adoption by the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Convention a resolution declaring that the act altering the
Massachu	PERSON	- setts charter , the
Boston	LOCATION	port bill , and the act quartering soldiers upon the colonies , '' are unconstitutional and void , and can confer no authority upon those who act under color of them ; that all force employed to carry such unjust and illegal attempts into execution is force without authority ; that it is the right of British subjects to resist such force ; and that this right is founded upon both the letter and the spirit of the British Constitution . ''

		The doctrine of the sovereignty of the people , as the true source of all political power , was early adopted by him , was embodied with his assent in the
Federal and State Constitutions	ORGANIZATION	, was enunciated in his argument in the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Convention in favor of the adoption of the
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eral Constitution , and was illustrated frequently in his lectures before the Law School , with a lucidity and fervor not surpassed in the opinion he rendered as a
Justice of the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	in the case of
Chisholm vs. Georgia	LOCATION	.

		He was 238 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, an earnest advocate of the dual system of gov - ernment ,
Federal and State	ORGANIZATION	, which was intro - duced by the Constitution of
1787	DATE	, and his expositions of its advantages were peculiarly distasteful to its opponents .

		The `` obligation clause '' of the
United States Constitution	ORGANIZATION	has been a bone of contention among jurists and students of the law .

		Learned lawyers have pertinaciously insisted that the f ramers of the Constitution never intended it to apply to grants by the legislature of charters of incorporation .

		Critics have denounced
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	of
1819	DATE	for having invented the idea , in the
Dartmouth College	ORGANIZATION	case , that a corporate charter was a legislative contract , which must be held inviolable just as a different legislative grant had been held in
Fletcher vs. Peck	LOCATION	.

		It is now known that at the very time when the legislature of
Georgia	LOCATION	repealed its grant of
1795	DATE	,
Hamilton	PERSON	stated his conviction that such legislation was a violation of the '' obligation clause , '' and predicted the decision in
Fletcher vs. Peck	LOCATION	, which was rendered after his death .

		It is now known , too , that
Wilson	PERSON	, to whom is generally ascribed the introduction into the Constitution of the phrase '' obligation of contracts , '' had , prior to such use of that phrase , announced positive and uncompromis - ing views on the subject of repeal of corporate charters .

		In a pamphlet published in
1785	DATE	, he considered the proposition that the legislature of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	should repeal the charter granted by it in
1782	DATE	to the
Bank of North America	ORGANIZATION	.

		Upon the broadest constitutional grounds , viewing the state legislature as un - hampered by any express restrictions upon its powers , he argued against the possession of any power by the legislature to repeal an act creat - ing a private corporation after its acceptance by the incorporators .

		Such a charter he de - clared to be `` a compact , to be interpreted according to the rules and maxims by which compacts are governed . ''

		This , the earliest known argument on the subject , shows the views of the man who introduced the phrase '' obliga - tion of contracts '' into our jurisprudence .

		The criticism is often made that while the decision in
Fletcher vs. Peck	PERSON	, as to a legislative grant of land , may have been sound , this by no means warranted the extension of the principle to grants of charters , as in the
Dartmouth Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege case .

		But
Wilson	PERSON	's argument , made two years before the Constitution was framed , antic - ipates both the ruling in
Fletcher	LOCATION	vs.
Peck	PERSON	and that in the
Dartmouth College	LOCATION	case , as a prop - osition inherent in constitutional jurisprudence .

		It seems impossible to doubt that this argu - ment was influential in shaping not only the views advanced by
Webster	PERSON	, the advocate , but those adopted by
Marshall	PERSON	and the other judges , in the great case in which that proposition be - came embodied in our system .

		The editor of this new edition of
Wilson	PERSON	's works has appro - priately emphasized this argument , now repro - duced , as not the least valuable of his contribu - tions to our constitutional precedents .

		If his only achievement had been his opinion in the case of
Chisholm vs. Georgia	LOCATION	,
Wilson	PERSON	would have thereby won distinction .

		During his term of nine years ' service as a
Justice of the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, very few constitutional cases were litigated .

		This one is the only ex - tended opinion pronounced by
Wilson	PERSON	as a judge ; but it is '' a lion . ''

		The great and fun - damental question arose as to the relative rank and place of the States and the Central Gov - ernment , in the American constitutional sys - tem .

		The court , with but one dissent , decided that the Constitution subordinated the states - to the nation , and subjected a state to the suit of a private individual .

		On the founda - tion of this decision rests the governmental fabric of the
United States	LOCATION	; for a contrary conclusion would have made the
Union	ORGANIZATION	but a rope of sand .

		Two of the judges ,
Jay and Wilson	PERSON	, were by previous training and study prepared to state their conclusions in opinions replete with juridical learning , and the opinions of both are constitutional landmarks .

		It is no reflection upon the great character and attain - ments of Chief Justice
Jay	PERSON	to say that his opin - ion is , in respect of scholarly diction and lucid - ity of reasoning , surpassed by that of his colleague
Wilson	PERSON	.

		The latter set to himself , in this decision , the task of answering the ques - tion , '' Do the people of the
United States	LOCATION	form a Nation ? ''

		This question is illustrated by copious classical , historical , and juridical ref - erences , presented with the vivacity of an earn - est debater , the answer constituting a thesis in which the broad observations of a scholar , the close analysis of a jurist , and the profound re - searches of a philosopher are happily united .

		The freshness of his diction relieves the arid - ity of a dry subject , without detracting from its juristic value .

		His distinctions between statehood and sovereignty , his terse assertions of the sovereignty of the people , his illustra - tions of the inherent characteristics and the high honor of that sovereignty , and his close analysis of all the governmental questions in - volved in the American system , might to-day
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 239 be well taken as a text-book by the student of our institutions .

		He found the people of the
United States	LOCATION	asserting by implication , in the
Federal Constitution	ORGANIZATION	, their sovereignty , and the implication sufficed him . ''

		In an instru - ment well drawn , as in a poem well composed , silence is sometimes most expressive .

		To the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	, the term sov - ereign is totally unknown .

		There is but one place where it could have been used with propri - ety .

		But even in that place it would not , per - haps , have comported with the delicacy of those who ordained and established that Constitution .

		They might have announced themselves ' sov - ereign ' people of the
United States	LOCATION	; but , se - renely conscious of the fact , they avoided the ostentatious declaration . ''

		In his lectures on jurisprudence ,
Wilson	PERSON	was not only original , but far in advance of his time ; for such a course of lectures , if now first presented , would attract wide attention , and be worthy the authorship of any jurist of the day .

		They are merely general in their character , traversing with broad sweep the field of juris - prudence .

		Their merit lies in their exposition of first and fundamental principles and in the lecturer 's fine analysis .

		Government , consti - tutions , laws , legislation , and the administra - tion of justice , are collated and connoted as parts of one system .

		Sovereignty is analysed and traced to its source in the individual man .

		In the mental characteristics and capacities of man are found the basic principles of not only the true conceptions of sovereignty and gov - ernment on the one hand , but of the rules of judicial evidence on the other .

		A full modern treatise on evidence might be based upon Wil - son 's admirable chapter on the subject , in which , on a priori principles , the lecturer dis - closes fourteen distinct sources of that informa - tion which the mind recognizes as evidence .

		Understanding of this classification is aided by the lecturer 's previous illustrations of thought , conception , belief , and judgment as operations of the mind ; and those illustrations are now seen to be not merely theoretical and discur - sive , but practical and pertinent .

		These lec - tures are not only modern in their style of treat - ment of the subject , an American anticipation of what has been called the English theory of jurisprudence , but they are thoroughly Amer - ican in spirit .

		The author 's terse definition of a constitution is , '' that supreme law , made or ratified by those in whom the sovereign power of the state resides , which prescribes the man - ner according to which the state wills that the government should be instituted and adminis - tered . ''

		His account of the history of former confederacies , including in the list not only those which became operative , but also the ideal confederacy of European powers which was the dream of
Henry IV.	ORGANIZATION	, shows the growth of the idea of confederacy as leading up to our pres - ent system of a
Federal Republic	ORGANIZATION	, and contrasts its excellences with the defects of all its pre - decessors .

		He expounds with some detail the characteristic features of the new American system , and patriotically contrasts the
Ameri	PERSON	- can and British Constitutions , to the disadvan - tage of the latter .

		His national feeling was so marked that he treated Federal and State Con - stitutions as together composing one system , a practice to which our jurists are now returning .

		It is not uncommon at the present day to exalt the
United States	LOCATION	system of government to high rank among the governmental experi - ments which the world has seen tried .

		A cen - tury ago , patriotic Americans hoped for the success of their new experiment , amid many forebodings and more doubts .

		But
Wilson	PERSON	, studying it in the light of history and with the insight of a philosopher , acquired a faith in its capacity which exceeded hope ; and , at its very inception , he deliberately recommended it to his fellow - citizens of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, in a public address , as '' the best form of government which has ever been offered to the world . ''

		This is not vain glorification of a fabric which Judge
Wilson	PERSON	had helped to erect , for he gives abun - dant reasons , at every step in his arguments , for the faith he entertains , and demonstrates the correctness of his conclusions .

		His writings deserve a place , as preliminary instruction in the fundamentals of our government , not only in every law school in the land , but in every institution which aims to assist in the study of
Government	ORGANIZATION	,
Civics	ORGANIZATION	, or Political Economy .

		POST-DARWINIAN THEORIES .

		* The second Part of the late Mr.
Romanes	PERSON	' ''

		240 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, ance of acquired characters ; the second dis - cusses the question whether or not all specific characters are to be regarded as adaptive .

		Thus in both is the common purpose to show that other causes have probably cooperated with
Natural Selection	ORGANIZATION	in Evolution .

		The author 's remarkable power of exposition renders this the clearest and simplest book that has appeared in the sphere of the problems it discusses .

		Its style is very refreshing in con - trast with much of the recent controversy on the question of acquired characters .

		It does not marshall the facts to illustrate a precon - ceived theory ; but asks what really are the facts , and then proceeds to question whether they are sufficient to warrant any fixed theoretic conclusions .

		While thus displaying through - out the scientific temper , Mr.
Romanes	PERSON	recog - nizes that the discussion of his fundamental problems must be carried on at present as a matter of general reasoning , since the facts are so complex , and our knowledge of them is in - adequate for a final conclusion .

		In his preliminary discussion of theories the author shows how unfair is the claim of
Weis	PERSON	- mann and his school that upon their opponents rests the burden of proof of the inheritance of acquired characters , while at the same time
Weismann	PERSON	refuses to recognize any evidence except in cases where it can be shown that nat - ural selection has not been present at all .

		He clears up the popular error which attributes to
Weismann	PERSON	the first doubting of the
Lamarck	ORGANIZATION	- ian factors in heredity ; showing that Mr.
Gal	PERSON	- ton in
1875	DATE	presented a theory of '' Stirps '' which led him to doubt entirely the presence of these factors , and that Mr.
Romanes	PERSON	him - self had still earlier been led to question them .

		In his '' indirect evidence in favor of the in - heritance of acquired characters , '' he deals chiefly with reflex actions ; such as the reflex mechanism of our own organization which en - sures the prompt withdrawal of the legs from any source of irritation applied to the feet ; and such as the mechanism in a brainless frog which enables it to preserve its balance on a book that is slowly revolved .

		The peculiar significance of these actions results from the fact that each is a complex coordination of functions in which the separate functions have no selective value ; and yet the coordination could never arise as the mere blending of adaptations .

		Hence it seems that
Natural Selection	ORGANIZATION	would have nothing to work with in such a case unless the complex coordination of functions sprang at once into full being .

		Some similar arguments are drawn from the sphere of Instinct , but much less stress is placed upon these since their bearing has been more fully recognized than in the case of inherited reflex actions .

		In his chapter on '' experimental evidence in favor of the inheritance of acquired charac - ters , '' he calls attention to the meagreness of the work that has been done ; and dwells par - ticularly on the observations of Brown-Sequard upon guinea-pigs ; the results of which were in a limited degree corroborated by his own experiments .

		He concludes that here , and in the case of some experiments with plants , the facts bear very strongly against
Weismann	PERSON	's hypothesis ; although they are admitted to be insufficient to prove the existence of
Lamarck	ORGANIZATION	- ian factors .

		Mr.
Romanes	PERSON	speaks with the authority derived from experiments carried on by him through a long period of years ; yet he frankly confesses that the results of his own work were chiefly negative , without being of such a conclusive character as to lead him to the point of view of
Weismann	PERSON	.

		The author 's conclusion is that while prob - ably there is a relative continuity of germ - plasm , we have every reason to doubt that this continuity is and always has been absolute ; and that
Weismann	PERSON	's theory of its absolute con - tinuity was constructed to support his extended system of speculative theory .

		It is certainly an interesting thing that the long discussion as to the inheritance of acquired characters has left the most of us at the point of view taken by Mr.
Romanes	PERSON	, feeling that acquired characters have much less importance in heredity than was formerly supposed , and yet probably do form an appreciable element in the whole problem of evolution .

		As
Weismann	PERSON	's theories are discussed in the first part of the book , so the views of
Wallace	PERSON	form the subject of criticism in the second part , although , the author observes , the individual in each case is selected only as the most noteworthy representative of the point of view opposed .

		He holds it to be a matter of fact that '' a large proportional number , if not a majority , '' of specific characters are of the class to which no use can be assigned .

		This is illustrated by the results of his study of color characteristics in birds and mammals .

		Hence he concludes that there is every reason to believe many specific characters to be indifferent , and the result of other causes than natural selection .

		Among these causes he considers climate , food , sexual selection , laws of growth , and isolation .

		Most of these latter factors may be summed up in
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 241 what Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	has called '' the survival of the existing . ''

		From a discussion of the different definitions of Species is shown the impossibility of secur - ing an absolute principle of classification .

		He suggests that the separation of specific charac - ters from variations on the one side and generic characters on the other , as being in a unique way the result of natural selection , is in part a result of the title of
Darwin	PERSON	's book on the '' Origin of Species . ''

		Hence the curious result that something like the earlier superstitious reverence for species which
Darwin	ORGANIZATION	's book was written to overthrow has resulted from the book itself .

		He makes it very clear that no definite line can be drawn between specific characters and other differentiated qualities . ''

		Bad '' species must always multiply at the expense of '' good '' species , since it is often our ignorance of inter - mediate forms which determines our classifica - tion of two known kinds as distinct species .

		Hence the effort of
Wallace	ORGANIZATION	to hold specific characters as always adaptive , while acknowl - edging that variations and generic and family forms may often be unadaptive , is reduced to an absurdity .

		This seems so entirely obvious that one is inclined to wonder at the space de - voted to it , but Mr.
Romanes	PERSON	says in his pre - face : '' From my previous experience of the hardness with which this fallacious doctrine dies , I do not deem it safe to allow even one fragment of it to remain , lest , hydra-like , it should re-develop into its former proportions . ''

		Certainly it is worth while to make entirely clear the fact that Evolution is a theory of the origin and cumulative development of adaptive characters , and not merely of species .

		On this basis the author proceeds to show that hence in the development of all adaptive characters Natural Selection must be at least the chief cause , but is by no means the only cause in determining species .

		The chief value of the book is as a keen criti - cism of unwarrantable theories .

		It is only indirectly constructive ; yet it is of great posi - tive value , since it clears the ground wonder - fully , and places us in a position to see the facts as they are .

		TRAVELS VARIOUS .

		* Mr.
D. G. Hogarth	PERSON	discourses lightly and pleas - antly in '' A Wandering Scholar in the Levant '' of varied experiences and impressions in the
Near East	LOCATION	.

		In his first two chapters we have an inter - esting account of a scholar 's adventures in copying inscriptions , collecting coins , and buying relics of the classic past in the land of the wily Turk ; the third chapter gives general impressions of
Anatolia	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Hogarth	PERSON	tells us that the Turkish peasant is a '' slow-moving , slow-thinking rustic , who limits his speech to three tenses out of the sixty-four in his language , and his interests to the price of barley . ''

		... In energy and intelligence he takes rank a grade below his dog . ''

		Mr.
Hogarth	PERSON	makes many suggestive remarks on the Armenian problem and on the problem of the Turk and his waning power .

		He says that the Turk '' Has lost heart himself .

		Already he foretells the sta - tions in the retreat of the Crescent-Stambul to
Brusa	LOCATION	, Brusa to
Aleppo	LOCATION	,
Aleppo	LOCATION	to
Bagdad	LOCATION	; and Moslem mothers tell their children that this or that will come to pass as surely as a cross will be seen again on
Santa Sophia	LOCATION	.

		And , be sure , the Turk will make no effort himself to arrest his own decay ; for as faith grows weaker , the original sin of fatalism waxes more strong that fatalism which has been mistaken so often for a symptom of Islam , but preceded it and will survive . ''

		Then follow chapters giving impressions of travel and research in the
Euphrates	LOCATION	region , in
Egypt	LOCATION	and in
Cyprus	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Hogarth	PERSON	's style is refined yet strong , and he has made an original and interesting vol - ume , and instructive withal , in which we learn some archaeology and politics , and more history and an - thropology .

		While certainly not a great book , yet it is a genuine book in its sketchy way .

		What has been the use of coming to
Africa	LOCATION	! ''

		Travelling by ox wagon seems neither an adven - turous or rapid or comfortable mode of transit .

		Certainly two and one-half miles an hour is twenty times too slow for the American , and a daily start at three
A. M.	PERSON	, bad roads , foul water , and other such incidents will hardly commend this trip to the tour - ist , though Miss
Balf	PERSON	our makes light of it all .

		How - ever , if Miss
Balfour	PERSON	had the pen of a
Stevenson	PERSON	she might make as interesting a book of her meagre experiences as he did of '' Travels with a Donkey '' ; but we must frankly confess that the style is as commonplace as the matter , though the simplicity and directness of the narrative is in a measure en - gaging .

		The drawings are very creditable .

		Captain
H. M. Chittenden	PERSON	's account of the Yel - lowstone Park is a book of information , a popular monograph and handbook , and the completest work of the kind yet published .

		It is prepared evidently with much care , and will be of service to tourists , and others interested in the subject .

		It has appendices giving the legislation on the
Park	LOCATION	, a list of appro - priations and of superintendents , an extended biblio - graphy , and a good index , but the illustrations do not add much to the book .

		As to the game in the Park we note the interesting remark : '' There are no fewer than 30,000 elk in the
Park	LOCATION	.

		For the buffalo , mountain sheep , and a few other varie - ties , the prospect is good , though not so flattering .

		The number of buffalo does not exceed probably two hun - dred , and the possibility of their early extinction has led the
Smithsonian Institute	ORGANIZATION	to allote a sum of money for the construction of a large inclosure in the
Park	LOCATION	, where at least a portion of the herd can be kept and be thus more carefully protected .

		Of the moose , moun - tain lion , wolverine , lynx , wild-cat , marten , and otter , the perpetuation is more doubtful . ''

		Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	has collected sketches of travel , most or all of which have appeared in the magazines , into a volume entitled '' Three Gringos in
Venezuela	LOCATION	and
Central America	LOCATION	. ''

		A '' gringo , '' be it known , is one who jabbers gibberish ; hence from the point of view of the scornful Spanish - American , all English-speaking travellers are gringos .

		Like Mr.
Davis	PERSON	's other books , this is bright and clever writing , though sometimes overdrawn , and some - times flippant with sophomoric smartness which might well be exchanged for serious fun and honest enthusiasm .

		But notwithstanding a hard manner - ism which at times makes itself unpleasantly felt , the book is both sufficiently entertaining and instruc - tive .

		We feel after reading it that the best thing for the so-called republics of
Central America	LOCATION	would be to come under the sway of the best administra - tors in the world , the English , and that
Cuba	LOCATION	as a republic could be only a failure .

		The illustrations from photographs are very good and interesting .

		Another book which concerns itself with
South America	LOCATION	is Mr.
J. R. Spear	PERSON	's '' The Gold Diggings of
Cape Horn	LOCATION	. ''

		The author frankly acknowledges that this is only a '' collection of newspaper sketches , '' and we might judge as much from internal evidence , for we find everywhere that eagerness to make a strong tale , if not o'er true , that striving for effect at almost any cost , which is apt to characterize newspaper writing .

		The title is a misnomer , as we find but some twenty pages on gold mining .

		Argen - tine
Patagonia	LOCATION	and
Tierra del Fuego	ORGANIZATION	and its people are the real subject .

		We learn that the country in its mining , ranching , and agricultural resources is fast being developed by immigrants of various na - tionalities , and that the native savage tribes are rapidly disappearing .

		Mr.
Spears	PERSON	glorifies the sav - agery of the Yahgan Indians and decries the mis - sionaries without stint .

		We may admit that this tribe is not of the lowest grade , but we should desire more full and scientific knowledge of their lan - guage of '' over 40,000 words '' ; and as to the debas - ing effect of the misdirected effort of the mission - aries , this was from his own statements far less hurtful than the brutalities of seamen and miners .

		The problem of savage life in sudden and close con - tact with civilization is certainly not solved by Mr.
Spear	PERSON	's easy laissez faire theory .

		The book im - presses us as a hasty , biased sketch , and mostly made from hearsay , the last chapter being almost the only bit of personal narrative .

		Still , as being a fairly well written description of a little-known country , it will interest the general reader , and be of service to tourists and investors . ''

		With

Chitral	LOCATION	, '' by Lieut.
W. G. L. Benyon	PERSON	, is correctly described by the author as '' an account of the daily life of British officers and In - dian troops on a frontier expedition ; how we lived and marched , what we ate and drank , our small jokes and trials , our marches through snow and rain , hot valleys or pleasant fields . ''

		This narrative of the relief of
Chitral	LOCATION	on the northwest frontier of
India	LOCATION	gives no striking incidents , and , told in the unemotional soldierly fashion , will hardly be of much interest to the American civilian .

		But whoever wishes to know the life of the common soldier and officer on an expedition among the mountains of the lower
Himalyan	LOCATION	region will here find it set down briefly in plain and blunt prose .

		The book is pro- vided with a serviceable map and some passable illustrations .


Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	's last book on
Japan	LOCATION	is entitled ''
Kokoro	PERSON	, '' that is , the heart , thus indicating the subject of the book , the emotional life of the Jap - anese as seen in their patriotism and religiousness , romantic love , and so on .

		Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	insists that
Japan	LOCATION	is now no closer emotionally to Western life than she was thirty years ago -LRB- p. 11 -RRB- , which , how - ever , he practically contradicts in saying -LRB- p. 37 -RRB- that the Japanese are even now feeling '' the new sentiment of aggressive egotism . ''

		Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	's prophecy for
Japan	LOCATION	is : '' The foreign settlements , as communities , will dis - appear : there will remain only some few great agencies , such as exist in all the chief ports of the civilized world ; and the abandoned streets of the concessions , aud the costly foreign houses on the heights , will be peopled and

		Large foreign investments will not be made in the interior .

		And even Christian mission - work must be left to native missionaries ; for just as Buddhism never took definite form in
Japan	LOCATION	until the teaching of its doctrines was left entirely to Japanese priests , so Christianity will never take any fixed shape till it has been so remodeled as to harmonize with the emotional and social life of the race .

		Even thus re - modeled it can scarcely hope to exist except in the form of a few small sects . ''

		Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	believes that the hope of the race is '' a Buddhism strongly fortified by Western science . ''

		It is everywhere obvious that our author is a pro- nounced Japophile , and so not capable of a thor - oughly critical and impartial treatment of his sub - ject ; yet his style is so skilful , and his appreciation of the Japanese character so intimate and thought - ful , that this slight work will be of interest and value to all who seek a better understanding of the new nation of the
Far East	LOCATION	.


HIRAM M. STANLEY	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Mr.
Joseph Jacobs	PERSON	's '' Jewish Ideals ,
SSS	ORGANIZATION	& t * and Other Essays '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a collection of thoughtful and schol - arly papers , mainly reprints , ranging over many problems which the peculiar position of modern Judaism has brought into prominence .

		This posi - tion Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	regards and elucidates from the standpoint of modern thought and culture , yet with due fidelity to Jewish history and the higher and worthier Jewish ideals and aspirations .

		Some of the titles are : `` The God of
Israel	LOCATION	, a history '' ; ''
Jehuda HaleVi	PERSON	, Poet and Pilgrim '' ; '' The Lon -
don Jewry	PERSON	, 1290 '' ; '' Little St.
Hugh	PERSON	of Lincoln '' ; '' Jewish History : Its Aims and Methods '' ; etc. .

		The so-called Jewish Question is touched upon briefly in a semi-humorous paper in which the writer en - deavors to show that the current ill-will against Jews is largely due to the '' over-intellectuality '' of their early education .

		We may infer from what Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	says on this point that the young Jew is virtually trained for life as for a wit-combat b , outrance no '' gentle and joyous '' passage-at-arms in which magnanimity , courtesy , and forbearance play their parts , but a keen struggle in which the great point is to win .

		Consequently we find , he thinks , that '' the absence of charm is as distinct a characteristic of Jews as the presence of capacity '' a proposition which may at least be excepted to as inapplicable to the fairer half of the race : the hardiest Anti-Semite will scarcely deny charm to the daughters of Judah .

		Following out his argu - ment , Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	hits upon what he cheerfully be - lieves to be a complete and feasible '' solution '' of the Jewish Question ; and this he embodies in the paradoxical advice to Jewish parents , '' Make fools of your children '' that is , we take it , make them foolish enough , or , if you will , Quixotic enough , to think that there are other and even better ends in life than material ones ; other virtues than '' sharp - ness '' ; other ways of regarding one 's neighbor than as primarily a competitor to be striven with .

		Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	's '' solution '' seems to us to be of much wider applicability and efficacy than he claims for it ; and we commend it to the notice of Gentile parents not excepting Anglo-American ones .

		``
Napoleon III	PERSON	. ''

		-LRB- imported by
Scrib	PERSON	- ners -RRB- is stm a ?

		.

		ther book of P ersonal chat and reminiscence from the pen of that cheery raconteur , Sir
William Fraser	PERSON	.

		Sir
William	PERSON	's capital volumes , ''
Disraeli	PERSON	and his Day , '' ''
Hie	PERSON	et
Ubique	ORGANIZATION	, '' etc. , are known as among the best of their kind ; and his latest venture shows no sign of flagging spirits or a depleted repertory .

		He knew
Napoleon	PERSON	personally -LRB- if , indeed , anyone can fairly be said to have known that inscrutable character -RRB- , and saw a good deal of him during the main phases of his career down to the closing days at
Chisel	LOCATION	- hurst .

		The portrait he draws of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	is a favor - able one , and he takes occasion more than once to contrast him with his uncle , not at all to the latter 's advantage .

		Sir
William	PERSON	has no doubt whatever that
Napoleon III.	PERSON	, after his downfall , intended to return to
France	LOCATION	, and to execute a coup d'6tat re - motely similar to his great uncle 's after the return from
Elba	LOCATION	.

		The details had been arranged .

		A private yacht was engaged to land the Emperor secretly on the coast of
France	LOCATION	, the plan being that he should proceed to the camp at
Chalons	LOCATION	, where a large army was assembled for the
Autumn	DATE	man - oeuvres .

		Declaring himself , he was to head this force , and march at once upon
Paris	LOCATION	.

		These facts the author had from the owner of the yacht which had been selected , the late
James Ashbury	PERSON	, who , adds the author , '' more than once mentioned the circumstance to me ; and he repeated it the evening before his death . ''

		The book is full of good stories and pen-portraits , and these are interlarded with the shrewd worldly-wise comments on notable men and events of one who has known both at first-hand .

		The term Hedonism is frequently used to designate a class of moralists who agree in holding that all human action is determined by the agent 's desire for his own pleasure , and that conduct is approved or dis - approved solely according to the relation in which it stands to the happiness of the person judging .

		This is not the only significance of the term , but certainly it may be used in this sense if desired .

		It is of these moralists that Professor
Watson	PERSON	writes in his little work , '' Hedonistic Theories from Aris - tippus to Herbert Spencer '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The de - scriptive portions are for the most part very well done .

		The exposition is always clear , logical , and , considering the limited space devoted to any one author , remarkably complete .

		The most serious errors are those by which
Hume	PERSON	and
Herbert Spen	PERSON	- cer are brought into the list of Hedonists as here 244 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, defined .

		Both of these writers affirm the reality of purely unselfish action in the strictest sense of that term .

		Accordingly Professor
Watson	PERSON	should either have omitted them entirely in his study , or else have broadened his definition of Hedonism .

		But unfortunately he has his own notions of what a man must believe who attributes value to pleasure for its own sake , as do both
Hume	PERSON	and
Spencer	PERSON	, and it is therefore perhaps no matter of surprise that in the presence of such an a priori theory the mere facts of history should be handled rather rudely .

		Apart from this , the presentation of Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's ethical views is one of the best that has ever been written .

		In the critical remarks to which the expo - sition always leads up , the specialist who is well read in the subject will find little that is new .

		Throughout they display that union of exceptional power of insight with a mania for discovering con - tradictions and scoring the maximum number of points from the enemy , which is coming to be char - acteristic of the school of
T. H. Green	ORGANIZATION	.

		The be - ginner for whom the book is evidently intended will probably be rather repelled than attracted by these tactics , while his patience will be sorely tried in at - tempting to follow intelligently certain portions of the reasoning .

		Professor
Watson	PERSON	is not as uniformly successful in making a popular presentation of his own views as he is in the case of his opponents .

		But the merits of the work in this latter respect are so exceptional that it may be cordially recom - mended to all those interested in the problems of ethics .

		General Sir
Evelyn Wood	PERSON	's '' Cav - ^ y ^ the
Waterloo	LOCATION	Campaign '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- forms a capital comple - mentary volume to the previously issued works in this series , '' The Decline and Fall of Napoleon '' and '' The Rise of
Wellington	LOCATION	, '' by
Viscount Wolse	PERSON	- ley and
General Lord Roberts	ORGANIZATION	, respectively .

		The three volumes together are a desirable addition to the critical literature of the
Waterloo	LOCATION	campaign .

		General Wood 's book has a certain advantage in freshness of theme , or rather of standpoint no author heretofore having applied himself specially to bringing out clearly and consecutively the cavalry operations during the four days ' fighting .

		It is to this point , and to brief sketches of the cavalry lead - ers on both sides , that the writer confines himself , telling only enough of the general story of the bat - tle to render his recital intelligible .

		The work is prefaced by a chapter on the organization of the French army , in which
General Wood	ORGANIZATION	shows the falsity of the common statement that
Napoleon	PERSON	had at
Waterloo	LOCATION	'' the finest army he ever commanded . ''

		About fifty per cent of the Line of the Emperor 's forces were recruits , mainly young and immature men ; and of the Imperial Guard , 18,500 strong , some 5000 were untrained men , and the balance were largely worn veterans of previous campaigns .

		Organization was imperfect , and discipline was lack - ing .

		The '' Iron Duke '' seems to have owed a very considerable share of his renown to the capricious Goddess of Chance .

		Had
Napoleon	PERSON	been
Napoleon	PERSON	on the day of
Waterloo	LOCATION	; and had he on that day commanded , instead of the somewhat Falstaffian array of recruits that made up half his army , the battalions organized by the iron genius of the great Carnot , it had undoubtedly gone hard with Welling - ton and
Blilcher	PERSON	.

		General Wood scouts the notion , not uncommon among English infantry soldiers , that , now that '' we possess a rifle which , when fired horizontally on level ground , propels a bullet through the air for five hundred yards without its rising more than five feet , '' the days of cavalry are prac - tically passed away .

		The lament over the fancied evanishment of the horse-soldier is an old one ; and many changes have been rung on it since
Hotspur	ORGANIZATION	's `` popinjay lord `` bewailed the advent of '' villainous saltpetre '' ; but the author notes that cavalry , so far from disappearing , is , since the war of 1870-71 , even growing somewhat in favor all the great Con - tinental Powers increasing the number of their mounted troops , and training them with greater care .

		The volume contains a number of maps and portraits .

		American Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	has literature for written '' An Introduction to Amer - young students .

		ican Literature '' -LRB-
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which is easily the best book for the use of the lower schools that has yet been produced upon this subject .

		It has the twofold virtue of not saying too much , and of putting in simple and forceful lan - guage the things that it does say .

		It offers easy reading for young students , yet is free from the vice of being obtrusively '' written down '' to the level of their intellectual appreciation .

		A baker 's dozen of writers are discussed in as many chapters , the selec - tion being
Franklin	PERSON	,
Irving	LOCATION	,
Cooper	PERSON	,
Bryant	PERSON	,
Emer	PERSON	- son ,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	, Whjttier , Poe ,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Thoreau	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, and
Parkman	LOCATION	.

		Another chapter treats of
Halleck	PERSON	and
Drake	PERSON	, still another of the Colonial period , while two closing chapters make brief mention of '' Other Writers '' and discuss '' The End of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The apparatus consists of suggestive questions and bibliographical notes appended to the several chapters , and a brief chronology .

		The illustrations are portraits , homes , and autographs .

		The judgments expressed are usually sound , and the book is remarkably free from those critical crochets that the best of men some - times put into school manuals .

		The note of Amer - icanism is often struck , but not sounded over-harshly , and youthful American readers are led to feel that the literature of their own country should be deeply interesting to them , without being given the impres - sion that a
Longfellow	LOCATION	is a
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		Our only quarrel with the author is for sanctioning the irri - tating pedantry that spells
Vergil	ORGANIZATION	for Virgil ; but we suspect that if Dr.
W. F. Poole	PERSON	were living , he would have something to say about the statement that Cotton Mather '' was one of the most active in the persecution of the alleged witches of Salem . ''

		Current discussions show that this school is charged with exclusive attention to craniology ; Pro- fessor
Ferri	PERSON	seeks to show that psychological , social , and physical elements are regarded by those whom he represents .

		The main contention of the writer is that prisons and penalties do not reform and are not deterrent ; that to increase severity would bru - talize society and would have no effect on confirmed criminals , because these lack moral sense and fore - sight ; and therefore social defense can be secured only by preventive measures .

		He shows how legal definitions of crime and judicial procedure are influ - enced by traditions from a time when superstition and revenge , rather than science , determined meth - ods of punishment .

		Radical changes are demanded in the present state of knowledge .

		Treatment must be adapted to the actual nature of the criminal , and not to a theoretical classification of offenses .

		The essential differences among law-breakers must be the basis of penal systems .

		Some of the reforms suggested are regarded from an Italian point of view , and some are of speculative interest ; but the essential principles are worthy of careful attention . ''

		\ i J PI
E. Robinson	PERSON	, is a volume of short sketches , fifty-seven in all , dealing with the out-of - door life of man and beast .

		The papers , many of which were originally published in '' Forest and Stream , '' are written by a man who is by instinct both sportsman and lover of nature .

		His delinea - tions of the small denizens of the woods , fields , and river-sides show long and close familiarity with their traits and habits , as well as a real affection for those who are so often the victims of the sportsman 's gun .

		Throughout the book , love of sport and love of ani - mals are at war , but in '' A Plea for the
Unpro	PERSON	- tected '' the latter comes uppermost .

		Some of the best work in the book is contained in the twelve essays describing the months of the year .

		The pic - ture in each one is complete and distinct , showing keen discrimination and discernment of the typical qualities of the passing seasons .

		The language for the most part is well chosen .

		The chief fault is one that might have been remedied by omitting a few of the papers , in other words , there is at times an impression of monotony ; but no lover of nature can fail to enjoy these simple and untechnical sketches .

		The new edition of

		It is very neat in appearance , and it is offered at about half the price of the rival edition .

		There are eight volumes , each with three illustrations .

		But it has no critical apparatus whatever , and does not present so trustworthy and definitive a text as has been provided for the other edition .

		It aims , in fact , to present the works alone , which it does in a fairly satisfactory man - ner .

		The critical student will not be likely to view it with favor , although its cheapness and mechanical excel - lence will recommend it to a circle of readers that the
Stedman	PERSON	- Woodberry edition would not be likely to reach at all .

		The editor of the '' Columbian Knowledge '' series -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- has been singularly happy in the selection of subjects for the volumes that have thus far appeared .

		`` Total Eclipses of the Sun , '' `` Public Libraries in
America	LOCATION	, '' and '' Arctic Discoveries '' are all subjects of timely interest , and each is , in a sense , complete in itself that is , deserving of special treatment , although really but a part of some larger subject .

		General
A. W. Greely	PERSON	's '' Handbook of Arctic Discoveries '' is essen - tially a manual of facts , concisely stated and well - arranged , condensed from the 50,000 pages i > f narrative that have grown up about the subject , mostly during the past half-century .

		The book is well supplied with maps , and will be found in every way helpful to those interested in Arctic .

		exploration . ''

		The Statesman 's Year-Book '' for
1895	DATE	, edited by Mr.
J. Scott Keltie	PERSON	and Mr.
I. P. A. Reijwick	PERSON	, is the thirty-third annual publication of that invaluable com - pendium of -LRB- usually -RRB- accurate informatioa .

		It repro - duces all the familiar features of earlier editions , and has been carefully corrected to date .

		The most note - worthy change is made in connection with the several sections relating to the navies of the world .

		These have all been thoroughly revised by Mr.
S. W. Barnaby	PERSON	.

		A new feature is offered by the four maps that precede the text .

		These have for their subjects the frontier question on the Pamirs , the Indo-Chinese frontier ques - tion , the Venezuela-Guiana boundary question , and the recent
Bechuanaland	LOCATION	arrangements .

		Messrs.
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		The '' Classics for Children '' published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have been enriched by the addition of the `` Adventures of Hatini Ta'i . ''

		This work , translated from the
Persian	LOCATION
sixty-five years ago	DATE	, and first published in English under the auspices of the
Oriental Transla	ORGANIZATION	- tion Fund , has remained practically inaccessible until the present time , being now rescued by Mr.
W. R. Alger	PERSON	, and brought within easy reach of the public .

		It is a series of tales not unlike the '' Arabian Nights , '' and Mr.
Alger	PERSON	is justified in declaring it '' not one whit infe - rior to the very best of those world-renowned master - pieces . ''

		In its present popular form it will doubtless find many readers , not alone among the young , for it has a charm that appeals to all ages .

		The thirteenth series of the ''
Johns Hopkins Univer	PERSON	- sity Studies in Historical and Political Science '' has recently been completed by publication of the following monographs : `` White Servitude in the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	of Vir - ginia , '' by Mr.
James C. Ballagh	PERSON	; '' The Genesis of
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia 's First Constitution , '' by Mr.
R. D. Hunt	PERSON	; ``
Benja	LOCATION	- min Franklin as an Economist , '' by Mr.
W. A. Wetzel	PERSON	; '' The Provisional Government of
Maryland	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
J. A. Silver	PERSON	; and '' Government and Religion of the
Virginia	LOCATION	Indians , '' by Mr.
S. R. Hendren	PERSON	.

		Of the fourteenth series -LRB-
1896	DATE	-RRB- , the following three numbers have been issued : '' Constitutional History of
Hawaii	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Henry E. Chambers	PERSON	; `` The City Government of
Baltimore	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Thaddeus P. Thomas	PERSON	; and `` Colonial Origins of New England Senates , '' by Mr.
F. L. Riley	PERSON	.

		These spe - cial historical studies are of great value and highly cred - itable to the institution that puts them forth .

		Mr.
Lorenzo Sears	PERSON	is the author of a work entitled '' The History of Oratory from the Age of Pericles to the Present Time '' -LRB-
Griggs	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The author discusses the history , science , and philosophy of public discourse , with illustrations drawn from the literature of twenty-four centuries .

		Noting the place of each typical orator in the long history of the art , Mr.
Sears	PERSON	has also sought to point out the rhetorical principles exemplified by him , and '' to observe the trend of eloquence '' iu the period to which he belongs .

		Such men as
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	,
Cicero	LOCATION	,
Savonarola	LOCATION	,
Webster	PERSON	,
Sumner	PERSON	,
Phillips	PERSON	, and
Curtis	PERSON	, are made the subjects of separate chapters while other chapters deal with such themes as '' Attic Ora - tors , '' '' Mediaeval Preachers , '' '' Eccentric Eloquence , '' and '' Oratory of the French Revolution . ''

		The whole work has been carefully done , and fills a place that has been vacant up to the present time . ''

		Word Formation in the Roman Sermo Plebeius '' is the title of a bulky dissertation by Mr.
Frederic Taber Cooper	PERSON	, of
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is '' an histor - ical study of the development of vocabulary in vulgar and late Latin , with special reference to the Romance languages . ''

		The author 's original plan contemplated nothing less than a historical grammar of the subject ; but , as the material grew upon his hands , he found that he had collected under the head of word-formation alone enough matter to make up a substantial treatise .

		He hopes , however , to follow up the present work with a
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 247 volume of equal size upon plebeian syntax .

		The indus - try required for the preparation of this work must have been very great , and it speaks well for our universities that such dissertations should be put forth in their name .

		Messrs.
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish the books .

		`` The Individual and the State : An Essay on Jus - tice '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- is a
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	thesis , presented for the doc - torate by Mr.
Thomas W. Taylor	PERSON	, Jr. .

		It presents a careful study of the literature of the subject , but reaches the somewhat unsatisfactory conclusion that '' the ideal of
Justice	ORGANIZATION	is purely subjective , binding only upon the individual holding it , and not applicable as a test of the Tightness or wrongness of any existing conditions . ''

		Those who have attempted to formulate a principle of justice notably Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	come in for much sharp criticism before this negative conclusion is reached .

		Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	is entitled to his opinion , but he has not said the last word upon this great subject .

		The
Pegasus Club	ORGANIZATION	is a
Philadelphia	LOCATION	organization hav - ing for its purpose '' the writing and study of poetry . ''

		Its members write poems and submit them anonymously to the Club '' for criticism and acceptance or rejection . '' ''

		The Year Book of the Pegasus '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , a pamph - let volume now published , reproduces the best work submitted under the
Club	ORGANIZATION	rules , and divulges the au - thorship of each piece .

Owen Wister	PERSON	, Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	, Mr.
C. L. Moore	PERSON	, Mr.
H. S. Morris	PERSON	, and Mr.

		Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's book is charming in more ways than one .

		His facile pen would make easy reading of the driest subject ; and when it deals with a theme so fascinating as that of the conditions of life on another planet , hard-hearted indeed must be the critic who does not find himself ready to embrace conclusions which he would have contemptuously rejected if reached by a rougher path .

		OUTLOOK ,
N. Y.	PERSON	`` We do not know how we can look at this melodrama with the eyes of one of its prin - cipal actors better than through the medium of these Memoirs of
Karras	PERSON	.

		The reader is put by
Barras	PERSON	among the very personages , he breathes the fetid atmosphere , looks through the lurid glare , discerns the cowardice masked beneath the mock heroic , the despotic temper wrapping itself in the colors of liberty , the lying which unblushingly offers its services to truth , the steel-like cruelty scabbarded in profes - sions of humanity .

		Just because of the vices of the author , these Memoirs disclose the very spirit of the epoch .

		For this they will pos - sess a unique value to the student not only of the French Revolution , but also of human nature .

		CRITIC ,
N. Y	ORGANIZATION	.

		These Memoirs are undoubtedly of great his - - torical value .

		Barras had a sharp eye as well as a sharp pen .

		He was in the midst of it all , lived through the Terror in constant danger of the guillotine , and saw the sordid inside of the great upheaval that ushered in the regime moderne .

		CHAMBERS 'S ENCYCLOPAEDIA is in use as a book of reference wherever the English language is known .

		The first edition of this great work was completed in

		From this point for over twenty years a process of correction and revision was continued from year to year , thus bringing the information down to the latest pos - sible date .

		But this process of revising and altering could not be carried on indefinitely .

		Many articles called for an en - tirely different treatment .

		New subjects of interest demanded admittance ; while some have lost their claim to the prominence given them twenty-five years ago .

		The Publishers therefore have set up and electrotyped the work afresh for this new edition , in the preparation of which every line of the previous edition has been scrutin - ized , and the articles rewritten , partially or entire , while new articles have been prepared to embrace all new subjects required by the progress of knowledge .

		This edition is consequently a new encyclopaedia , comprising the latest information in the whole range of human knowledge , and it is offered to the public at a reduction of one-third from the price of any previous editions .

		Furthermore , we have withdrawn our former trade editions from the market .

		For the time of his story Mr.
Parker	PERSON	has chosen the most absorbing period of the romantic eighteenth-century history of
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		The cur - tain rises soon after
General Braddock	ORGANIZATION	's defeat in
Virginia	LOCATION	, and the hero , a prisoner in
Quebec	LOCATION	, curiously entangled in the intrigues of La
Pompa	PERSON	- dour , becomes a part of a strange history , full of adventure and the stress of peril , which culminates only after
Wolfe	PERSON	's victory over Mont - calm .

		The material offered by the life and history of old
Quebec	LOCATION	has never been utilized for the purposes of fiction with the command of plot and incident , the mastery of local color , and the splendid realization of dramatic situations shown in this distinguished and moving romance .

		The illustrations preserve the atmosphere of the text , for they present the famous buildings , gates , and battle-grounds as they appeared at the time of the hero 's imprisonment in
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		In two volumes .

		8vo , cloth ,
$ 5.00	MONEY	.

		In this important , suggestive , and instructive work , which embodies the study and researches of twenty years , the author '' simply tries to let the light of historical truth into that decaying mass of outworn thought which attaches the modern world to mediaeval conceptions of Christianity , and which still lingers among us a most serious barrier to religion and morals , and a menace to the whole normal evolution of society ... My belief is that in the field left to them their proper field the clergy will more and more , as they cease to strugge against scientific methods and conclusions , do work even nobler and more beau - tiful than anything they have heretofore done .

		And this is saying much .

		My conviction is that Science , though it has evidently conquered Dog - matic Theology , based on Biblical texts and ancient modes of thought , will go hand in hand with Religion ; and that although theological con - trol will continue to diminish , Religion , as seen in the recognition of ' a Power in the universe , not ourselves , which makes for righteousness , ' and in the love of God and of our neighbor , will steadily grow stronger and stronger , not only in the American institutions of learning , but in the world at large .

		In all French history there is no more inspiring episode than that with which M. Gras deals in this story : the march to
Paris	LOCATION	and the do - ings in
Paris	LOCATION	of that
Marseilles Battalion	LOCATION	, made of men who were sworn to cast down ' the tyrant , ' and knew ' how to die . '

		His epitome of the motive power of the Revolution in the feelings of one of its individual peasant parts is the very essence of simplicity and directness .

		His method has the largeness and the clearness of the Greek drama .

		The motives are distinct .

		The action is free and bold .

		The climax is inevit - able , and the story has a place entirely apart from all the fiction of the French Revolution with which I am acquainted . ''

		285 THE TIE THAT BINDS .

		The beautiful story of the Athenian captives at
Syracuse	LOCATION	, set free and restored with all hon - ors to their fatherland because they could recite verses from the poet best beloved of their cap - tors , has been made familiar to us all by two among the noblest works of
Robert Browning	PERSON	. ''

		Any such happy man had prompt reward , '' our poet tells us , '' If he lay bleeding on the battle-field They stanched his wounds , and gave him drink and food ; If he were slave i ' the house , for reverence They rose up , bowed to who proved master now , And bade him go free , thank Euripides !

		Ay , and such did so : many such , he said , Returning home to
Athens	LOCATION	, sought him out , The old bard in the solitary house , And thanked him ere they went to sacrifice . ''

		This story has much more than the virtue of an anecdote ; it has rather the significance of an eternal truth , of the everlasting power of liter - ature to reconcile differences , to soften the as - perities of intercourse between nations , to strengthen the bonds of sympathy between hu - man beings , and to offer promise of that '' Par - liament of man , the Federation of the world , '' which the poet still insists upon foreseeing , however idle his dream be held by the reluctant and short-sighted multitude .

		While the vision of the seer halts at nothing short of this ideal of the brotherhood of man finally accomplished , he whose faith is less firm and whose gaze can not descry things hidden so deep in the mists of the future may still find in the possession of a common speech some earnest of a harmonious union for all to whom that speech is native .

		Particularly true is this of us born to the use of the English language , t fS '' Who speak the tongue That Shakespeare spake , the faith and morals hold Which
Milton	PERSON	held . ''

		A common language is the tie that binds men together almost in spite of themselves .

		This is true even if the language be one that has never risen to supreme excellence of expression upon the lips of the literary artist .

		A striking illus - tration of this fact is offered by
Miss Olive Schreiner	PERSON	, in her account of the uncouth Taal of the Boer .

		The Boer himself is of mixed Dutch and Huguenot strain , and his speech is an almost inconceivably degraded dialect of the Dutch tongue .

		It is absolutely without a liter - 260 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, ature , and is probably incapable of originating one .

		Yet it has fused into a compact nation - ality the heterogeneous elements that went to the making of the Boer , and its unifying influ - ence compels our admiration and our respect .

		If this be the power of a rough and poverty - stricken dialect , what limits may be set to the potency of so rich and refined an instrument of intercourse as the English language ?

		It is not from mere pride of race that the philosophical observer rejoices in the amazing spread of the English language over the face of the earth .

		It is rather that he feels the immense signifi - cance to the future of mankind that must at - tach to an ever-widening use of the tongue in whose literature are embodied the noblest civic and ethical ideals of the modern world .

		Ten generations have now followed one an - other since the man who in English speech gave supreme expression to these ideals was with us in the flesh .

		It is three centuries since the gentlest , and wisest , and deepest of modern souls was building the monument of song that none knew better than himself '' would outlive the perishing body of men and things till the Resurrection of the Dead . ''

		And who will dare say that the work of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is more than barely begun ?

		Year after year we commemo - rate the anniversary of his birth , and each year we look back with reverence to the past because of the promise that it gives us for the future .

		The words spoken at the recent
Stratford	LOCATION	cele - bration by the man who so worthily represents among the English people the best elements of American culture , and the message of good will sent to the
Birmingham	LOCATION	gathering by the Chief Magistrate of our Republic , were both expres - sions of the feeling that a common claim to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	constitutes between
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	a bond of union too strong to be broken by differences that might cause other nations to fly at one another 's throats , too sacred to be made the sport of political passion or weakened by petty international jealousies .

		The Philistine , we suppose , smiled at Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	's message , deeming it a bit of inef - fectual but harmless sentimentality , yet the message embodied a deeper truth than ever en - tered into the self-satisfied Philistine conscious - ness .

		Doubtless , also , he smiled at Mr.
Bay	PERSON	- ard 's assertion that
America	LOCATION	claimed Shake - speare no less than
England	LOCATION	, yet that too is the deepest kind of a truth .

		There is much reason to believe that the teaching of American his - tory in our public schools leaves dominant in the child 's mind an impression that
England	LOCATION	is our hereditary enemy .

		How much better it would be , and how much more essentially just , to emphasize the fact that , although tem - porary differences have now and then arisen between the two nations , yet these are as noth - ing in comparison with the glory of their com - mon inheritance ; that English history , from
Alfred	LOCATION	to
Cromwell	LOCATION	, belongs to us as rightfully as to our kinsmen over-sea , and should be to us a source of no less pride than that we justly take in the continuation of the history through
Washington	LOCATION	down to
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		That this is the view ultimately to obtain among the English - speaking peoples seems to us certain .

		The very stars in their courses are working to bring it about , and the quiet , irresistible influence of a common intellectual tradition will some day ac - complish a closer and more vital union between the scattered sections of the English family than was ever cemented by bond of dynasty or political organization in the history of the world .

		There is a larger patriotism than that of the state , a wider fellowship than that of the geographical area ; it is in community of achievement and aspiration that men are in truth brothers , and it is in literature that they find their real relationship .

		The mutterings of war between the two great English-speaking peoples recently called forth by a reckless play in the politico-diplomatic game have not been wholly evil in their effect .

		If they have been accompanied by a melancholy display of truculence on the part of time serv - ing politicians and journalists , they have also served to make clear the almost absolute unan - imity of the better elements of English-speaking society in rejecting the thought of such a war as a horror unspeakable and unthinkable .

		That it would be essentially civil war has been the general verdict of sober-minded observers , for the essential characteristic of civil war is that the opposing forces should be sharers of the same sympathies and ideals , whether sharing or not the same governmental machinery .

		If all civilized nations knew each other as well as the sections of the English race know each other , all war would be civil war , and burdened with the awful responsibilities of such strife .

		The jingoes and the fomenters of international ill-feeling are poor prophets .

		We prefer to pin our faith to the prophecy of the distinguished Englishman who spoke last year to the mem - bers of the
Harvard Law School	ORGANIZATION	.

		Upon that occasion , Sir
Frederick Pollock	PERSON	, discussing '' The Vocation of the Common Law , '' brought his remarks to a close with a peroration so sig -
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 261 nificant and so eloquent that we can not resist the temptation to borrow it for the adornment of our own discussion of so nearly - allied a theme . ''

		Dreams are not versed in issuable matter , and have no dates .

		Only I feel that this one looks forward , and will be seen as wak - ing light some day .

		If anyone , being of little faith or over-curious , must needs ask in what day , I can answer only in the same fashion .

		We may know the signs , though we know not when they will come .

		These things will be when we look back on our dissensions in the past as brethren grown up to man 's estate and dwelling in unity look back upon the bicker - ings of the nursery and the jealousies of the class-room ; when there is no use for the word * foreigner ' between Cape Wrath and the
Rio Grande	ORGANIZATION	, and the federated navies of the English-speaking nations keep the peace of the ocean under the
Northern Lights	ORGANIZATION	and under the
Southern Cross	ORGANIZATION	, from
Vancouver	LOCATION	to
Sydney	LOCATION	, and from the Channel to the
Gulf of Mexico	LOCATION	; when an indestructible union of even wider grasp and higher potency than the federal bond of these States has knit our descendants into an invincible and indestructible concord . ''

		THE SELECTION OF FELICITOUS BOOK TITLES .

		Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	has again changed the title of his last novel .

		It was at first '' The Simpletons , '' which was probably abandoned on account of its similarity to
Charles Reade	PERSON	's '' A Simpleton '' ; it was changed for ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine '' to '' Hearts Insurgent , '' and it has become in book form , '' Jude the Ob - scure . ''

		This shows the care and thought which authors give to the selection of suitable names for their books , and their effort to gain for them the popular ear .

		In an article published in '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly '' for
March , 1895	DATE	, entitled '' Some Confessions of a Novel - Writer , '' Mr.
Trowbridge	PERSON	tells of the great trouble he had in giving a satisfactory name to his favorite and popular novel , '' Neighbor Jackwood . ''

		He says : '' A score of titles were considered , only to be rejected .

		At last I settled down upon '
Jack	PERSON	- wood , ' but felt the need of joining to that name some characteristic phrase or epithet .

		Thus I was led to think of this Scriptural motto for the title-page , ' And a certain woman went down from
Jerusalem	LOCATION	to
Jericho	LOCATION	, and fell among thieves , ' which suggested the question , ' Who was the neighbor unto this woman ? '

		and the answer , ' Neighbor Jackwood , ' and I had my title . ''

		D'Israeli said that were it inquired of an ingen - ious writer what page of his book had caused him most perplexity , he would often point to the title - page .

		He probably spoke from his own experience , as the changes he made in his own titles evinced the value he placed on attractive ones .

		His most successful book figures in the first edition as `` Anec - dotes , Sketches , and Observations , Literary , Crit - ical , and Historical '' ; he later invested it with the happy title of '' Curiosities of Literature . ''

		Those were the times when wordy titles were fashionable , and he made like changes in his other books .

		He referred to an English novel published as '' The Champion of Virtue '' which could find no readers , but afterwards passed through several editions un - der the happier invitation of '' The Old English Baron . ''

		In poetry also a felicitous title is of service .

		Lowell writes of a new volume of poems in the hands of the printer , '' I had decided to put the
' June	DATE	Idyl ' in the forefront and call it a '
June	DATE	Idyl and Other Poems , ' but Fields told me that
Whittier	LOCATION	's new volume was to be called ' A Summer Idyl . ' ''

		Then he thought of '' Appledore '' ; later concluded to finish his '' Voyage to Vinland '' -LRB- begun eighteen years previous -RRB- , and make the title '' A Voyage to
Vinland	LOCATION	and Other Poems . ''

		Mr.
Fields	PERSON	would not listen to this , and proposed he rechristen the Idyl , '' Elmwood , '' and name the book after that .

		This to
Lowell	PERSON	seemed too personal , like '' throwing my sanctuary open to the public and making a show - house of my hermitage . ''

		Finally he hit upon `` Un - der the Willows , '' in place of a ''
June Idyl	PERSON	, '' and this settled the question . ''

		Pictures from
Apple	ORGANIZATION	- dore '' was first printed in '' The Crayon , '' as '' My Appledore Gallery . ''

		In
March , 1870	DATE	,
Lowell	PERSON	writes to
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	: '' I am glad you like ' The Ca - thedral . '

		... The name was none of my choosing .

		I called it ' A Day at
Chartres	LOCATION	' and Fields re-chris - tened it . ''

		Again -LRB-
December , 1886	DATE	-RRB- ,
Lowell	PERSON	offers a short poem to
Aldrich	PERSON	for the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' saying , What shall I call it ?

		Will ' A Grumble ' do ? ''

		It was finally named '' Fact or Fancy . ''

		That
Hawthorne	PERSON	's '' Marble Faun '' appeared in
England	LOCATION	under the title of '' A Transformation '' is well known .

		This was chosen to please his pub - lisher , and
Hawthorne	PERSON	said of it , '' It gives one the idea of Harlequin in a pantomime . ''

		But the title by which we know it does not fully characterize the story , as the Marble Faun is only casually referred to ; the real subject being the mysterious Donatello the living faun , and notwithstanding the deserved success of the book , the title is not so well chosen as others of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	.


Walter Scott	PERSON	in his introduction to ''
Rob Roy ''	PERSON	said that when he planned the novel he was at loss for a title '' a good name being very nearly of as much consequence in literature as in life , '' and he adds that the title ''
Rob Roy	PERSON	'' was suggested hy Mr.
Constable	PERSON	, `` whose sagacity and experience foresaw the germ of popularity which it contained . ''

		Lockhart writes of the great difficulty Constable bad in inducing
Scott	PERSON	to adopt his suggestion that the name of the real hero would be the best possi - 262 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, ble name for the book . ''

		Nay , '' said
Scott	PERSON	, '' never let me have to write up to a name .

		You well know I have generally adopted a title that told nothing . ''

		To the same judicious adviser is due the title of ''
Kenilworth	LOCATION	, '' which
Scott	PERSON	wished to call , like
Mickle	PERSON	's ballad , ''
Cumnor Hall	PERSON	, '' but yielded to Constable 's wishes and substituted ''
Kenilworth	LOCATION	, '' notwithstanding
Ballantyne	PERSON	's hint that the result would be '' something worthy of a kennel . ''

		Lock - hart says that Constable had every reason to be satis - fied with this child of his christening .

		The novel '' Redgauntlet '' had made considerable progress at press before Constable and
Ballantyne	PERSON	could per - suade
Scott	PERSON	to substitute that title for ''
Herries	PERSON	, '' his first choice .

		After the publication of '' The
Monas	PERSON	- tery , '' Constable wished
Scott	PERSON	to call the succeeding novel `` The Nunnery , '' instead of `` The Abbot , '' but in this instance
Scott	PERSON	wisely stood by his first choice .

		Constable certainly had a genius for choosing titles .

		Scott was equally fastidious in naming his poems .

		He refers repeatedly in his letters to a poem he is writing to be entitled '' The Nameless
Glen	PERSON	, '' and later mentions it as '' The Lord of the Isles , '' a title which had suggested itself to him as more striking .

		Often his first choice was used as a sub-title , as '' The Fair Maid of
Perth	LOCATION	, or
St. Valentine	ORGANIZATION	's Eve , '' ''
Anne of Geierstein	PERSON	, or the Maid of the Mist , '' as he could not decide to abandon them wholly .

		Southey 's ''
Roderick	PERSON	the Last of the Goths , '' was first called ''
Don Pelayo	PERSON	. ''


Charles Dickens	PERSON	often changed a title after choos - ing it . ''


Barnaby Rudge	PERSON	, '' that earnest plea for tolerance and the abolition of capital punishment , was announced for many months under the name of ''
Gabriel Vardon	PERSON	. ''

		During the twenty months of the serial publication of '' Dombey and Son , '' its title was '' Dealings with the Firm of Dombey and Son , Wholesale , Retail , and for Exportation '' ; but on its completion in
1848	DATE	, its present admirable title was adopted .

		Dickens 's favorite child , ''
David Cop	PERSON	- perfield , '' was originally brought out under this title : `` The Personal History , Adventures , Experiences , and Observations of
David Copperfield	PERSON	the Younger , of
Blunderstone Rookery	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- which he never meant to be published on any account -RRB- . ''

		Dickens followed the example of his avowed master
Smollett	PERSON	and at first gave a novel the title of its hero or heroine , even going so far as to adopt the alliteration of ''
Peregrine Pickle	ORGANIZATION	'' and ''
Roderick Random	PERSON	'' as a model for ''
Nicholas Nickleby	PERSON	'' ; but he broke away from this habit , and his titles are generally original and striking .

		`` Bleak House '' was first called `` Tom-All-Alone 's , '' and certainly in this case second thoughts were best .


George Eliot	PERSON	considered the subject one of real importance and in her Journal and Letters devotes much space to it . ''

		The Mill on the Floss '' was first called by her , '' Sister
Maggie	PERSON	. ''

		Under date of
Jan. 3 , 1860	DATE	, she writes to Mr.
John Blackwood	PERSON	: '' We are demurring about the title .

		Mr.
Lewes	PERSON	pre - fers ' The
House of Tulliver	ORGANIZATION	, or Life on the Floss ' to our old notion of ' Sister
Maggie	PERSON	' ; ' The
Tulli	PERSON	- vers , or Life on the Floss ' has the advantage of slipping easily off the lazy English tongue , but it is after too common a fashion -LRB- ' The Newcomes , ' ` The Bertrams , ' etc. -RRB- ; then there is ` The Tulliver Family , or Life on the Floss . '

		Pray meditate and give us your opinion . ''

		After some further corre - spondence , she urges Mr.
Blackwood	PERSON	to give the casting vote , and in reply to his suggestion , writes : '' ' The Mill on the Floss ' be it then . ''


Anthony Trollope	PERSON	says he first intended to call his novel '' Can you Forgive Her '' by the title of '' The Noble Jilt '' ; but he was afraid the critics might throw a doubt on the nobility , and that there was more of tentative humility in that which he at last adopted .

		Few writers , however , made more changes in their efforts to satisfactorily christen their novels than
Charles Reade	PERSON	.

		While it was in press he changed '' It is Never too Late to Mend , '' from ''
Susan Mer	PERSON	- ton , '' its original title .

		He gives his reasons in de - tail to his publishers , and says , '' '
Susan Merton	PERSON	' is a very bad title because under that title the book is a failure ,
Susan Merton	PERSON	being a third-rate character in point of invention and color .

		On this change I am peremptory and sensitive too .

		As it is cruel to make you lose the effect of past advertisements , I suppose you must add ' or
Susan Merton	PERSON	, ' if you are bent on it ; but if so , ' It is Never too Late to Mend ' must be the first title .

		But even this is against my judgment . ''

		Reade showed his pleasure when the title proved a hit . ''

		The Cloister and the Hearth '' was printed in part under the title of '' A Good Fight . ''

		When he dramatized one of his novels he changed the title . ''

		Peg Woffington '' was drama - tized as `` Masks and Faces , '' and `` A Terrible Temptation '' became , as a play , '' The Double Mar - riage . ''


Carleton Coffin	PERSON	's '' The Boys of
' 61	DATE	, '' was origin - ally '' Four Years of Fighting . ''

		Many other illustrations might be given to show that authors realise that the reading public is likely to be , `` Charm 'd with the foolish whistling of a name . ''

		A CORRECTION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It is with a certain hesitation that we write you to correct the author of a somewhat bitter letter published in your journal for
April 16	DATE	, for we recognize the signa - ture as that of a gallant soldier , as well as a student of literature .

		But as the author of that letter labors under several misapprehensions , we think that he will be glad to learn the facts . ''

		The Red Badge of Courage '' was read and ac - cepted by us in
December , 1894	DATE	, and , in book form , it was first published in this country in
October , 1895	DATE	.

		Although the book was copyrighted in
England	LOCATION	at the same time , it was not formally published there for two months .

		Meantime the American journals had reviewed it and had begun an almost universal chorus of eulogy .


October 19 , 1895	DATE	, the '' New York Times '' devoted a column and a half to a strong review of '' this remark - able book . ''

		On
October 13	DATE	, the ''
Philadelphia	LOCATION	Press '' compared Mr.
Crane	PERSON	and
Bret Harte	PERSON	, not to the disad - vantage of the former .

		On
October 26	DATE	, the ''
New York	LOCATION	Mail and Express , '' in one of several notices , said , '' The author has more than talent there is genius in the book . ''

		On
October 26	DATE	, the ''
Boston Transcript	ORGANIZATION	, '' in speaking of '' this tremendous grasping of the glory and carnage of war , '' added at the close of a long and enthus - iastic review , '' The book forces upon the reader the con - viction of what fighting really means . ''

		Other favorable reviews appeared in
October	DATE	issues of the following American newspapers : ''
New York Herald	ORGANIZATION	, '' ''
Brooklyn Eagle	ORGANIZATION	, ''
Cleveland	LOCATION	World , ''
St. Paul Pioneer Press	ORGANIZATION	, ''
Boston	LOCATION	Daily Advertiser , '' ''
New York	LOCATION	World , '' '' St.

New York	LOCATION	Commercial Advertiser , '' '' Kansas City Journal , '' ''
Chicago	LOCATION	Evening Post , '' '' Bos - ton Courier , '' '' Cleveland Plain Dealer , '' ''
Boston Bea	PERSON	- con , ''
Hartford	LOCATION	Times , '' Sioux City Times , '' '' New Haven Leader , '' and ''
Minneapolis	LOCATION	Journal , '' and to these names , taken almost at random , we might add many others .

		These journals reviewed `` The Red Badge '' favorably in
October	DATE	, and others , including weeklies like '' The Critic '' and '' The Outlook , '' followed in
Novem	DATE	- ber with emphatic recognition of the strength and high talent shown in the book .

		It was not until the end of
November	DATE	, two months after publication here , that the first reviews appeared in
England	LOCATION	.

		By that time American reviewers from
Maine	LOCATION	to
California	LOCATION	had '' greeted '' the book with the highest '' encomiums . ''

		The English '' encomiums '' be - came specially marked in late
December	DATE	,
January	DATE	, and
February	DATE	.

		We state these facts in view of your correspondent 's remarks that '' So far , at least , the American papers have said very little about the merits or demerits of the book , '' and , '' The book has very recently been reprinted in
America	LOCATION	, '' and , '' Respect for our own people should have prevented its issue in this country . '' ''

		Our coun - try '' was the first to recognize Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's genius , and our people have read his book so eagerly that it contin - ues to be the most popular work of fiction in the market , and it has been the one most talked of and written about since
October	DATE	last .

		A glance at the back of the '' Red Badge '' title-page would have shown that the book could not have been `` first published '' in
England	LOCATION	and `` reprinted '' here , while the literary departments of journals throughout our country , and the opinions of American men of let - ters like Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and Mr.
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	, have proved , happily , that Americans are ready to recognize American talent , and that , pare your correspondent , a prophet is not without honor even in his own country .

		As to other points , against the opinion of the gallant veteran who criticizes the book might be put the opin - ions of other veterans who have found only words of praise .

		A RED BADGE OF BAD ENGLISH .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAI , . -RRB-

		The animus of the articles in British magazines dur - ing our Civil War , as quoted by `` A.
C. McC	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		in your issue of
April 16	DATE	, sufficiently explains the English en - thusiasm for that literary absurdity called '' The Red Badge of Courage . ''

		The trend of the whole work to prove the absence of such a thing as a gentleman in the union army may be justly expected to arouse the re - sentment of the class of whom `` A. C. McC . ''

		is such a striking and honorable example .

		If this work is real - ism , it is realism run mad , rioting in all that is revolt - ing to man 's best instincts , and utterly false to nature and to life .

		The Federal army doubtless possessed its share of ruffianly officers and stupid brainless men , but to select such and to hold them up as types is not true realism .

		Yet this is the work which one
London	LOCATION	period - ical compares favorably with the writings of
Tolstoi	PERSON	' and Zola , and concerning which another
London	LOCATION	periodical says : `` There is no possibility of resistance when once yon are in its grasp . ''

		The examples of hysterical composition given by `` A. C. McC . ''

		might be supplemented by others fully as absurd taken from nearly every page of the book .

		Amid so much that is strained and affected there is not one agreeable character , hardly one praiseworthy senti - ment , and certainly not a new or original thought .

		But as the book is heralded as one of the literary successes of the year , it is but fair to call attention to a few ex - amples of its latter-day English .

		We can bear with equanimity the author 's vulgarisms and mannerisms , his use of the split infinitive , and of such words as reliable , standpoint , and others which the slipshod fashion of the day has authorized by general usage .

		We may even attribute to '' typographical errors '' such careless con - structions as the following : '' A shrill lamentation rang out filled with profane illusions to a general '' -LRB- p. 193 -RRB- . ''

		His anger was directed not so much against the men whom he knew were rushing '' -LRB- p. 57 -RRB- . ''

		Tottering among them was the rival color bearer , whom the youth saw had been bitten '' -LRB- p. 222 -RRB- .

		But what is to be said of the following bright gems , culled almost at random while turning over these '' irre - sistible '' pages ? ''

		Set upon it was the hard and dark lines '' -LRB- p. 222 -RRB- .

		`` There was no obvious questionings , nor figurings , nor diagrams .

		There was apparently no considered loopholes '' -LRB- p. 219 -RRB- .

		`` He departed ladened .

		The youth went with his friend , feeling a desire to throw his heated body onto the stream '' -LRB- p. 179 -RRB- . ''

		Once he found himself almost into a swamp '' -LRB- p. 79 -RRB- . ''

		The majesty of he who dares give his life '' -LRB- p. 68 -RRB- . ''

		He could not flee no more than a little finger can commit a revolution from the hand '' -LRB- p. 56 -RRB- .


Eugene Field	PERSON	, not long before his death , remarked : `` The one crime that can not be righteously charged 264 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, against OUT Jin de siecle poetasters is slovenliness . ''

		Un - happily ourjtfn de siecle prose writers are peculiarly sus - ceptible to the charge .

		Can this general butchery of the language be the nemesis of '' dialect literature , '' which has done so much to bring sensible and intelligible En - glish into ill repute ?

		A WORD IN REPLY TO
MR. STEARNS	PERSON	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		On page 96 of his '' Midsummer of Italian Art , '' in speaking of Michelangelo 's '' Captive , '' Mr.
Stearns	PERSON	says : '' The other Captive is , or was till recently , in the Boboli Gardens at
Florence	LOCATION	. ''

		Both of these gigantic statues have been in
France	LOCATION	since the reign of
Francis I.	PERSON	, and at least since the time of Napoleon they have stood in the
Louvre	LOCATION	side by side , so that no man could see one without seeing the other .

		Has the author of the above lines seen either ?

		And is a man who has not seen them competent to write about Michelangelo ?

		In his letter in your issue of
April 1	DATE	, Mr.
Stearns	PERSON	excuses his error about the location of Raphael 's '' Dis - pute on the Sacrament '' by saying that pictures in
Italy	LOCATION	have been recently changed about .

		This immense pic - ture is a fresco covering an entire wall , and is as immova - ble as the building itself .

		Could the writer ever have been in the Stanze ?

		And ought one who has never been there to write of Raphael ?

		If he will buy a copy of Baedeker he will find that the two windows of the Antecollegio face away from the
Lido	LOCATION	, and that without the use of the
Roentgen	PERSON	rays the
Lido	LOCATION	can not be seen from that room .

		Grimm does not say that II
Pensieroso	PERSON	is Giuliano de ' Medici .

		What he does is to correct the popular im - pression that he is Lorenzo the Magnificent , and to call attention to the fact that he is the worthless Lorenzo who begot
Catherine de ' Medici	ORGANIZATION	.

		I think that I am safe in saying that no living man has seen the Head of the Medusa in the Tribune of the
Uffizi	LOCATION	, and that no one who is not familiar with the con - tents of that and the preceding rooms ought to write about Italian art .

		Mr.
Stearns	PERSON	is mistaken in supposing that I bear him any grudge .

		But a man ought not to write about
Michel	PERSON	- angelo and
Raphael	PERSON	without a patient and loving study of their original works , which no application to photo - graphs and engravings will supply .

		Mr.
Stearns	PERSON	's book is interesting and well written , but it could not have been written upon the spot , and is usually at variance with the results of modern criticism .

		A WORD ABOUT BOOK-MAKING .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In The Nation '' for
March 22 , 1894	DATE	, 1 made a short plea for '' the index-making conscience , '' as something that must be cultivated by everyone who wishes both to write books and to love his fellow-men .

		Two years more of vexation have forced me once again to give to my feel - ings the relief of utterance .

		I especially desire to speak to those who review books in the pages of THE DIAL .

		It is upon THE DIAL and similar publications that any effort to secure a higher standard of book-making must depend .

		The average author or publisher will not have a loftier ideal of what a book ought to be than that which finds expression in our best literary reviews .

		It is one of the duties of such periodicals to police the field of literature .

		The mere mechanical excellences which mark a good book should certainly be insisted upon .

		Some of these are often lacking simply on account of the ignorance of the writer concerning the art of book - making , or of his indolence , or from a mixture of these causes .

		The standard in these matters is altogether too low , and our literary police should enforce the demand for improvement .

		A recent book is entitled '' The Philosophy of English Literature , '' by Mr.
Greenough White	PERSON	.

		The work is published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It contains 266 pages , but no table of contents , index , or any other handle of any kind whatever .

		One almost feels that the division of the work into paragraphs might have been omitted if any modern precedent could have been found for this .

		Mr.
White	PERSON	can not realize that what he has written is only a potential book , that ninety per cent of the useful - ness that his work might easily have had is now impos - sible to it .

		Why is there no index to the '' Letters of Matthew Arnold '' ?

		How can one disengage
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's judgments upon Goethe and other great writers from their entang - ling alliances with
Flo	PERSON	, and Fan , and
Dick	PERSON	, and
Nelly	PERSON	, from the midst of buns and dinners , journeys and politics , from '' coughs , and rheums , and phthisic , and catarrh '' ?

		Is it right for the editor and the publishers to compel everyone who values the work to make his own index ?

		Dr.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	perhaps thought that the clear arrangement of his book , '' The Poetry of Tennyson '' -LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	's Sons -RRB- , made an index unnecessary .

		So much labor has been expended by him upon the full and val - uable '' Chronology '' and list of '' Biblical Quotations and Allusions '' that one hesitates to find fault ; but the work is too valuable to be without an index .

		I have made a full one for myself by putting into my copy of Tennyson a V with the page-references after the title of every poem upon which Dr. Van Dyke comments .

		Others may be able to make use of this suggestion .

		American and English book-makers are perhaps en - titled to the consolation that their standard in the mat - ter of indexes is higher than that of some other nations .

		A prominent
New England	LOCATION	professor who is publishing a work in
Germany	LOCATION	recently had the MS. for an elabo - rate index returned to him with the information that the publisher had no use for '' that thing . ''

		It seems passing strange that
Freytag	PERSON	's '' Die Technik des Dramas , '' a work to which an index is especially neces - sary , should still be without one .

		The work appeared in
1863	DATE	, and has reached at least the seventh edition .

		The second edition of the American translation -LRB-
Griggs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with all its imperfections on its head , may well claim to be a more useful book than the original , even to one commanding both languages , because of its full index .

		I find it practicable , however , to use the English index in connection with the German text .

		That this full index is not a faultless one will be clear when I say that
Kleist	PERSON	is not mentioned on the single page of the work to which reference is made , and that his name appears in four places that have been overlooked .

		Our very best books often have important defects of a mechanical or semi-mechanical nature .

		It will per - haps help to make this fact clear if in the remainder of this communication I mention only works which have with some justice been looked upon as models .

		Of course all of them have indexes , and I think good ones .

		A wealth of editorial conscience , together with a wealth of knowledge and taste , has gone into Mr.
Sted	PERSON	-

		THE DIAL man 's '' Victorian Anthology '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book seems nearly perfect .

		I believe , how - ever , that occasional glossarial notes are needed , and that some notes of a more general nature would be very helpful .

		Because there are dialect poems , and because '' the Rudyards '' never '' cease from kipling , '' even a practiced reader needs help now and then and the book is made for ordinary readers .

		Perhaps Mr.
Sted	PERSON	- man was unwilling to explain anything for fear that he might be expected to interpret
Carroll	PERSON	's '' Jabberwocky . ''

		At first sight one would say that Professor Butcher 's admirable book , ''
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's Theory of Poetry and Fine Art , with a
Critical Text	ORGANIZATION	and a Translation of the Poetics '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , contains every form of help that the student can ask for .

		For a first reading it does .

		Reference is made at every point in the body of the work to the clause or clauses of the '' Poetics '' which are there touched upon .

		It is not made easy , however , for one who starts from the '' Poetics '' to refer to Pro- fessor
Butcher	ORGANIZATION	's discussions .

		I have spent several hours in putting into my copy , against each clause in the trans - lation of the '' Poetics , '' references to those pages in the following part of the book where that clause is inter - preted or enforced .

		Now I can start with
Aristotle	PERSON	and refer to Professor Butcher , instead of the reverse .

		Professor
Gummere	PERSON	's '' Old English Ballads , '' in the `` Athenaeum Press Series '' -LRB-
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has received the abundant praise that it deserves ; but use reveals one decided mechanical defect .

		The part of the book con - taining the poems themselves has a running-head '' Bal - lads '' ; on the right-hand page this should be replaced by the title of the particular ballad of which a part is there given .

		The '' Notes '' in a later division of the book have nothing to enable one to bring the two parts of the book into comparison without loss of time .

		The heading of p. 315 , for example , might well read : '' Notes : pp. 3-13 . ''

		I would suggest , also , that in all such books the title of a new poem or selection in the body of the work have printed after it as an '' exponent '' the num - ber of the page where the notes upon that selection are given .

		For example , the ballad beginning on p. 241 in Professor
Gummere	PERSON	's book would be headed '' Child Waters 35 ^ . ''

		Very many books for the study of En - glish literature have the defect of which I am now complaining .

		One is compelled to lose much time in bringing together any particular portion of the text and the notes thereupon .

		Other details of book-making I must leave unnoticed , such as tables of contents , side-heads , bibliographies , etc. .

		Let me , however , make one general remark .

		Book - makers may be divided roughly into two classes .

		The authors and publishers of one class ask : `` What is the smallest possible amount of attention which I can be - stow upon a table of contents , index , and similar details , without hindering the sale of my work or calling down upon myself the castigation of reviewers ? ''

		Each mem - ber of the other class asks : '' In how many ways can I make my book helpful and usable ? ''

		Here 's to the health of all members of this latter class ; may they live long and prosper !

		And may their tribe increase !

MARY ANDERSON	PERSON	'S MEMORIES .

''

		We feel bound to say that Mme.
Navarro	PERSON	's book , which is largely the record of her brilliant , if measurably hard - won , professional triumphs , strikes us as un - likely to exert the deterrent effect she seems to propose ; and that the tale of the barn-storming disasters of some effectually crushed tragedian would have been more to the purpose .

		In fact , it would be rather difficult to point to a book less likely to act as a wet blanket on budding histrionic ambitions than this one of Mme.

		But you mus ' ` low me to call your maw ' ; and in a trice she was gone ... She , in turn , called the critic of the family , Dr.
Griffin	PERSON	, who likewise was astonished , and made my heart beat with joy by saying , You '11 make a good actress some day .

		Your scene has thrilled me , and I would rather have rough work and a good thrill than any amount of artistic work without it . ' ''

		Thenceforth , Dr.
Griffin	PERSON	-LRB- highly appreciating his '' good thrill '' on this occasion -RRB- became his step - daughter 's stanchest abettor .

		Through him interviews were obtained with Miss Gush - man -LRB- who predicted '' a future '' for the novice -RRB- , and with
John McCullough	PERSON	who hated stage - struck people , and said so . ''

		Genial John , '' however , soon thawed before his young visitor 's enthusiasm and manifest talent ; and before leaving the city he said emphatically to Mr.
Macauley	PERSON	, the veteran
Louisville	LOCATION	manager : '' Barney , when you can , put this girl on the stage .

		If I am a judge of such matters , she will make a fortune for you . ''

		Miss
Anderson	PERSON	made her debut , as
Juliet	PERSON	, at
Macauley	ORGANIZATION	's Theatre ,
Nov. 25 , 1875	DATE	.

		The ar - rangements were hurriedly made , and there was but one rehearsal .

		This rehearsal proved a sore trial to her , for the members of the company were most unkind to the raw-looking tyro who was assigned to the leading role .

		When she appeared , all stared , some tittered , others whis - pered audible and unflattering '' asides . ''

		Says Miss Anderson : '' Scarcely sixteen , my hair in a long braid , my frock reaching to my boot-tops , tall , shy , and awkward , I may have given them cause for merriment ; but it was as cruel , I thought , as underbred , to make no effort to con - ceal their mirth at my expense . ''

		But the
night	TIME	's performance was a pronounced success .

		The kindly indulgence with which the lighter opening scenes were received by the audience warmed into genuine enthusiasm when the tragic parts were reached ; and flowers and recalls were the order of the
evening	TIME	.

		The young debutante was led before the curtain after every act , amid such rounds of applause as had seldom shaken the walls of the old
Louis	LOCATION	- ville play-house .

		Miss
Anderson	PERSON	subsequently filled engage - ments at
St. Louis	LOCATION	,
New Orleans	LOCATION	, San Fran - cisco , and other Southern and Western cities , when , her fame spreading , attractive offers from
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	managers tempted her to try her fortune before the more critical audiences of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Here again success crowned her efforts despite some rather cavalier treatment at the hands of the discriminating critics of the daily papers .

		In
1878	DATE	she went abroad for the first time .

		At
Paris	LOCATION	many charming and profitable evenings were spent at the
Comedie Franchise	ORGANIZATION	although
Miss Anderson	PERSON	admits that the exquisite re - finement and finesse of the French stage were at first lost upon her , the nice tints and touches by which such actors as Mme.
Bernhardt	PERSON	, Got , Worms , and Mounet Sully obtained their effects appearing weak and insipid . ''

		I longed , '' she says , '' for the artists to fling their restraints to the winds and give the public a good old - fashioned burst in the tragic scenes , such as I had been accustomed to see and indulge in my - self . ''

		On orie occasion , however , it seems Mme.
Bernhardt	PERSON	gratified her with '' a good old - fashioned burst '' in a style that must have brought the '' gods '' even of old ''
Macauley	PERSON	's '' to their feet .

		Madame , she says , had a way of turning her back upon the audience to make comic remarks or grimaces for the benefit of her friends in the wings ; and it was quite im - possible to realize her tragic power when she constantly distracted one with droll '' asides . ''

		But one evening she said to
Miss Anderson	PERSON	, '' I will act for you to-night .

		It is not good for me , but you shall see . '' ''

		After the first acts a series of triumphs she came to the death scene .

		I shall always remember it as the most powerfully realistic acting I have ever witnessed .

		When it was over , there was wild enthusiasm in the house .

		The great actress lay upon the stage like one really dead .

		Her maids ran to her assistance .

		There was a stain of blood upon the handkerchief put to her lips .

		A little iced champagne restored her , though she was only able to stand quite still , while the audience thundered its applause .

		She put her hand on my shoul - der on coming off the stage , and , with a faint smile , simply said Voila ! ' '

		Miss
Anderson	PERSON	made her
London	LOCATION	debut in
1883	DATE	, at the
Lyceum	LOCATION	.

		Parthenia was the role chosen for the opening night , as being the sim - plest one in her repertory , and one in which comparison with leading English favorites would not be challenged .

		The choice proved a wise one , though managers and critics advised against it , believing that the old-fashioned sen - timent and stilted phrase of the play would pro- voke the mirth of a Hn-de-siecle audience .

		A
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 267 full house greeted the young American actress , and the applause on her first entrance was long and hearty . ''

		The excitement of the first scenes had evidently weakened me , for in the second act , while weaving gar - lands for the golden cups , a kindly voice from the pit called out : ` Mary , please speak up a bit ! '

		This was said with such good feeling that it put an end to my nervousness , and from that moment the play ran smoothly to the end ... Among the many who came behind the scenes to offer their congratulations was Mr.
P. T. Barnum	PERSON	, who exclaimed , in his own hearty way ,
Hurrah	PERSON	for
America	LOCATION	!

		You 've won
London	LOCATION	, or I know nothing of public taste ! ' ''

		That Miss
Anderson	PERSON	had indeed won
London	LOCATION	was clearly demonstrated on the night of her farewell performance there .

		Mr.
Alma-Tad	PERSON	- ema , the distinguished painter , has eloquently described the scene , in a letter to the heroine of the evening : '' ... The house called for a speech , and it did one good to see everybody so grateful for what you had given , and I shall never forget the moment when , after a few words of farewell , you hesitated , and tried to find a support on the curtain , when a voice from the gallery was heard saying , God bless you ,
Mary !	PERSON	'

		and immedi - ately the hearty wish was reechoed by the whole theatre as if with one voice .

		Alas !

		you did not keep your prom - ise , and never returned to the
London	LOCATION	stage , and reserved only to some chosen friends the happiness of meeting you , who must always be a bright star in their past . ''

		But
Miss Anderson	PERSON	's reception at
London	LOCATION	, kindly as it was , was nothing to that at
Dublin	LOCATION	, where the warm-hearted Irishmen , not content with making the theatre a sort of cheerful pan - demonium during each evening 's performance , took the horses from her carriage every night after the play and dragged it through the streets in triumph .

		Of one night in particular she says , '' I doubt if , outside of
Dublin	LOCATION	, any landau ever held so many shrieking enthusiasts . '' ''

		The driver 's box occupied by three or four of them , one on each of the carriage steps , dozens pushing it from behind , dozens pulling it in front , the top literally swarming with them ; while from the crowd that rushed after our strange-looking vehicle came deafening cries of ' Hurrah for
America	LOCATION	! ' '

		The Sthars and Sthroipes for iver ! '

		God Bless our Mary ! '

		while
Mary	PERSON	sat inside , fearfully listening to every creak of the roof , and ex - pecting it each moment to fall in with its kind-hearted though heavy-weighted devotees . ''

		On the final night 's journey to
Queenstown	LOCATION	, where
Miss Anderson	PERSON	was to take ship for
America	LOCATION	, she was awakened from time to time by unaccountable cheers and cries of ''
Hurrah	PERSON	for the Stars and Stripes ! '' ''

		Good luck to our Mary ! ''

		etc. ; and was at last told that a detach - ment of that night 's audience had boarded the train , and were seeing her safely on her way to the sea .

		It is pleasant to record these well - earned triumphs of our gifted countrywoman .

		Miss
Anderson	PERSON	made her final appearance on the stage at
Washington	LOCATION	in
1889	DATE	.

		Shortly afterward she became engaged to
Antonio F. de Navarro	PERSON	, whom she had known for many years ; and in
June , 1890	DATE	, they were married at the little Catholic church at
Hampstead	LOCATION	, Lon - don .

		Many and great inducements , she says , '' have since been offered me to act again , but ' II en coute trap cher pour briller dans le monde , Combien je vais aimer ma retraite profonde ; Pour vivre heureuz , vivons caches . ' ''

		Miss
Anderson	PERSON	's book is easily and pleas - antly , if perhaps rather hurriedly , written .

		It contains many anecdotes of notable people Generals Grant and
Sherman	PERSON	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Tennyson , Cardinal Manning	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	,
WUkie Collins	PERSON	, and so on besides a fund of good stories drawn from the author 's professional experiences .

		Perhaps the best part of it is the wholesome impression it conveys of the character of the writer for it is needless to say that in
Miss Anderson	LOCATION	the stage lost not only a gifted artist but a most estimable wo - man .

		The generous plaudits that followed her career were paid no less to the one than to the other ; and her name is enrolled with those of the many true men and pure women who have graced and dignified the player 's once con - temned calling .

		We may note , in closing , that
Miss Anderson	PERSON	's stern insistence on the pro- prieties became a sort of half-humorous by - word in the profession , the witty Mr.
W. S. Gilbert	PERSON	once affirming that such was her horror of grossness in all its forms that she could scarcely be persuaded to touch her share of the gross receipts .

VIRGINIA	LOCATION	'S ECONOMIC HISTORY .

		* Students of American history are beginning , after much experimental writing , to practise a correct method of unfolding our national his - tory .

		The history of the
United States	LOCATION	has hitherto seemed to a large extent to evade , in treatment , the introduction of any unity into the narrative , or the discovery of any unity in the substance .

		Men have gone on writing gen - eral histories , and , surveying the ill-assorted material from above , have failed to grasp into one the apparently incoherent local diversities .

		Even
Bancroft	PERSON	, over-possessed by the cult of ancestor-worship , could not find in such pre - * ECONOMIC HISTORY OF
VIRGINIA	LOCATION	in the Seventeenth Cen - tury .

		By
Philip Alexander Bruce	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		268 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, suppositions any adequate principle of construc - tion .

		Hildreth the iconoclast did no better in this respect , although he cleared the atmos - phere of cant and of rhetoric .

		A few years ago the
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	historical school began to make us see that the biological method is the true one , and that the beginnings of national life must be traced upward from the subter - ranean rootlets of the days of the founders into that difficult specimen of the composite which covers a continent and fills the heavens .

		We now realize that the processes which made the thirteen colonies have gone on making new local centres in the ever-enlarging West , and that a true method of investigation will work upward from the local centres of life and of institutions to the evolving unit toward which they all con - tribute .

		American national history can not be finally written until the field of the local life be thoroughly investigated and the material clas - sified .

		A portion of our oldest local area has been thoroughly covered in a book recently issued , '' The Economic History of
Virginia	LOCATION	in the
Seventeenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Philip A. Bruce	PERSON	, and the limited field selected has been so search - ingly explored that it is safe to say the work has been done once for all .

		Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	, as secre - tary of the
Virginia Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, has had familiar access to a wealth of materials , which he has handled in a most scholarly and critical way .

		The mass of material available is so great that the author 's original intention of writing
Virginia	LOCATION	's economic history to the time of the Civil War was abandoned .

		Other abstinences are not so pardonable , but are due to too rigid an adherence to a table of categories .

		In the preface we are told that the general subject of Virginian history , apart from the course of events , falls under the following heads : Eco - nomic Condition , Social Life , Religious Estab - lishment and Moral Influences , Education , Mil - itary Regulations ,
Administration of Justice	ORGANIZATION	, Political System .

		Confining his investigations to the economic condition alone , the writer has sacrificed unity to system .

		He says : '' No references have been made to printing in Vir - ginia in the seventeenth century , and the degree to which books entered into the inventories of the planters ' es - tates , because such references , it appeared , would more properly come under the head of Education .

		For the same reason , the question as to how far bricks were employed in the construction of church edifices in that age has not been touched upon at length in the descrip - tion of the use of this material in houses , because it seemed to be more consistent to include it under the head of the
Religious Establishment	ORGANIZATION	.

		For the same rea - son , also , the scope of taxation and the powers of the vestries have only been dwelt upon incidentally to facts relating directly to the economic condition of the peo - ple .

		A full account of both would with more fitness be given under the head of the political system . ''

		It may be questioned whether this mechan - ical partitioning of the field of history would allow of good results even if one assumed that all the six other departments made by Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	are to be presented to us with the same thoroughness which his section has enjoyed .

		But , as it is , one misses from these volumes just such material as has been omitted purposely .

		Some explanation of the parish system and of the methods of taxation are essential , even in an economic history , to an intelligent compre - hension of the subject by anyone who is not a historical scholar .

		While thus confining his history too rigidly to satisfy the reader , who will hardly live to see all the field occupied by as able pioneers as this one , Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	has neg - lected little inside his own boundaries . ''

		Rea - sons for the Colonization of
Virginia	LOCATION	'' intro - duces us to chapters on the physical character and the Indian economy of the aboriginal pe - riod .

		Four chapters on agricultural develop - ment follow ; and another on the acquisition of title to land leads on to a discussion of the sys - tem of labor with the '' servant '' and the slave .

		Other chapters treat of the domestic economy of the planter , of the relative value of estates , of money , and of manufactured supplies , and a final chapter is given to the town .

		The recog - nition of Captain
John Smith	PERSON	, as '' the real founder of
Virginia	LOCATION	, the one man who early rec - ognized , and who labored hard while in power to carry out , the true principles of action which should have been followed by the small band of colonists planted on the Powhatan , '' is given with no uncertain sound , and is refreshing after so much that has been written in disparage - ment of that truly great man .

		It is shown that
Smith	PERSON	was not the only farsighted and wise man in the colony whose admirable counsels were overruled by the shortsighted desire of the managers in
England	LOCATION	for an immediate return on investments .

		Gates must share with
Smith	PERSON	in the credit for statesmanlike breadth and prevision .

		Such men as these opposed as mo - tives of the original adventure the search for the precious metals and for a way to the
South Sea	LOCATION	, and laid emphasis on the other reasons which the writer so admirably sets forth new sources of raw materials for the industrial life of
England	LOCATION	, new markets for English goods , new fields for the growing population of the
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 269 mother land , and new political barriers against the formidable power of
Spain	LOCATION	all of which were justified in the event .

		Every chapter is packed with details of the immediate subject in hand , but those which make the most distinct contribution to historical literature discuss the servant , land tenure , and agriculture .

		The peculiar institution of the servant is handled with accuracy and discernment , although the atmosphere is too much that of condonation of an essentially vicious system as bad if not worse than that of slavery .

		Yet the writer is to be thanked for his successful vindication of this unfortunate class from the foul aspersions upon them that have become historic in a famous retort of
Ben Butler	PERSON	.

		Many of these so-called criminals were political offenders in a time of civil war , and many others were the victims of the kidnapper .

		It is maintained , with much force , that in the beginning the cul - ture of tobacco was an economic necessity , and in no small degree continued to be such .

		Yet of this culture the system of large estates was a result , and not as is commonly supposed of the existence of slavery .

		This manorial sys - tem , which made a land of no cities and of few towns , produced that political result which so largely differentiated
Virginia	LOCATION	from New En - gland , and yet which made her the '' mother of statesmen . ''

		It would take much more space than we can command to expatiate upon the merits of these volumes .

		A few shortcomings may be noted .

		One would not infer from Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	's allusion to the
Roanoke Island	LOCATION	colonists that he had read Professor Weeks ' able paper on that sub - ject , published by the
Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is not accurate to speak of an emperor at
Moscow	LOCATION	in the sixteenth century .

		One would naturally infer from the statement on page 41 of Volume I. that
McClure	PERSON	sailed around the northern end of the American continent in
1852	DATE	.

		When reading of the controversy in the
Stuart	PERSON	days over the importation of
Virginia	LOCATION	tobacco , one turns in vain to the bibliography for a reference to
Hall	PERSON	's '' Customs-Revenue of
England	LOCATION	'' ; a reference needed , if only to cor - rect some of the errors of temper as well as of statement of that somewhat bilious writer .

		It would be difficult to say what is the thought in the sentence beginning at the bottom of page 75 in the first volume .

		The same may be said of the sentence at the bottom of page 314 .

		On page 90 , again , we are told of '' planks twenty yards in length and two and a half feet square . ''

		On page 158 of the second volume the shingle used is described as '' a square oblong piece of cypress or pine wood . ''

		But these are mere specks on the sun , and do not impair the value of a book which is a marvel of minute detail and of critical fairness of judgment .


JOHN J. HALSEY	PERSON	.

		THE FAR EASTERN QTJESTIOX .

		* Premier Bourgeois recently declared that if the Chinese administration was reorganized by Europeans his
Government	ORGANIZATION	would see that
France	LOCATION	got her share of the offices .

		This is a refreshing manifestation of the feeling in the Cabinets of
Europe	LOCATION	, a spiritual inheritance from Alexander VI. , perhaps , that all outer - barbarians may most suitably be used to com - plete some list of colonial possessions .

		It also suggests that since the war between
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, Russian , French , and English states - men have another '' Sick Man '' on their hands , not in extremis , as that expensive patient at
Constantinople	LOCATION	appeared to be some months ago , but certainly sick enough to lead them to consider the best means of getting their just portion of the estate .

		And so it happens that there is a Far Eastern Question , not less puz - zling in its possibilities than the ever unan - swered
Eastern Question	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume in which Mr.
Valentine Chirol	PERSON	discusses this new situation is unusually enlight - ening .

		Unlike an anonymous writer in a re - cent number of the '' Fortnightly Review , '' he thinks Lord
Rosebery	PERSON	may have been right in refusing to join
Russia	LOCATION	in the protest against the permanent Japanese occupation of the pen - insula of Liao-tung provided for by the treaty of
Shimonoseki	LOCATION	.


Japan	LOCATION	's friendship , deserved by this refusal , may be more valuable in the immediate future than the dubious gratitude of
China	LOCATION	which the opposite policy would have called forth .

		Nevertheless , Mr.
Chirol	PERSON	does not fail to recognize the substantial gains in control over the Peking authorities
Russia	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	won by taking skilful advantage of the position their successful intervention assured them .

		The old policy of
England	LOCATION	in the
Far East	LOCATION	rested on the doctrine that there was immense latent power in the Chinese Empire ; but the war has so effectually disposed of this venera - ble tradition that the confidence with which it * THB FAB EASTERN QUESTION .

New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		270 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, was announced up to within the past few months seems now almost incredible .

		The country has great natural resources , doubtless , and the peo - ple are industrious , and yet these advantages are neutralized by a thoroughly corrupt admin - istrative system .

		Says Mr.
Chirol	PERSON	, in giving his impressions after a visit there : '' Nowhere in Peking could the faintest indication be detected of a desire to apply , or even of a capacity to understand , the lessons of the recent war .

		A more hope - less spectacle of fatuous imbecility , made up in equal parts of arrogance and helplessness , than the
Central Government	ORGANIZATION	of the
Chinese Empire	ORGANIZATION	presented after the actual pressure of war had been removed it is almost impossible to conceive . ''

		Mr.
Chirol	PERSON	seems to have had remarkable opportunities of forming an intelligent opinion , especially through an inter view with the
Tsungli	PERSON	-
Yamen	PERSON	, or board of Foreign Eelations , and dur - ing a call upon Li
Hung Chang	PERSON	at Tientsin on his return from Peking .

		Li
Hung Chang	PERSON	asked him why he had remained so much longer than he had intended in the Chinese capital . ''

		I replied that I had been looking for some sign of the awakening of
China	LOCATION	. '

		I hope , ' rejoined the Viceroy with a grim smile , that your time has not been wasted . '

		In one sense certainly , as I assured his Excellency , my time had not been wasted , for I had at least satisfied myself that the search upon which I had been engaged was a futile one . ''

		If such be the condition of the Chinese Em - pire , the judicious use of pressure exercised through the channels of diplomacy , but made effective by suggestive displays of military and naval power , is the secret of successful negotia - tion with the
Son of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	.

		Eussia and
France	LOCATION	understood this perfectly , and for the last year they have been browbeating
China	LOCATION	into one concession after another , the details of which are not yet fully known in
Western Europe	LOCATION	.

		But they were anxious first to rid themselves of their German ally , of whom they had no further need after the Japanese had yielded .

		Accordingly , the Eussian and French ministers suddenly discovered that they had letters giv - ing official notification of the accession of
Nich	ORGANIZATION	- olas II .

		and the election of President
Faure	PERSON	, which they had not delivered because of the war . ''

		With a curious affectation of impossible secrecy an audience was arranged , to which the Russian and French ministers proceeded in great state .

		There they received , according to their own account , in terms of unprece - dented cordiality , the solemn thanks of the
Son of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	himself for the great services rendered to him by their respective Governments .

		This was the first public intimation conveyed to
Germany	LOCATION	that her com - pany was no longer required or desired . ''


France	LOCATION	then ,
June 20	DATE	, under threats , compelled the President of the Tsungli-Yamen to sign a convention giving to her territory in the south which
England	LOCATION	ceded to
China	LOCATION	a little over a year ago on the understanding that it would not be transferred to any other Power without
England	LOCATION	's consent .

		Next ,
Eussia	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	together forced upon
China	LOCATION	a Franco-Eussian loan toward which proposals from either Brit - ish or German financiers were not to be re - ceived .

		But for a crisis in the
Paris	LOCATION	money market , this scheme to make
China	LOCATION	financially dependent on the two Powers might have suc - ceeded .


Paris	LOCATION	, however , has been unable to furnish all the money needed to cover the war indemnity .

		Consequently , within the last few weeks , as Mr.
Chirol	PERSON	foresaw , an Anglo-Ger - man loan of .16,000,000 has been negotiated .

		This event leaves the triumph of
France	LOCATION	and
Eussia	LOCATION	impaired , especially as
England	LOCATION	will probably never permit the
June	DATE	convention to be carried out , because it would more firmly fix the hold of the French on the upper Mekong and would still further threaten English con - trol of the Yang-tsze-Kiang valley .

		Mean - while , the Western world is filled with rumors of extraordinary privileges granted Eussia in the North , rights of way for the Trans-Siberian railroad , ice-free ports for the
navy	ORGANIZATION	, and the like .

		In view of the trade the British have built up in the
Far East	LOCATION	, this new turn of affairs must seem ominous to Englishmen .

		It is an open question , therefore , in spite of what Mr.
Chirol	PERSON	says , if it would not have been wiser for En - gland to have accepted
Eussia	ORGANIZATION	's invitation , extended to her before it was sent to
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, and to have arranged for joint diplomatic action against
Japan	LOCATION	's proposed seizure of Leao-tong , since an agreement at this point might have opened the way for a friendly settlement of all outstanding questions between
Eussia	ORGANIZATION	and
England	LOCATION	.

		Moreover , had
England	LOCATION	met
Eussia	ORGANIZATION	's views in
Eastern Asia	LOCATION	, perhaps the attempt to intervene in
Armenia	LOCATION	would not have proved such a discreditable failure .

		Mr.
Chirol	PERSON	's book throws considerable light also on the industrial situation .

		From his study of the rapid economic development of
Japan	LOCATION	, he believes the Japanese will soon be
England	LOCATION	's most dangerous competitors in the Chinese mar - ket .

		His remarks carry the suggestion that the two island empires may not always be friendly .

		Mr.
Chirol	PERSON	's analysis of the situation in the
Far East	LOCATION	is supported by the opinions of the Eight Hon.
George N. Curzon	PERSON	,
Under-Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	in the
Salisbury Cabinet	LOCATION	, expressed in the revised edition , just published , of his `` Prob - lems of the Far East . ''

		One glances over Mr.
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 271
Curzon	PERSON	's pages with more than ordinary curi - osity because his present position in the For - eign Office might give his book a quite unusual authority , but the new preface intimates with disappointing clearness that he has drawn solely from the deep well of his own private wisdom .

		Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	has certainly had the good for - tune , rare among seers , of reprinting verbatim et literatim , to the confusion of skeptical critics , prophecies made in the first edition of his book just before the war .

		For example , he wrote then and repeats now , '' The Chinese army , under Chinese officers , even with muskets in its hands and cartridges in its pouches , is an undisciplined rabble of tramps . ''

		The chief value of this edition , besides being an exhibit of prophecy fulfilled , consists in the chapter on '' After the War , '' and particularly in that por - tion of the chapter which gives the story of
Japan	LOCATION	's efforts to force reform in
Korea	LOCATION	from
1894	DATE	to the close of the
summer of 1895	DATE	.

		This story presents a side of the recent conflict in the
East	LOCATION	which reflects no especial credit upon the good sense of Japanese statesmen .

		The utter failure of the plan and the general conse - quences of the war have changed
Korea	LOCATION	, says Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	, into the powder magazine of the
East	LOCATION	.

		He predicts that we shall hear of this '' last of the nations and most miserable of peo - ples '' again before long ; and since he wrote
Korea	LOCATION	has furnished the spectacle of another palace revolution , with
Russia	LOCATION	and not
Japan	LOCATION	as the solicitous friend .

		The importance of Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	's utterances would have been increased had they been writ - ten with the
Mekong Settlement	ORGANIZATION	before him and the rumors of Russian aggression sound - ing in his ears , but even though they antedate the latest turns of the kaleidoscope , one or two gain a special interest from his present respon - sibilities .

		In explaining the attitude of
Great Britain	LOCATION	toward Russian advance he points out the dangers to British shipping in the Yellow Sea from a Russian port and fleet in the
Gulf of Fe-chi-li	ORGANIZATION	, and says that Russian squadrons , with permanent quarters at
Port Lazareff	LOCATION	and Fusan on the eastern coast of
Korea	LOCATION	, would seriously jeopardize , if not absolutely overturn , the balance of power in the
Far East	LOCATION	, and adds that to such an issue ''
England	LOCATION	is prohibited alike by her imperial objects and her commer - cial needs from lending her sanction . ''

		Al - though , like Mr.
Chirol	PERSON	, Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	says
China	LOCATION	'' appears to have learned nothing , and , what is worse , to have unlearned nothing from the war , '' he differs from Mr.
Chirol	PERSON	in feeling , if not thinking , that
China	LOCATION	may yet turn to
Great Britain	LOCATION	for support , because
Great Britain	LOCATION	has shown herself more disinterested than the others .

		He obviously does not relish the policy of intimate relations with the bumptious Jap - anese , who , moreover , he also believes are des - tined soon to make serious inroads on British trade in
China	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	prints as appendices the
Revis	PERSON	- ion Treaty between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, giving the Japanese their long-desired judicial autonomy , and the
Treaty of Peace	ORGANIZATION	between
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, signed at
Shimonoseki	LOCATION	.


HENRY E. BOURNE	PERSON	.

		BETTERS AND VERSES OF DEAN STANLEY .

		* The editor of the recently issued '' Letters and Verses of Stanley '' has erred , if at all , in rejecting too scrupulously those letters which reveal the personal life of the great liberal min - ister and scholar .

		Yet this fault is much rather to be pardoned than the opposite one which pa - rades the sacred privacy of a great man 's heart and hearth before the wanton curiosity of an alien public .

		One must feel on reading the Letters that we have in the volume all that a typical Englishman like
Dean Stanley	PERSON	, guard - ing his house as his castle , would willingly con - cede even to his admirers ; in a word , that the Editor has met the first requirement of an ed - itor of private correspondence , and treated it in accordance with the probable wishes of the writer of the letters .

		The result for the read - ing public is quite distinct : a certain revela - tion of Dean
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's tastes and opinions , though little that is new ; some additional con - tribution to the picture of
Thomas Arnold	PERSON	letters that would find appropriate place in a supplement to
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's `` Life of Arnold '' ; considerable material supplementary to his `` Sinai and Palestine '' ; and so on with his other books ; finally a few interesting letters from
Jowett	PERSON	, several letters by
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	from
America	LOCATION	, and his verses .

		There is nothing in these letters to alter the opinion which prevails of Dean Stanley as an eminently wholesome , cheerful Englishman , who spent not overmuch time worrying as to the scheme of the universe and his position in it , but took things as he found them , lived cleanly and loftily , and did conscientiously what * LETTKRS AND VERSES OF

		272 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, he found to do .

		That he was not , at least in his youth , so different from other men , is shown in his letters telling of his presenting his prize poem ''
Charles Martel	PERSON	'' before the school at Rugby .

		He writes to his sister Mary : '' I have been pondering a new coat , but I have at last come to the conclusion that the one I had at the ball will do .

		The only objection is that when , in speak - ing the English verse , I stretch forth my hand in action , the sleeves , being rather short , come down ; but I can remedy that by a long shirt sleeve , and perhaps my forefinger turned down upon the rebellious coat-sleeve . ''

		Doubtless the absence of letters describing spiritual wrestlings is not proof conclusive that the young man had none , yet the editor would probably not have withheld such .

		And the at - titude of the man 's mind seems frankly ex - pressed in these extracts : '' I know of no system to which I can hold except
Arnold 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		I feel that to become a Newrnanist would be a shock to my whole existence , that it would subvert every relation of life in which I have stood or hoped to stand hereafter .

		I dread to think of it even as a pos - sibility , and I dread also the possibility of a long and dreary halting between two opinions which will mar the pleasure of every opinion I hold for an indefinite period .

		With this feeling you may be sure I shall not join it without a desperate fight within and without , that I will leave no stone unturned which may enable me to keep in that line of life to which I had thought God had called me , and from which a conversion to Newmanism would lead me away into a path utterly unknown to me '' -LRB-
Feb. , 1838	DATE	-RRB- . ''

		I received a letter from
Arnold	LOCATION	which added what - ever could be added to the solemnity of the ordination -LSB- his own -RSB- , and softened whatever could be softened of the bitterness of subscription . '' ''

		The real thing which long ago moved me to wish to go into orders , and which , had I not gone into or - ders I should have acted upon as well as I could with - out orders , was the fact that God seemed to have given me gifts more fitting me for orders , and for that partic - ular line of clerical duty which I have chosen , than for any other '' -LRB-
Feb. , 1840	DATE	-RRB- .

		One of the most beautiful things about
Stan	PERSON	- ley was his devotion to
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		His '' Life and Correspondence of Thomas Arnold '' is inspired by the very spirit of
Arnold	LOCATION	, and will remain the best of his published works .

		But a more touching memorial of this love '' pass - ing the love of woman '' is the annual letter to Mrs.
Arnold	PERSON	or her children on the anniversary of
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's death , with its ever renewed testi - mony to the immortality of the inspiration of the great
Rugby Master	ORGANIZATION	's life and teaching . ''

		Risest thou thus , dim dawn , again , '' so , but with less sadness , rings the keynote of the se - ries from
1847	DATE	to
1880	DATE	when the last was writ - ten to '' My Dear Fan , '' Mrs.
Arnold	PERSON	having died several years before . ''

		I anticipate by one day the letter which I always wrote to your dear mother at this time , that you may get it in the midst of dear
Matthew	PERSON	's home .

		I am going to give an address to a school on your father , and I shall make it , as at Rugby , on the two words whose meaning and hope
Matthew	PERSON	told me that we had both learned from the same source Religion and History .

		... How I seem to see him towering above the rest of the world , amidst all the changes that have happened since !

		How I trust to what he taught us and what he showed us !

		... We are on a little island of memory , and all who share in that memory must hold together as long as life lasts . ''

		Whether Stanley wrote the anniversary letter for the next year does not appear , and he died a month after it was due ,
July 18 , 1881	DATE	.

		Americans will of course be interested in the letters from
America	LOCATION	.

		On the voyage the Dean coached for the approaching contact with the new country , as indicated in the following : '' I can now repeat the names of all the Presidents , and explain the meaning of Democrat and Republican .

		Democrat is Liberal , and Repub - lican is Conservative . ''

		Like all foreigners he was looking for something that would '' smack of the soil , '' and found it in a wild Westerner who said , `` I was that sick that I almost brought up my knee-pans '' ; as well as in a choice col - lection of Americanisms more or less recogniz - able .

		He attended the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Salem and heard Story 's poem . ''

		I thought it quite magnifi - cent in its tone .

		It denounced the follies and corruptions of the
United States	LOCATION	with a vigor which I should have thought quite impossible to have been attempted . ''

		The society of Bos - ton struck him as very like that of
Geneva	LOCATION	, '' the most civilized in
Europe	LOCATION	the same uni - form amount of intelligence and cultivation in all the families all well-conditioned , and all intermarried with each other . ''

		The editor has modestly chosen the designa - tion '' Verses '' for Dean
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's few rhymed effusions .

		The student of literature may find room for interesting reflections in the fact that the man who wrote the prize poem at Rugby in
1832	DATE	, and again at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	in
1837	DATE	, was so lack - ing in the divine afflatus as these verses show .

		Stanley as a poet tempts to a comparison with Luther , for while he has a few pieces in lighter vein , as '' The Bear of Bludan , '' and the valen - tine to Mrs.
Grote	PERSON	, his best work , indeed his only work worth considering , is his hymns .

		These treat the same themes as Luther 's hymns , and are in much the same spirit and quality of workmanship .

		There is a version of the
Dies Jrce	ORGANIZATION	in six-line stanzas , closely resembling the translations of
Walter Scott	PERSON	and
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	.

		Resemblance to some version of this much - translated hymn was of course inevitable .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 273 Among the best of the pieces in this line are those beginning : '' When the
Pascal	PERSON	evening fell , '' '' Let us with a gladsome mind , '' and es - pecially `` Where is the Christian 's fatherland ? ''

		Of this last , imitated from
Arndt	PERSON	's famous poem '' What is the German 's fatherland ? ''

		the last stanza runs : '' Thy native home is wheresoe'er Christ 's spirit breathes a holier air ; Where Christ-like Faith is keen to seek What Truth or Conscience freely speak Where Christ-like love is keen to span The rents that sever man from man Where round God 's throne His just ones stand There ,
Christian	LOCATION	, is thy Fatherland . ''

		It is strange , by the way , that there is such absolute absence of any influence of
Tennyson	LOCATION	on
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's poetic taste .

		Indeed ,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Dickens	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, seem not to have been within his horizon .

		TRIBAL , SOCIETY AS ILLUSTRATED IN
WALES	LOCATION	.

		* Twelve years ago Mr.
Seebohm	PERSON	put forth '' The English Village Community , '' the sixth chapter of which dealt with the tribal system in
Wales	LOCATION	.

		His latest work , '' The Tribal Sys - tem in
Wales	LOCATION	, '' is an expansion of that chap - ter .

		In method of treatment it differs greatly from its predecessor .

		That was a comparative study English ,
Welsh	ORGANIZATION	,
Irish	LOCATION	, and ancient Roman institutions all coming within the pur - view of the author .

		This , in the author 's words , is '' confined to an attempt to understand the structure of tribal society in
Wales	LOCATION	.

		The meth - ods of tribal society in
Wales	LOCATION	and the extension of the inquiry to other tribal systems are left to form the subject of another volume '' -LRB- p. v. -RRB- .

		This purpose is rigidly adhered to , and no - where do we find a suggestion of that contro - versial spirit displayed in '' The English Vil - lage Community . ''

		But though maintaining this position of neutrality with respect to the evi - dence he adduces , Mr.
Seebohm	PERSON	's end in view is none the less evident .

		Throughout the en - tire work , influences in accord with Mr.
See	PERSON	- bohm 's well-known opinions irresistibly force themselves upon us .

		We find no ideas advanced to bias the judgment simply a statement of facts ; but these facts are so artfully mustered and massed that the continuity of argument , even if only suggested , and that ever so faintly , is complete , and in the end appeals with aston - ishing power .

		* THE TKIEAL SYSTEM IN
WALES	LOCATION	.

		Being part of an inquiry into the structure and methods of
Tribal Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		By Sir
Frederic Seebohm	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green	ORGANIZATION	, & .

		Co. .

		The documentary sources upon which Mr.
Seebohm	PERSON	has based his study consist of the Extents , Court Rolls , and Assessments of the Isle of
Anglesey	LOCATION	, from the year
1294	DATE	to
1352	DATE	; but from these he has necessarily worked back to the ancient laws of
Wales	LOCATION	and ecclesias - tical donations of the pre-Norman era .

		The fact that Mr.
Seebohm	PERSON	can not read the Welsh language is no bar , for the documents are all in
Latin	LOCATION	.

		Curious cases are discernible in reading the sources , showing the difficulty Ed - ward 's lawyers had in discovering a Latin term to define a purely Welsh institution -LRB- e. g. , p. 3 -RRB- , precisely the same problem which faced the Roman historian Tacitus in describing the man - ners and customs of the ancient Germans .

		But Mr.
Seebohm	PERSON	's hours of study have not been confined merely to the alcoves of the
Record Office	ORGANIZATION	, or the MS. department of the British Museum .

		As a member of the
Royal Commis	ORGANIZATION	- sion to investigate the Welsh land-system , he has actually traversed the entire land of which he writes .

		The basis of '' The Tribal System in
Wales	LOCATION	, '' however , is the documents pertain - ing to the so-called '' manors '' of Aberffraw and
Denbigh	LOCATION	, upon the Isle of
Anglesey	LOCATION	.

		The reason for so doing is that here , more than anywhere else in
Wales	LOCATION	, Welsh tribal customs are likely to be seen in their purity .

		The tenacity of the Welsh tribal system is astonishing , for its inte - gral structure survived '' the wreckful siege of battering days , '' the conquests of
Henry II	ORGANIZATION	.

		and
Edward I.	PERSON	, plague and famine , and as one has finely said , '' the slow assay of time until the final institution of the English law under
Henry VIII	PERSON	. ''

		The '' manor '' of Aberffraw is shown to have consisted of demesne land held by free tenants who occupied weles or gwelys , while the unfree villani occupied outlying hamlets .

		The ques - tion then arises , What was a wele ?

		The an - swer is found in the Denbigh Extent -LRB- 8 Ed - ward III. , see Appendix B -RRB- , which '' seems to be the only one which meets the requirements of the case .

		It was made before the ' Black Death . '

		It relates to a mainly pastoral dis - trict which continued to a large extent under the rules of ancient custom .

		It gives the name of every tenant , and has , moreover , distinct reference to a condition of things both before and after the conquest of
North Wales	LOCATION	'' -LRB- p. 30 -RRB- .

		It is evident that the weles are of free tribesmen who are said to hold in weles and gavells , and further evidence shows that the wele was a fam - ily group including great-great-grandsons , with sub-divisions into gavells .

		Thus the Welsh 274 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, land was occupied by so many joint-family com - munities embracing subordinate family groups .

		The wele is , therefore , a division of the tribe , not of the land , holding an undivided share in the occupation of a district -LRB- pp. 31-4 -RRB- .

		Turning from the kindred-group to the land it occupied , we find the lowest land unit in the surveys called villata .

		These villatce are fixed and permanent units , while the wele itself was not compact , but could enjoy separate holdings in several villatce , or be confined , as the case might be , to one villata .

		It is impossible , how - ever , to go into the details of tribal structure described by Mr.
Seebohm	PERSON	: they are welcome additions to our knowledge of early institutions .

		The main interest lies in the fact that in this tribal society of
Wales	LOCATION	one sees a nucleus of the later manor .

		This is nowhere stated , but the inference drawn from the consideration of the evidence in hand is that the old English manor had an admixture of Welsh elements in it , and the corollary of this inference is that the English conquest of
Britain	LOCATION	was not as de - structive as some students would have us think .

		This interest is heightened by the fact that the Welsh constitution contained unmistakable feudal origins , and these , strange to say , are not so much of a political or economic charac - ter as military .

		Undoubtedly feudalism is neither wholly Roman nor wholly German in origin , but rather social and economic : given certain conditions and certain effects will fol - low , whether in
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	or in
India	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The Welsh chieftain called a uchelwr was a privileged tribesman , head of a wele , a landed lord , and in
South Wales	LOCATION	a judge also -LRB- pp. 54 , 90 , 93 , 127 -RRB- .

		The other members of the wele were not joint-tenants or * landed ' persons , but were in a subordinate position and had rights of maintenance only -LRB- p. 91 -RRB- .

		Every innate boneddig or tribesman of full blood claimed his maintenance as mem - ber of the greater kindred-group and not by inheritance from his father .

		He ascended to his father 's privilege as a landed person at his father 's death , but the right of succession was prospective he might live and die without such ascent .

		When he did ascend to the privilege of his father he became a marchog or mounted horseman .

		Thus in the military constitution of the tribe the uchelwr is a horseman , the in - nate boneddig a foot-soldier -LRB- p. 91-5 -RRB- .

		The evolution of this feudal system Mr.
Seebohm	PERSON	presents as follows : '' Under the tribal system the wele is the unit .

		The brenhin -LRB- privileged chieftain or prince -RRB- and the mem - bers of his wele form the royal and ruling class .

		The breyrs or uchelwrs , heads of weles with the innate boned - digs under them , form the second class of free tribes - men .

		The villeins , or strangers in blood , form the third class ; and beneath all these were the cceths or slaves , who could be bought and sold . ''

		The extraordinary solidarity of the kindreds and the tribe a solidarity to which history bears ample testi - mony was gained at the expense of the freedom and equality of the individual tribesmen .

		And little as the Codes reveal to us of the actual condition of the Cym - ric tribesmen , it is impossible to shut our eyes to the easy possibility of oppression on the part of chieftains and uchelwrs .

		It is easy to see how , if such was the structure of the Gallic tribes described by
Caesar	PERSON	, his description of tribal society might well be , in measure at least , typical of tribal society generally in its early stages .

		It might , under the pressure of want on the part of the tribesmen or the unscrupulous use of power on the part of the uchelwrs or higher chieftains , easily come to pass that the mass of tribesmen , with their bare rights of maintenance and a peculium subject to the vicissitudes of fortune , elsewhere than in the
Gaul of Caesar	ORGANIZATION	's description might become almost the serfs of the uchelwrs , or , as he describes them , the servi of the equites '' -LRB- p. 109 -RRB- .

		These feudal forms suggest a bond between tribal society and feudal society , and also have their direct bearing , as is shown -LRB- p. 130 -RRB- , upon early English institutions .

		If Mr.
Seebohm	PERSON	had done nothing else in these pages than bring the light of Welsh forms to bear upon our knowledge of feudalism and the manorial sys - tem , his book would have been a notable one .

		As it is , he has advanced some other facts which will set the student of early English institutions to earnest thinking .

		For example , in the case of a criminal who was banished from Cymru , '' it was required of every one of every sex and age within hearing of the horn to follow that exile , and to keep up the barking of dogs , to the time of his putting to sea , until he shall have passed three-score hours out of sight '' -LRB- p. 59 -RRB- .

		This at once sug - gests the old English ordinance of the hundred .

		Evidently here in
Wales	LOCATION	we have the folk of a district responsible for oversight of a criminal .

		Few questions in English institutional history have so eluded settlement by sincere and pro- found investigators as that of the origin and early character of the hundred .

		Historians from
Spelman	ORGANIZATION	down to
Stubbs	PERSON	and
Freeman	PERSON	have tried in vain and in many ways to explain the origin and early character of the hundred .

		Phillips ,
Turner	ORGANIZATION	, and Palgrave give up in des - pair .

		Lingard opposes the view of everybody else , and has none of his own .

		Spelman , rea - soning from analogy in the frank-pledge , refers it to a similar responsible group .

		So does
Leo	PERSON	.

		Verelius and
Grimm	PERSON	hold that the hundred
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 275 was an area comprising a hundred vittce or hamlets .

		Schmidt holds that it was an area of a hundred hides of land .

		Ihre makes it a re - cruiting district of a hundred men for battle .

		Lappenberg 's opinion is much the same .


Eich	PERSON	- horn , withKemble and
Konrad Maurer	PERSON	, believes that it was in its origin a personal division , and became territorial at the end of the nomadic period , through the occupation by each century of a district to dwell in .

		Waitz so thinks , too , but pushes farther , and holds that each of the hundred men was given a hide of land .

		Finally ,
Stubbs	PERSON	says that the only reasonable conclusion is '' that under geographical hundreds we have the variously sized pagi or districts in which the hundred warriors settled ; the boundaries of these being determined by other causes , as the course of rivers , the ranges of hills , the distribution of estates to the chieftains , and the remnants of British independence '' -LRB- Const .

		Hist , of
England	LOCATION	, I. 106 -RRB- .

		Is it not possible that , at last , in this mere allusion of Stubbs to '' the remnants of British independence '' we have a clue to the hundred ?

		We have seen the similarity between the provisions of the criminal law in
Welsh	LOCATION	and English customs ; we have seen the similarity between the Welsh '' manor '' and the old English manor ; we have seen the marked military character of the Welsh tribal system , and over against this we put the strong military elements of the ancient German constitution the hundred and the comitatus .

		What is the inference ?

		that in the progress of the English conquest these similar institutions amalgamated in greater or less de - gree , precisely as on the Continent analagous Roman and German institutions combined in different proportions in
Frankish Gaul	LOCATION	,
Visi	PERSON	-
Gothic Spain	LOCATION	, and
Lombard Italy	LOCATION	.

		Other likenesses in
Welsh	LOCATION	and English insti - tutions fortify this inference .

		How else in Kent , most remote from
Wales	LOCATION	and the first land in
Britain	LOCATION	to be hallowed by the tread of men of the English kin , can the custom of gav - elkind be accounted for ?

		Gavelkind is not found in the lands conquered by Angles and Saxons .

		Plainly , the
Jutes	PERSON	, who in point of number were the least of the Teutonic invaders , succumbed more than has been supposed to the existing Welsh regime -LRB- cf. also pp. 79 , 86 , 88 , 95 , 101 , 106 -RRB- .

		It will not do for the advocate of the abso - lute purity of English institutions to wink at facts such as these Mr.
Seebohm	PERSON	has brought forward .

		As said in the beginning , he has no - where in his work applied the facts he has dis - covered , having left the extension of his inquiry to another time ; but while Mr.
Seebohm	PERSON	is writing his companion volume , it behooves the enthusiast for the purity of early English insti - tutions to redeem his time if he intends to re - fute Mr.
Seebohm	PERSON	's arguments , for the present work , in the opinion of the reviewer , constitutes the most formidable assault yet made upon the '' Teutonic School . ''

		It may be well , before making an end , to no - tice some features for the elucidation of which we are indebted to the present work : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The importance of land as an economic factor in the development of tribal society is emphasized .

		Blood relationship lay at the basis of the Welsh tribal society from the earliest times , but grad - ually proprietorship in land crept in .

		Yet the strength of the former tie is shown in that , like everything else , proprietorship was forced into a tribal mould .

		Whatever of land ownership grew up in the tribe was tribal ownership , but there was nothing like '' the modern democratic view of a society in which equality of rights and shares settled every question '' -LRB- p. 88 -RRB- .

		The kindred , to the ninth and fourth degree , were both related to the land , but through the wele , who was regarded as the land-owner of the district .

		In him were vested as landed pro- prietor the tribal rights of his wele , so far as regards land occupation -LRB- pp. 60 , 87-9 -RRB- .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- Mr.
Seebohm	PERSON	shows that the notion of private property was a late growth -LRB- p. 95 -RRB- , and that the idea of conveyance was `` foreign to the tribal system in its early stages , '' and due to the influence of the church -LRB- pp. 150 , 193 , 226-7 -RRB- .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- The infiltration of secular influ - ences into the Welsh church bears a striking resemblance to the history of the church among the
Franks	PERSON	.

		The church set itself to convert the tribal lords in
Wales	LOCATION	, and they , as the lords in
Frankish Gaul	PERSON	, immediately rushed into her offices ; the ecclesiastical abuses enumerated by Welsh historians might be taken , with the change of names of persons and places , for a page of
Gregory of Tours	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nothing has yet been said of the style of the work .

		As the reader has probably discovered , '' The Tribal System in
Wales	LOCATION	'' is not easy reading .

		And yet it is relieved here and there by touches of light and color which raise that page at least from the dull dust of economics .

		Such a page is that describing the hearth of the Welshman 's home , with the mark of the kindred upon it .

		We are told : '' The covering and uncovering of the fire had a pic - turesque significance .

		Whether the fire were of wood 276 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, or turf , the hearth was swept out every night .

		The next thing was to single out one particular glowing em - ber the seed of the fire which was carefully restored to the hearth and covered up with the remaining ashes for the night .

		This was the nightly covering of the fire .

		The morning process was to uncover the ' seed of fire , ' to sweep out the ashes under which it was hid , and then deftly to place back the live ember on the hearth , piling over it the fuel for the new day 's fire .

		This was the uncovering of the fire , which thus from year end to year end might never go out .

		Anyone who has seen the pro- cess performed on a Celtic hearth will understand the natural transition in the mind of the Welsh poet ,
Henry Vaughan	PERSON	, in his lines on Sleep , ' from the high-flown metaphor : ' The pious soul by night Is clouded like a star ... ' to the more homely one * Though sleep , like ashes , hide My lamp and life ... ' and see at once the symbolic significance '' -LRB- pp. 82-3 -RRB- .

		We shall look eagerly for Mr.
Seebohm	PERSON	's promised sequel , for the present work is prob - ably the most important contribution to insti - tutional history made by an English writer since the death of
Sir Henry Summer Maine	ORGANIZATION	.

		men can attain an independent judgment .

		The social ethics of Church , Family , Education , Indus - try , and Citizenship , are treated with ability and moral earnestness , though not without a bias which makes it necessary to go over the grounds of reason - ing for one 's self .

		The art of illustration is used with fine effect in the chapters of the book which set before us the '' Life of the Poor in Great Cities . ''

		Such men as Mr.
R. A. Woods	PERSON	, Mr.
J. A. Riis	PERSON	, and Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	bring to mind the various aspects of crowded misery , the hopes and needs of the distressed .

		American and European conditions are described .

		Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	writes with so much knowledge and spiritual force that he can afford to indulge repose in style .

		Every paragraph in his '' Ruling Ideas of the Present Age '' is instantly intelligible , and yet we are led to consider some of the most profound thoughts about life and duty .

		There is no pretense of scientific and technical discussion , or unfolding of economic or political doctrine , but '' ruling ideas '' are treated in the spirit of a seer , a prophet Fatherhood , Brotherhood Sacred and Secular , Prop - erty , Religion and Politics , Public Opinion ,
Phari	LOCATION	- saism , are some of the topics .

		It is always interesting to watch the play of a vigorous intellect about a social problem , and it is helpful to the unfolding of an argument when a sagacious and disciplined business man contributes his reflections .

		Mr.
O. D. Ashley	PERSON	, in '' Railways and their Employees , '' discusses the subject of the relations of corporations to their employees in close touch with the facts .

		He reasons from experience and successful trials , not from pure invention .

		He advises corporations to provide sick benefits , life insurance , pensions , out of income , and offers as a motive the more efficient and faithful service which would thus be secured .

		The examples of success - ful undertakings are found in European and Amer - ican life .

		He seems to have gathered his data while he was writing the book , a method which is natural enough to a busy tradesman , but has its disadvan - tages from the standpoint of thoroughness of treat - ment .

		He does not seem to be acquainted with some of the most important works on the subject nor with some of the most conspicuous examples of prosperous cooperation .

		His skepticism about co - operation initiated by workingmen may thus be partly accounted for .

		In spite of these limitations the academic defenders of the cooperation principle will justly be encouraged by the judgment of a leader in large enterprises .

		The author feels quite sure that Western railroads will never have an income sufficient to provide for pensions and insur - ance until the laws permit them to combine to stop rate-cutting .

		He does not seem to be aware that there are other leaks to be stopped .

		The popular belief about stock-watering , thefts by directors , un - fair contracts with freight companies , he does not consider .

		Government is necessary in order to protect national life and all its processes and goods .

		But when we go so far we must go forward .

		The protection of life and property means more than militia and police ; it involves education , poor relief , and the use of the governmental machinery as the organ of pub - lic convenience .

		Government tends to develop a sense of solidarity , a deep social consciousness of unity and sympathy . ''

		The social consciousness , in proportion as it is real , demands government under existing circumstances ; but finally the social consciousness may be so perfect that government will be allowed to drop away like an out-grown shell . ''

		The attempt is made to judge the recent Pullman strike in the light of the ethical principles of the book .

		The small volume on '' Labor in its Relations to Law '' is a very convenient summary of the com - mon and statute law in force in this country in re - spect to the employment contract , strikes , boycotts , and the various questions connected with these phe - nomena .

		The author is to issue a larger '' Hand - book '' on the same subject .

		The chapters here no - ticed were given at the
Plymouth School of Ethics	ORGANIZATION	in
1895	DATE	.

		The main thesis of '' Our Industrial Utopia '' is that we are sick from superfluity and victims of imagination .

		It is not necessity which torments us , nor corporations which oppress us , but the craving for more superfluity which goads and vexes us .

		The defence of corporations ,
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	,
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, and trusts , is so rare in our days as to be positively interesting .

		A public sated with attacks on '' bloated bondholders '' and vile '' money-bags '' and '' unscrup - ulous trusts , '' `` vampires , '' and `` Octopus , '' may here find rest and refreshment before renewing the attack .


Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	, spite of recent crit - icism , is canonized and his image restored to its pedestal .

		It is true the author seems to be able to go through our cities with eyes , ears , and heart tight shut , but in many points , spite of his '' mind-cure '' panacea , he launches some keen shafts .

		In our age , when the socialistic tendency is dominant to monot - ony , such a book may be condiment , and appetizes , even if it does not provide nutriment .

		The recent death of '' Stepniak '' will give added interest to his '' King
Stork	ORGANIZATION	and
King Log	PERSON	, a Study of
Modern Russia	LOCATION	. ''

		To those who peer into the cloudland of Russian political and ecclesiastical despotism , these pages may afford some help .

		We can hardly expect absolute history from the radical and persecuted exile .

		But studying the mind of Stepniak we are weighing some of the forces which work , even by methods of human wrath , toward a clearer day and a happier lot .

		Americans will find in the first volume a brief but sympathetic account of the sect of Stnndists and the way in which the
Russian Government	ORGANIZATION	has treated them .

		The style is free from violence and exaggeration , but the most calm recital of facts , if they be facts , fills one with distress and indignation .

		Professor
Patten	PERSON	has written some extremely sug - gestive chapters , in his '' Theory of Social Forces , '' on the social forces which make for progress .

		In the earlier part of the essay there seems to be some doubtful and not entirely luminous reasoning about the origins of '' mental mechanism '' and biological impulses to progress ; but the chapters on '' A Social Commonwealth '' and '' Normal Progress '' move on modern and more stable ground , where there is less reason and room for wise guesses .

		Physical forces are given due place ; aesthetic factors are highly honored ; economic elements are clearly treated ; and , what has been rare in such purely academic and scientific discussions , the essential religious and Christian ideals are frankly recognized among the agencies of progress .

		This portion of the essay must be regarded as a most important contribution to the discussion , as it helps to restore the balance of thought , to present the spiritual beliefs in some - thing like a true perspective , and to help men of our age over the superficial criticism of Comte which was carried forward on the powerful current of his magnificent scheme of social philosophy .

		There is here a chance to run out beyond strict science to the visions of the author 's individual Weltanschauung a sort of
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	hierarchy -LRB- p. 129 -RRB- .

		The national feeling is treated with scant justice -LRB- p. 102 -RRB- .

		Why should it cease any more than friend - ship or domestic attachments ?

		Why should patriot - ism contradict philanthropy ?

		The denial of the possibility of a social philosophy because we can not compare the human race with the races which in - habit other planets seems fanciful , although we can - not doubt that a better philosophy will arise when we have wings or other means of communication with our nearest neighbors .

		The suggestion -LRB- p. 150 -RRB- that moral feelings are impediments to progress arises from a too narrow and negative definition of morality .

		If morality is conceived as a positive force under the Golden Rule it would have no such tendency as the author imagines .

		No student of social pathology and of charitable work can afford to miss the annual Reports of the
National Conference of Charities	ORGANIZATION	and Corrections .

		They are simply indispensable .

		The `` Charities Review '' has now practically become the monthly organ of the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	and will serve as a constant reminder of its work .

		The last Report shows two new elements , the work of the scientific theorists of the colleges and universities , and the work of the residents in Social Settlements .

		The latter feature is to be even more prominent in the future .

		278 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, RELIGIOUS -LSB- LITERATURE , THEORETICAL , AND PRACTICAL .

		* Those who find any discouragement in the fact that the religious literature of our time is filled with bold and sharp criticism , should be encouraged by the further fact that it is also practical in many new ways ; in many new ways strives to understand and remove the evils that have so long vexed society .

		We have nothing to apprehend from criticism , al - though it may seem to be destructive in form , so long as it is associated with an active corrective mood of mind .

		The religious literature which flows in upon us in full stream aims , much of it , at a regen - eration of life which must , in the end , put us in firmer possession of spiritual truth .

		It is certainly well to know of the doctrine , by doing the will of God . ''

		The Messages of the Seven Churches of
Asia	LOCATION	'' demands respect both by the excellency of its pur - pose and by the diligence with which it is pursued .

		It is intended for good old-fashion people , of whom we are glad to believe there are many , and will bring to them comfort and that form of edifi - cation of which they are capable .

		It is written under the ruling idea that every portion of Scrip - ture has a specific and divine purpose by which it is united with every other portion , and that all taken together make a complete and immaculate record .

		It is not fitted , therefore , to play any part in current discussion , or to bring it any light .

		Fortunately the volume , though a large one , confines itself to the mere margin of the Apocalypse , and so saves the reader from a hopeless wandering among the prophetic imagery of which its body is made up .

		No one with the temper here indicated has ever pushed into the heart of the book and reached any - thing which could be called dry land .

		The volume shows somewhat , in spite of its unswerving belief , the modern method by giving the subject an histor - ical and geographical background .

		Compelled by the facts of the past to accept a figurative coming of
Christ	LOCATION	, it still clings , in reference to the future , with * THE MESSAGES OF THE SEVEN CHURCHES OF ASIA .

		undying faith to a judgment and a judgment-seat .

		`` The Johannean Problem '' is a clear and concise rendering of the argument for the authenticity of the fourth gospel . ''

		It is our purpose to summa - rize the evidence for the genuineness of the fourth gospel so far as ascertained at the present time . ''

		This task , certainly not an unimportant one , the author has satisfactorily performed .

		It would hardly be possible to find as much on this topic in as compact a form elsewhere .

		The work is thor - ough and candid .

		It is difficult to resist the force of the internal evidence , especially as presented by
Bishop Lightfoot	PERSON	. ''

		The Two
St. Johns	LOCATION	'' is a life of John the Dis - ciple and
John	PERSON	the Baptist , extended by reflection and enforcement after the manner of a sermon .

		It is a book of practical piety , of good taste and good judgment , and is fitted to render the service of a religious tract . ''

		Nature and Deity '' is a noteworthy book .

		The theme is treated in a comprehensive and penetrative way .

		The author shows a strong grasp of thought .

		The object of the volume is '' the rationalization of religion . ''

		This is to be done by finding in expe - rience widely interpreted the impulse and law of our religious life .

		This impulse is the quest of the ideal .

		Our religious life is given in our natural life .

		How given ?

		is the inquiry of our author .

		The suf - ficiency of natural law in the sphere of religion is the postulate of the book .

		It is well fitted , on the one hand , to steady the steps of those who are los - ing the footing of faith ; and to make , on the other hand , more cautious the steps of those who are pur - suing the unseen in a conventional and assured way .

		It is easy for us to accept the general conclusion of the book , though we can not feel that the inner force of truth receives quite equal emphasis with its outer form .

		The narrowing tendency of a primarily empirical inquiry seems to us to te distinctly pres - ent . ''

		Nature coheres by an imminent or inherent vital law . ''

		We are entitled to more than this .

		As certainly as a vital process transcends a mechanical one , so certainly does an intellectual and spiritual process surpass a vital one .

		Nature coheres by a complex process , both vital and spiritual .

		Neither do we think that religion is adequately represented as an effort to harmonize our lives with universal power .

		The religious life is harmonized with uni - versal power , but by virtue of a transcendent im - pulse .

		The difficulty here , however , may arise from the inability to say all things at once .

		It is a vol - ume worthy the consideration of those who study the inner reason of the ways of life .

		It is not possible to adequately characterize '' The Christ of To-Day '' in a brief space ; but we have no alternative .

		The temper of the book is of the best .

		There is much everywhere to which one would heartily assent .

		The enthusiasm with which the subject is presented is boundless .

		Yet one is not quite satisfied .

		There is too much rhetoric in the book for its best effect .

		Not that the rhetoric is bad ; on the other hand , it is good , but it leads
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 279 to an exaggeration and reiteration which are incon sistent with the clearest , most persuasive thought .

		The aim of the author is to enforce the divinity of Christ , especially on the practical side as the re - demptive force of the world .

		This aim is the exact opposite of that of the volume we have just consid - ered .

		The purpose of the one author is to find God in nature ; of the other , to find him in the revela - tion of Christ .

		In lucidity and closeness of thought , the first author has decidedly the advantage .

		Dr.
Gordon	PERSON	is not as explicit as his theme requires him to be on either of the two essential parts of his sub - ject : what is meant by the divinity of Christ , and how is the salvation of man involved in it .

		The difficulty with most persons who doubt this divinity is , that it seems to them an obscure , un verifiable dogma , and one , if accepted , of no obvious practical value .

		It is through the words of
Christ	LOCATION	, their truth and their love , that we find access to God ; not by virtue of any mystery of his being .

		Concerning this we are at liberty to maintain any theory which seems best to cover the facts ; knowing that any and every conception will be inadequate .

		This vol - ume will be satisfactory to those who share the be - liefs of its author ; but will not persuasively lead those who stand remote from them . ''

		A Study of Death '' is an unusual , a singular book .

		It is a prose poem , after the method of
Browning	PERSON	, and must be wrestled with by most read - ers with something of the penetration and patience that that author imposes .

		The title is suggestive , not descriptive .

		The theme is not death simply , but all the darkness which braids the light of the world .

		It is a discursive treatise on moral chiaroscuro .

		The author has a highly cultivated mind of remarkable insight and unbounded faith .

		Faith is with him not so much the product of a reasoning process as of wide vision .

		The shadows of the world are visi - ble and inseparable parts of its beauty .

		They carry no disturbance to the mind , and cast no burden on the spirit . ''

		Faith boldly occupies the field of pessim - ism , finding theism its largest hope . ''

		The volume is full of insight , and contains passages of great force and beauty .

		Most will need to read it in a detached manner , taking a little now and then , as they can make use of it .

		One feels as though the author had gone forth in a clear night among the mountains , had seen strange , vanishing , beautiful things , min - gled them with his own sensitive , vivacious thoughts , and rehearsed them in a sporadic way as the impulse prompted .

		The progress and adherence of the vol - ume are quite as much in the feelings elicited as in its logical continuity .

		One must tread lightly if he is to keep step with the writer .

		The next two volumes , '' Christian Teaching and Life '' and '' The Spiritual Life , '' are of a practical type , and are sent out by the
American Baptist Pub	ORGANIZATION	- lication Society .

		The first is designed to be an aid in Biblical study .

		The general topics are : The teachings of Christ and of the Apostles , The use of Creeds , Relation of Christian teaching to Life , Im - provement in Christian Teaching .

		The subordinate topics under each of these divisions are stated and supported by liberal Scriptural references .

		The work has been perspicaciously and diligently done , and the volume will be aidful to those who wish either to study or teach the
Bible	LOCATION	in the approved method .

		The treatment of immediate social ques - tions is neither full nor forceful .

		The second vol - ume contains addresses given on various occasions by Mr.
Needham	PERSON	.

		It comprises also a brief sketch of the life of the author .

		Mr.
Needham	PERSON	has been an active evangelist for many years , working by himself and in connection with Mr.
Moody	PERSON	and others of like temper .

		He has been active in form - ing and guiding conferences .

		The critic 's function is suspended in the presence of discourses of this kind .

		They are to be chiefly judged by their practical effects .

		A movement cure is not to be estimated by a descrip - tion of its processes , but by its actual results . ''

		Heredity and Christian Problems '' is a pleasant and practical presentation of a wide , suggestive theme .

		Dr.
Bradford	PERSON	belongs to the still small though growing number of ministers who are striv - ing to render the truth under the terms of our pres - ent knowledge , and to redirect it more skilfully to the solution of social problems .

		This class has not only the past behind it , but the present around it , and the future before it .

		The first chapters are occupied with a r6sum6 of the law of heredity as expounded by various leading authorities ; and cover the ground somewhat extendedly .

		The later chapters apply the doctrine to theoretical and practical problems ; such as the freedom of the will and the person of Christ , education and the home , pauperism , crime , and race-renovation .

		The book is well fitted to instruct and to guide the general reader desirous to make wisely his contribution to the common wel - fare .

		It is quite often conceded that genius does not pass by inheritance .

		The author seems to accept that conclusion .

		More , however , seems to be en - volved in the concession than they are aware of who make it .

		We shall hardly say that genius has fixed boundaries , and is distinct in kind from talent and intelligence .

		If it is not , and is not transmissible , it becomes improbable that pure intellectual endow - ments are transferred .

		There are so many implica - tions of mental power in physical organization , that simply physical inheritance goes far to impart moral and intellectual quality . ''

		Pascal and Other Sermons '' constitutes a final volume of gleanings from the discourses of Dean Church .

		It is made up chiefly of occasional ser - mons preached elsewhere than in
St. Paul 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dean Church was one of the most distinguished of En - glish preachers of the present generation , and his sermons have been extendedly published .

		They are among the best of their kind .

		What Dean Church says of '' The Pensee 's of Pascal , '' in its ministration to men is true of his own discourses .

		They deepen '' the grounds of evolution by elevating the level of religious thought , and enlarging its horizon .

		Devo - tion , to be kept pure , needs ideas as well as feel - ings . ''

		His sermons owe their helpful power to a 280 THE DIAL , -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, profoundly reflective and spiritually earnest frame of mind .

		He renders the spiritual world for him - self and for others under the leading beliefs wrought out by the Church , and these beliefs show in him , as they showed in
Pascal	LOCATION	and in many another , a wonderful power to search the thoughts , strengthen them and give them a divinely productive and stim - ulating force .

		The ruling ideas of the discourses indicate a somewhat severe orthodoxy .

		It was by virtue of depth of conviction rather than by conces - sion to the growth of opinion that Dean Church ex - erted his influence .

		JOHN BASCOM .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Whoever can write anything which shall give a true and sufficient idea of
John Donne	PERSON	, such an idea as will make the general reader of poetry understand why he is regarded as a poet of surpassing genius , may deem himself no longer an apprentice in the art of criticism .

		Donne is the most baffling of the minor poets ;
Whipple	PERSON	and
Lowell	PERSON	,
Gosse	PERSON	and
Dowden	PERSON	, and a number of lesser men , have tried their hands , and yet no lover of
Donne	PERSON	feels that anything ade - quate has been said , and those who know the poet still remain an elect number .

		One bar to a more general reading of
Donne	ORGANIZATION	is now removed by the publication of his poems in two volumes -LRB-
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , excellently edited by Mr.
E. K. Chambers	PERSON	.

		A care - ful text and sufficient apparatus in the way of vari - ants and notes are supplied by the editor , and the work appears in the attractive form of the '' Muses Library , '' now becoming more and more familiar to us .

		There is , too , a very remarkable portrait , which is a better comment on the characteristic poems than much that has been written on the sub - ject .

		But in coming to the introduction by Mr.
George Saintsbury	PERSON	, the reader of other essays on
Donne	PERSON	will feel a disappointment , less keen now for the many that have gone before .

		Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	is known to be a devoted admirer of the poet , and it would go hard if such a one could say nothing rightly .

		Accordingly here , as in what Mr.
Saints	PERSON	- bury had written of
Donne	PERSON	in the '' Elizabethan Literature , '' we have several good things well put ; but taken all in all no sufficient word is said of the real man , the intense , the fascinating , the inscru - table poet .

		True to his own nature , as to the inev - itable secrecy of youth ,
Donne	PERSON	drew around him a cloudy something which keeps him forever to him - self .

		And whoever may have penetrated within has been unable , on coming forth , to render a good account of what he has experienced .

		The reader must still depend upon himself , and here he will be helped by Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	's notes , for
Donne	PERSON	is a poet who needs a good deal of annotation , and Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	is often happy in suggestion and com - m ent , and frequently offers something of value as to he historic fact .

		An acceptable '' A .

		History of American Literature '' summary of -LRB- Silver ,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Profes - Americanliterature .

		gor p L p atte e 5 j g a new text-book for schools and colleges .

		It is , on the whole , an acceptable summary of our literary history , well - arranged and comprehensive .

		The author has grasped the truth that '' no one ever learned litera - ture from a text-book , '' and has not resorted to the pernicious practice of making his manual a compen - dium of '' elegant extracts . ''

		Instead , he gives the student brief directions , classified as '' required read - ing '' and '' suggested reading , '' and in every way encourages him to use the text-book as merely a point of departure for the real study of the subject .

		Among the noteworthy features of the book are a considerable admixture of American history and a larger degree of attention to the political writers and orators than their literary importance would warrant , the frequent references to works of stand - ard criticism , and the numerous bits of brief com - ment from other writers that we find inserted in appropriate places .

		We have noticed but few errors .

		The author can hardly be blamed for saying that no life of Governor
Hutchinson	PERSON	has been written , al - though Mr.
Hosmer	PERSON	's biography , just published , has been for some time announced .

		We are told that the Stedman-Woodberry edition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	is in twelve volumes instead of ten , and are given the surpris - ing information that '' the most complete and au - thentic biography of
Lowell	LOCATION	that has yet appeared '' is Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	's in the '' American Men of Let - ters '' series .

		We must also protest against the one-sided view of Whitman that is given us .

		To say that he is '' confessedly the poet of the body , '' without large qualification , is distinctly false .

		A serious omission is that of all mention of Colonel
Richard Malcolm Johnston	PERSON	from the section devoted to Southern novelists .

		Notei of the Northern The ^ as ' ; na ^ century has found its prodigies of the higher life , in schol - arship , art , and letters , in
Russia	LOCATION	and the Scandinavian countries .

		It is perhaps the Ren - aissance , now at last reaching most of
Northern Europe	LOCATION	; but whether a Renaissance or not , it has affected the public mind profoundly .

		Everybody has heard something of it ; the names of Tourge - nieff and
Tolstoi	PERSON	, of Ibsen and
BjOrnson	PERSON	, are more familiar to many than those of contemporary writ - ers of
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		So it is that '' Six Modern Women '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , by
Laura Marholm Hausson	PERSON	, is in a way attractive through its Northern coloring .

		The author is of Swedish family , and of the six women , two are Russian ,
Sonia Kovalesky	PERSON	and
Marie Bashkirtseff	PERSON	, two Scandinavian ,
Amelie Skram	PERSON	and
A. C.-Edgren-Leffler	PERSON	, while of the two others ,
George Egerton	PERSON	, in '' Keynotes '' at least , smacks of the North very strongly .

		The one real Southerner is
Eleanora Duse	PERSON	, who is presented to us as more remote from the common conception of the Italian than any of the others .

		The book , then , arouses one 's dormant sympathy with the present
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 281 insurgence of the forces of intelligence and heart in
Northern Europe	LOCATION	.

		It is a restless book , extrav - agant and foolish at times , but still with vigor and life .

		As such , many will like to read it , although whoever thinks of getting much else will probably be disappointed .

		The author hardly seems a dis - passionate observer or a keen analyst , and her think - ing and writing border too much upon the spectac - ular and the emotional to carry conviction .

		The critical value of the book is small .

		But beside its indication of the movement of ideas , its frankly ex - pressed views on men and women are not without interest to those who have not a deeply-rooted aver - sion to things they can not applaud .

		An interesting Mr - s - H - J e y es has written , for the sketch of useful '' Public Men of To-Day '' se - Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	.

		^ ft yely interesting sketch of `` The Right Hon.
Joseph Chamberlain	PERSON	'' -LRB-
F. Warne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Jeyes	PERSON	writes confessedly from the Con - servative standpoint ; but this does not prevent him from being generally fair to the pushing and force - ful
Birmingham	LOCATION	Liberal .

		We are glad to note that the book is quite free from personal chatter , the author wisely devoting his rather limited space to matters likely to interest intelligent people .

		Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's public career has been eventful and picturesque ; and Mr.
Jeyes	PERSON	's outline of it from the early days of Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's municipal activities down to his skilful handling , as Colonial Secretary , of the recent complications arising out of the insensate foray of Dr.
Jameson	PERSON	forms no bad sketch of English political history during the period embraced .

		Ample materials are afforded for ena - bling the reader to judge of Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's political aims and convictions , and of his powers as a debater .

		Very effective was his retort courteous to the Irish taunt -LRB- apropos of his
Birmingham	LOCATION	re - forms -RRB- that his was a '' Mayoral mind '' : '' I will confess to you that I am so parochially minded that I look with greater satisfaction to our annexation of the gas and of the water , to our scientific frontier in the improvement area , than I do to the results of that
Imperial	ORGANIZATION	policy which has given us
Cyprus	LOCATION	and the
Transvaal	LOCATION	; and I am prouder of having been engaged in warring against ignorance , and disease , and crime , in
Birmingham	LOCATION	, than if I had been the author of the Zulu war , or had instigated the inva - sion of
Afghanistan	LOCATION	. ''

		The volume is neatly made , and it contains a good portrait of Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	.

		Experiments in Prose .

		Those who read '' Vistas , '' and ex - pected great things from Mr.
Will	PERSON	- iam Sharp , are disappointed in '' Ecce Puella '' -LRB-
Way & Williams	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is by no means an advance , which is not strange , for the greater part of the book seems to have been written , not after '' Vistas , '' but before .

		The piece which gives its name to the book is rather a rambling thing on the beauty of women that seems originally to have been written to go with pictures .

		It is no very extra - ordinary collection of quotations and gossip about ideal beauty and historic beauties .

		The short prose fantasies at the end are elaborate developments of very slight themes .

		There remains the '' Fragments from the
Lost Journals of Piero di Cosimo	ORGANIZATION	, '' which strikes a much surer note than anything else in the book .

		Not throughout , but certainly here and there , are things which touch the right spot .

		Still the book can hardly be called a success , nor will it increase Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	's reputation .

		We see but one direction in which it has a real interest .

		This is in its style .

		In the later imaginings Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	is striving , with many others nowadays , to do with prose what has rarely been done with it before .

		He would make it the medium of expression for color , emotion , fancy , that has generally taken form in poetry .

		It does not seem to us that he is completely a master of his instruments ; there is hardly a page where a careful reading aloud would not bring out some absolute discord in rhythm , diction , or sentiment .

		But the effort has its charm ; there are not many men who have been able to use our language in this way , and to the lover of style , at least , there is always interest in the attempt .

		A volume ^ r -
Bernhard Berenson	PERSON	's `` The of sound Florentine Painters of the Renais - sance '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , the second of the four projected volumes on the Italian painters of the period , is now ready .

		The little book shows the same good qualities of critical acumen , sound schol - arship , and descriptive accuracy , which mark its popular predecessor on the Venetian school .

		The series aims to be a thorough critical presentation of the essential characteristics of the great Schools of
Italy	LOCATION	, and a detailed guide to Italian paintings every - where as well each volume containing a list of principal works and an index of places , which ren - ders it a very desirable hand-book for the European tourist .

		Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	is an accredited member of the scientific school of art criticism , and his data and attributions may be relied upon as correct through - out .

		The volumes are very compact , the author 's aim being to interpret as concisely and clearly as possible each School in a way that may enable the reader to grasp its historical development and to enjoy it aesthetically and intelligently .

		The frontis - piece in the present number shows a portrait pre - sumably after
Verrochio	PERSON	, which is evidently selected rather as a characteristic example of the aim and manner of the
Florentine School	ORGANIZATION	, than by reason of the charm of the original .

		Studies in classical philology .

		After much delay ,
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	has published the first vol - ume of its long-promised '' Studies in Classical Philology . ''

		The '' Studies '' are edited by the heads of the
Departments of Greek	ORGANIZATION	,
Latin	LOCATION	, Archaeology , and Comparative Philology ; that is , by Professors
Shorey	PERSON	,
Hale	PERSON	,
Tarbell	PERSON	, and Buck .

		All of these scholars contribute to the present volume , as well as Professor
Capps	PERSON	, of the
Department of Greek	ORGANIZATION	.

		The contents are as follows : '' The
Antici	PERSON	- 282 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, patory Subjunctive in Greek and Latin , '' by Mr.
William Gardner Hale	PERSON	; ''
Vitruvius	PERSON	and the Greek Stage , '' by Mr.

Carl D. Buck	PERSON	; and '' The Idea of Good in
Plato	LOCATION	's Re - public , '' by Mr.
Paul Shorey	PERSON	.

		With the exception of the last-named paper , these studies are of strictly technical interest , and appeal only to specialists in their several subjects .

		Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	's paper has both technical and general interest , since it is possible to know something of the ethical system of Plato with - out being a classical specialist .

		Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	's rank at the head of
American Platonists	ORGANIZATION	gives exceptional value to this discussion , and his compact and weighty , but attractive and well-ordered , style makes of his paper a contribution to ethical philosophy of the highest importance .

		His essential aim is to make clear `` the true form and pressure of the body of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's thought , which sentimental Platonists are forever losing in rapt contemplation of its gorgeous vestment . ''

		_ Mr.
A. S. Martin	PERSON	's book '' On Par - .

		pleasant byways of literature , giving us a historical essay upon the subject , and an abund - ant sheaf of illustrative examples .

		Parody , like all other literary forms , began with the Greeks , and the author of the '' Batrachomyomachia '' was , in a sense at least , the first great parodist .

		Aristophanes , of course , revelled in parody , and numerous others of the ancients tried their hands at it .

		It is ex - tremely interesting to trace the influence of this literary form down through the Middle Ages to modern times , and Mr.
Martin	PERSON	has pursued the task with industry and a keen scent .

		His examples are taken from a wide range of English poetry , but we are surprised to find that they do not include what are unquestionably the best parodies in the language those published by Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	in his '' Hep - talogia . ''

		This is all the more surprising from the fact that Mr.
Martin	PERSON	quotes from the '' Heptalogia '' in his prefatory essay , so that he can not be charged with ignorance of its existence .

		Calverley , too , although quoted from , is not illustrated by his best work , '' The Cock and the Bull . ''

		These are serious omissions , and ought not to have been found in a work so painstaking and generally acceptable as Mr.
Martin	PERSON	's undoubtedly is .

		Mr.
Field	PERSON	's last volume .

		Those who relish the humor of the late Mr.
Eugene Field	PERSON	may find a rather favorable specimen of it in `` The House '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , a pretty book detailing '' an episode in the lives of
Reuben Baker	PERSON	, astrono - mer , and of his wife
Alice	PERSON	. ''

		The scene is laid in
Chicago	LOCATION	; and we rather suspect certain residents of the city will find little difficulty in recognizing them - selves among the dramatis personce .

		Mr.
Field	PERSON	had an amiable way of springing these little surprises on people .

		In the opening chapter Mr.
Baker	PERSON	and his wife '' buy a place '' ; and in the succeeding ones they proceed to furnish and put it in order , the hu - mor of the story hinging mainly on the transparent simplicity -LRB- peculiar to astronomers -RRB- in practical mat - ters of Mr.
Baker	PERSON	.

		The book is amusing enough , and Mr.
Field	PERSON	's fun is as usual decidedly '' obvious , '' without being exactly coarse .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
W. R. Jenkins	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, has added '' Quatre - Vingt-Treize '' to his series of reprints of the novels of Victor Hugo .

		The work is published in a single volume of 595 pages , and presents the text complete , together with an introduction and English notes prepared by Dr.
Benjamin Duryea Woodward	PERSON	, of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Notes are particularly needed by English readers of this great book , and Dr.
Woodward	PERSON	has supplied the desirable information in a compact and acceptable shape .

		The volume of ''
Trinity Verse	ORGANIZATION	, '' just edited by Mr. De Forest
Hicks	PERSON	and Mr.
Henry Rutgers Remsen	PERSON	, and published at
Hartford	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, is , like a former volume of similar title -LRB- part of whose contents are re - produced -RRB- , made up of verses written for '' The Trinity Tablet '' and other undergraduate publications .

		There are not many familiar names among the writers repre - sented , those of Mr.
Richard Burton	PERSON	and Mr.
C. F. Johnson	PERSON	being perhaps the only ones that have attracted public attention .

		Nevertheless , the book contains some excellent verse , in moods alternately grave and gay , and speaks well for the literary influences at work in the institution whence it comes .

		Two stories by
Zschokke	ORGANIZATION	, '' Dar Abenteuer der
Neu	PERSON	- jahrsnacht '' and '' Der
Zerbrochene Krug	PERSON	, '' edited by Dr.
A. B. Faust	PERSON	;
Herr Wichert	PERSON	's `` An der Major - secke , '' edited by Mr.
Charles Harris	PERSON	, and
Herr Heyse	PERSON	's - '' L'Arrabiata , '' edited by Miss
Mary A. Frost	PERSON	, are Ger - man texts recently published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		At the same time we have from the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


Frau Hillern	PERSON	's '' Hoherals die Kirche , '' edited by Mr.
F. A. Dauer	PERSON	;
Herr Volkman-Leander	PERSON	's `` Trau - mereien an Franzosischen Kaminen , '' edited by Miss Amalie Hanstein ; and
Herr Heinrich Seidel	PERSON	's ``
Herr Omnia	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
J. Matthewman	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Ernest Rhys	PERSON	has done students of Elizabethan literature a real service in editing a collection of '' The Lyric Poems of
Thomas Campion	PERSON	. ''

		Such a book would not have been possible had it not been for the labors of Mr.
A. H. Bullen	PERSON	, to whom we practically owe the restor - ation to English poetry of one of the sweetest and truest singers that our language has ever possessed , and to whom Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	makes ample acknowledgment .

		The present edition , published by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is the first , however , that has made
Campion	PERSON	accessible to any other than a narrow audience , and is exceedingly welcome .

		Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	's `` Essays , '' just published by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, are thirteen in number , and are , for the most part , critical studies of minor English authors .

		The writer says : '' I have always chosen , for biographical and critical study , figures whose personal - ity or writings have seemed to me to possess some sub - tle , evasive charm , or delicate originality of purpose or view . ''

		Among his subjects we find
John Hales	PERSON	,
Henry More	PERSON	,
Andrew Marvell	PERSON	,
Vincent Bourne	PERSON	, Gray ,
Blake	PERSON	, ,
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 283 Keble , and Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	.

		We wonder how Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	will relish being described as one of a group of '' persons about whom hung an undefined promise of greater strength than ever issued in performance . '' ''

		The Age of
Dryden	PERSON	, '' by Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	, suc - ceeds Mr.
Dennis	PERSON	's '' Age of Pope '' in the series of '' Handbooks of English Literature '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , of which Professor
Hales	PERSON	is the editor .

		It is an admirable book , covering the
last forty years of the seventeenth century	DATE	, but leaving out such writers as
Milton	LOCATION	and Clarendon , who belong in spirit to an earlier period .

		Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	has classified the writers of the period dis - cussed , thus making it an easy matter to refer to the philosophy , or the divinity , or the science of the Re - storation years .

		The style of the book is delightful , - and the scholarship unimpeachable .

		IjITERARY NOTES .

		The
Robert Clarke Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce that they have just issued the fourth edition of Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	's '' Etidorhpa . ''

		We have received from
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	the second volume of their reprint of Carleton 's '' Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry . ''

		A new edition of '' The Glaciers of the Alps , '' by
John Tyndall	PERSON	, has just been published by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The text is practically unchanged .

		Dr.
Ernest Hart	PERSON	's '' Hypnotism , Mesmerism , and the New Witchcraft , '' appears in a revised and enlarged edition from the press of
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Titus Andronicus '' and ''
Romeo	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' each with an etched frontispiece , have been added to the '' Temple ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, with the Dent-Macmillan im - print .

		Messrs.
Copeland	PERSON	& Day announce for early publica - tion a new translation into English , by Mr.
M. S. Henry	PERSON	, of the mediaeval Cantefable or song-tale of '' Aucassin et Nicolette , '' with versified passages rhymed by Mr.
E. W. Thomson	PERSON	.

		Judge
Robert H. Russell	PERSON	, the senior member of the firm of
R. H. Russell & Son	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- De
Witt Publishing House	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , died on the 3d of
April	DATE	at his home in
Strat	LOCATION	- ford ,
Conn.	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	was Probate Judge in
Strat	LOCATION	- ford for many years .

		Sir
Philip Perring	PERSON	has '' done into English verse '' the tc Fables '' of
Florian	PERSON	, and the work is published by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The form is , for the most part , rhymed iambic tetrameter , and the transla - tion is neat and effective .

		`` The Positive Philosophy of
Auguste Comte	PERSON	, '' in
Harriet Martineau	PERSON	's condensed translation , appears in a new edition -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with a specially written intro - ductory essay by Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	.

		It makes three volumes of the familiar
Bohn	PERSON	library . ''

		Tartarin of Tarascon '' is the first volume of a uni - form edition of Daudet in English , bearing the Dent imprint , and published in this country by
Messrs. Mac - millan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The French illustrations are reproduced , and the French mechanical style closely followed .

		The '' Kilmarnock '' edition of the poems of
Burns	ORGANIZATION	, edited by Mr.
J. A. Manson	PERSON	, and published by the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	PERSON	, is a beautifully-printed work in two volumes , sold at a moderate price .

		The editor con - tributes a discriminating biographical preface of some length .

		The
Twentieth Century Club of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	will close an exceptionally interesting season -LRB- the seventh of its ex - istence -RRB- , on the eighth of
May	DATE	, with a
Brahms	ORGANIZATION	evening .

		Mr.
W. F. Apthorp	PERSON	comes from
Boston	LOCATION	to make the address , which will be illustrated by a programme of songs and chamber music .

		A recent endowment has made it possible for
Colum	PERSON	-
bia University	ORGANIZATION	to take the important step of establish - ing a
School of Music	ORGANIZATION	, and it is stated on good authority that Mr.
E. A. MacDowell	PERSON	is to be called to take charge of the work .

		The appointment would be an admirable one for
the University	ORGANIZATION	, as well as a deserved tribute to one of our most brilliant and original composers . ''

		The Evolution of Woman '' is a series of humorous drawings by Mr.
H. W. McVickar	PERSON	, printed in black and one color , and handsomely published by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
E. Irenseus Stevenson	PERSON	contributes `` A Man 's Preface , '' in verse ; the verses that accompany the drawings are not acknowledged , probably because they are so bad .

		The book will serve to while away a dull half-hour .

		The
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	make the interesting and important announcement of a new popular edition of that invaluable work , `` Chambers 's Encyclopaedia , '' from entirely new plates and thoroughly revised to date , many of the articles being entirely rewritten .

		Former trade editions of the work will be withdrawn from the market .

		The same firm will issue cheaper editions , re - vised and enlarged , of ''
Lippincott	PERSON	's Gazetteer '' and ''
Lippincott	PERSON	's Pronouncing Dictionary of Biography and Mythology . ''

		The `` Letters of
David Ricardo	PERSON	to
John Ramsay McCulloch	PERSON	, 1816-1823 , '' edited by Dr.
J. H. Hollander	PERSON	, form a double number of the '' Publications of the Amer - ican
Economic Association	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		We should also note , as having been for some time upon our table , the sketch of '' British Rule in
Central America	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Ira D. Travis	PERSON	, published by the
Michigan Political Science Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion ; and Miss
Lucy E. Textor	PERSON	's study of the '' Official Relations between the
United States	LOCATION	and the
Sioux Indians	LOCATION	, '' a publication in the '' History and Economics '' series of the
Leland Stanford Junior University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Recent attacks in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	upon the principle of inter - national copyright have caused a renewal of activity in the
American Copyright League	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Executive Coun - cil of that organization , at a meeting held
April 2	DATE	, adopted the following resolutions : `` Resolved , That the Executive Council of the
American Copyright League	ORGANIZATION	declares its opposition to further limitation of the principle of international copyright by any extension of the manufacturing clause . ''

		Resolved , That the
Council	ORGANIZATION	approves the bill offered by Mr.
Cummings	PERSON	in the present
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in behalf of American dramatists providing more adequate means for the enforce - ment of dramatic copyright .

		`` Resolved , That the
Council	ORGANIZATION	approves the creation of a separate copyright office as provided in the separate bill now pending before
Congress	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Resolved , That in view of the present revival in copyright legislation and of the recent attacks on the principle of inter - national copyright , and in view of the desirability of providing at an early session of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	for a copyright commission to consider the general subject of copyright law , the treasurer is directed to resume the collection of dues , suspended after the passage of the Act of
1891	DATE	, and the Secretary is authorized to take steps to increase the membership of the League . ''

		A general meeting of the League will be called in No - vember , until which time it is hoped such objectionable measures as the Treloar Bill may be staved off .

		In no case of an unfinished story has an author left so full a forecast of his intention .

Stevenson	PERSON	had outlined to his amanuensis , Mrs. Strong , the plot of what remained unwritten , and by her aid an editorial note of nearly twenty pages gives it so fully that the reader is left in no doubt of the result or of the fate of any of the characters .

		THE DIAL 291 SOUTHIVORTH 'S Essentials of Arithmetic Some quotations from a review by
DAVID EUGENE SMITH	PERSON	, of the
Michigan State Normal School	ORGANIZATION	, published in the
March	DATE	number of '' The School Review '' : `` It is one of the very few works that have successfully broken from tradition ... Mr.
South	PERSON	worth is the hundredth man , yea , even the thousandth ... This is high praise .

		What is there in ' The Essentials of Arithmetic ' that is so distinctive and at the same time so excellent as to deserve such an encomium ?

		... In the first place the author has dared to attempt to make pupils think , actually think for themselves without telling them what they ought to think ... Further - more the author has dared to insert the definitions where they belong , that is , after the concepts are entirely familiar , and to say , ' For reference . '

		Such pedagogy is as refreshing as it is unusual ... Another venturesome idea has been carried out , and one which may militate against the sale of the book ; the author has insisted that the teacher should also think , and should know something outside of the text-book .

		For example , two methods of performing an operation are given and the pupil is told to state which is the better , and why ; no bint is given to teacher or pupil ; each must think ... Still another feature which makes us love the book for the enemies it will make , is the introduction of the simple equa - tion where it belongs .

		... Is it not sound pedagogy , and are we not inevitably coming to it ?

		It lets in the light ; it clears up the mystery ; it makes psychology and logic , instead of the freaks of history , the factors in the arrangement of the course , and it insists that the making of an easy thing hard is not per se commendable ... But there is one thing which everyone will commend , namely , the work in oral arithmetic .

		This is introduced skilfully , and progressively , and continuously from the first day to the last .

		... In one other respect the book is remarkable .

		It is up to date .

		Those who have much to do with the examination of text-books as they appear will appre - ciate the truth of the statement that this feature is really re - markable .

		Here is a text-book which , under exchange , speaks of postal and express money-orders , perhaps the most common instruments of exchange known to the majority of people .

		And this is only one of a considerable number of features that come under the same category ... Besides introducing alge - braic forms where they belong , the work introduces metrical geometry where it belongs .

		This is done in a natural manner and to the extent that is demanded in common life .

		More - over the child is still required to keep to accurate arithmet - ical forms in his mensuration .

		... In the arrangements of the solutions the work is a marvel .

		It gives the numerical solution as a pupil is advised to arrange it ; it then gives the formal solution , in numbered or lettered steps , thus covering the logical analysis ; the teacher may call for either or both as the subject demands ... After such unusual praise it may be asked , ' Has the book , then , no weak points ? '

		Was there ever a book without them ?

		Was there ever a book without some misprint , some questionable assertions , some things that would not please every critic ?

		This book has them ; but they are few in number , and are so much over - shadowed by its excellences that it would serve no good pur - pose to enter the limited field at this time , or to mar the pleas - ure of reviewing a book that is really superior , and that is destined to do a great deal to improve American education .

		A measure is now under consideration in the national
Congress	ORGANIZATION	which should call forth an indignant protest from all persons who are inter - ested in the education of youth , as well as from all persons who stand for the belief that civili - zation means something very different from the rule of brute force , something entirely unlike the militant organization which seems to be the accepted ideal of European society at the pres - ent day .

		The measure in question is styled '' A Bill to establish a bureau of military education and to promote the adoption of uniform mili - tary drill in the public schools of the several States and Territories . ''

		It has had two read - ings in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, and is now in the hands of the
Senate Committee on Military Affairs	ORGANIZATION	.

		It contemplates the creation in the War Depart - ment of a new Bureau , the preparation of a text-book of drill regulations adapted to the use of public schools , the free distribution of such book to the schools that may apply for it , and the direct encouragement of military training for schoolboys throughout the country .

		This measure is a natural consequence of the tall talk about war that has been heard so frequently of late in the Capitol at
Washington	LOCATION	, and made so much of by sensational newspapers almost everywhere .

		In the present inflamed condition of a considerable section of public opinion it is not impossible that such a measure , obnoxious as it is to every genuine educator and every right-thinking person , may find its way to the statute-book , unless the opposition of the sober - minded shall find prompt and vigorous expres - sion .

		One of the greatest dangers to which our public schools are exposed is that of the raids so frequently made upon them by bands of well - meaning but ill-balanced riders of hobbies .

		One set of people gets the notion that some form of mechanical discipline in morals and religion is greatly needed , and moves heaven and earth to secure the introduction of Bible-readers or eth - ical catechisms into the school curricula .

		An - other set becomes possessed of the fantastic idea that our children need more than anything else to be guarded against the danger of becom - ing drunkards , and drafts measures -LRB- like the monstrous legislation recently enacted in New 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	,
York	LOCATION	-RRB- for the compulsory adoption of what is called '' scientific instruction in temperance , '' a kind of instruction which is usually repudiated by those who have a right to speak for science , and which proves to be temperate only in name .

		Another set of hobbyists finds in manual train - ing a panacea for all social ills , and does its best to convert our schools into carpentry kindergar - tens .

		Raids of this sort upon public education have become alarmingly frequent of late , and it is not surprising that some of our congress - men should wish to organize a foray of their own .

		Fortunately , our decentralized system of education makes it impossible for the national government to do anything mandatory , and mil - itary drill can not be imposed upon the schools of any
State	ORGANIZATION	without its own consent .

		Still , it is desirable that the friends of education do everything possible to prevent such a bill as that now under consideration from passing into law , and we are glad to observe that the Amer - ican
Humanitarian League	ORGANIZATION	and other bodies have undertaken the organization of an active opposition to the measure .

		There are only two arguments that can pos - sibly be urged in favor of military discipline for our schoolboys .

		One of them is that war will remain a normal accompaniment of civil - ization , and that training for war is conse - quently an essential part of the education of the male citizen .

		The other argument is that military discipline serves a useful purpose in itself , being the best means of securing physical vigor and a manly carriage .

		The second of these arguments is easily to be disposed of .

		The few hours of military drill that are all it would be possible to provide for in any public-school system would not go far in securing the physical results that we may admit to be desirable .

		On the other hand , we believe that the best authorities regard military drill as a very imperfect means of physical de - velopment , and much inferior to the scientific systems of our better gymnasia .

		Dr.
Sargent	PERSON	, of the
Harvard Gymnasium	ORGANIZATION	, for example , says that military drill does not , to any extent , meet the physiological demands of the body .

		He then goes on to deny the common statement that drill tends to make young men erect and graceful , and sums up his opinion of the mat - ter in the following weighty paragraph : `` After taking the most favorable view possible of mil - itary drill as a physical exercise , we are led to conclude that its constrained positions and closely localized movements do not afford the essential requisites for developing the muscles and improving the respiration and circulation , and thereby improving the general health and condition of the system .

		We must further conclude that in case of any malformation , local weakness , or constitutional debility , the drill tends , by its strain upon the nerves and pro- longed tension on the muscles , to increase the defects rather than to relieve them . ''

		Those who have a constitutional prejudice against `` professors '' and their opinions may be referred to the views of Lieutenant-Colonel
Edmands	PERSON	of the
Boston	LOCATION	Cadets , to whom no one will be likely to refuse the title of '' practical man , '' and who says : '' I only know that school drill injures the militia service , and I never saw a school successfully drilled .

		... In
Boston	LOCATION	the effect of school drill has been to make boys round-shouldered and narrow-chested .

		I never saw a school company well set up in my life . ''

		As for the argument based upon the immi - nence of war , and the importance of being pre - pared to fight when the time comes , it really amounts , when used in defence of military drill for schoolboys , to an insidious plea for the abandonment of the policy which has caused this nation to make so unprecedented a pro- gress in wealth and power .

		Happy as we are in climate , in vigorous national stock , and in richness of natural resources , we are happiest of all in our freedom from any necessity of taking upon our shoulders the crushing burden of militarism .

		No power in the world wants to make war upon the
United States	LOCATION	, or would dream of attacking them except upon the strongest provocation .

		As far as the question of war and peace is concerned , the future is absolutely in our own hands , and no nation in history has ever had our opportunity of show - ing how vastly more important than the victo - ries of war are the victories of peace .

		To con - template a military future for this Republic , to encourage the hot-headed minority who would like to look forward to such a future , is sheer madness , and anything that remotely tends to arouse or to strengthen the military spirit in our population , should be frowned upon by everyone who has at heart the interests of civ - ilization .

		The gravest objection to such a bill as that which has occasioned these remarks is not , then , that it would cost money , or that it would divert educational forces from their proper channel , or that it would provide for physical training of a sort inferior to that already provided in our schools , but rather , in the words of the
New York	LOCATION	`` Nation , '' that it `` springs from the same sense -
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 295 less and brutal war-spirit that is making wreck of so many public reputations , and continually threatening to embroil us with other nations .

		What its promoters really have in mind is , not physical exercise , not parades and displays , but the spreading in childish minds of the idea that fighting is the noblest occupation of man , that we are all the while exposed to insults and ag - gressions , and must be ready to whip all crea - tion on call .

		Now the boys have too much of this idea already .

		It is in their minds that the furibund patriotism of Lodge and
Frye	PERSON	finds most admiration in fact , so far as we have observed , its only admiration .

		What they need , together with their fellow juveniles in the
United States Senate	ORGANIZATION	, is , not military drill , but instruction in good manners , in the arts and love of peace , and in ambition to make the country decent and habitable instead of feared . ''

		It is for these reasons that we hope and trust that the objectionable measure will fail to be - come law as it certainly must fail if those who are opposed to it , and to the spirit which it represents , will only take the trouble to make their feelings known to their representatives in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is no partisanship in a ques - tion like this , and consequently nothing to pre - vent good men of all parties from joining in the effort to defeat so pernicious a piece of proposed legislation .

		FROM AVALON .

		It is not lost , that green and tranquil isle , Encircled by the arms of
summer	DATE	tides , That sway , and smile , and whisper of the sea .

		Not far away it lies ; its fragrant shades Shot through by golden lances of the sun , And stirred by gentle airs that wander still On noiseless feet , to find the chamber fair Where , couched on mystic herbs and asphodel , Healed of his hurts ,
King Arthur	PERSON	lies asleep .

		Oft have I found its shelter .

		When the stress Of warring winds , and sharp tumultuous storms Have left me spent and breathless on the field , Then my swift thoughts , for healing and for rest , Bear me away to peaceful Avalon .

		The sweet enchantments of the bounteous queen Have changed the shifting waves to fields of rye , And seas of meadow-grass , that softly break Against the low-browed wall that shuts about The blessed trees , veiled in eternal bloom .

		The bees make happy tumult , and the air Quivers with gauzy , bright-winged , dancing motes And small white butterflies go shimmering by , Silent as souls , among the scented boughs .

		The skies bend low ; the pale moon idly drifts , A phantom ship , to some celestial port , And night and day flow on in still content Through blissful years , in changeless Avalon .

		EMILY
HUNTINOTON MILLER	PERSON	.

		SHAKESPEARE IN LEXICOGRAPHY .

		This subject is suggested as one of practical im - portance , in connection with recent and present development in university study of English , by the special prominence of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in the university courses .

		Lexicography seems to be the most impor - tant channel through which the results of '' higher criticism '' in English , that can be attained origi - nally only by the few fortunate university students , may be communicated to the many who must depend upon the scholars for information and guidance .

		Dictionaries of English have made wonderful ad - vances , both in method and in clearness and accu - racy , but the possibilities are still far beyond the actualities .

		The field for new lexicographic work will be open as long as one of these possibilities is unconquered , and this means practically always .

		Shakespeare is the author who furnishes the best means of testing the work already done , and of indi - cating a special need of improvement , but without intending disparagement of present accomplishment save in the matter of a few details .

		Writing of the teaching of English in American universities , very few of the twenty professors who contribute to a book recently published fail to men - tion Shakespeare especially , and some of them even say that his writings are made a special and sepa - rate study .

		In the introduction to the book is the following : `` If literature is to count for so much among our higher interests , the manner in which we set about to prepare the way for it is surely of the utmost importance , and any misdirection of energy in this preparation means an almost incalculable loss . ''

		Can there be any question that false defini - tions of words , sometimes involving a most absurd contradiction of terms , exemplify a misdirection of energy ?

		And is not the dictionary the commonest tool in the preparation spoken of ?

		Professor Dodge of
the University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	says : '' Of far greater importance -LSB- than the study of Chaucer -RSB- is the question of how to approach Shake - speare .

		It is bad enough to confine ourselves to the grammatical forms of Chaucer ; it is little far -LSB- sic -RSB- from criminal to do so with -LSB- sic -RSB- our mighty dram - atist .

		Not that the grammatical and linguistic side shall be ignored ; it must , however , be reduced to a minimum , as a means to a greater end .


Richard Grant White	ORGANIZATION	to the contrary ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	requires much annotation of various kinds , in order that the study may yield its full return . ''

		-LRB- JSnpassant , would not the last sentence be much better with the initia - tory word notwithstanding ? -RRB-

		An inference natu - rally drawn from this criticism namely , that Mr.
White	PERSON	asserts that little annotation is necessary seems to be somewhat inaccurate ; closer to the truth would be an assertion that more annotation is neces - sary than he made .

		His notes really are very mea - gre , notwithstanding his explicit claim of sufficient copiousness made as follows in the preface to the Riverside Shakespeare : '' In determining what pas - sages were sufficiently obscure to justify explanation , 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, the editor , following eminent example , took advice of his washerwoman , and also of the correctors of the press in the office in which the edition was printed , to whose intelligent suggestions and thought - ful care he owes much which it gives him pleasure to acknowledge .

		He therefore ventures to say to any reader who may not be able to understand a passage which is left without remark , that the fault may possibly be that of some other person than the poet or the editor . ''

		This evidently means that the editor thinks he has explained everything that needs explanation .

		His claim is strengthened by the more explicit following assertion : '' Explanation of obso - lete words and phrases is given wherever it is needed , and as often as occasion requires ... Every word that needs explanation is explained in this edition whenever and wherever it occurs , unless , indeed , it is found twice in the same scene : in which case repetition was deemed superfluous . ''

		Shakespeare undoubtedly used many words that are now obsolete , and many others in senses no longer living .

		It would not be difficult to find in any unabridged dictionary a large number of instances of both kinds not noted by Mr.
White	PERSON	, and often the reason for his omission of explanation must have been failure to perceive a common need .

		Research in the case of some of these words discloses a ten - dency to lexicographic error ; and this is very un - fortunate , because ordinary readers will refer to dictionaries for definitions of words they do not understand , and naturally will accept what is found there as correct .

		It is to be presumed that lexicographers , in defin - ing Shakespearean words , consult the works of spe - cial students ; therefore the specialists must be con - sidered the prime authorities .

		Have the specialists habitually selected the most profitable and reason - able starting-point for their word-studies ?

		A very interesting and entertaining phase of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's writing is the abandon with which he uttered seem - ing solecisms , this fact having led to some strange misunderstanding of the spirit in which it was done , and to destructive criticism , on the score of care - lessness , of some of his grandest work .

		Thus , Mr.
White	PERSON	attributes to Shakespeare a habit of writing carelessly , in frequent foot-notes such as '' heedlessly written , '' '' one of S. 's many reckless twists of lan - guage , '' etc. .

		For instance , in '' The Two Gentlemen of
Verona	LOCATION	, '' act ii. , scene 7 , is the following : ''
Lucetta	PERSON	.

		I do not seek to quench your love 's hot fire , But qualify the fire 's extreme rage , Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason .

		Julia .

		The more thou damm ` st it up , the more it burns . ''

		Mr.
White	PERSON	's note on this is : '' the more it burns .

		An example of
S.	ORGANIZATION	's carelessness , followed by one of the most charming and exquisitely written passages of his lighter style . ''

		Is not this rather an example of W. 's careless or unappreciative criticism ?

		Hav - ing likened love 's glow to fire , and spoken of con - fining it within bounds , the poet has
Julia	PERSON	use the word `` damm ` st , '' as the monosyllable most natu - rally suggested by what has gone before , and then passes to the figure of a running stream , suggested in turn by '' damm ` st. '' Certainly this is not a re - sult of carelessness .

		The lexicographers class an astonishing number of word-uses as obsolete .

		When a word occurs in a way not immediately recognized as one of its familiar uses , the conclusion seems to be reached at once that it must stand in some old and disused sense , and a separate definition is made for it on that basis .

		Would it not be more accurate and scholarly to as - sign a current meaning wherever that is possible ?

		Many of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's words treated as obsolete by lexicographers are readily explainable as used in still current senses , in some cases by considering the phrasing as merely elliptical , and in some by slight extension or alteration of the wording of familiar definitions , without actual change in their purport .

		In '' The Merry Wives of
Windsor	LOCATION	, '' act ii. , scene 2 ,
Ford	ORGANIZATION	says to Sir
John Falstaff	PERSON	, '' Now , Sir
John	PERSON	, here is the heart of my purpose : you are a gentle - man of excellent breeding , admirable discourse , of great admittance . ''

		Admittance as here used is de - fined in
Webster	PERSON	's '' Unabridged '' as '' the custom or prerogative of being admitted '' ;
Worcester	LOCATION	de - fines it as '' custom or privilege of being admitted to great persons '' ; the '' Imperial Dictionary '' says it means '' the custom or privilege of being admitted to the society of the great '' ; the '' Century '' pre - serves the `` Imperial '' definition ; and Dr.
Murray	PERSON	's '' New English Dictionary '' gives the definition , '' the habit or faculty of being admitted . ''

		All these dictionaries say that the word in this use is obsolete .

		Webster 's '' Unabridged '' and the '' Imperial '' give this quotation : '' Now , Sir
John	PERSON	, you are a gentle - man of excellent breeding , ... of great admit - tance . ''

		Worcester 's quotation is the same , but with no mark of elision .

		It is a point of comparatively slight importance , but both elisions should have been noted , as they are in the '' Century . ''

		All these lex - icographers seem to have been misled by what ap - peared to be an uncommon use of the word , and to have manufactured definitions accordingly ; while the fact is that this word is used in its common meaning , and the part of the sentence that needs explanation -LRB- if any is needed -RRB- is the two words of great .

		The passage means '' a gentleman command - ing much admittance , '' and the quotation would be properly placed under
Webster	PERSON	's second definition '' Permission to enter ; the power or right of en - trance ; and hence , actual entrance . ''

		Mr.
White	PERSON	had good reason for neglecting explanation of this passage , for it means exactly what the words say in their common acceptation .

		In the first act of '' Cymbeline , '' fourth scene ,
Imogen	PERSON	says to
Pisanio	LOCATION	, speaking of
Posthumus	PERSON	's departure : '' Thou should st have made him As little as a crow , or less , ere left To after-eye him . ''

		Webster 's '' Unabridged '' has no entry of after-eye ; the '' International '' says it is poetic , meaning '' to look after . ''

		Worcester enters it as v. a. -LRB- verb ac -
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 297 tive -RRB- , marks it obsolete , and defines it : `` To keep one in view ; to look after one . ''

		The '' Imperial '' enters it as v. t , -LRB- verb transitive -RRB- , defines it as if intransitive and as a living word , '' to keep one in view , '' and has let instead of left in the quotation .

		The '' Century '' gives the word as obsolete , mean - ing '' to keep in view . ''

		The passage means that Pisanio should not have stopped looking until Post - humus had gone entirely out of reach of vision , and '' keep in view '' expresses the object of the action , not the meaning of the verb , which is simply , as
Murray	PERSON	correctly gives it , '' to follow with the eye , to look after . ''

		Murray 's only fault is that he says the word is obsolete , thus implying that it was once current .

		In fact , it was a nonce-word , and is as good now as it ever was , should one choose to use it .

		In the first act of '' Measure for Measure , '' fourth scene , the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	says to Friar Thomas : `` And to behold his sway , I will , as ' t were a brother of your order , Visit both prince and people ; therefore , I p ` rythee , Supply me with the habit , and instruct me How I may formally in person bear me Like a true friar . ''

		Webster 's '' Unabridged , ''
Worcester	LOCATION	, and the '' Im - perial '' give as a separate definition of bear as an intransitive verb , '' to act in any character , to behave , '' except that the '' Imperial '' omits '' to be - have , '' and all mark it obsolete .

		None of the others gives the passage quoted .

		Worcester and the '' Im - perial '' quote '' Instruct me How I may formally in person bear Like a true friar . ''

		Webster quotes in one line , '' Instruct me how I may bear like a true friar . ''

		This similarity of treat - ment , with its absurd error , evidently arises from the fact that some editions of Shakespeare have the line without the pronoun me -LRB- probably because of misunderstanding the old reflexive form beare , a dissylable -RRB- , but at least five editions , including the
Riverside	LOCATION	, give the pronoun .

		In the first scene of the second act of ''
King Henry VIII.	PERSON	, ''
Buckingham	PERSON	says : '' Go with me , like good angels , to my end ; And , as the long divorce of steel falls on me , Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice , And lift my soul to heaven . ''

		Worcester defines this word divorce as '' the cause of separation , '' and
Webster	PERSON	's '' Unabridged '' and the '' Imperial '' say '' the cause of penal separation . ''

		Webster 's '' International '' says '' that which sepa - rates . ''

		All these works say the word in this use is obsolete .

		The word was never used , and never could be used , with the meaning given in these defi - nitions .

		That which is named in the passage is not a cause , nor an agent or instrument , but an effect caused by the stroke of steel , and the line is ellip - tical , '' as the long divorce -LSB- of soul and body -RSB- of -LSB- that is , caused by -RSB- steel falls on me . ''

		Divorce as here used means just what the '' Century Diction - ary '' says it does , '' complete separation , absolute disjunction , '' though a better , because more explicit , definition seems to be '' permanent separation or disunion of things naturally united , '' in this case the body and the soul .

		Here the lexicographers had not even the excuse of real unfamiliar !

		ty for calling the particular use of the word obsolete , since it is identical with that in such an expression as '' divorce of church and state . ''

		Any one who chose to write `` the long divorce of , '' instead of `` death caused by , '' would have the same right to do so , and the same expectation of easy understanding , that Shake - speare had .

		It seems clear that literal construing of literal passages , not only in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	but in all litera - ture , should be the first aim of commentators , and that it should be in keeping with the current lan - guage as far as possible .

		Of course
Shakespeare	PERSON	and his contemporaries used many words that are not now used , and all of their now disused expres - sions should be explained in the light of their own time ; but the discrimination should be made much more carefully than it has been .

		Will the true spirit of literature be fully and ac - curately understood , in secondary schools or in uni - versities , or anywhere , until such evil results of mis - directed energy are eradicated ?

		Only one important example has been considered here , but the evil is far more extensive .

		For instance , how can a writer be accepted as final authority as a thinker who exploits such inaccuracies of thought as the assertion that '' redness is the name of a color '' ?


G. P. Marsh	PERSON	said this in one of his lectures on the English lan - guage , and
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	said the same thing of whiteness .

		The simplest common sense should preclude such assertions from being possible to any one , especially to a logician .

		Some way must be found to make them impossible if we are ever to enjoy really accurate literary scholarship .

		It really requires some courage to confess it , but I was one of the first English reviewers to whose lot fell the reviewing of Mr.
Stephen Crane	PERSON	's book , '' The Red Badge of Courage . ''

		Worse still a quite damning fact , I fear I even ventured to praise it .

		Mr.
Crane	PERSON	I had never heard of when his book came to me in the ordi - nary course of business , but I read the volume with the greatest interest ; I thought & in many ways a remark - able performance , and I did my best to give reasons for the faith that was in me .

		But apparently it is a subtle insult for an Englishman to praise an American book .

		I used to think that a good book was a good book the whole world over .

		It is only since landing in this coun - try and picking up THE DIAL of
April 16	DATE	that I have learned better .

		Your correspondent , ''
A. C. McC.	PERSON	, '' is my authority .

		Now , I am truly sorry that any criticisms of mine or of my brother reviewers in
London	LOCATION	should have so annoyed your correspondent , for he evidently was very much annoyed .

		He came out on the warpath , 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, arrested Mr.
Crane	PERSON	as a literary spy , court-martialled him , and shot the poor fellow off-hand .

		This book , says ''
A. C. McC	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		in effect , can not be a good one for Americans to read because the English have praised it .

		He puts the whole thing in a nutshell , you see .

		This English praise , he is convinced , is a
Gre	ORGANIZATION	- cian gift .

		I personally thought I was merely pointing out the merits of what seemed to me a book that de - served some notice .

		But he saw the ambush we English reviewers were laying .

		Deep under our affected enthusi - asm for this young writer was an intense desire to insult
America	LOCATION	.

		It sounds oddly , does n't it ?

		But he has chapter and verse to prove it .

		He comes across some cruel , senseless gibes at the
Union	LOCATION	soldiers in '' Black - wood 's Magazine . ''

		They are over thirty years old , and to-day , from one end of
England	LOCATION	to the other , you could not find a man to express anything but the bitterest shame of them .

		But what of that ? ''

		There , '' exclaims
A. C. McC	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		exultantly , '' that is why these English are praising
Stephen Crane	PERSON	.

		The hero of his book is a coward .

		Thirty years ago an ignorant British maga - zine talked of ` the swift-footed warriors of
Bull	ORGANIZATION	's Run . '

		Do n't you see the connection ?

		It is all a deep-laid plot to throw mud at American soldiers . ''

		To be sure !

		And so when I sat , pipe in mouth , a peaceable , jaded reviewer , happy to have come across a book above the dull dead level , my mind was really full of schemes for avenging Bunker 's Hill !

		Your correspondent 's letter is a compound of mis - judged patriotism and bad criticism .

		Take only these two sentences .

		`` The book , '' he says , `` is a vicious satire upon American soldiers and American armies . '' ''

		Respect for our own people should have prevented its issue in this country . ''

		A curious attitude to take up towards a book , unworthy of an American , as it seems to me , and peculiarly unworthy of an American who , as I hear , fought through the war with distinction .

		I will say at once that no such idea ever presented itself to a single Englishman into whose hands the book fell .

		The most insignificant thing about the book , the one point which every sensible reviewer would at once dismiss from his mind as quite immaterial , is the fact that the hero fought for the North .

		If he had been an English - man in the ditches before
Sebastopol	LOCATION	, or a Frenchman at Sedan , the book would have been just as remarkable , and the praise of the English journals no less warm .

		But to ''
A. C. McC	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's one unforgivable crime lies in portraying a Northerner who fled from the field .

		Scarcely less wrong-headed is your correspondent 's criticism of the book as a piece of literature .

		He has missed the whole point of the tale .

		Part of Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's plan , I take it , was to give an idea of the impressions made on a raw recruit by the movements of a regiment in battle .

		Who can doubt that to a man who but yester - day was working at the plough the whole thing appears one intolerable confusion ?

		As for the style in which the book is written , `` A. C. McC . ''

		finds in it '' an entire lack of any literary quality . ''

		Mr.
Crane	PERSON	, once more , is an author '' utterly without merit . ''

		No half-measures with
A. C. McC	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Again quotations are at hand .

		De - tached sentences are given , and anything disapproved of is italicised .

		The odd part about it is that most of the expressions thus crucified seem to me admirable and picturesque .

		That there is a youthful and occasionally reckless daring about some , is true enough .

		But on the whole I am prepared to back Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's sense of lan - guage against ''
A. C. McC	ORGANIZATION	.

		's . ''

		However , I am concerned little here with the merits of Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's work .

		The book can take care of itself quite well .

		I was surprised at ''
A. C. McC	ORGANIZATION	.

		's '' singular criticisms , and thought that a few words from '' the other side '' might be fairly called for .

		JOURNALISTIC AUTHORITIES ON ENGLISH .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the
February	DATE	''
Bookman	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Richard Burton	PERSON	reproaches Mr.
Robert Barr	PERSON	for his heterodoxies on shall and will .

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	pronounces the philosophy of the auxiliaries as simple as the familiar table he gives ; but Mr.
Burton	PERSON	is apparently ignorant that this table leaves out all the real difficulties and most of the import - ant doctrine .

		Questions and dependent sentences of the various forms comprehend most possibilities of violat - ing the accepted cauons ; and Mr.
Burton	PERSON	's confidence is evidently based mainly on deficient understanding of the scope of his subject .

		Again , Mr.
Burton	PERSON	tells us that the differences be - tween shall and will have been '' perpetuated and adorned by the choicest and happiest writers for some six hundred years . ''

		On the other hand , authorities like
Matzner	PERSON	,
Abbott	LOCATION	,
Latham	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	, and
Kellner	PERSON	, tell us that the distinction is of very recent origin and of not invariable demarcation ; and the testimony of
Blackburn	LOCATION	's capital study is in substantial harmony with their views .

		Shakespeare and
King James	ORGANIZATION	's translators certainly lived less than
six hundred years ago	DATE	, yet they did not succeed in mastering '' the very different shadings of these auxiliary words . ''

		Finally , Mr.
Burton	PERSON	does '' not hesitate to say cate - gorically that no great English stylist can be mentioned who does not uniformly prove himself a master of the very different shadings gained by the proper handling of these auxiliary words . ''

		We have already been forced to expel Shakespeare and
King James	LOCATION	's transla - tors from the fold of '' choicest and happiest writers '' : now we must exclude from the number of '' great En - glish stylists '' various impostors who have so long hyp - notized critics .

		Stevenson is by no means an uncommon offender in this particular , in spite of Mr.
Burton	PERSON	's eulogistic exemption ; while
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Brooke	PERSON	,
Hughes	LOCATION	,
Myers	PERSON	,
Eliot	LOCATION	,
Symonds	PERSON	,
Newman	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	,
Lytton	LOCATION	, also forfeit their claim , not necessarily to general good behavior , but absolutely to impeccabil - ity : not one of them is '' faultily faultless '' ; every one of them is at times guilty of a mishandling that , accord - ing to Mr.
Burton	PERSON	, '' bespeaks the lack of literary expe - rience . ''

		I hold myself ready to furnish citations to doubters .

		Why the ''
Bookman	PERSON	'' should allow its limited space to be used by Mr.
Barr	PERSON	and Mr.
Burton	PERSON	for such pur - poses , I can not divine , any more than I can pretend to estimate what Mr.
Burton	PERSON	risks in his categorical asser - tions .

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	certainly has a very superficial knowl - edge of shall and will , of the development of English usage , of the diction of English stylists ; and perhaps that is the very reason why , in an age that has abjured the last superstitions of noble minds the divine right of kings , verbal inspiration , papal infallability , and the innate superiority of woman alike he `` perpetuates and adorns '' an impossible fetich .

		There is , neither in instinct nor in self-conscious analytical explanation , any such guarantee of immunity as Mr.
Burton	PERSON	's optimism assumes .

		The writers above specified do not , it is true , exemplify to a very trying extent the American and the Keltic tendency towards `` I will '' for `` I shall , ''
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 299 though they do at times exemplify it too far to jus - tify proximate infallibility ; but they freely use `` I would '' for '' I should , '' '' will you '' for '' shall you , '' while '' would '' is by them used almost indifferently with '' should '' or to its supersedure , in certain forms of dependent sentence .

		Apropos of the ''
Bookman	PERSON	'' and English , that jour - nal 's
April	DATE	inquiry of the
Poet Laureate	ORGANIZATION	illustrates the difficulty of getting and keeping any faith once de - livered to any saints .

		The ''
Bookman	PERSON	'' asks the
Lau	PERSON	- reate to give the construction of '' seat '' in '' who was given a seat '' a point , another point , of sympathetic contact with the '' Sun . ''

		A college professor of Latin ought to find commonplace the conversion of dative with active to subject with passive , the accusative remaining a phenomenon which has been immemorial in En - glish .

		Examples can be multiplied indefi - nitely from all ages and forms of English , for the con - struction is natural and unimpeachable , in spite of the ''
Bookman	PERSON	's '' ignorance ; and '' it is so , '' even though we fail to see in the '' Sun '' or elsewhere '' in our midst . ''

		The '' Sun '' indeed goes so far with its misapplied preju - dices as to deny the validity of '' Mr.

Reed	PERSON	was presented '' ; whereas the double construction of present has never , I believe , been questioned by any - body : verily , the veteran editor here stands so straight as to bend backwards .

		Yet , such is the irony of fate and the tendency of human nature to break out even amongst the Shakers as
Artemus Ward	PERSON	puts it in his New Haven lecture on Lincoln , Mr.
Dana	PERSON	is reported in the '' Sun '' as saying , '' Now we are denied this right '' an involuntary , and hence a more significant , tribute to the vitality of true doctrine .

		Indeed , not only is the construction sustained by the consensus of authority and illustrated by every natural writer of English , but -LRB- as Mr.

		LIFE AND LETTERS OF DR.
HOLMES	PERSON	.

		* Dr.
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	says somewhere , touching a class of authors who have been sar - castically charged with arming the
King of Terrors	ORGANIZATION	with a new sting for eminent people , '' I should like to see any man 's biography with corrections and emendations by his ghost ... Just imagine the subject of one of those extra - ordinary fictions called biographies coming back and reading the life of himself , written very probably by someone or other who thought he could turn a penny by doing it . ''

		Were it pos - sible for the Autocrat himself to revisit with critical intent '' the glimpses of the moon , '' we venture to say his honored shade would find little to alter or seriously except to in Mr.
Morse	PERSON	's delightful '' Life and Letters of
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	, '' now before us .

		Mr.
Morse	PERSON	has given us a satisfactory biography and a rarely entertaining book as well despite the fact that the career he depicts was , as he says , outwardly so uneventful '' that the utter absence of anything in it to remark upon became in itself remarkable . ''

		Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, as we know , in his youth spent two years abroad as a med - ical student , and he revisited
Europe	LOCATION	for three months in his old age ; these were the only marked aberrations from the narrow orbit of a tranquil professional and literary life passed , one may say , in the shadow of that
State House	ORGANIZATION	which one of his characters , with a cheerful and abiding faith in things Bostonian , styles '' the hub of the solar system . ''

		The Doctor 's life was entirely that of the private citizen .

		Unlike many contemporary men of letters , he never shone , nor sought to shine , in politics ; he never held , nor '' ran for , '' any office ; he resisted the efforts made to draw him into a more militant part in the political struggles which resulted in the abolition of slavery ; less justly perhaps than any of his illustrious friends could he , recalling the stirring events of his time , have added , `` Et quorum pars magnafui . ''

		The autobiography upon which Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	is pretty generally supposed to have been en - gaged for some time prior to his death dwindles in point of fact into some scattered notes and memoranda , mainly early reminiscences jotted down at odd moments , without method , connec - tion , or revision .

		These occupy a chapter of * LIFE AND LETTERS OF OLTVEK
WENDELL HOLMES	PERSON	.

		By
John T. Morse	PERSON	, Jr. .

		In two volumes , illustrated .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		300 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, some twenty odd pages in the present work , and Mr.
Morse	PERSON	has wisely printed them almost intact .

		They are sprinkled with allusions to the writer 's old bugbear , Calvinism , and con - tain some amusing memories of the clergymen with whom his father used to exchange pulpits .

		These clergymen he divides into two classes : pleasant men -LRB- if a trifle weak in the theolog - ical joints -RRB- , with a cheerful look and smile in spite of its being the Sabbath day ; and men of grim and dejected mien whose presence lent additional gloom to the Puritan
Sunday	DATE	, and who preached , as they phrased it , '' as dying men to dying men . '' ''

		To one of the most distinguished leaders of the Or - thodox party I had an instinctive dislike from early childhood .

		I was told that I laughed when I went to church and heard him preach .

		I remember upsetting his inkstand , which left a very black spot in my mem - ory .

		Another had a twist in his mouth that knocked a benediction out of shape , and proved afterwards to have a twist in his morals of a still more formidable character . ''

		As to his early reading , the Doctor says : '' I read few books through .

		I remember writing on the last page of one that I had successfully mastered , perlegi , with the sense that it was a great triumph to have read quite through a volume of such size .

		But I have always read in books rather than through them , and always with more profit from the books I read in than the books I read through j for when I set out to read through a book , I always felt that I had a task be - fore me , but when I read in a book it was the page or the paragraph that I wanted , and which left its impres - sion and became part of my intellectual furniture . ''

		Pope 's Homer was his prime favorite . ''

		... To the present time the grand couplets ring in my ears and stimulate my imagination , in spite of their formal symmetry , which makes them hateful to the lawless versifiers who find anthems in the clash of blacksmiths ' hammers , and fugues in the jangle of sleigh-bells . ''

		Of another book which was early put in his hands the Doctor observes : ''
Bunyan	PERSON	's ` Pilgrim 's Progress ' that wonderful work of imagination , with all its beauty and power seemed to me then , as it does now , more like the hunt - ing of sinners with a pack of demons for the amusement of the Lord of the terrestrial manor than like the ten - der care of a father for his offspring .

		... It represents the universe as a trap which catches most of the human vermin that have its bait dangled before them , and the only wonder is that a few escape the elaborate arrange - ments made for their capture . ''

		What Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	was and how he fared dur - ing his student days at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and at
Paris	LOCATION	is chiefly to be gathered from two groups of let - ters -LRB- given by Mr.
Morse	PERSON	in separate chapters in their chronological place in the narrative -RRB- , the one group addressed to an
Andover	LOCATION	school friend ,
Phineas Barnes	PERSON	, the other to members of his own family .

		These early letters are mainly such as any clever young man with a good flow of wit and animal spirits might write under like circumstances .

		There is an occa - sional twinkle in them of the peculiar humor of the future '' Autocrat , '' and one is even led to suspect that there was a certain tincture of the ways of '' the young fellow called John '' in the Doctor 's youthful make-up .

		Indeed , Mr.
Morse	PERSON	admits -LRB- rather gingerly -RRB- that his distinguished relative had always '' a considerable infusion of the ' sporting man ' in his composition . ''

		He was for years a zealous boating man , and boasted a small fleet of his own -LRB- including a '' shell '' -RRB- on the
Charles River	LOCATION	; he owned to a penchant for the '' ring , '' possessed the '' Box - iana '' prints , and has preserved more than one doughty modern Entellus in the amber of his racy prose ; he loved a good horse -LRB- one of his most cherished European memories was that he saw `` Plenipotentiary '' win the Derby -RRB- , was learned in equine matters , and used to say , when a young physician , that what he liked best about practising medicine was that '' he had to keep a horse and chaise . ''

		Mr.
Morse	PERSON	draws an amusing picture of the young practitioner charging about the country in this ambitious vehicle a `` one-hoss-shay , '' apparently , of the type of the Deacon 's masterpiece : '' In one of the clumsy great vehicles of that day , swung upon huge C springs , vibrating in every direction , the little gentleman used to appear advancing along the road , at once in peril and a cause of peril , bouncing inse - curely upon the seat , and driving always a mettlesome steed at an audacious speed . ''

		Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, as we know , won no marked suc - cess as a practising physician .

		His reputation as '' a gay young fellow , '' as a jester -LRB- he an - nounced to his prospective clients that their '' smallest fevers would be thankfully re - ceived '' -RRB- , and still more as a poet -LRB- he recklessly published a book of poems at the outset of his medical career -RRB- , were at first sorely against him ; and he soon drifted to the academic side of his profession .

		Here , his influence for good must have been , as an English writer observes , incalculable .

		Thoroughly versed in the theory and practice of his calling , of keen insight into facts , alert , kindly , sympathetic , gifted with rare power of concise , racy expression , and of singular personal charm , it is indeed difficult to conceive of a man more fitted to shine in the role of teacher .

		Mr.
Morse	PERSON	does full justice , in an interesting chapter studded with tributes from ex-pupils and former co-workers , to Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	's academic labors and services .

		To teach something thoroughly was his ideal .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 301 '' Smatterings , and the conceit of half knowledge , were odious to Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	; and as in this country they rise to the dignity of a national characteristic , he had to wage unresting war against them .

		He said : Our Amer - ican atmosphere is vocal with the flippant loquacity of half knowledge .

		We must accept whatever good can be got out of it , and keep it under as we do sorrel and mullein and witchgrass , by enriching the soil , and sow - ing good seed in plenty ; by teaching and good books , rather than by wasting time in talking against it .

		Half knowledge dreads nothing but whole knowledge . ''

		In the spirit of the foregoing , Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	used to express an indignant contempt for the notion , once prevalent , and now mildly recrud - escent in the form of a pseudo-literary fad , that a proper way of showing '' American independ - ence of
England	LOCATION	'' was to forswear '' good En - glish '' in speaking and writing , and affect an unwashed dialect , '' redolent of the soil '' and patriotically free from the taint of a mean sub - servience to '' foreign models . ''

		Mr.
Morse	PERSON	recalls '' once hearing a gentleman of some reputation in literature say actually in ad - dressing the
Board of Overseers	ORGANIZATION	of a distin - guished seat of learning that he did not ap - prove of teaching young men to write ' good English , ' to use words accurately , and to con - struct sentences grammatically ; on the con - trary , he said that he wanted an infusion of the wild rough inaccuracies of the great new West ! ''

		If Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	were present on this occasion he must certainly have been seized with
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's desire to '' examine the gentleman 's organs '' if not to add a '' bump '' or two to the original quota .

		A writer in the '' Quarterly Review '' -LRB- cited by the author -RRB- says of the debt of American literature to Holmes : '' When young
America	LOCATION	demanded that the political revolution which separated the Old and New Worlds should have its literary counterpart in a similar revolt ,
Holmes	PERSON	threw all his influence in the opposite scale .

		He urged with keen satire , as well as with the force of ex - ample , that even a Republic must recognize the laws of conventional decorum , and that those who enter the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	of the Muses outrage propriety if they osten - tatiously flaunt their working-dress .

		To him as much as any other man we owe it , that the
Versailles	LOCATION	of American literature has not been invaded to a greater extent than it has by the vocabulary and manners of the < Halles . ' ''

		Mr.
Morse	PERSON	discusses the literary side of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	's career intelligently and temperately , and wisely refrains from the attempt to fore - cast the exact place his works are destined to take in the future .

		Of the poems , he prefers '' The Last Leaf , '' placing it in point of merit before '' The Chambered Nautilus '' to our thinking a somewhat doubtful judgment . ''

		The Last Leaf '' is perhaps the most unique of the poems , the one to which it would be most dif - ficult to assign a fair poetical analogue ; but , applying
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's test , do not the quaint , crisp versicles , half - playful , half - tearful , fall below such high and genuine work as this ? ''

		This is the ship of pearl , which , poets feign , Sails the unshadowed main , The venturous bark that flings On the sweet
summer	DATE	wind its purpled wings In gulfs enchanted , where the Siren sings , And coral reefs lie bare , Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair . ''

		Summarizing his view of the poetry , Mr.
Morse	PERSON	concludes : '' There may , therefore , be doubt whether or not
Holmes	PERSON	was a great , inspired poet ; but there is no doubt at all that he was a charming singer , according to a dis - tinction which , it must be admitted , would affect the standing of some of the most delightful versifiers from the days of Sappho and Anacreon down to this current year . ''

		Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	was anything but a voluminous correspondent , and his collected letters -LRB- not reckoning those interspersed by the author in his narrative -RRB- occupy scarcely two-thirds of the second volume .

		But if these letters are rela - tively few , they are of the first order in point of merit and interest ; and the reader will find their perusal a rare treat .

		The editor has con - veniently divided them into six groups : those addressed to Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	, those to Mr.
J. W. Kimball	PERSON	, to Mr.
Motley	PERSON	, to Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	, to Mrs.
Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward	PERSON	, and '' Miscel - laneous Letters . ''

		The group to Mr.
Motley	PERSON	-LRB- `` unquestionably the Doctor 's best , '' thinks Mr.
Morse	PERSON	-RRB- indicate satisfactorily the state of the writer 's feelings and opinions during the Civil War .

		We have already noted the Doc - ter 's distaste for public affairs .

		His social and political conservatism , and his seeming apathy at a period when the organic national forces were plainly marshalling themselves for the '' irrepressible conflict , '' were oddly contrasted with his alert progressiveness in other matters , and his constant readiness to do battle for his religious and scientific opinions .

		Calvinism and homoeopathy he attacked with a zest and vigor that savored of the pure gaudium certaminis ; slavery , the cardinal iniquity of the hour , he long seemed willing to dally with tentatively , expressing the opinion -LRB-
1856	DATE	-RRB- that `` we must reach the welfare of the blacks through the dominant race '' a notion '' abhorrent to aboli - tionists . ''

		But when the war came , his attitude changed ; and he became , says Mr.
Morse	PERSON	, '' a strenuous , intense , often a greatly excited , patriot . ''

		In
1862	DATE	he wrote to Mr. Motley : '' ... They begin to talk about the entente cordiale between this country and
England	LOCATION	as likely to be rees - tablished so may it prove !

		Not that
England	LOCATION	can ever 302 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, be to us what she has been .

		Those sad words from
John Bright	PERSON	's letter hare expressed the feelings that have sunk deep into the hearts of all -LRB- who have hearts to be reached -RRB- among us . '

		There has been shown -LSB- us -RSB- no generosity , such as became a friendly nation , and no sympathy with -LSB- us -RSB- in -LSB- our -RSB- great calamity . '

		Those beautiful breasts of our ' mother ' country , from which it seemed that nothing could wean us , have shrivelled into the wolf 's dugs , and there is no more milk in them for us henceforth evermore .

		The West end is right .

		Not by aggression , but by the naked fact of existence , we are an eternal danger and an unsleeping threat to every government that founds itself on anything but the will of the governed .

		We begin to understand ourselves and what we represent , now that we find who are our enemies , and why and how they would garrote us now that our hands are on these felons ' throats , if they could paint a lie over so that its bones would not show through .

		I do believe Hell is empty of Devils for the last year , this planet has been so full of them helping the seces - sion liars ... '' I have told you I am hopeful , and always have been .

		Hands off , and we '11 lick these fellows out of their inso - lent adjectives .

		We did lick 'em well at Mill Spring the other day , and at Drainsville a little before this , and , I myself entertain no manner of doubt , can whip them man for man at any time , in a fair field , picked against picked , average against average .

		We are the conquerors of Nature , they of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's weaker children .

		We thrive on reverses and disappointments .

		I have never believed they could endure them .

		Like Prince
Rupert	PERSON	's drops , the unannealed fabric of rebellion shuts an explosive element in its resisting shell that will rend it in pieces as soon as its tail , not its head , is broken fairly off .

		That is what I think , I , safe prophet of a private correspon - dence , free to be convinced of my own ignorance , and presumption by events as they happen , and to prophesy again for what else do we live for but to guess the future in small things or great , that we may help to shape it , or ourselves to it ? ''

		The following characteristic extracts from later letters to Mr.
Motley	PERSON	-LRB- 1870 -RRB- need no comment . ''

		Another sensation in a somewhat different sphere is our new
Harvard College President	ORGANIZATION	.

		King Log has made room for
King Stork	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	makes the Cor - poration meet twice a month instead of once .

		He comes to the meeting of every Faculty , ours among the rest , and keeps us up to eleven and twelve o'clock at night discussing new arrangements .

		He shows an extraordin - ary knowledge of all that relates to every department of the
University	ORGANIZATION	, and presides with an aplomb , a quiet , imperturbable , serious good-humor , that it is impossible not to admire .

		We are , some of us , disposed to think that he is a little too much in a hurry with some of his innovations , and take care to let the Corporation know it .

		I saw three of them the other day and found that they were on their guard , as they all quoted that valu - able precept , festina lente , as applicable in the premises .

		1 can not help being amused at some of the scenes we have in our Medical Faculty , this cool , grave young man proposing in the calmest way to turn everything topsy-turvy , taking the reins into his hands and driving as if he were the first man that ever sat on the box ... In the meantime
Yale	ORGANIZATION	has chosen a

E. G. J. KOREAN	PERSON	GAMES .

		* Few American students have seriously stud - ied games .

		Among those who have Mr.
Stewart Culin	PERSON	certainly ranks very high .

		To his energy was due the remarkable and interesting exhibit of the games of the world shown at the
Chicago Exposition	ORGANIZATION	.

		Regarding this exhibit , he wrote a paper , published in the '' Journal of Amer - ican Folk-lore , '' which was an excellent and suggestive bit of work .

		He has written a num - ber of other papers upon the games of Amer - ican children and upon games of the Chinese , which have appeared in various periodicals , government reports , and independent pam - phlets .

		The work before us , '' Korean Games , '' is the most extensive he has undertaken .

		While the scope of the work is fairly indicated by the title , its full purpose is but partly set forth .

		The author says it '' is intended not only as a survey of the games of
Korea	LOCATION	but as a prac - tical introduction to the study of the games of the world . ''

		Its incentive was due to sugges - tions made by Mr.
Gushing	PERSON	, in regard to cer - tain North American Indian games .

		These pos - sessed some curious features which suggested new lines of study and comparison .

		Korea the
Hermit Nation	ORGANIZATION	has been an almost unknown land .

		It is extraordinarily interesting in its conservatism .

		While it has been much influenced by
Japan	LOCATION	and profoundly by
China	LOCATION	, it has shown considerable freedom and independence .

		In its games , it betrays * KOREAN GAMES , with Notes on the corresponding Games of

		THE DIAL 303 these influences from outside ; at times it also shows notable originality ; in some cases it ap - pears to have conservatively kept nearer to old , original forms than the other two countries .

		On the whole it may be said that the similarity between the games of
Korea	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	is greater than between those of
Korea	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The toys of children are curiously alike the world over .

		The little figures that are weighted so as to stand upright interest Korean children as they do our own .

		Kites are great favorites in
Korea	LOCATION	, but are relatively simple .

		They are usually rectangular in form , with a circular hole in the middle , and are made of colored paper spread upon a bamboo frame .

		They pre - sent no such variety in form as in
China	LOCATION	, or even as in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Curiously , however , the
Koreans	LOCATION	assert that '' the Chinese do not know how to fly kites . ''

		The season for kite-flying closes in
Korea	LOCATION	with the
first half of the first month	DATE	.

		At the end of the season kites are sent adrift after wishes that the year 's misfortunes may go with them have been written upon them .

		While `` kite fighting '' or `` kite cutting '' is practiced in all three of the countries ,
Korea	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	, and Jap - an , it seems to be particularly in vogue in
Korea	LOCATION	.

		It is interesting to find that the little '' her - mits '' delight in a hand-clapping game with a rhythmic formula , very like our own '' Beans porridge hot . ''

		In
Korea	LOCATION	, too , we find that old game oh , so old of two players simulta - neously throwing fingers and guessing the sum thrown by the two .

		It is represented on Egyp - tian monuments , described in Latin authors , and played by Italian children today .

		There are in
Korea	LOCATION	surprisingly many games where chance decides who shall `` pay the piper . ''

		Thus two boys buy candy ; each breaks his piece : he in whose piece there is the biggest cavity pays for both .

		Two boys buy cherries ; one agrees to take a certain number , say forty , in his mouth and separate the pulp and pits , without swallowing a stone : failure requires his paying for both lots , success secures pay - ment for his by the other .

		Many such tests exist .

		Pitching pennies appears to be quite com - mon , and it is stated that some ten or more ways are known .

		In some of the games there are quite elaborate rules .

		Everyone , who has heard of
Korea	LOCATION	at all , knows of the curious sectional or factional fights that take place at set times .

		Begun by little boys , they become free for all before they end .

		Stones are the weapons , and results are not infrequently serious .

		The city of
Seoul	LOCATION	is divided into five Pou -LRB- sections -RRB- Middle ,
East	LOCATION	,
West	LOCATION	, South , North .

		There the faction fights take place between the inhabitants of these divisions .

		These section fights are really the old quarrels of savage tribes , jealous of ter - ritorial rights , surviving on as custom into civ - ilization .

		They exist , still more meaningless and less definite , among ourselves in the fights between different `` gangs '' of boys in the streets of our great cities .

		But the interest of Mr.
Culin	PERSON	's study cul - minates in the board games and matching games of grown people .

		The game of Nyout where a board is used , upon which is marked out a diagram , along which pieces are moved in accordance with a decree given by throwing marked blocks is a good and simple type of a large class of games .

		Among such games are pachisi -LRB- parcheesi -RRB- , backgammon , etc. .

		In Nyout , the path followed is a circle with two diameters crossing at right angles at the centre ; in pachisi , the circular path has been crowded down about and close to the cross-bars ; in back - gammon the cross-bars disappear and the circle becomes a rectangle .

		In all three the move - ment of the pieces is controlled by the throwing of dice or the dropping of sticks .

		Chess exists widely through the Orient .

		Chi - nese and Korean chess differ in some details , and
Culin	PERSON	considers the Korean form the more finished and logical .

		Still , in the Hermit Na - tion , it is looked upon as a '' frivolous pastime , suitable for young persons and rustics . ''

		Dominoes are practically the same in
China	LOCATION	and
Korea	LOCATION	.

		A common Korean game is quite like the Chinese fortune-telling with dominoes .

		Culin believes that dominoes originated in a system of divination by means of two dice .

		He also believes cards to have grown out of divin - ation .

		He says : '' They are clearly copied from slips of bamboo , such as are used as divining lots at the present day in
China	LOCATION	.

		In fact , an almost exact replica of the Korean pack is to be found in the eighty consecutively numbered lots , .

		ts ` in , used by Chinese gamblers to divine the lucky num - bers in the lottery called Pak-kop-piu .

		The latter re - tain the arrow-like tip , while the cards bear the arrow feather , and the names of both are almost identical with that of arrow tsin . ''

		As here suggested , our author believes the lot - sticks themselves to be derived from arrows used in divination ; the original divining box was , to his mind , the quiver .

		These bits , taken from the book here and there , suggest the interesting mass of material .

		In the introductory chapter are some important generalizations and suggestions .

		The two chief questions involved in the study of games are 304 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, origin and distribution .

		Mr.
Culin	PERSON	believes that games have been , very largely , not con - scious inventions , but unconscious survivals from primitive conditions in which they orig - inated in magical rites and chiefly as a means of divination .

		We have suggested part of the argument above .

		Not alone in
China	LOCATION	and
Korea	LOCATION	, but also along our own
Northwest Coast	ORGANIZATION	, divin - ation slips and gambling sticks have been copied from dropped arrows .

		In many games curious cosmic ideas are found .

		The Nyout board combines the cross of the world directions and the circle .

		The falling or divided arrows de - termine numbers . ''

		A diagram upon which the counts are made allows the ascertaining of place .

		This diagram , whether the nyout circuit , or the eight or sixty-four diagrams , the pachisi cross on the chess board , invariably stands for the world .

		The cosmical import of game boards is often plainly manifest , but in none more clearly than in the Korean board forpa-tok , whose quarters are designated by the cosmical symbols .

		It is apparent in the divinatory games that the counts refer ultimately to people , and that the counters actually stand for men .

		In the pachisi board they are differentiated with the colors of the world-quarters . ''

		The book is beautiful in mechanical execu - tion almost too much so for a scientific book intended for use .

		The white cover , bearing the two-principles symbol in blue and red at the centre and four of the trigrams at the corners in blue , presents a striking appearance .

		Twenty - two full-page plates , in color , reproduced from original Korean paintings , represent games in progress .

		A large number of cuts from Jap - anese originals are scattered through the text .

		* The secret of
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	's power is suggested in these words of Thoreau : '' There is no hope for you unless the bit of sod under your feet is the sweetest to you in this world in any world . ''

		The very fact of being alive was to
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	joy enough .

		To be alive here and now , with all these charming people , this bright sunshine , this blue sky , the green grass and clear waters , and above all this noble work to do , this in - deed was a condition meet for the gods .

		secret at once of
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	's personal charm , his power as a teacher , and his success as an inves - tigator .

		In this tremendous optimism , the op - timism of the man who fears nothing , shrinks from no effort , and knows no despair ,
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	stands unique among men of science . ''

		When surrounded by material difficulties he fortified his spirit by a marvellous power of always hoping for better times , having an absolutely unshaken confidence in himself . '' ''

		Blood runs quick in his veins , '' said
Lowell	PERSON	, '' and he has the joy of animal vigor to a degree rare among men a true male in all its meaning . ''

		In his youth
Agassiz	PERSON	writes to his father that his aim is to be '' a good son , a good citizen , and the first naturalist of his time , '' and that he feels within him '' the strength of a whole generation to work towards this end . ''

		In his manhood , in whatever he did , as
Darwin	PERSON	once said , he '' counts for three . ''

		In his old age he hesitated not to begin work which it might take half a century to make effective .

		In all his life to his last words , '' le jeu est fini , '' he was the same joyous , genial , sanguine enthusiast , a great , wise , overgrown , independent , eloquent , happy boy , with a boy 's love for life , for the earth , and for whatever he could do with it . ''

		The best friend that ever student had , '' is his worth - iest epitaph .

		Not less characteristic are these words of another student : '' We buried him from the chapel that stands among the College elms .

		The students laid a wreath of laurel on his bier , and their manly voices sang a requiem .

		For he had been a student all his life long , and when he died he was younger than any of them . ''

		Agassiz was no type of the bookworm or the recluse .

		His thought was always joined to action , which is the normal conclusion to all thought .

		He recognized instinctively and to the full that the ultimate end of science is hu - man conduct .

		He had no likeness to
Brown	PERSON	- ing 's Grammarian , with his high and narrow aims which could not be translated into human movement and relations to men .

		In everything he did ,
Agassiz	PERSON	was accompanied by a trail of students , followers , and associates .

		He always thought , says
Marcou	PERSON	, '' that he had not enough friends or associates around him .

		His home was a sort of phalanstery of Savants . ''

		Failure was impossible with him , for his very boldness in facing the greatest difficulties without flinch - ing constantly brought him help from those who could appreciate the man , even if not fully understanding his aims .

		This was especially true in
America	LOCATION	, where over and over again he found rich friends who , as one of them said ,
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 305 were '' not willing to stand by and see so brave a man struggle without aid . ''

		One of
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	's associates , an early friend and fellow-student , brought by him from
Swit	PERSON	- zerland to help him in his geological investiga - tions , was
Jules Marcou	PERSON	.

		In his '' Life , Let - ters , and Works of
Louis Agassiz	PERSON	, ''
Marcou	PERSON	has tried with great conscientiousness to give us a true picture of the man .

		In this he has had the advantage of a lifelong acquaintance and access to a great number of unpublished letters and documents .

		He had shared
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	's suc - cesses and failures , his successes being chiefly scientific , his failures chiefly financial .

		There can be no question of the fidelity of Mr.
Marcou	PERSON	's efforts and intentions .

		In taking the volumes as a whole , the result is a marked success .

		In these books one can not fail to see a clear picture of Agassiz as he was , rising above all their verbiage , their repetitions , their naive moralizations , and their still more naive exhibitions of prejudice .

		There are many sen - tences of Marcou which reveal forgotten per - sonal strifes and jealousies more interesting to the author than to the reader , and which might well have been left in oblivion .

		It is evident that had
Marcou	PERSON	been in
Agassiz	LOCATION	's place the list of students and associates in his '' phalan - stery '' would have been reduced by more than half , and those who for reasons not always clearly given fail to meet
Marcou	PERSON	's approval , are mercilessly scored .

		On the other hand , many who were rivals with
Marcou	PERSON	in
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	's good graces are treated with a generosity usu - ally well deserved .

		For say what one may of the treachery of Desor , the snobbery of
Forbes	LOCATION	, or the uneasy vanity of several others , the great body of the Agassiz guild , both at
Neufchatel	ORGANIZATION	and at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, were men in every way worthy of the master they followed .

		Marcou 's work appears at its best when it deals with the scientific efforts of
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	, rather than with his own opinions .

		The latter are given with child-like simplicity which some - times drops into bluntness , as when he criticises
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	's family affairs or rebukes him for his familiarity with his assistants .

		Marcou 's treatment of the subject of Evolu - tion is delightful in its simplicity .

		He can see nothing in the work of
Darwin	LOCATION	,
Lyell	PERSON	, and Huxley but philosophical speculation . ''

		Agassiz was unwilling to abandon the method of exposition of facts which he found established in science , and substitute in its place metaphysics and hypotheses . ''

		`` Philosophical naturalists would find their task a very barren one if there were no classifiers , no embry - ologists , no paleontologists .

		It is very well to theorize and discuss teleology , agnosticism , spiritism , morphol - ogy , mimicry , natural selection , evolution , transformism , etc. , but before everything else we must know the his - tory of every animal , of every plant , and accumulate all that constitutes the treasuries of every branch of nat - ural history . ''

		In one place
Marcou	PERSON	drops from prejudice to slander , and in this he ceases to be funny .

		He says that
Darwin	PERSON	's `` Origin of Species '' became a thorn in
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	's side . ''

		His pupils in a body turned against him , for they were delighted to believe that they knew more than he of the philosophy of natural history , the descent of man , the creative power of horticulturists and of pigeon - breeders , and the mutability of species and genera .

		To the disgust of
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	, they turned from their master to applaud all the articles on evolution and origin of species published in American periodicals by
Asa Gray	LOCATION	,
Chauncey Wright	PERSON	, and
John Fiske	PERSON	, the last two not even naturalists . ''

		It is simply silly to affirm that such childish motives could have influenced such men as Le Conte ,
Hyatt	LOCATION	,
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	,
Allen	PERSON	,
Packard	ORGANIZATION	,
Shaler	PERSON	,
Brooks	PERSON	,
Whitman	PERSON	, and the rest .

		It would be more true to say that these men followed to the letter the precepts of their master .

		They adopted as scientific truth the '' working hy - pothesis '' of transformism by
Natural Selection	ORGANIZATION	and other influences only after all other con - ceivable hypotheses had ceased to work .

		In the light of the varied biological studies to which
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	had introduced them , they could not cling to the old notion of the special crea - tion of species and '' look an animal in the face . ''

		The unique episode of the school at
Penikese	LOCATION	is well treated by
Marcou	PERSON	.

		In plan and devel - opment this school was thoroughly characteris - tic of the man .

		It was the '' little Academy '' at
Munich	LOCATION	and the '' Hotel des Neufchatelois '' on the glacier of the
Lauter Aar	ORGANIZATION	over again .

		Had Agassiz been in the prime of life it would have been more notable and fruitful than any of these earlier associations .

		As it was , we may still say that , notwithstanding all the rich streams of science which have since come to us from
Germany	LOCATION	, '' the school of all schools which has had the most influence on the teaching of science in
America	LOCATION	was held in an old barn on an uninhabited island .

		It lasted but three months , and in fact had but one teacher .

		The school at
Penikese	LOCATION	existed in the personal pres - ence of Agassiz : when he died , it vanished ! ''

		306 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, THE TEACHING OF LATIN .

		* We feel sure that all progressive teachers of Latin are in thorough sympathy with the aim of Dr. Coy 's new '' Latin Lessons for Be - ginners , '' namely , to introduce the pupil early to good connected Latin reading and at the same time to give him a thorough knowledge of the common forms and simple constructions .

		After but eighteen lessons on formal grammar , including three declensions and the indicative mode of the four conjugations and of swm , the author plunges in medias res and begins
Viri Romce	PERSON	.

		This is followed by
Nepos ' Life of Timoleon	ORGANIZATION	and by
Caesar	PERSON	's campaign against Ver - cingetorix .

		We can not help wishing that he had waited just a little longer so that systematic work in grammar might not be thrown out of joint quite so soon .

		We grant that the author has done remarkably well under the circum - stances , but the exigencies of the text neces - sarily divorce and unfortunately separate many grammatical facts and principles that naturally belong together .

		The author aims to overcome this by continuous quizzing on the preceding work and by many reviews .

		These will no doubt assist in binding together isolated facts ; but it must not be forgotten that young pupils are very slow to correlate and classify knowl - edge properly .

		To assist students in doing so , the book stands in great need of an index , for the material is so arranged that we fear they will often find great difficulty in referring back to some point to which inquiry has been directed .

		To develop reading power , the passages for translation are supplemented by short sentences based upon the text , in
Latin	LOCATION	and in English , for translation at sight .

		This feature is an ex - cellent one .

		We fear that some of the exer - cises , especially those in English , will prove too difficult , but the test of the class-room can alone decide that .

		Another commendable fea - ture is that after the seventieth lesson the spe - cial vocabularies under each are removed to the end of the book , that students may be en - couraged to read without them .

		Vocabulary is further fostered by frequent attention to En - glish derivatives and groups of kindred Latin words .

		It would have been well , also , to give more attention to word formation in the special and general vocabularies .

		In general the book deserves approval both for its plan and for the way it is carried out .

		* LATIN LESSONS FOB BEGINNERS .

		By
E. W. Coy	PERSON	, Ph.D. , Principal of
Hughes High School	ORGANIZATION	,
Cincinnati	LOCATION	.


New York	LOCATION	: American Book Company .

		There are some matters of detail which we believe invite criticism .

		Among the most im - portant are the following : Dr. Coy states that '' the long and short vowels differ only in the time occupied in uttering them , '' whereas it is reasonably certain that there was a difference between them in quality as well as in quantity , , most marked in the case of e , e , and o , 6 ; but also appreciable in the case of i , i , and u ,
u. Again	PERSON	, the accent of words is marked in all paradigms .

		This seems not only unnecessary but unwise .

		The laws of Latin accent are so simple that they can be very easily applied , es - pecially when the quantities are marked .

		Mark - ing the accent will lead students to neglect to note the quantity , which should be their guide - in determining it .

		With reference to quantity
Marx	PERSON	has been followed , although his work has been already largely revised by an American scholar and is inconsistent with all Latin - English Dictionaries .

		The statement with reference to the future of the 3d and 4th conjugations -LRB- p. 36 -RRB- , the treat - ment of verbs in io , and of purpose and result clauses , seem quite unsatisfactory .

		The rule with reference to the declension of numerals -LRB- 277 , e -RRB- is obscure to say the least , neither is it clear how the statement that '' the locative in the plural number has the form of the dative or ablative '' -LRB- 283 , a -RRB- can be made to tally with the history of that case .

		The declension of trux is given -LRB- 253 -RRB- as the paradigm for adjec - tives of one ending , without is in the accusa - tive plural , though that is the more common ending for all that class .

		The author has been careful as a rule to ad - mit only essentials .

		We question the utility of mentioning the rare locative domui in the declension of domus , and of including the un - usual word gloriola in the list of words -LRB- 263 -RRB- .

		We note a few inconsistencies : the explana - tions of natu maior , 89 and 144 , do not agree r neither do the statements about the genitive of vis in 116 and in the vocabulary .

		There are also a number of slips of more or less import - ance , among them the following : vultum -LRB- 141 -RRB- is called a noun of the fifth declension ; fad for passive infinitive offacio -LRB- 169 -RRB- ; no infin - itive is given under the periphrastic conjuga - tions -LRB- 212 -RRB- .

		The book is attractive in appearance and the proof-reading has been carefully done .

		It is to be regretted that there is no map of
Rome	LOCATION	and of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		The geographical notes , of which there are a number , are worse than useless without .

		THE DIAL 307 SOME RECEXT EDUCATIONAL , BOOKS .

		* Miss
Catharine Aiken	PERSON	's '' Method of Mind Train - ing '' is a slight book in truth its real substance might be put into fifty of its very small pages which details the author 's devices in mental gym - nastics as used in her schoolroom .

		The strength - ening of attention was the chief object in view , and since attention practically equals intellectual effort , or study , or application , the real end coincides with the chief end of education .

		To get strong , accurate , quick attention ,
Miss Aiken	LOCATION	saw that she must have sufficient motive or interest , and of the common motives fear , hope , emulation , curiosity , feeling of duty she relied mainly on emulation .

		By put - ting words and numbers on a swinging blackboard and allowing them to be seen but a few seconds , she stimulated competition in calling words and num - bers in their order , in spelling , etc. .

		Miss
Aiken	PERSON	does not appear to use '' word-game , '' i. e. , the giving out of a word from which to form other words within a limited time .

		This tests both vocabulary and spelling in a very interesting way .

		Many , however , will be disposed to criticize all such devices as un - healthy tours de force , as more or less mechanical reproductions , as mere tests of quickness which will discourage slower but often more solid minds , and as providing in emulation a low and unworthy method ; and yet all must agree that
Miss Aiken	PERSON	's methods are suggestive , and may with some minds be highly successful .

		In Mr.
Charles W. Mann	PERSON	's '' School Recreations and Amusements '' we find much that we should not look for , and do not find much we should look for .

		Indeed , a large part of the book is concerned with mere formal exercises , as in gymnastics , or with direct pedagogical method .

		On any strict inter - pretation of his title , about three-fourths of Mr.
Mann	PERSON	's book is irrelevant .

		On the other hand , we fail to find mention of such distinctly school-games as '' word-game , '' `` geography-game , '' and `` in-sight - and-unseen . ''

		Geography-game , played by holding up lettered cards , and asking for rivers , towns , etc. , beginning with the letter shown , may be adapted to history and other studies .

		The loaning of pictures is not treated , nor yet the competitive finding of Latin words in English dress .

		`` We notice that while the writer discourages geog - raphy rhymes , he tends to encourage history rhymes , which is hardly consistent .

		The book as a whole lacks newness , suggestiveness , and completeness , and at the best is only a passable compilation and compendium .

		The account of the public school system of On - tario by the Hon.
G. W. Ross	PERSON	will be found of inter - est and value in many respects to us who dwell in '' the States . ''

		In some ways
Ontario	LOCATION	's system is certainly superior to ours , as in its greater unity and centralization , its general inspectorship , and in the publication of school books by the central provincial authority ; but it is inferior in that it gives Roman Catholics their own public schools .

		The appendix on sanitation in rural schools shows some curious and suggestive statistics .

		Next on our list we have three
Froebel	PERSON	books . ''

		Froebel 's Gifts '' and ''
Froebel	PERSON	's Occupations '' are manuals which are well written and clear in expo - sition , and well fitted to serve their purpose in as - sisting mothers and teachers in kindergarten work .

		Both volumes abound , like most kindergarten books , with quotations and references , which must be ac - counted a defect in a manual .

		The third book , ''
Froebel	PERSON	's Mother Play , '' is poetically and music - ally the best arrangement that has been made .

		How - ever ,
Froebel	PERSON	could easily be improved on in making play-songs which should deal with the environment of the child to-day .

		For instance , the cuckoo song and the wheelwright song can mean nothing to the American child .

		We need two distinctly new books , one adapted to the child in the country and one to the child in the town .

		Further , the illustrations , being uncolored , small , and archaic , are not suited to the child of to-day .

		Froebel should not become a fetich ; it is time that kindergartenism got beyond him .

B. A. Hinsdale	PERSON	's '' Studies in

		Consequently , the style is oral rather than literary .

		A bundle of papers of this kind which has no continuous theme hardly makes a book in the strict sense , though each paper may have had by itself a certain practical value in connection with the occasion for which it was prepared .

May 16	DATE	, by Dr.
H. T. Lukens	PERSON	, aims to be a clear , full , and practical monograph for teachers .

		This implies , we think , that it should be thoroughly inductive in spirit and method , proceeding immediately from examples in actual school - room experience to the simplest generalizations and definitions .

		This book , being complex , general , and in style very dry , is far from this ideal , though it may compare favorably with similar treatises .

		Its defects are in some measure due to its Herbartianism .

		An unnecessary history of the psychology of association is given -LRB- pp. 39-43 -RRB- .

		Mr.
H. Holman	PERSON	in his '' Education '' sets forth what he takes to be an original conception , namely a u pure science of education '' deduced directly from psychogeny .

		However , the conception that education is but the application of the laws of men - tal development can scarcely be called new .

		Mr.
Holman	PERSON	's mode of exposition may be original , that is , a chapter of psychology followed by a chapter of inferred educational principles .

		This order repeated often through the book tends to split up subjects and leads to repetition .

		It would have been better to treat each main principle in its whole extent with its psychological basis in a single chapter introduced by concrete illustrations , and a final chapter on inter - relation .

		Many points in Mr.
Holman	PERSON	's book invite criticism , for example , his conception of educa - tion as purely intellectual -LRB- p. 20 -RRB- and the stress he lays on repetition -LRB- p. 117 -RRB- .

		However , it is on the whole a meritorious work , and gives fairly well a large , judicious , and , in the main , sound outline of the modern doctrine of education .

		The material is well digested , although we have the common vice of pedagogical literature , over-use of quotation .

		The style is clear and direct .

		The Appendix should be Americanized .

		English scholars .

		Aside from
Pollock	LOCATION	and
Maitland	PERSON	and Round , what students of
England	LOCATION	's history and institutions compare with
Felix Liebermann	PERSON	or Vino - gradoff or Busch ?


Rudolph Gneist	PERSON	, who has just died , might be cited also , and the late Bishop of Ches - ter would be the only one who could wear his armor .

		In
Felix Makower	PERSON	's '' Constitutional History of the Church of
England	LOCATION	, '' the field of English church history is now occupied , and with that thoroughness characteristic of German scholarship .

		If there is any source , prominent authority , or article of value omitted , which bears even indirectly upon the sub - ject , a diligent search has failed to discover it .

		The bibliography appended to the work fills twenty - nine pages .

		The extent to which black-letter Latin tomes and other documentary sources have been not merely cited but used is remarkable .

		In view of the fact that the page-print is beautifully large and distinct , while the notes are clearly but finely printed , it will not be a rash assertion to say that one-half of the work is comprised in the notes .

		The minuteness of the writer 's accuracy may be ap - preciated when we find him citing the preamble to the Constitutions of
Clarendon	LOCATION	, and then adding specific directions as to construction , of which this microscopic detail is an example : '' In
Stubbs	PERSON	, Select Charters , a comma is placed after sui , whilst that after aliorum is omitted . ''

		It seems strange to find so little upon Wiclif or the Lollords in such a history , but the work is strictly what it purports to be a history of the constitution of the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of course such limitations bar it from popular usage , but for the serious student of eccles - iastical or civil history and institutions for the clergyman , the lawyer , and the university scholar the book is a veritable mine .

		It is written with unusual clearness and directness ; the legal qual - ity of the writer 's mind is observable throughout ; each page reads like a lawyer 's brief .

		The book is admirably analyzed , a system of cross-references , in every case , making it possible to refer to collat - eral matter .

		There is nothing to indicate directly that the translation has been made by the author himself , but internal evidence points that way .

		Mr.
MacKinnon	PERSON	's study in international history , '' The Union of
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	, '' is a very different sort of work from Mr.
Makower	PERSON	's .

		The author lacks the calm temperament of a judicial writer , nor can he look at men and events as a third person ; for he is a Scotchman writing of his coun - try 's history and not a German studying that his - tory as something of interest yet wholly apart from himself .

		It is to be regretted that the personal equation should so largely have influenced a book written from so much contemporary evidence , '' in - cluding a large amount of new matter . ''

		Fourteen chapters recount the history of
Scotland	LOCATION	in the eighteenth century .

		The keynote is struck in the last chapter , `` Nationality and the Union , '' which is the plea of an earnest Scottish patriot for wider recognition of the importance of
Scotland	LOCATION	as a mem - ber of the British Empire .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 309 The recent parliamentary struggle for
Home Kale	ORGANIZATION	in
Ireland	LOCATION	, the change of ministry , and the present intensity of English interests in
Africa	LOCATION	and the
East	LOCATION	, has obscured the humble agitation in favor of Scot - tish Home Rule , an organized movement since
1886	DATE	, the aim of which is to secure a separate legislature and executive for
Scotland	LOCATION	, thus making a federal and not an incorporating union , which , it is argued , is more compatible with the interests of the British Empire .

		Let the author speak for himself ; the fact that the question has received such slight attention on this side of the water we hope will justify so full an extract as the following : '' There is no reason why the project should be re - garded as dangerous , or necessarily impracticable .

		Take the case of the two countries situated as
Scotland	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	are .

		Both are possessed of ripe experience in the arts of legislature and government .

		Both have a vast interest at stake in maintaining that mighty Em - pire on which the sun never sets .

		Both are endued with intense national sentiment , along with a common pride in the achievements of the great men of both nations , who have contributed to build up that wide nation of imperial
Britain	LOCATION	.

		Both are impressed with the convic - tion that the united Parliament is overburdened with the weight of imperial and national questions .

		The necessity of subdivision of legislative labors is forcing itself upon the attention of all parties .

		Tentative en - deavors have already been made , with good results , in this direction .

		There can be nothing revolutionary , in the bad sense of that word , in agreeing to devolve on two , or , if
Wales	LOCATION	be included in the distribution of re - sponsibility , say three national Parliaments , the work that is at present so unsatisfactorily performed by one unwieldy body in
London	LOCATION	. ''

		The success of the German Empire in combining national and local legislatures with an imperial diet is cited as an example to
England	LOCATION	, after which Mr.
MacKinnon	PERSON	concludes : '' A priori , then , the case for national legislatures in
Great Britain	LOCATION	is not incompatible with the larger pa - triotism which we cherish as citizens of the greatest em - pire that the world has ever witnessed ... Let us ask , what the men who advocate Scottish Home Rule have to say in its behalf ?

		They affirm that a national par - liament at
Edinburgh	LOCATION	could meet the demands of
Scot	PERSON	- tish legislation more efficiently than is done by the Brit - ish
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	... They complain that
Scot	PERSON	- tish legislation is jostled out of the running in the race for supremacy with English , Irish , and imperial meas - ures ... They object that Scotsmen are put to an enormous expense by the necessity of constant deputa - tions to
London	LOCATION	, by the cost of private bill legislation , and by appeals to the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	... This is not the sum of the Home Ruler 's contention .

		He complains that
Scotland	LOCATION	is overtaxed in comparison with ''
England	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	, and that
Scotland	LOCATION	receives an inadequate return out of the British exchequer . ''

		Here a plea is entered for government support of Scotch as well as of English universities , and '' finally , the argument based on nationality is a strong one . ''

		The author waxes indignant when he writes of En - glishmen , using the term ''
England	LOCATION	'' to indicate the
United Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	, or even the British Empire : '' This constant use of the term is entirely unconsti - tutional it is a transgression both of history and of the constitution , and shows that the conditions of the treaty of
Union	ORGANIZATION	are becoming , to Englishmen , in an important respect , a dead letter ... The legal , ecclesiastical , and educational institutions of both countries were preserved as a distinct natural inheritance to the respective peo - ples .

		To speak of the English army , the English navy , the English Parliament , or , in the sense in which it is frequently done , the English people , is both bad history and bad constitutional law '' -LRB- pp. 517-22 -RRB- .

		Professor
Vincent	PERSON	's '' The Age of Hildebrand '' is an endeavor to present in a popular , yet scholarly form , the significant features of the great mediaeval movement terminated by the pontificates of
Gregory VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		and
Boniface VIII.	ORGANIZATION	, and of which
Hildebrand	PERSON	was the actuating personality .

		The treatment is not confined , however , strictly to the conflict of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	and Papacy for world-sovereignty .

		There are chapters upon the intellectual condition of Eu - rope at the time , upon the rise of the universities , upon the monastic orders .

		The hook is weakest in the treatment of purely political history .

		The influ - ence that the identification of the papacy with the
Clugny Reform	ORGANIZATION	had in tending to make the papacy a universal institution ; the part that the
Norman State	ORGANIZATION	in
Italy	LOCATION	, that
Tuscany	LOCATION	, that the Pataria played in the great duel ; the causes inducing the French interference in
Italy	LOCATION	and the results thereof , are not treated as fully as desirable .

		At times the author visibly errs , e. g. in his consideration of
Gregory VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		's conduct at
Canossa	LOCATION	.

		The pope did not re - fuse to see
Henry IV	ORGANIZATION	.

		at once because he wished keenly to humiliate his arch-enemy ; the case had been referred to
Augsburg	LOCATION	, whither
Gregory	PERSON	was hastening , and he hesitated to adjudicate alone what had been reserved for the German synod .

		More - over , the Emperor did not stand '' with bare feet in the snow , fasting and shivering in the icy wind ... for three days , '' but merely for a few hours each day , warmly clad , too , beneath his penitent 's garb .

		The moral sentiment of
Europe	LOCATION	would have revolted against a pope so inhumane .

		As to penance ,
Otto I.	PERSON	,
Otto III.	PERSON	,
Henry II.	PERSON	,
Henry III.	PERSON	, and
St. Louis	LOCATION	had all been publicly flogged .

		The truth of this dra - matic episode at
Canossa	LOCATION	is that the emperor had beaten the pope at his own game and
Gregory	PERSON	was in a quandary he did not know what to do , so that
Henry	PERSON	was obliged to wait , meanwhile playing the penitent to prevail upon the pope .

		A valuable fea - ture of the book is an excellent bibliography .

		Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	's `` Westminster '' originally appeared as a series of papers in the '' Pall Mall Magazine . ''

		They are the sketches of a man to whom history is a pastime and literature a profes - sion .

		No attempt is made to enter into the history of Westminster in the large sense of that word , as typifying that of Parliament , nor does he enter , strange to say , into the more limited field of the his - tory of the
Abbey	ORGANIZATION	and its monuments , a subject which must have appealed strongly to him .

		Rather it has been the author 's purpose to restore to the mind 's eye the vanished palace of Westminster and 310 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	,
Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	, and to picture the life of
England	LOCATION	's grand abbey in its services , its rule , and its sanctuary .

		The pages betray the enthusiasm which every En - glishman displays for the traditions and institutions of his ancestors .

		A charm of the book is in the sym - pathy displayed for the subject , redolent with sug - gestions of the Middle Age , the light of cathedral aisle , the color of windows , roseate and pearl , `` twi - light saints and dim emblazonings . ''

		But Sir Wal - ter is a knight of the romancer 's quill ; he does not dip his pen in
Gibbon	PERSON	's ink-pot .

		When he tries to write sober-suited history , he has the naive quality of
Don Quixote	PERSON	.

		His favorite thesis , that the Isle of
Bramble	PERSON	was a thriving mart long before
London	LOCATION	existed , is the humble Spanish wayside inn trans - formed into a gorgeous palace .

		From the point of view of the bookmaker 's art , the volume is a delight to the eye ; it is admirable in binding , clear of print , and beautiful in illustration .

		To those who can boast '' claims of long descent '' other than of Huguenot or Knickerbocker or direct Germanic ancestry ,
Elizabeth Hodges	PERSON	's '' Some An - cient English Homes '' may appeal with interest .

		The pages are profusely sprinkled with allusions to Lord This and Lady That .

		To be sure no one of them ever had any influence upon the political history of
England	LOCATION	, and their social history can not be of the remotest interest save to the genealogist or the antiquary , yet what of that ?

		The book is not with - out interest , if it is without depth .

		Piquant descrip - tions of old English castle life , hunts , tennis tourna - ments , or stronger forms of rivalry , as the jousts , racy incidents and spicy anecdotes , enliven its pages .

		But `` the boast of heraldry , '' so often repeated , finally palls upon the American reader , who will be likely to plunge into '' Yellow Plush '' to restore him .

		Mr.
Inderwick	PERSON	's little book , '' The King 's Peace , '' is one of a series of works which aim to present the results of latest scholarship in a popular compass .

		It is clearly printed , neatly bound , well illustrated with old-time sketches and prints , and contains also some very nice and interesting incidents .

		But the first requisite for the scholarly presentation of his - tory is a scholar , and the author is no historian .

		He has no historical sense .

		He is a lawyer , and his - torians as such have next to no weight with him .

		He will gravely quote
Coke	ORGANIZATION	against
Stubbs	PERSON	, and Dug - dale or
Selden	PERSON	in preference to
Thorpe	PERSON	or Gneist .

		It is pitiable to think that any serious-minded stu - dent can entertain the remotest idea that the Com - mon Law may be of Druid origin , yet
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	is cited as authority for this supposition !

		Mr.
Inder	PERSON	- wick is grotesque without being respectably pedantic .

		In regard to English institutions prior to the Nor - man Conquest , the light that is in Mr.
Inderwick	PERSON	is darkness .

		As more modern times are approached the darkness is less intense , although the shadow of
Coke	ORGANIZATION	and
Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	obscures every page .

		If the author had been writing in jest , his book would have been brilliant ; as it is , it is neither law nor history .

		Fortunately the book can do little harm , for the veriest tyro in English institutions will detect errors on nearly every page .

		Professor
Edward P. Cheney	PERSON	has contrived to make the usually prosaic page of a study in economics sparkle with interest in his most entertaining '' So - cial Changes in
England	LOCATION	in the
Sixteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		One reason why he has been enabled so to do is the fact that he writes from the view-point of contem - porary literature , as well as from rent-rolls , tax lists , and parish registers .

		In writing of the Open Field System of agriculture , in which the field was divided into strips of an acre or half-acre in extent by '' balks '' of unplowed turf , he quotes Shakespeare 's '' Between the acres and the rye These pretty country folks would lie '' which is a picture of an English harvest field as accurate as it is attractive .

		Pamphlets , sermons , old letters , prose and poetry , have been copiously drawn upon in order to present the influence of the Renaissance and Reformation upon the masses of the people ; the decline of the old English baron - age ; the rise of the
Tudor Monarchy	ORGANIZATION	; the expan - sion of commerce , and the increase of the precious metals .

		The sixteenth century was a period of transi - tion in
England	LOCATION	; it was '' a period of the growing prosperity of the prosperous and the utter misery of the poor , '' and the homely phrases culled from con - temporary writings are here combined to make a study in economic history which is at once scholarly , attractive , and unique .

WESTFALL THOMPSON	ORGANIZATION	.

		BRIEFS ON NETV BOOKS .

		Helps for Commentaries upon
Tennyson	PERSON	are the student multiplying so rapidly that the num - of
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		ber bi -LRB- j g f aip to equal that Q f bookg devoted to the exposition of
Browning	PERSON	.

		Tennyson 's poetry , of course , is usually so lucid as to be self - explanatory , and does not call for the same sort of annotation that '' Sordello , '' for example , requires ; but the range of his observation was so wide , and his thought so subtle , that some sort of assistance is frequently welcome , and even needful .

		Two books , intended to help the student to an understanding of the greatest English poet of our age , are before us , and may be briefly characterized .

		Mr.
W. M. Dixon	PERSON	, the author of one of these books , calls his work '' A Tennyson Primer '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which is not the most happily chosen of titles .

		The literary '' primer , '' exemplified by such admirable books as Professor
Dowden	PERSON	's primer of Shake - speare and the primer of
Shelley	LOCATION	, published under the auspices of the
Shelley Society	ORGANIZATION	, is a well-defined form of manual , and is not primarily intended to be read .

		It aims to present in compact and well - arranged form the chief facts concerning the life and works of the writer in question , and is in no sense an essay or a biography .

		Now Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	's '' Primer '' is a very readable and suggestive little
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 311 book , but really amounts to a literary biography , with a critical essay appended , and does not per - form for Tennyson the special service that a primer should perform .

		A book properly answering to that name would not , for example , give us a long his - torical disquisition upon the Arthurian legend in English poetry , nor would it include bits of anec - dote and fragments of correspondence .

		We have no serious fault to find with Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	's work , ex - cept that it is like so many others in failing to do adequate justice to either '' Maud '' or the dramas .

		Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	quotes
George Eliot	PERSON	as saying , '' Ten - nyson 's plays run
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's close , '' and tells us that '' such criticism is pestilential . ''

		Well , we are inclined to spread the pestilence a little by saying that
George Eliot	PERSON	was not far from right .

		Perhaps the most valuable feature of this little book is its bib - liography , which occupies some forty pages , and is particularly rich in references to periodical literature .

		Unlike most Englishmen , Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	has recognized to the full the importance of American criticism , and his list includes many references to THE DIAL , `` The Atlantic Monthly , '' `` Poet-Lore , '' `` The Critic , '' and other American journals .

		Both in plan and in spirit Mr.
Morton Luce	PERSON	's '' Handbook to the Works of Alfred Lord Tennyson '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- better ful - fils the purpose of a '' primer '' than does the work previously under discussion , although the bulkiness of Mr.
Luce	PERSON	's volume deprives it of a claim to that modest title .

		It is the outgrowth and expansion of the author 's earlier '' New Studies in
Tennyson	LOCATION	, '' and presents us with a chronological commentary upon the poems .

		The work embodies a vast amount of research , tracing in much detail the sources of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's thought and form , explaining the diffi - culties , illustrating the poems by suggestive parallel passages from other writers , and illuminating the subject with a good deal of temperate and helpful criticism .

		It makes a book simply indispensable for the reader of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and ought to come into general use wherever the poems of the last great Laureate are studied with serious purpose .

		Teach - ers of English literature will find it a valuable ad - junct to their work , and will cordially welcome its appearance .

		Prof.
Raymond	PERSON	1 !

		Prof essor
Raymond	PERSON	, in the preface to latest volume '' Painting , Sculpture , and Architec - onJMhetics .

		ture ag Representative Arts '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- , expresses the view that some statements in THE DIAL 'S notice of one of his previous volumes were founded upon very superficial reading .

		If he is right -LRB- and it may be questionable what Professor
Raymond	PERSON	would call superficial -RRB- it seems to us to follow that the average reader , if he want to make anything at all out of the book , will be placed in a dilemma : either he will have to give a good deal of hard study to Professor
Raymond	PERSON	's work , or he will have to acknowledge at the start that his author is a sufficient and adequate guide in matters of aes - thetics .

		How fit Professor
Raymond	PERSON	is for this posi - tion will , we think , be obvious from a single exam - ple .

		If time permitted we would gladly give more , but we must confine ourselves to a minor point ; and with a view of indicating his method , we take his handling of the idea that the Gothic arch was suggested by branching trees in the forest .

		On page 32 , he remarks : '' But suppose that , taking a sug - gestion , as the early architects undoubtedly did , from the way in which limbs branch out from tree - trunks , the wood and stone which the pillars sup - port are also made to branch off from them as in arches . ''

		It will be observed that the imitation on the part of the early arch-builders is undoubted .

		In spite of this substantiation of a historic fact which on page 398 becomes a simple truth , Professor
Ray	PERSON	- mond on page 399 only goes so far as to write , '' It is an indisputable fact that an avenue of trees with bending branches inevitably suggests to anyone who has seen it .

		-LSB- Reference to
Beverley Minster	PERSON	and the Palms . -RSB-

		If it does so in our age to the ordinary observer why could it not have done so in the mid - dle ages to the first Gothic builder ? ''

		Why , indeed ?

		And since it did , '' is it not evident that when this has been done -LSB- / .

		e. , the arches made to
spring	DATE	from the pillars -RSB- something has been done which adds to the representation of the mere conception of sup - porting strength , a representation of the same effect as produced by appearances of nature '' -LRB- p. 32 -RRB- .

		It is not clear what effect is alluded to : if it be that of `` supporting strength , '' we should say that such is not the idea produced in us by a spreading tree ; if it be the effect really produced by a spreading tree , i. e. , airy lightness , which is also produced by good Gothic , we should say that airy lightness har - monized ill with supporting strength .

		Later we hear -LRB- p. 399 -RRB- that those who deny that the branch - ing of trees might have suggested Gothic arches , '' or ridicule , as they do , the statement that it might -LSB- of .

		above undoubted -RSB- , would have difficulty in mak - ing most men believe that they could recognize any conclusion whatever attainable as a result of only logic or insight . ''

		Such is Professor
Raymond	PERSON	's rigorous method .

		When such a thinker attempts a difficult subject , he may strike out some interesting ideas , but he rarely says the last word on the mat - ter .

		Professor
Raymond	PERSON	's books have a good deal that is suggestive here and there , and this one has a number of illustrations which serve to make his points clearer .

		Afield Aeon 's In his '' With an Ambulance during experiences in the the Franco-German War '' -LRB- imported Franco-German war.ty
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Dr.
Charles E. Ryan	PERSON	narrates his sufficiently stirring personal experiences and adventures as a field surgeon with both the con - tending armies in 1870-71 .

		To those who would undertake the just now specially useful exercise of mentally realizing the hideous and coarsely prosaic realities which constitute nine-tenths of that alleged national need and educative disguised blessing called War , we cordially commend Dr.
Ryan	PERSON	's book which , we hasten to add , is not weakened as a nar - rative by being written with any ulterior moral or 312 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, didactive purpose .

		Dr.
Ryan	PERSON	is simply a narrator .

		An evil is often best shown to be an evil by the plainest and least argumentative statement of facts .

		Thus , we take it , no more cogent plea against war , or more damning indictment of its reckless advo - cates and promoters could be made , than this terse , vivid , and unassuming recital of Dr.
Ryan	PERSON	's ; and were it within the bounds of human possibility to convert by moral means to humanity and right reason those '' statesmen '' whom a satiric destiny and a betrayed electorate have sent to
Washington	LOCATION	to guard the welfare and maintain the credit of this nation , and who have been discharging their man - date by doing their best to plunge us into war on this , that , or the other pettifogging pretext , we should earnestly commend Dr.
Ryan	PERSON	's book as a tract suit - able for distribution at the federal Capital ; but , un - fortunately , nothing short of a strait-waistcoat , or the absolute certainty of being sent to the front should his barbarous clamor bear fruit , is likely to bring a Jingo politician in full cry to his senses .

		At the outbreak of the Franco-German war Dr.
Ryan	PERSON	was a medical student at
Dublin	LOCATION	.

		A natural taste for adventure and a humane desire to be of service impelled him to set out for
Paris	LOCATION	, where he joined the Anglo-American Ambulance then organizing under the command of Dr.
Marion Sims	PERSON	.

		The corps was at once sent to Sedan ; and here Dr.
Ryan	PERSON	had his first taste of the horrors of war .

		One easily reads between the lines of the author 's account of Sedan , as of later engagements , the prime cause of the swiftness and thoroughness of the French de - feat .

		As in the China-Japan war , it was a loosely organized mob of soldiery against a compact per - fectly-ordered fighting machine whose every move was a part of a coherent scheme ; and the issue was never in doubt from the outset .

		Bismarck and
Moltke	PERSON	chose well the moment for striking the blow that was to consolidate the new German Empire and secure the primacy therein to
Prussia	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Ryan	PERSON	's narrative is by no means , what we may per - haps have incautiously led the reader to infer it to be , a mere surgeon 's catalogue of horrors and cas - ualties .

		It is long since we have seen a more en - tertaining book of the kind .

		aiong the
coast of Southern France	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` The Riviera : Ancient and Mod - ern '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , by
M. Charles Len	PERSON	- fa ^ a French engineer , will be welcomed by readers who propose to spend some part of the
summer	DATE	in southern
France	LOCATION	along the strip of coast extending from
Marseilles	LOCATION	eastwards toward
Genoa	LOCATION	.

		Though a scientific man with a keen eye for the fauna , the flora , the geologic formation and the climatic conditions of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	coast ,
M. Lenthe	PERSON	`` ric is a writer who shows marked power in description and unusual literary judgment .

		His method of treating the subject is peculiarly characteristic and gives an air of leisure to the vol - ume which is refreshing .

		As the author remarks too truly : ' A sea-voyage nowadays is a question only of time , seasickness , and money . ''

		Accord - ingly he asks the reader to accompany him slowly along the coast , preferring to travel in a small fishing-boat and thus to go from port to port past the sites of ancient Taurcentum ,
Toulon	LOCATION	,
St. Tropes	LOCATION	,
St. Raphael	LOCATION	,
La Napoule	ORGANIZATION	,
Cannes	LOCATION	,
Antibes	LOCATION	-LRB- the an - cient Antipolis -RRB- , Nice , and
Monaco	LOCATION	; or to linger among the islands of
Hyeres	LOCATION	and the Le * rins , fol - lowing the course of Greek and Phoenician sailors of earlier times .

		But
M. Lenthe	PERSON	`` ric 's plan allowed him to stop a while at most of the places to which we have referred , so that he has described the scen - ery of
Maritime Provence	LOCATION	, notably the gorges of the Este * rel , the surroundings of Fre * jus , and the lower valley of the Var .

		He has little to say of the Prom - enade of Nice or regarding the '' rooms '' of
Monte Carlo	ORGANIZATION	such topics are matters of guide-book inform - ation .

		His interest is to some extent historic .

		Hence he speaks frequently of the Grecian colonies of an - tiquity within this region , and he traces out the work of Romans and
Saracens	LOCATION	, so far as these peo - ples left permanent influences upon their successors .

		The comments upon the present-day inhabitants and their industrial and social interests are cogent and often entertaining .

		Hardly once does the reader notice a trace of weariness on the part of the author , or any sign of the struggle which occasionally M. Lenthe ` ric must have experienced while sifting the literary details for his brilliant sketching .

		The vol - ume is provided with plates and maps which make the journeyings clear .

Miss Madame Roland	LOCATION	.

		Ida M
Tarbell	ORGANIZATION	gives us a full , faith - ful , and literal account of the much canvassed and usually misjudged career of the
Girondin Egeria	ORGANIZATION	.

		As the representative of a faction and the type of a leading social , political , and intellectual revolution - ary class ,
Madame Roland	ORGANIZATION	has been alternately lauded and abused .

		To one school of opinion she is the saint and martyr : to the other the little bour - geoise , whose diseased vanity fancied a rival in the Queen of
France	LOCATION	herself ; the soured plebeian whose revolutionary zeal was born of hatred for those at the top , rather than love for those at the bottom of the social scale .

		As usual , the truth lies somewhere between the extremes .

		Let us say that
Madame Roland	ORGANIZATION	was a high and puissant soul , whose loyalty to her ideal could harden nevertheless at times into a certain unwise and ignoble implacability ; a gen - erous dreamer touched with the pedantry of her time ; a Frenchwoman , with a large share of the national love of histrionic 6clat , and of the distinc - tion of a leading role ; a raw and incapable politi - cian for , admitting that she swayed the counsels of the Girondins , there surely was never a political party worse led than hers .

		Her crowning political mistake was her repeated rejection of
Danton the Mirabeau	PERSON	of the populace , and with all his faults , the real Colossus of the Revolution , the man who ,
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 313 allied with the Girondins and with
Dumouriez	PERSON	, might hare saved
France	LOCATION	from anarchy .

		Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	's book is not a mere revamping of facts in the life of
Madame Roland	ORGANIZATION	which are already known ; nor does it represent what may be termed the poetical method applied to biography .

		Her recital is terse , clear , and literal ; and her recent close researches among original documents , as well as her intimate acquaintance with descendants of
Madame Roland	ORGANIZATION	now living in
Paris	LOCATION	, have enabled her to present some new facts that throw additional light upon the career and character of her heroine .

		Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	has done her work patiently and conscientiously ; and she has resisted the common temptation to make
Madame Roland	ORGANIZATION	the motife of a rhapsody , rather than the subject of a biography .

		There are a num - ber of illustrations , mainly portraits .

		Professor
Sayce	PERSON	's '' The
Egypt	LOCATION	of the Hebrews '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , `` isintended to supplement the books -LRB- on
Egypt	LOCATION	-RRB- already in the hands of tourists and students , and to put before them just that information which either is not readily accessible or else forms part of larger and cumbrous works '' -LRB- Preface -RRB- .

		The first four of the eight chapters of the book discuss '' the pa - triarchal age , '' '' the age of Moses , '' '' the exodus and the Hebrew settlement in
Canaan	LOCATION	, '' and '' the age of the Israelitish monarchies . ''

		The positions taken are substantially those found in the author 's earlier works .

		Abraham 's sojourn in
Egypt	LOCATION	-LRB- p. 20 -RRB- , Ebed-tob 's letter to
Egypt	LOCATION	and his identification with Melchizedek -LRB- p. 71 -RRB- , the Pharaoh of the Exodus -LRB- p. 90 ff -RRB- , are some of the points on which he agrees with his former utterances .

		These first four chap - ters add little or nothing to our stock of knowledge .

		But chapters V. -
VIII	PERSON	.

		are vigorous presentations of `` the age of the Ptolemies , '' `` Herodotos in
Egypt	LOCATION	, '' '' in the steps of Herodotos , '' and '' Mem - phis and the
Fayyum	LOCATION	. ''

		They gather into brief compass the most salient points under each topic .

		Pioneer-work is always necessarily venturesome , and Professor Sayce even oversteps the bounds of law in this regard .

		He never fails to interest his reader , unless it is by recapitulating matter already in book form .

		Some valuable appendices on dynasties , on chronology and writers , fittingly close the volume .

		While perpetuating some of the author 's proverbial guesses , this book may do a great good in clarify - ing the historical air of
Egypt	LOCATION	, and in righting our conceptions of
Israel	LOCATION	's relations to
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		Those who have read Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	's The makers of , , - .

		T - , , .

		, , .

		.

		.

		- , Modern
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Makers of
Florence	LOCATION	and ''
Mak	PERSON	- ers of
Venice	LOCATION	'' know essentially what to expect in '' The Makers of Modern Rome '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , though the apologetic Preface forewarns the reader not to expect the author 's best work .

		Here is brought together a quantity of interesting material from epochs of modern Roman history the close of the fourth century , of the sixth , of the eleventh , of the twelfth , the middle of the four - teenth , and from the middle of the fifteenth through the
first quarter	DATE	of the sixteenth material much of which is not easily accessible in a village library .

		Any secondary work of history , such as this , ought to give at least a brief list of its sources , as , in the first section ,
Thierry	PERSON	's '' Life of St.
Jerome	PERSON	. ''

		In - deed , the material of the volume is limited too ex - clusively to such works as those of Muratori ,
Migne	LOCATION	, and the Bollandists .

		The share of
Melania	LOCATION	and Paula in making modern
Rome	LOCATION	does not appear to be great in comparison with that of Theoderick ,
Michael Angelo	PERSON	, or
Victor Emmanuel	PERSON	.

		The con - tents of the volume on the whole would better de - serve the title '' The Makers of the Papacy . ''

		Here are a few examples of a careless style to be found in the book : '' Withdrawn into a villa had she ? ''

		-LRB- p. 19 -RRB- ; '' the breach of all the decorums of life '' -LRB- p. 29 -RRB- ; '' What more dreadful influence could be than one which made a woman forsake her child , the infant whom she had carried in her arms to the great funeral , in the sight of all
Rome	LOCATION	, the son of her sorrow ? ''

		-LRB- p. 32 -RRB- ; '' When every one else had tried their best '' -LRB- p. 67 -RRB- ; `` And all the fault of the Pope , as who could wonder if the sufferers cried ? ''

		On p. 109 occurs a slip of mere careless - ness , '' the terrible
Alaric	PERSON	, a scourge of God like his predecessor Attila , '' which the publishers can correct in a new edition by substituting '' successor '' for '' predecessor . ''

		Yet the book brings to the av - erage reader much interesting matter that is new , and with its good print and numerous illustrations deserves , and will probably find , many readers .

		A dainty little volume that should A cheery volume find f u The Bicyclers , and of wholesome fun . '

		Ihree Other Farces -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , by that clever writer , Mr.
John Kendrick Bangs	PERSON	.

		None of our other up-to-date humorists , we think , provoke quite so many laughs to the page as Mr.
Bangs	PERSON	does and his fun is always cheery , wholesome , and decent withal .

		The `` three other farces '' in the book are : '' A Dramatic Evening , '' '' The Fatal Message , '' and `` A Proposal under Difficulties . ''

		The four pieces are distinct from each other in plot and action ; but the same characters appear in each .

		In '' The Bicyclers , '' '' Mr.
Perkins	PERSON	'' takes his first lesson in '' biking , '' while his friends watch him from the window .

		One of these , ''
Bradley	PERSON	, '' becomes anxious over the non-arrival of his wife , who is com - ing down town a-wheel , and who presently an - nounces by telephone that she has been arrested for riding without a light .

		She is finally bailed out , and the company retires to supper . ''

		A Dramatic Evening '' shows the tribulations of the good-natured ''
Perkins	PERSON	, '' who has rashly agreed to have private theatricals in his house , which is thereupon pulled to pieces in the usual harrowing way . ''

		The Fatal Message '' shows the final rehearsal of the play , the fun turning on the general '' bulldozing '' of the hos - pitable ''
Perkins	PERSON	'' by his guests , and the final dis - covery that ''
Bradley	PERSON	, '' misreading a telegram sent him , has learned the wrong part .

		`` A Proposal under 314 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, Difficulties '' represents '' Yardsley '' and ''
Barlow	PERSON	'' calling upon '' Miss Andrews , '' both with the inten - tion of proposing to her .

		In the main scene '' Yards - ley , '' soltis , rehearses his impending proposal and is ^ rapturously accepted by the house-maid who hap - pens to enter at the critical moment .

		The '' situa - tions '' are ingenious , the dialogue is clever , and the fun throughout waxes fast and furious up to the denouement .

		The last farce , especially , strikes us as a capital one for private theatricals .

		The piquant drawings call for special mention .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The following German texts have recently been pub - lished : Storm 's '' Immensee , '' edited by Mr.
H. S. Beres	PERSON	- ford-Webb -LRB-

Emil Du Bois Raymond	PERSON	, edited by Dr.
James Howard Gore	PERSON	-LRB- Ginn -RRB- .

		We have also received a '' First German Book , '' by Mr.
M. J. Martin	PERSON	-LRB- Werner -RRB- , pre - pared upon the inductive plan .

		Of recent French texts we note the following : '' Pgcheur d'Islande , '' by ''
Pierre Loti	PERSON	, '' with notes by
M. C. Fontaine	PERSON	-LRB-
Jenkins	PERSON	-RRB- ;
Augier	PERSON	's '' Le Gendre de

Louise S. Hotchkiss	PERSON	-LRB- Heath -RRB- ; and a '' Key to Short Selections for Translating English into French , '' by
M. Paul Bercy	PERSON	-LRB-
Jenkins	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The series of '' English Classics '' published by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of which we have heretofore had occasion to speak in terms of high praise , is rap - idly growing .

		Four volumes have just been added to the list , and are upon the general level of excellence attained by their predecessors .

		They are
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's '' The Rime of the Ancient Mariner , '' edited by Mr.
Herbert Bates	PERSON	; `` As You Like It , '' edited by Messrs.
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	and
W. L. Phelps	PERSON	; `` A Midsummer Night 's Dream , '' edited by Mr.
George P. Baker	PERSON	; and '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' edited by Mr.
Francis B. Gnmmere	PERSON	.

		We can not recommend anonymous editions of En - glish classics , such as the texts recently published by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	, including `` Macbeth , '' two books of '' Paradise Lost , '' and DeQuincey 's '' Revolt of the Tartars . ''

		Anonymity in such cases usually means cheap labor and scamped workmanship .

		A word of praise may be given , however , to this firm of pub - lishers for their '' Eclectic School Readings , '' of which two volumes , both by Dr.
Edward Eggleston	PERSON	, are at hand .

		These books are entitled '' Stories of Great Amer - icans for Little Americans , '' and '' Stories of American Life and Adventure . ''

		They are simply written and attractively illustrated .

		Book lovers will take delight in a charming little vol - ume entitled '' Reminiscences of Literary
London	LOCATION	from
1779	DATE	to
1853	DATE	'' by Dr.
Thomas Rees	PERSON	, with additions by Mr.
John Britton	PERSON	.

		The book was first privately issued about
1853	DATE	, and is now reprinted and published in a very attractive form by Mr.
Francis P. Harper	PERSON	-LRB-
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		It contains much curious matter respecting books their authors , publishers , and sellers written in a familiar style , and is , on the whole , very enjoyable reading . ''

		A Metrical History of the Life and Times of Na - poleon Bonaparte '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , edited by Mr.
William J. Hillis	PERSON	, is further described as '' a collection of poems and songs , many from obscure and anonymous sources , selected and arranged with introductory notes and con - necting narratives . ''

		Mr.
Hillis	PERSON	has been collecting these poems for many years , and found that he had at last '' a poem for nearly every incident of note in the life and history of
Napoleon	PERSON	, from his birth to his second fune - ral . ''

		The poems , together with the prose connective tissue supplied by the editor , and the twenty-five pho - togravure illustrations , make up a handsome octavo of more than five hundred pages .

		The average excellence of the work is not as mean as might hastily be imag - ined , for the names of Byron ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Southey	LOCATION	,
Koerner	PERSON	,
Praed	PERSON	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,

Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	send us new editions , cloth bound , of three of their works : '' The Psychology of Attention , '' by

		Mr.
Henry Cuyler Bunner	PERSON	, who died on the eleventh of this month , at the age of forty , will be as sincerely mourned as any writer of his generation .

		Most people think of him , from his editorial connection with ''
Puck	PERSON	, '' as a humorist , but he was much more than this .

		His novels , short stories , and poems possessed a high order of merit , a delicacy and a distinction that are rather French than English .

		Although much of his activity was given to journalism , he was not spoiled by it , as so many good writers are , but remained true to literary ideals of the higher sort throughout his brief but productive career .

		An edition of Mr.
Stanley Waterloo	PERSON	's novels , `` A Man and a Woman , '' and '' An Odd Situation , '' has just been published in
London	LOCATION	, and for the latter work Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	has prepared an interesting preface , from which we quote the opening paragraph : `` The appearance of a new literary and publishing centre is an event of great interest , if only on account of its rarity .

		Hitherto it has seemed as if the tendency among the English-speaking nations was to concentrate , rather than to increase , the literary centres .


London	LOCATION	has swallowed up
Edinburgh	LOCATION	and the provincial centres ;
Dublin	LOCATION	is a silent sister ; Mel - bourne and
Sydney	LOCATION	produce very little ;
Canada	LOCATION	can not hold out against
New York	LOCATION	, which is absorbing
Boston	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		During the last five or six years , however , there has sprung up in the city of
Chicago	LOCATION	a new literary centre and a new centre of publishing .

		There exists in this city of a million -LSB- sic -RSB- inhabitants , which sixty years ago was but a kind of barbican , or ad - vanced post against the Red Indian , a company of nov - elists , poets , and essayists , who are united , if not by asso - ciations and clubs , at least by an earnest resolution to cultivate letters .

		It may be objected that this is nothing but a provincial coterie , such as we in this country have seen at
Lichfield	LOCATION	,
Norwich	LOCATION	, and other places , and that , like all such societies , it will presently disappear .

		I do not think that this will be the fate of the
Chicago	LOCATION	move - ment , for several reasons .

		First , the city is so huge that there must be continually born in it , or brought into it from the country , persons with the literary gift ; next , there exists in the
Northwest States	LOCATION	an unbounded admiration for the literary calling a feeling which ought by itself to raise up aspirants ; thirdly , they have at
Chicago	LOCATION	a
University	ORGANIZATION	, with Professors of Literature and Libraries ; they also have , for the higher culture , colleges and academies of music , theatres and opera houses , galleries of paintings , schools of art , and lec - tures of all kinds ; they have a journal of literary crit - icism , sober , conscientious , and scholarly , from every point of view unsurpassed by any other literary journal in
America	LOCATION	or
England	LOCATION	.

		Besides all these aids , they have daily papers by the dozen , which afford the aspir - ant the means of a livelihood while he is working at his real profession .

		Not without importance , moreover , are those literary circles which are found in every little township of the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	, by means of which at least the young people are taught from childhood the dignity , and the might , and the glory of literature .

		Given , therefore , a people who are always ready to pour out their love and respect upon every writer who can touch their hearts ; given these country circles of cul - ture ; given a great city in which all the problems of hu - man life can be studied ; given , again , a company of men and women resolved to give all that is best in them to the pursuit of letters ; it would be strange , indeed , if there did not come out of all of this a growth of litera - ture worthy of joining the literature of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	, and Pope ; Fielding and
Thackeray	PERSON	;
Lowell	PERSON	and
Longfellow	LOCATION	;
Emerson	PERSON	and Motley . ''

		THE STEARNS BICYCLE IS The Epitome of Comfort , And a perpetual delight to its owner .

		The STEARNS is one of those few wheels which improve upon acquaintance .

		The more thorough the trial which is given it , the better it is liked .

$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The discussion by this now famous author of such topics in practical religion as `` Temptation , '' `` Individuality , '' `` Science of Life , '' '' Loss of Goods , '' and '' Broken Homes , '' is characterized by the same keen insight and sympathetic touch which have so potently appealed to those who have read his other books . ''

		It is impossible to analyze a spiritual effect , because it is largely an atmosphere , but the secret of the sweetness of this work is , we think , that it springs from the heart , and not -LRB- as is the case with so much of the ' religious ' literature of the day -RRB- from the intellect . ''

		342 THE DUTIES OF AUTHORS .

		That every right implies a correlated duty , and that the assertion of the one should be con - ditioned upon the acceptance of the other , is a principle in which theoretical is more common flian practical acquiescence .

		The burden of
Mazzini	PERSON	's criticism of the French Revolution tiras that it gave undue prominence to the Rights of Man , and had little to say about the corre - sponding Duties of Man .

		It was the funda - mental aim of that patient heroic soul to mor - alize the European revolutionary movement by insisting upon the claim of duty as a necessary accompaniment of the claim of right .

		Transferring the discussion from the political to the literary plane , we are inclined to think that too much has lately been heard about the rights of authors in comparison with what is said akmt their duties .

		It is then with peculiar satisfaction that we call attention to the chapter on '' The Duties of Authors '' included in Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's recently-published collection of addresses to ethical societies .

		While Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	and his associates in the Society of Authors are engaged in the praiseworthy work of exposing the wily ways of the dishonest publisher , it is well that a strong voice should now and then discourse upon the responsibili - ties of authorship , and sound a note of warning against the temptations which beset the man of letters under the modern commercial literary regime .

		The ethics of literature is a large sub - ject with many ramifications , and neither Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	nor any other man could hope to treat of it exhaustively within the limits of a single essay ; but the address to which reference is now made touches upon the more salient fea - tures of the subject , and is characterized in unusual measure by good sense , sound logic , and fine ethical tone .

		So large a proportion of literary energy now - adays is absorbed by journalism that no discus - sion of the duties of authors can ignore the work of those who write for the newspaper press .

		It is in journalism , also , that writers are most strongly assailed by the temptations peculiar to their craft .

		The question of anony - mity , for example , is one that must be consid - ered in its ethical relations , and it takes the 326 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, keenest self-searching for a man to be sure that under the impersonal shelter of the plural pro- noun he is not saying things to which he would blush to attach his signature .

		Nothing is more contemptible than the work of the writer who makes himself a hireling of some party organ , and earns his daily bread by the advocacy of doctrines to which he does not personally sub - scribe ; doctrines that are abhorrent to him as an individual .

		Such a prostitution of literary talent maybe defended , is defended , in many ingenious ways , but the cobwebs of sophistry woven about the discussion by defenders of this practice are easily swept away by anyone who is determined to see things as they are and regulate his con - duct in accordance with the fundamental prin - ciples of morality .

		The stock argument by which lawyers justify their defence of the crim - inal of whose guilt they are convinced the plea that such a person is entitled to the most favorable interpretation of which the law ad - mits , and that someone must secure it for him is not valid in the discussion of questions of public interest .

		No matter of governmental policy is entitled to any other defence than may be made for it by those who honestly believe in its advisability ; for those who disbelieve in it , yet enlist their powers in its behalf , no con - demnation can be too strong .

		The first duty of the citizen is to further what he honestly believes to be the real interests of the state , and , if his activity take the special form of argument through the medium of the press , to be sure that his public utterances tally with his private opinions .

		To repudiate this obligation is to act the part of traitor , and in a more dangerous , because a more insidious , way than that of the leader of an armed revolt . ''

		To thine own self be true '' is a precept that journalists , more than most other people , need to keep in mind .

		Anonymity doubtless serves as a shelter for much of the baseness that we are reprobating ; yet historically , Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	tells us , it is rather the effect than the cause .

		`` According to a well-known anecdote , two writers of the eighteenth century decided by the toss of a half - penny which should write for
Walpole	LOCATION	and which should write for his adversary Pulteney ; but the choice was generally decided by less reputable motives .

		Now , so long as the press meant such a class it was of course natural that the trade should be regarded as discredit - able , and should be carried on by men who had less care for their character than for their pockets .

		In
England	LOCATION	, where our development has been continuous and tradi - tions linger long , the sentiment long survived ; and the practice which corresponded to it the practice , that is , of anonymity has itself survived the sentiment which gave it birth . ''

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	then goes on to say : `` The mask was formerly worn by men who were ashamed of their employment , and who had the same reasons for anonymity as a thief or an anarchist may have for a disguise .

		It may now be worn even by men who are proud of their profession , because the mask has a different significance . ''

		This latter statement is to a considerable extent true , but we are far from sure that the senti - ment is dead that gave birth to anonymity , or that great numbers of journalists to-day do not write what they are told to write , and paid for writing , irrespective of their own convictions .

		Anonymity has other dangers than the major one of making men false to themselves .

		It affords , for example , '' obvious conveniences to a superficial omniscience . ''

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	re - marks with genial humor : `` The young gentleman who dogmatizes so early might blush if he had to sign his name to his audacious utterances .

		His tone of infallibility would be absurd if we knew who was the pope that was promulgating dogmas .

		The man in a mask professes to detect at a glance the absurd sophistries which impose upon the keenest contempory intellects ; but if he doffed the mask and appeared as young Mr.
Smith	PERSON	, or
Jones	PERSON	, who took his degree last year , we might doubt whether he had a right to assume so calmly that the sophistry is all on the other side . ''

		The one safe rule seems to be that the anony - mous writer `` should say nothing when he speaks in the plural which would make him look silly if he used the first person singular . ''

		The man who should follow this rule , and who should refrain from allowing any personal feel - ing to invade his judgments of other men and their works , might safely be trusted to write unsigned articles by the score , and , if he re - mained all the while true to his convictions , could not fairly be charged with falling short of the whole duty of authorship .

		Another temptation that besets the author is that of being content to follow current opin - ion , instead of doing his best to aid in its forma - tion . ''

		There is an old story , '' says Mr.
Ste	PERSON	- phen , '' which tells how a certain newspaper used to send out an emissary to discover what was the common remark that everyone was making in omnibuses and club smoking-rooms , and to fashion it into next morning 's article for the instruction of mankind .

		The echo affected to set the tune which it really repeated . ''

		One of the most obvious duties of authorship is that of having something of your own to say , and of preparing yourself by strenuous effort to say it in the most direct and forcible man - ner .

		There is a great deal more of '' facile writing '' than there was half a century ago ,
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 327 but it is doubtful if there is any more writing of the first-rate sort , '' which speaks of a full mind and strong convictions , which is clear be - cause it is thorough . ''

		This phase of the ques - tion of duty as it relates to authors could not be better put than in the following passage : '' I have been struck in reading newepaper articles , even my own , by the curious loss of individuality which a man seems to suffer as a writer .

		Unconsciously the author takes the color of his organ ; he adopts not only its sentiment but its style , and seems to become a mere transmitter of messages , with whose substance he has no more to do than the wires of the electric telegraph which carries them .

		But now and then we suddenly come across something fresh and original ; we know by instinct that we are being addressed by another man , and are in a living relation to a separate human being , not to a mere drilled characterless unit of a disciplined army ; we find actually thoughts , convictions , arguments , which , though all arguments are old , have evidently struck the writer 's mind , and not merely been trans - mitted into his pen ; and then we may know that we are in the presence of a real force , and meeting with a man who is doing his duty . ''

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	's exposition of his theme is so attractive that we are loth to dismiss with a few words , as must , however , be done , the re - maining features of the discussion .

		There is the fruitful subject of writing for money , upon which we read : '' I do not doubt that authors ought to be paid ; but I certainly agree that a money reward ought never to be the chief aim of their writing .

		And I confess that some utterances about copyrights in these days have jarred upon me , because they seem to imply that the doctrine is not disavowed so unequivocally as it should be by our leaders . ''

		Then there is the subject of writing too much to write anything well , concerning which the author discourses feelingly , and of which mel - ancholy examples are about us on every hand .

		Then there is the suggestive disquisition upon literary preaching , which deserves an article by itself .

		Finally , there is the deeply interesting discussion of duty as it applies to the imagina - tive worker , the duty of eschewing false real - ism and false sentimentalism alike , of avoiding like the plague the promptings of the familiar spirit that confuses notoriety with fame , and , pointing out how easily the one may be secured , deludes the writer into thinking that it is much the same thing as the other .

		All these matters must be passed over with a word , and space found only for the conclusion that '' the endur - ing power of every great writer depends not merely on his intellectual forces , but upon the charm of his character the clear recognition of what it really is that makes life beautiful and desirable , and of what are the baser ele - ments that fight against the elevating forces . ''

		COMMUNICA TION .

		THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN
JAPAN	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		\ I have already referred in your columns to the re - newed popularity of the English language in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The principal reason for this increased interest is well set forth in the following opening paragraph of an English article by
Naibu Kanda	ORGANIZATION	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, on '' English in
Middle Schools	LOCATION	, '' in a recent number of `` The Sun '' : '' The successful termination of the war has given an impe - tus to industrial and commercial enterprises to an extent hitherto unprecedented in the annals of this country .

		It ia not too much to expect that in the next ten years the material progress of
Japan	LOCATION	will completely throw into the shade her no inconsiderable achievements in the past thirty years .

		She has come forth victorious from the storms of the battle-field , only to be plunged into a mightier conflict the struggle for su - premacy in the field of commerce .

		Not the least of her wea - pons in this species of warfare is the knowledge of European languages , especially English , the intellectual currency of the commercial world . ''

		This article a plea for more careful , thorough , and practical instruction in English is itself an indication of the present tendency .

		It is true that for some time '' The Sun '' has contained several pages of English notes , edited and principally written by Mr.
Kanda	PERSON	a graduate of
Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	, in the class of
1880	DATE	; but it is now found possible to change these notes to more elaborate articles , written by leading English scholars among the Japanese .

		The two previous issues of '' The Sun , '' for instance , contained a well-written article on some sociological problems of the day in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		`` The Educator , '' the organ of
The Christian Education Society	ORGANIZATION	, contains every month about four pages of English notes ; and frequently the daily papers print a few columns of English matter .

		But most significant of all is the fact that an English magazine has just been started by the Japanese .

		It is to be published monthly , and is called '' The Far East . ''

		It is practically an English edition of the Kokumin no Tamo -LRB- '' The Nation 's Friend '' -RRB- , a brilliant and success - ful vernacular magazine ; but while some of the matter will appear in both periodicals , many articles will be written originally for '' The Far East . ''

		Whether the articles are all first hand or only translations , they will together serve to make the new magazine '' a mirror of Japanese public thought , '' and will unquestionably bring the East and the West into closer sympathy with each other .

		Being subjected to foreign revision before publication , the magazine is remarkably free from the errors that mar so much of the independent writing of English by Japanese .

		It is certainly to be hoped that '' The Far East '' will live long and prosper .

		That it desires and deserves a wide circulation in foreign coun - tries is evident from the fact that the annual subscrip - tion -LRB- including postage -RRB- is only
1.50 yen	MONEY	, or , at the pres - ent rate of exchange , only a little over
80 cents	MONEY	.

		And , even if the Japanese silver yen , now quoted at
53 cents	MONEY	should rise to
67 cents	MONEY	, the magazine would then cost only
$ 1.00	MONEY	per year in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Pardon me if I take the space to mention one more indication of the renewed interest in the study of En - glish and other European languages , as shown in the fact that there will probably be established in
Tokyo	LOCATION	, under government auspices , a special '' School of Foreign Languages . ''

		328 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, Boofts * MR. IiOCKER 'S `` CONFIDENCES . ''

		* That Mr.
Frederick Locker-Lampson	PERSON	's pleas - ant '' Confidences '' can not be accorded a place beside the kindred volumes of
Rousseau	PERSON	and others who have freely unbosomed themselves to the world is largely due to the fact that the author has nothing of a comfortably shocking or scandalous nature to confess .

		Grace , wit , variety , the amiable
London	LOCATION	lyrist naturally has in abundance ; but the only approach to a breach of good morals that we find him own - ing to is that he once sneaked away from a '' Charity Breakfast '' without '' paying the shot . ''

		It came about in this wise .

		In an un - guarded moment Mr.
Locker	PERSON	accepted an invi - tation to that meal from the `` Patagonian Church Extension Society '' ; hour , half-past eight ; chairman , the philanthropic Sir
Bonamy Veroles	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Locker	PERSON	arrived on time -LRB- and uncommonly hungry -RRB- , helped himself liber - ally to the tongue and toast -LRB- thus committing himself to the breakfast -RRB- , and was just begin - ning to feel chatty and comfortable , when , he says , up stepped '' a busybody of a fellow in a white tie , who , with ostentatious assurance , slapped down a blank cheque , a lead pencil , and the eulogy of the charity at my plate , look - ing significantly at me and my substantial slice of tongue as he did so . ''

		It at once dawned on Mr.
Locker	PERSON	that he was trapped .

		It was a clear breach of hospitality ; and one can easily pardon Mr.
Locker	PERSON	for momentarily wishing the
Patagonian Church	ORGANIZATION	, its extenders , and Sir
Bonamy Veroles	PERSON	, at the tropics .

		His first impulse was to fly .

		But how ?

		Here a bright thought struck him .

		Clapping one hand osten - tatiously to his waistcoat , and feigning a look of subdued but intense agony , he rose painfully from his chair , slipped past the astonished waiters , weathered the coldly inquiring stare of the plainly incredulous Sir
Bonamy	PERSON	, gained the hallway , jumped into a cab and drove home .

		So much affected was Mr.
Locker	PERSON	by the dra - matic force of his impersonation , that , he tells us , '' I kept my hand where I had placed it till I reached my own door . ''

		Mr.
Locker	PERSON	's '' Confidences '' were prepared for publication , he says , largely in the interests of accuracy and for the benefit of his own de - * MT CONFIDENCES : An Autobiographical Sketch ad - dressed to my Descendants .

		By
Frederick Locker-Larupson	PERSON	.

		scendants to the tender mercies of whose un - certain memories he was unwilling to trust his treasured cargo of family records and ancestral anecdotes . ''

		In this little matter , '' he adds , '' I can not trust them : they would make havoc of my hobby .

		I hardly know which is the more trying to me their languid endurance of a family story , or their inaccurate repetition of it . ''

		The volume was written at different pe - riods during the last fifteen years of Mr.
Locker	PERSON	's life , and was in type at the date of his death ,
May 30 , 1895	DATE	.

		It contains , besides the pleasantly diversified story of his life and adventures , and the family portraits and anec - dotes , several '' biographical sketches , '' or , rather , portraits from memory , of noted literary people
Thackeray	PERSON	,
George Eliot	PERSON	and Mr.
Lewes	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	,
Dean Stanley	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, etc. .

		Mr.
Locker	PERSON	was born in
1821	DATE	, at
Greenwich Hospital	ORGANIZATION	, of which his father , a somewhat Shandean character , was Civil Commissioner .

		Around this institution most of his early mem - ories cluster , his affectionate description of it recalling Lamb 's paper on the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	.

		His mother was the daughter of the Rev.
Jonathan Boucher	PERSON	, an excellent divine and philologist , who spent part of his early manhood in Amer - ica , and was a close friend of
Washington	LOCATION	.

		When the revolutionary troubles began , how - ever , Dr.
Boucher	PERSON	preached boldly against the cause of the colonists , running no small risk of personal violence in doing so , and was at length compelled to return to
England	LOCATION	.

		His last ser - mon , preached at
Annapolis	LOCATION	, with pistols on his pulpit cushion , concluded as follows : `` As long as I live , yea , while I have my being , will I proclaim , ' God save the King ! '

		The author notes that he lent
Thackeray	PERSON	several of Wash - ington 's letters to his grandfather , while the novelist was writing ''
Henry Esmond	PERSON	. ''

		Mrs.
Locker	PERSON	, the author 's mother , was a pious wo - man of Evangelical leanings emphatically '' a church-going animal , '' as her son somewhat rue - fully recalls .

		In her more scrupulous moments she seems to have held the opinion -LRB- though in general a cheerful soul -RRB- that cards and dancing were hardly compatible with salvation .

		Her Sabbatarian views entailed the usual penalties on her children .

		Says Mr.
Locker	PERSON	: '' I well remember the sultry
Sunday	DATE	evenings when my mother would carry me off to an ugly little pepper - boxed temple , with its tin-kettle bell , where we sim - mered through Mr.
Shepherd	PERSON	's long-winded pastorals .

		The mean , cramped , white-painted pew ; the faint and unpleasant odor of Mr.
Shepherd	PERSON	's large flock -LRB- how he collected it was a mystery -RRB- , made the worthy man 's

		THE DIAL 329 weariful discourses doctrine , reproof , instruction , and dubious grammar still more irksome .

		I was very do - cile , and I remained so .

		I am told that the devout Papuans perform their religious rites standing on one leg .

		If ever my lot should be cast among these simple people , I should be glad to oblige them . ''

		Widely different from the dissenting Mr.
Shepherd	PERSON	was the official Hospital chaplain , Dr.
Coke	ORGANIZATION	,
R.M.	LOCATION	, a stanch Churchman of the orthodox shovel-hatted , port-wine school , who preferred absolute unbelief to shaky theology . ''

		He was , '' says Mr.
Locker	PERSON	-LRB- not very rever - entially -RRB- , '' a kindly but choleric old boy , with a sanguine complexion and roomy boots . ''

		Be - ing summoned once officially to administer ghostly comfort to a mariner who was about to slip his cable for the next world and had some reasonable doubts as to his probable destina - tion , Dr.
Coke	PERSON	said reassuringly : '' Don ' t con - cern yourself about that , my dear sir that 's my affair ! ''

		Mr.
Locker	PERSON	's first school was a preparatory one at
Clapham	LOCATION	, kept by a
Miss Griffin	PERSON	, of whom he remembers little save that she had all the qualities of a kitchen-poker , '' except its occasional warmth . ''

		Miss
Griffin	PERSON	was succeeded by Mr.
Barnett	PERSON	, an Orbilius of the rod , who knew little Latin and much less Greek , and who sought to awaken in his pupil a taste for the classics by thrashing him severely with the buckle-ends of his own braces . ''

		I am sure , '' Mr.
Locker	PERSON	says , '' Mr.
Barnett	PERSON	was an absurd man .

		and that his ignorance was encyclopaedic . '' ''

		Years afterwards he came to see my father at
Green	ORGANIZATION	- wich , and I was amazed to think that the person before me , old and gauche , and with a propitiatory grin , was that formidable savage who had once exercised so terri - ble a sway .

		We talked of past days , and as he was rather jocose , I ventured to say that I still felt the ting - ling of his hazel switches .

		The miserable creature pre - tended he had no recollection of these matters .

		It is strange , my dear young friend , but I have entirely for - gotten it . '

		Perhaps you have forgotten it , sir ; but then , you were at the other end of the switch . '

		I never saw him after that day . ''

		The next school was Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's a dismal `` Low Church '' establishment , where the pupils ' main dissipation was '' An occasional clerical meeting , where Biblical proph - ecy and the Apocalyptic number 666 were frantically discussed by a knot of what I now think must have been presumptuous jackasses , and in a way that then occa - sioned me cold , clammy terrors .

		I still suffer from their sinister predictions . ''

		After Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's came '' a huge unregenerate school at
Dulwich	LOCATION	, '' where Mr.
Locker	PERSON	learned little or nothing ; and finally a day-school at
Blackheath	LOCATION	, where , he says , '' I remained two years , and had an inglorious time of it .

		The only thing I did pretty well was original poetry .

		A subject was given us , and by a certain day we pro- duced a poem .

		My mother wrote most of mine ! ''

		About this time Mr.
Locker	PERSON	's parents began , with some reason , to despair of him ; for what was the use , they argued , of his being clever at fives and cricket and rhyming , if he spelt abom - inably and could scarcely construe a line of Latin ?

		So
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	plans , and aspirations in the direction of the bar or the church , were abandoned ; and the future poet presently found himself perched on a high stool in a Mincing Lane counting-house , where for a twelvemonth or so he made a cheerful pretence of '' learning the business , '' learning in reality little except the foibles and oddities of his fellow-clerks , upon which he delighted to prac - tise , and which are humorously recorded .

		At this point in his narrative Mr.
Locker	PERSON	indulges in some melancholy reflections on current social changes and democratic tendencies , gloomily forseeing a day when the Archbishop of Can - terbury -LRB- successor of Becket and Pole ! -RRB- ''

		may occasionally be seen on the roof of a Piccadilly omnibus '' ; and when
Devonshire House	ORGANIZATION	shall be converted into '' a dry-goods store on the American plan . ''

		The change , he fears , will soon be here .

		The tokens of it are in the air . ''

		Only a few days ago I saw a deplorably dressed ani - mal , diamonds and emeralds stuck in bispostiche cravat , lounge up the steps of
White 's Club	ORGANIZATION	, and take his seat in the bow - window the bow - window , mind you , of the Somersets , the Stanhopes , the
Fanes	LOCATION	; then I recognized that he was my stockbroker , and in acknowledgment of my obeisance he gave me a calculated and reserved bow . ''

		In
1841	DATE	Mr.
Locker	PERSON	received a temporary clerkship in
Somerset House	ORGANIZATION	, and in the fol - lowing year was transferred to the Admiralty , in
Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here he was made private sec - retary to Lord
Haddington	PERSON	and was afterwards appointed deputy reader and precis writer offices which he seems to have filled to the satis - faction of his chiefs .

		A trip to the continent in
1849	DATE	led eventually to his marriage -LRB- 1850 -RRB- to Lady
Charlotte Bruce	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Locker	PERSON	tells very prettily '' how it came about . '' ''

		We had seated ourselves on a bench -LRB- in
Hyde Park	LOCATION	-RRB- and neither spoke .

		I took her hand . '

		This is the pret - tiest hand in the world , ' said I. ' I happen to know of one that 's quite as pretty , ' said she .

		Another silence .

		Perhaps I was incredulous , but when she put the other pretty hand into mine I knew that we were both very happy . ''

		Mr.
Locker	PERSON	's marriage to
Lady Charlotte	LOCATION	was plainly the turning-point in his fortunes ; and he seems to have lived thenceforth as a man of means , first-rate social position , and abundant leisure . ''

		London Lyrics '' -LRB- '' certain 330 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, sparrow-flights of song , '' he modestly terms them -RRB- were published in
1857	DATE	, while Mr.
Locker	PERSON	was still at the Admiralty .

		They soon attracted the favorable notice of Thackeray .

		He invited Mr.
Locker	PERSON	to write for the ''
Cornhill Maga	PERSON	- zine , '' and once said to him , in reply to an allu - sion to his own poetry , '' Yes , I have a sixpenny talent -LRB- or gift -RRB- , and so have you ; ours is small - beer , but , you see , it is the right tap . ''

		A good many of us will doubtless prefer this wholesome '' small beer '' to some other '' taps '' of a much more pretentious brand .

		Mr.
Locker	PERSON	naturally knew many people of note , literary and otherwise ; and his reminis - cences of them are fresh and piquant and sometimes a little satirical .

		Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	he saw occasionally at her own fireside .

		`` Her physique was peculiar : curls like the pendent ears of a water-spaniel , and poor little hands so thin that when she welcomed you she gave you something like the foot of a young bird ; the Hand that made her great had not made her fair .

		But she had striking eyes , and we forgot any physical shortcomings they were entirely lost sight of in what I may call her incompar - able sweetness , I might almost say affectionateness ; just as , while we are reading it , we lose sight of the incom - pleteness of her poetry its lack of artistic control . ''


George Eliot	PERSON	, says Mr.
Locker	PERSON	, '' Was , to my mind , a plain woman .

		Her countenance was equine she was rather like a horse ; and her head had been intended for a much longer body she was not a tall woman .

		She wore her hair in not-pleasing , out-of - fashion loops , coming down on either side of her face , so hiding her ears ; and her garments concealed her outline they gave her a waist like a milestone ... She had a measured way of conversing ; restrained , but impressive .

		... As she often discussed abstract sub - jects , she might have been thought pedantic , especially as her language was sprinkled with a scientific termin - ology ; but I do not think she was a bit of a pedant ... I have been told she was most agreeable en tete-a-tete ; that when surrounded by admirers she was apt to be - come oratorical . ''

		Mr.
Locker	PERSON	attended the funeral of
George Henry Lewes	PERSON	, at
Highgate	LOCATION	. ''

		We were a very small party in the mortuary chapel , not more than twelve persons .

		I never before had seen so many out-and-out rationalists in so confined a space .

		A brief discourse was delivered by a Unitarian clergy - man , who half apologized for suggesting the possible immortality of some of our souls . ''

		In his pleasant paper on
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, Mr.
Locker	PERSON	describes the poet as a man of striking appearance '' tall , dark , grizzled , bright-eyed , and rather fantastically dressed in a sacerdotal - looking garment . ''

		He visited Hunt three or four times at
Hammersmith	LOCATION	, and each time liked him better .

		Once he took tea with him . ''

		The meal was presided over by a nimble-fingered little nymph of a daughter in a stuff frock imperfectly hooked and eyed .

		She had not even the coquetry to pin her collar straight .

		I can still hear his Jacintha , give Mr.
Locker	PERSON	another cup of tea , ' delivered in a suave , almost stately , manner , and in silvery tones . ''

		The saying that an author is the reverse of all other objects , in that he magnifies at a dis - tance and diminishes as you approach him , Mr.
Locker	PERSON	declines to apply to
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	.

		He plainly liked the amiable , chronically impecu - nious , and very unworldly poet ; and even finds it in his heart to admire '' his beautiful reliance on providence '' which word , by-the-by , he rather significantly `` ventures in this connection to spell with a little * p. ' '' Kindly Mr.
Locker	PERSON	!

		Despite the '' Charity Breakfast , '' one can easily fancy him enacting on occasion the prov - ident raven at the shabby
Hammersmith	LOCATION	lodg - ings .

		Mr.
Locker	PERSON	's '' Confidences '' deserves , as much as any book of the kind that has fallen in our way in a long time , the trite praise that '' there is not a dull page in it . ''

		Mr.
Augustine Birrel	PERSON	is the editor ; and we are glad to note that he has provided a good index .

		THE PSYCHIC ASPECTS OF SOCIOLOGY .

		* Professor Giddings , author of '' The Princi - ples of Sociology , '' states in his preface that the particular object of the work is '' to combine the principles of sociology in a coherent theory . ''

		He aims to direct attention chiefly to the psy - chic aspects of social phenomena , '' believing that sociology is a psychological science , and that the description of society in biological terms is a mistake . ''

		But the biological terms structure , function , organ , and many others , occur at frequent intervals , because all higher activities must borrow their designations from the lower and first known .

		This volume seeks to avoid such metaphors , and they are not so common as in many other works , yet their fre - quent employment shows that he can not escape from them .

		The chief explanatory idea of the treatise is the '' consciousness of kind , '' which is defined as being '' a state of consciousness in which any being , whether low or high in the scale of life , recognizes another conscious being as of like kind with itself . ''

		For this notion the author claims originality , and thinks he has mediated successfully between the theories of imitation and social compulsion proposed in recent French discussions .

		Starting with this definition of the * THE PRINCIPLES OF SOCIOLOGY .

Franklin Henry Giddings	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, Professor of Sociology in

Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 331 principle of association , the material is divided into four books : '' The Elements of Social Theory , '' `` The Elements and Structure of So - ciety , '' '' The Historical Evolution of Society , '' and '' Social Process , Law , and Cause . ''

		In the first book , Professor Giddings dis - cusses the sociological idea .

		Society means a naturally developing group of conscious beings , in which converse passes into definite relation - ships which in the course of time are wrought into a complex and enduring organization .

		Sociology is the systematic description and ex - planation of society viewed as a whole .

		It is the general science of social phenomena .

		It is an interpretation of human society in terms of natural causation .

		It refuses to look upon humanity as outside of the cosmic process , and as a law unto itself .

		Sociology is an attempt to account for the origin , growth , structure , and activities of society by the operation of physical , vital , and psychical causes , working together in a process of evolution .

		Sociology has a distinct province ; it studies the phenomena that are consequent upon one state in particular namely , the consciousness of kind .

		Psychology studies all states of con - sciousness .

		Sociology is the science of elements and first principles that underlie all special social sciences , as economics and politics .

		What biology is to the special life-sciences of botany and zoology , that sociology is to the special social sciences .

		The data assumed in politics and in political economy are explained and traced to their origin by sociology .

		In considering the elements and structure of society , we encounter facts of aggregation and association of the population .

		Human beings are naturally gregarious , and groups are formed by family connections or by common settle - ments .

		Persons thus brought together form communities .

		The welding process is accom - panied by conflict , but also by communication , imitation , tolerance , and mutual aid .

		The social nature becomes more imitative , tolerant , and sympathetic .

		But the action of evolution upon various individuals is unequal , and from this inequality of pressure and result there arise the various social classes .

		These classes are of three kinds : vitality classes , personality classes , and social classes .

		In the study of these popu - lation classes , the author finds the key to the scientific arrangement of the problems of prac - tical sociology .

		But it does not seem to be within the scope of sociology , as defined by Professor Giddings , to give any place to prac - tical sociology , nor does he anywhere distinctly show where the discussion of the subject be - longs .

		Professor
Wagner	PERSON	's well-known defini - tion of the scope of political economy goes much further than our author 's definition of social science , since it includes an estimate of the social value of economic ways of life , and suggests better methods of realizing the ob - jects of industrial activity .

		Even the brief treatment of the ends of society in this work would seem to be logically excluded from a science which is simply descriptive and explan - tory .

		It is rather creditable to the writer that his vision of the scope of sociology is wider than the hampering definition with which he begins .

		From association arises the evolution of the social mind , the feelings , thoughts , and voli - tions which go from person to person and are shared by a whole assembly or community .

		Waves of emotion or of ideas are carried along by imitation or sympathy .

		Discussion secures a deliberate agreement upon common notions after reflection .

		In order to have such a fel - lowship in convictions and purposes , there must be contact , leadership , and organs of communi - cation , as press and pulpit .

		The social self - consciousness is made continuous by means of economic , juridical , political , and other tradi - tions , oral or written .

		These traditions are framed into standards , platforms , codes , and creeds .

		Out of this mingling of intellectual products with desires issue social estimates of things socially important , as preservation of the type , cohesion , possessions , and conditions of devel - opment .

		These estimates are the grounds of social choices .

		A distinction is made between social compo - sition and social constitution .

		The groupings of the social composition are natural products of the physiological and psychological activities of individuals , supplemented by natural selec - tion .

		They are at first unconscious products , but at later stages are subjected to choice .

		Then the author treats the rise of families of various types , ethnical and demotic aggregates as hordes , tribes , and communes , counties and cities .

		The constitution of a society means the organization of its members into association for specific purposes as governments , literary and religious societies .

		The greatest of these purposive organizations is the state .

		The an - alysis of voluntary associations , political , juris - tic , economic , and cultural , while very brief , is one of the best of several good discussions in the volume .

		The author here does justice to 332 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, a form of organization which De Tocqueville regarded as one of the most important elements in American life .

		The table of contents for Book III. , on '' The Historical Evolution of Society , '' is simply ap - palling .

		It irresistibly reminds one of the wonder and admiration excited by
Goldsmith	PERSON	's village school-master ; and the wonder grows with consideration .

		One hundred and sixty pages are given to zoogenic association , anthro - pogenic association , ethnogenic association , and demogenic association .

		The generalizations cover all events , known and guessed at , since the very early dawn of life .

		Whether they are true or not , or at least agree with the present consensus of experts , must be determined by the critics in many widely-scattered fields , and these specialists have already begun to com - ment .

		A council , composed of a biologist , an anthropologist , an ethnologist , a master of folk - psychology , and a philologist , would be required for a jury .

		And yet the author is justified in making the attempt , since a consistent theory on the subject could never be produced by the corps of contributors to an encyclopedia , but must come from some one brain .

		It is very comforting , in this clamorous and uneasy age of specialists , to read a calm and confident mes - sage like this : '' Such , then , is the complete philosophy of history . ''

		The author 's large knowledge of contemporary conditions appears with especial advantage in the analysis and ex - planation of contemporary society .

		His esti - mate of Christianity is this : '' It became the most tremendous power in history .

		Gradually it has been realizing its ideal , until , to-day , a Christian philanthropy and a Christian missionary en - terprise , rapidly outgrowing the esoteric sentimentalism of their youth , and devoting themselves to the diffusion of knowledge , to the improvement of conditions , and to the upbuilding of character , are uniting the classes and the races of men in a spiritual harmony . ''

		In the last book , on '' The Social Process , '' Professor Giddings estimates the physical fac - tor in social evolution .

		Human history is a part of cosmic evolution , and all social energy is transmuted physical energy .

		Hence , social progress is conditioned by the laws of matter and force .

		The persistence of force , the pro- cess of equilibration , and the physical necessity of evolution , are generalizations assumed as a basis ; and they are as true of the social popu - lation as of inorganic matter .

		Density of pop - ulation depends upon food supply , and culture is dependent on density of population .

		The direction of social activity is determined by the line of least resistance , and the movements of population are rhythmical .

		The functions of society vary with its structure , and become more definite and complex .

		The social process involves psychical as well as biological elements .

		Personality is produced by association .

		The ego is the centre of all social forces .

		It is not merely the product of heredity and individual experience , but of social influences and of the reaction upon these .

		The self is determined in its character by all its antecedents , but it also combines and modifies energies , and is itself a living force .

		Hence arise '' volitional associations '' through which communities express their common desires , act upon each other and upon nature , and make a social life of culture possible .

		The individual and society are ever reciprocally dependent .

		Communism and individualism are poles of one world .

		The modifications of the ego by social life are fixed in the structure of the brain and nerves , and so their effects are transmitted .

		The social process moves by causation and according to law .

		The primary social forces are psychical impulse , imitation , and rational choice .

		But the effects of volition are limited in the physical process by selection and sur - vival .

		The laws of rational choice are `` un - changing relations between the groupings of social values and the forms of social conduct . ''

		There are subjective and objective criteria of the ideal good , the former relating to inherent qualities of excellence , the latter to the adapta - tions of means to ends .

		The values are eco - nomic , ethical , and sociological .

		The ideal good , in its final form , combines virtue and pleasure , integrity and the expansion of life .

		Society advances in its preference of ideals .

		Personal force is first esteemed ; then utilitarian happiness ; then puritanic integrity ; and , last of all , self-realization .

		Passing from ends to means , the author states the law of combinations : '' A population that has but few interests , which , how - ever , are harmoniously combined , will be conservative in its choices .

		A population that has varied interests which are yet inharmoniously combined will be radical in its choices .

		Only the population that has many , va - ried , and harmoniously combined interests will be con - sistently progressive in its choices . ''

		But while social choices are determined by sub - jective values , survival is governed by organic and objective utility .

		Only that form of con - duct can endure which secures the widest and most harmonious arrangement for promoting life .

		The unnatural and injurious must be dis - solved .

		Society is more than an organism , it is an

		The function of society is to develop conscious life and to create human personality .

C. R. HENDERSON	PERSON	.

		EUGENE FIELD .

		* Some men have made their successes in lit - erature through the quality of their thought , but these have not always been as admirable for the form which that thought has assumed ; other men have distinguished themselves by the grace and charm of the setting which they have given to ideas not necessarily great or profound ; and yet others have won their way to a secure place in the hearts of mankind by a generous person - ality , which has asserted itself over and above all that they have said , and has been , indeed , the nerve and centre of all their sayings .

		The whimsical kindness of a
Charles Lamb	LOCATION	is always to be noted in whatever he has to bring into the light of day ; the pleasure in an essay of
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	's is something still apart from the contribution which he presents or the method which he uses in presenting it .

		The humorist is likely to have this winning personality ; often we are interested not exclusively in his mes - sage or the finish with which he utters it , but in that third something , over and above his work , predominantly alive in it , which is really the man himself , his nature , his character , his distinctive point of view .

		I think that we notice the same quality in the writings of
Eugene Field	LOCATION	.

		This is not to say that his work is deficient in finish , or that it is lacking in thought ; but only that in whatever he does we find preeminent that generosity , that bonhomie , which is the man .

		Whenever we open one of his books , we find , in addition to the story or the poem or the oddity which is the product of a humor always alert , the genial personality of the author rising before us and thus enhancing the gift which his hands are bearing to us .

		As Mr.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	says in an introduction to one of these vol - umes : '' All that he writes , indeed , is quite free from the conventionalism to which authorship as a profession is sadly liable .

		Because he is free from them , you read his poem or you read his prose , and are affected as if you met him .

		with him , or if you were talking with him at breakfast over your coffee , he would say just such things in just this way .

		If he had any art , it was the art of conceal - ing art .

		But I do not think that he thought much of art .

		I do not think that he cared much for what peo - ple say about criticism or style .

		He wrote as he felt , or as he thought , without troubling himself much about method .

		It is this simplicity , or what it is the fashion of the day to call frankness , which gives a singular charm to his writing . ''

		It is a curious fact that a man of Mr.
Field	PERSON	's taste and temperament should have done so much of his work for the daily press .

		The haste with which newspaper work must be done certainly stands in the way of many kinds of excellence ; it must be granted , however , that the excellences of clearness and immediate effectiveness are fostered by the constant appeal to large audiences , upon whom an impression must be made at once or not at all .

		That a man who revelled in old editions of rare books , who delighted in illuminated missals and monk - ish legends , whose mind was full of the fairy - lore of all times and races , should spend so much of his life in the rapid work required by the newspaper is somewhat singular .

		To be sure , rapidity of work does not of necessity imply either superficiality or carelessness ; the editorial or the brief paragraph , of the best sort , requires large knowledge and preliminary thought , and each must have incisiveness of utterance .

		However much Mr.
Field	PERSON	's earlier writings suffered from the conditions in which they were perforce produced , it may , perhaps , not be fanciful to trace in his mature efforts , to which leisure contributed its part , some of the better and higher qualities belonging to work produced with diurnal regularity for im - mediate consumption , but bearing the genuine literary stamp .

		It may be said that we have as yet made but very inadequate provision in our life for the talent that should by its nature devote itself to expression ; and journalism seems to afford to the young writer a resource which he finds only with much greater difficulty elsewhere .

		The writer of this notice must admit that he has only an imperfect sympathy with the mass of productions in various dialects , supposably of the English tongue , and many of which are entirely unknown to him , that have been clam - oring for public attention of late .

		He can see no adequate reason why a writer should volun - tarily select an inferior medium , when the great speech of the century is at his disposal ; nor why a talent whose products are expected to be read quite generally should hamper itself with the inconvenient narrownesses of a single sec - 334 THE DIAL -LSB-

		He is mindful of the '' Big - low Papers , '' but yet remembers that patriotism belongs to the whole country , and has thus far found its highest utterance in
America	LOCATION	in the '' Commemoration Ode . ''

		The humanity of Mr.
Field	PERSON	has brought him safely through waters where many another vessel has gone to pieces .

		The dialect story or poem , if it be more than a mere curiosity or a scientific disclosure of an out-of-the-way phase of life , must reveal some trait that touches the universal heart .

		Mr.
Field	PERSON	has fairly done this in his best efforts of the kind , although he would doubtless have agreed with the critic who classed the dialect effusions among writings of his that he esti - mated at the lowest rate .

		It is always an interesting thing to watch the growth of a writer , to find him becoming grad - ually cognizant of where his main strength lies , and winning a mastery more and more sufficient of that strength .

		Mr.
Eoswell M. Field	PERSON	, in his touching memorial of his brother in one of these volumes , speaks of the deepening insight and enlarging sympathy manifest in the later years of
Eugene Field	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		In the volume of stories beginning with '' The Holy Cross , '' one sees this conscious command of the instru - ment which he has selected for his use .

		The motives in these stories are more home-like , the fancy is better held in check , the humor is delicate as anywhere in
Field	LOCATION	's efforts .

		The author is evidently making his way to the doing successfully of what he can do best .

		The ac - tualities of life impress him more , the whimsi - calities have in them something besides their strangeness and oddity .

		He is on the thresh - old of the book which contains so much of his sincerest thought and feeling , the `` Love Affairs of a Bibliomaniac . ''

		Everybody is familiar with `` The Biblio - maniac 's Prayer '' : '' But if , O Lord , it please th thee To keep me in temptation 's way , I humbly ask that I may be Most notably beset to-day ; Let my temptation be a book , Which I shall purchase , hold , and keep , Whereon , when other men shall look , They '11 wail to know I got it cheap . ''

		Out of the feeling expressed in this poem grows a book .

		It appears that the idea of the '' Love Affairs '' was in its author 's mind for a long time .

		He was a collector of the enthusiastic kind , and it is not strange that his fervor at last found vent in the way in which it did .

		We must all concede that the way is certainly a happy one , and that its discoverer has admira - bly exploited its possibilities .

		He follows it through its varying windings with unflagging humor , and leads us delightfully from one gar - den spot to another .

		The wisdom as well as the wit is all through it in its author 's best and peculiar manner .

		The poems also scattered up and down the volume share in the writer 's en - thusiasm , as witness the following : '' My garden aboundeth in pleasant nooks , And fragrance is over it all ; For sweet is the smell of my old , old books , In their places against the wall . ''

		Here is a folio that 's grim with age , And yellow and green with mould ; There 's the breath of the sea on every page , And the hint of a stanch ship 's hold . ''

		And here is a treasure from
France	LOCATION	la belle Exhaleth a faint perfume Of wedded lily and asphodel In a garden of song abloom . ''

		Come , pluck with me in my garden nooks The posies that bloom for all ; Oh , sweet is the smell of my old , old books , In their places against the wall . ''

		There is always , apart from the pathos , an imaginative effect in an unfinished book ; we can proceed to complete it for ourselves in our own way , or we can wonder what the author would have done with it , and think of him as continuing his pleasant labors , and , with his powers at their height , fashioning habitations for his thoughts and fancies more perfect than those he built of old .

		We hear it occasionally said , perhaps some - what under the breath , and yet with consider - able assurance of its truth , that the golden age of prose has fairly set in , and that poetry , so long a sovereign , must now submit to become a vassal to its stronger brother .

		Notwithstand - ing this fine and recent theory , one discovers , after all , that the deepest and sincerest utter - ances of any man , competent to rhythmical composition , take the old but ever new form of rhyme and metre and stanza .

		The poetry of
Eugene Field	ORGANIZATION	contains his truest contribution to the thought and art of his day ; whether we consider his disclosures of the pleasures and weaknesses of the bibliophile , in which he was so immersed and which he knew so well , or whether we read his renderings of
Horace	PERSON	into a modernity at times perhaps somewhat too insistent , we touch the truest chord of the poet 's nature ; and when we come to his songs of the intimate life of home and childhood , we are aware of a gift unique and tender .

		What - ever technical deficiencies we may find , or how - ever a false note in some of the best known of these verses may offend our ear , we are quick to overlook it in the simplicity and genuineness of the feeling .

		Every man who writes at all
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 335 writes a good deal that his matured experience would fain forget , and the man is fortunate of whom a critic like Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	can say : '' That he did much beneath his standard , fine and true at times , is unquestionable , and many a set of verses went the rounds that harmed his reputation .

		For all this , he certainly has left pieces , compact of the rarer elements , sufficient in number to preserve for him a unique place among
America	LOCATION	's original characters , scholarly wits , and poets of bright fancy .

		Yorick is no more !

		But his genius will need no chance upturning of his grave-turf for its remembrance .

		When all is sifted , its fame is more likely to strengthen than to decline . ''

		The publishers have brought their tribute to the poet and humorist ; these books are beauti - ful books indeed ; and we all know of what the house that issues them , and the
DeVinne Press	ORGANIZATION	, are capable .

		of the elements of common humanity in the most diverse types of character , and as far as it strength - ens the claim of every individual to live his own life in his own way .

		It is less laudable if it tends to exalt the eccentric and the imperfectly developed type above that which is well-rounded and normal , or if it estimates ethical values in accordance with any other than the universal standard .

		Two stories just published by Mr.
Howells	PERSON	raise the question above suggested , and it is not altogether easy to de - cide which of these conflicting tendencies is empha - sized by them .

		Both the stories are about Shakers , and the author 's success in attaching a genuine hu - man interest to
Shakers	ORGANIZATION	is sufficient evidence of his art .

		In '' The Day of Their Wedding , '' two young people brought up in the community grow carnally - minded toward one another , and seek '' the world outside '' for the purpose of living together in the normal relation of man and wife .

		The force of early training proves too strong for them , however , and after a day of delirious excitement at
Saratoga	LOCATION	they falter in their resolve , and return unwedded to their associates .

		In `` A Parting and a Meeting , '' the theme is approached from the other direction .

		Two young people about to be married stray , half by accident , into a Shaker village .

		Both are much impressed by what they see , and the deeper na - ture of the man succumbs so quickly to the prose - lytizing influence that he then and there decides to abandon his worldly career in order to become a Shaker .

		In both these stories Mr.
Howells	PERSON	makes much of the `` psychological moment , '' and both must stand or fall in accordance with our estimate of the adequacy of the impelling motive .

		In the second story , we can not admit that the motive is adequate , while in the first judgment remains sus - pended .

		A lifetime even a brief one of habit is doubtless an immense directing force , and the more we think of the psychological problem of '' The Day of Their Wedding , '' the more we are inclined to admit the final resolution of the young people to be probable , if not inevitable .

		We are certainly not prepared for it by what goes before , and it comes to the consciousness with something like a shock , but reflection justifies it in considerable meas - ure .

		Both books are undoubtedly charming , en - livened as they are by gleams of humor , and suc - cessful as they are in the deft and subtle delineation of character .

		We have not heard from Mr.
F. J. Stimson	PERSON	as much of late as we could have wished , for his work is always finely conceived and carefully wrought .

		It is true that jurisprudence has gained what liter - ature has lost , but that does not altogether console the lover of literature . ''

		Pirate Gold , '' the novel with which Mr.
Stimson	PERSON	has broken a prolonged silence , is a story of mercantile
Boston	LOCATION	in the ante - bellum days .

		It has little to do with pirates , and the title , although justified by the ill-gotten hoard that is one of the most important '' properties '' of the story , serves rather as a romantic fillip to the imagination than as an index to the nature of the 336 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, book .

		The love of an old man for an adopted child is the central theme , suggesting alternately ''
Silas Marner	PERSON	'' and '' Les Misdrables , '' and leading to a situation comparable in pathos with the closing chapters in the story of
Jean Valjean	PERSON	.

		Perhaps the finest thing in the book is its portraiture of an old-time
Boston	LOCATION	merchant .

		The sketch is done with swift , incisive , sympathetic touches ; in short , with the art that conceals art so deftly that we realize only upon reflection how subtle the art is .

		Glimpses of the abolitionist agitation are also given in the later chapters , and the electrical tension of the time is admirably reproduced .

		The walking delegate has often appeared in Amer - ican fiction , but has been sketched with a master hand , as far as we know , in only two instances .

		One is the late Mr.
Bunner	PERSON	's short story , '' Zadoc Pine , '' the other is Mr.
Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	's new novel , ''
Tom Grogan	PERSON	. ''

		The latter is a very different sort of book from any that Mr.
Smith	PERSON	has previously given us ; it has a firmer grasp upon actuality , a more vital method of presentation , than even the story of our dear old friend Colonel
Carter	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	has taken his incidents from his experience as an en - gineer of public works , and his story deals with the cowardly efforts of a pack of '' union '' laborers to destroy the business of his independent and hard - working hero .

		The hero , by the way , is a heroine , for
Tom Grogan	PERSON	is really
Tom	PERSON	's widow , who takes her husband 's name and carries on his carting busi - ness .

		She is a strongly conceived character , delin - eated with sympathetic art , and stands out in fine contrast to the miserable loafers and rascally poli - ticians who are leagued against her .

		Such a book is , we think , calculated to do good as a social tract , and we shall be surprised if it does not have some - thing of the influence of
Reade	ORGANIZATION	's novel , ''
Pat Your	PERSON	- self in His Place , '' which deals , mutatis mutandis , with essentially the same subject . ''

		The Damnation of Theron Ware '' is by far the strongest work of fiction that Mr.
Harold Frederic	PERSON	has yet produced ; it is , indeed , one of the most striking and impressive novels of the year , or of several years .

		The scene is laid in the region that the author knows so well Central
New York	LOCATION	and the action takes place , for the most part , in a town of some ten thousand inhabitants .

		Mr.
Fred	PERSON	- eric has aimed to produce a great and typical pic - ture of American life , and an unerring instinct has taught him that such a picture must be concerned with the life of a small community rather than with the more attractive but also more sophisticated civ - ilization of the great cities .


New York	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	are , after all , less typically American than
Oshkosh	ORGANIZATION	and
Kalamazoo	LOCATION	, just as
Paris	LOCATION	is less typically French than Tours .

		It is in the small community that the mainsprings of a nation 's strength are to be traced most distinctly and the elements of its weakness most clearly discerned , that its fundamental ideals are most naively offered to the view .

		Mr.
Frederic	PERSON	's novel is a study of character projected upon a re - ligious background .

		Two forms of religious activity are given prominence , the narrow and colorless , but unquestionably native , orthodoxy of the primitive culture-stage in which the greater part of our pop - ulation still remains , and the more liberal but un - deniably alien ideal of the Church of
Rome	LOCATION	.

		A young Methodist minister ,
Theron Ware	PERSON	, represents the one , while the other is represented by a priest and by the fascinating woman whose influence brings about the minister 's damnation .

		Anyone who has lived in a small town in the older and more settled section of the country knows how sharp is the con - trast between these two religious elements how each is to the other a world almost utterly unknown and must pay tribute of admiration to the penetra - tion with which the author of this book has entered into the life of both , and the skill with which he has brought them both to bear upon the character of
Theron Ware	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is , in this aspect , not con - troversial , but simply vital ; besides being one of the subtlest studies of moral disintegration that have been made .

		Weak and contemptible as is the nature of the minister , we are not left unpitying as we read of his downfall , for we feel that he is the sport of fate , and that his life might have been shaped to a nobler outcome .

		The tree of knowledge is not for him the tree of life , yet we can not help thinking that it might have been so had his early environ - ment been a more wholesome one .

		The story of his final collapse is told with terrible power , and the effect is heightened by the tragic irony of the episodes that precede it .

		In its passionate aspect , the book strongly suggests the '' Spring Floods '' of Tourgue * nieff , for the movement is psychologically much the same .

		The workmanship of the novel is not in all respects praiseworthy ; some of the lesser characters are not perfectly realized , some of the threads are dropped , and some of the actions not adequately motivated .

		The scene , too , in which the first climax is reached may be reproached with touching upon the borders of the sensual , instead of remaining within the limits of the merely sensuous .

		But when all is said , the final impression is of a power that Mr.
Frederic	PERSON	has not heretofore dis - played , and that has now earned for him a high place in American literature .

		We note that the En - glish publishers of this novel have chosen to give it a new title '' Illumination '' which suggests '' The Marble Faun '' and '' Transformation , '' but which does not seem to have been a happy inspiration , although it strikes the ironical keynote of the book .

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's new novel is as neat in pattern as ever , flowing smoothly and decorously along for the proper number of pages , and then reaching the con - clusion that we have all the time known to be inev - itable .

		The scene is laid in
Amalfi	LOCATION	or , more ex - actly , in the Capuccini at
Amalfi	ORGANIZATION	and the only characters that count are four , two elderly people , once married and afterwards divorced , and two young people , children of the former by second mar - riages , learning to love one another before knowing anything of the earlier relations of their respective parents .

		It is all very skilfully planned , and very
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 337 entertaining .

		The author is as inveterate a moral - izer as ever , and when he is not talking himself , his characters take their turn , and converse at great length without saying anything in particular .

		Of characterization in any deep sense there are few traces ; the revelations that one gets from this inter - minahle chatter are about as illuminating as the indications that might be derived from a minute inspection of the clothing worn by the speakers .

		The book is an almost perfect example of machine - made art .

		The
Paris	LOCATION	Commune of
1871	DATE	is likely in the course of time to yield as many good stories as any episode in modern history .

		Perhaps the best of them that has yet been told is '' The Red Republic , '' by Mr.
Robert W. Chambers	PERSON	.

		This novel is characterized by unusual fertility of invention and a brisk man - ner that keeps the interest from flagging for a mo - ment .

		The author has made a minute study of the scene and the subject .

		The day-by-day happenings of those terrible weeks are chronicled with the atten - tion to detail of a newspaper report .

		Many of the leaders of the Commune have a place in the narra - tive , prominent among them being the sinister figure of
Raoul Rigault	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such episodes as the capture of the guns on
Montmartre	LOCATION	, the sortie toward Ver - sailles , and the crowning communistic infamy of the murder of Archbishop Darboy , are very vividly de - scribed .

		And through all the tale of horror there runs a thread of romance in the shape of one of the ten - derest of love-stories .

		A second novel by Mr.
Cham	PERSON	- bers , called '' A King and a Few Dukes , '' is almost equally interesting , although it is written with less care than the other , and although it is concerned with an imaginary series of happenings in the Bal - kan Peninsula rather than with the facts of actual history .

		It has something of the satirical vein of Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	's comedy , `` Arms and the Man , '' and is a good example of what may be called the bouffe variety of the historical novel .

		The fascination of the French Revolution for the novelist seems unabated , and it will be long before those few years that closed the last century a period perhaps richer in human interest than any other of equal length in modern history will cease to provide themes for romantic fiction .

		Yet often as the subject has been exploited , it has provided material for but few works that may in any sense be styled masterpieces .

		There is Hugo 's supreme `` Quatre-Vingt-Treize , '' and
Dickens	PERSON	's `` Tale of Two Cities , '' and Balzac 's '' Chouans , '' and
Bulwer	PERSON	's ''
Zanoni	PERSON	, '' but hardly anything else of very high rank .

		Mr.
Hatton	PERSON	's novel is of the purely conven - tional sort , and can not be given much praise .

		A certain cleverness in the management of incident is about all that we may credit it with , and it makes a fairly readable but nowise impressive story .

		It is called '' When Greek Meets Greek '' probably be - cause the author , like many other people , fancies the phrase to be some sort of a quotation , which we beg leave to assure him it is not .

		Mr.
Frankfort Moore	PERSON	's latest novel , '' The Secret of the Court , '' is in a new manner , being nothing less than a tale of romantic mystery , after the fash - ion of Bulwer .

		The only trouble is that the mys - tery which is unearthed in
Egypt	LOCATION	, and concerns the resurrection of the dead proves quite unman - ageable , and forces the author to dispose of the pos - sessor of the secret by burning him up in his castle .

		The reader naturally expects something less hack - neyed than this , and is disappointed .

		A story of life in a coal-mining town in the north of
England	LOCATION	is offered us by Mr.
W. E. Tirebuck	PERSON	. ''

		Miss Grace of All Souls '' is the title , the name indicating that the daughter of the vicar of
All Souls Church	ORGANIZATION	is the heroine .

		As a local study the book shows close familiarity with the scenes it por - trays , and intimate knowledge of the colliery point of view .

		The dialect is something of a stumbling - block , but could hardly have been spared from a study aiming at fidelity to fact .

		Examination of the work shows it to be a socialistic tract almost un - disguised .

		The author permits sentiment to over - ride logic , and his feeling for ethical values is sin - gularly faulty .

		The case that he takes for discussion is that of the hypocritical mine-owner , callous to the sufferings of the men whom he employs , and bent only upon securing the largest personal profit from his business .

		He is represented as bringing about a widespread colliery strike in order that he may sell his large accumulation of products at a sharp advance .

		A twenty-five per cent reduction of wages is ordered , while no reduction is made in the cost of manage - ment , and the proprietor gains largely by the re - sulting distress .

		The chapter of horrors is filled by a cave-in , a flooded pit , and a riot suppressed by military force .

		The case presented by Mr.
Tire	PERSON	- buck is a possible one , but we do not believe it to be typical .

		The statistics of such industrial struggles show us that managers as a rule submit to greatly reduced returns before they resort to the extreme measure of a reduction in wages , and that in many cases industries are kept in operation at a heavy loss in order that employment may be provided for the men .

		Mr.
Tirebuck	PERSON	defeats his own purpose by his distorted presentation of the situation .

		Colors so thickly laid on , and so violently contrasted , make it impossible to view the work as either serious art or serious economics .

		Capitalists without the sense of responsibility toward their dependents , and labor - ers who are models of nearly all the virtues , may doubtless be found here and there , but they are the exception rather than the rule .

		There is , moreover , a subtle sort of immorality in setting , as the writer does , the impulsive sentimentality of the vicar 's daughter against the maturer judgment of her father , and in claiming for her a sympathy that may well , in so complex a matter , be shared be - tween them .

		In this aspect , the book reminds us of a pernicious sort of Sunday-school literature in which the priggish and self-righteous child is rep - resented as sitting in judgment upon the well - meaning but worldly-minded parent , forgetting that obedience is the first of childish duties , and of course 338 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, not old enough to know that a child 's conviction of what is right is more likely to be shallow dogmatism than anything else .

		Miss Grace , to be sure , is not exactly a child in years , but she is actuated by an essentially childish disregard of the logical condi - tions of the problem which she thinks so clear of so - lution .

		In the end , she marries one of her humble coal-mining friends , which is perhaps the best thing that could happen to her , however such a union offends the sense of fitness .

		Mr.
C. F. Keary	PERSON	has done some good literary work in serious lines , but is hardly possessed of the gifts of the novelist . ''

		Herbert Vanlennert '' is a very long story more than five hundred pages long and one not easily to be read without a lib - eral exercise of the prerogative of skipping .

		Its manner is an attempted reproduction of the manner of
Thackeray	PERSON	, and it is safe to say that without '' Pendennis '' this book could never have been written , but the frequent suggestions of so great an artist only emphasize the distance between this book and its evident model .

		Apart from its prolixity and incoherence , Mr.
Keary	PERSON	's story is marred by one or two scenes that are conceived in extremely bad taste .

		It is essentially a story of English so - ciety , with an Afghan interlude supposed to devel - ope the manliness of the somewhat callow youth who serves as hero .

		There is a good deal of unde - niable cleverness about the book , as well as the sort of allusiveness which shows a man to have a good many intellectual interests and a fair degree of cul - ture .

		These qualities at least make it readable , de - void as it is of characterization in any high sense , or of style and symmetry .

		The prolixity of Mr.
Blackmore	PERSON	is so pronounced that he can spread the simplest plot over the pages of the most voluminous novel .

		This is an artistic defect not wholly excused even by the shrewd humor and kindly human feeling always character - istic of his work .

		It might be assumed a priori that he would not be able to meet the requirements of the short story , which ought always to display rapidity of action and economy of expression .

		The assumption is certainly justified by the four stories now published in a single volume .

		Their interest is slight , and there is little art in their structure .

		The style alone saves them , as it has saved some of Mr.
Blackmore	PERSON	's full-grown novels .

		There could not well be a sharper contrast than exists between the stories just referred to and those published by Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	in his '' Wandering Heath . ''

		Fragmentary as some of these are , they all exhibit the swift incisive touch of the man who weighs his words , and searches laboriously for the just expression .

		There is only one story , in the strictest sense '' The Bishop of Eucalyptus '' to be found in the collection ; the other pieces are character - sketches , humorous fancies , and quaint bits of Cornish tradition .

		Humor is nearly always present , now and then rollicking , but more fre - quently subdued to an internal chuckle .

		We have enjoyed most of all the story of the Bishop , the startling tale of '' The Captain from Bath , '' and the two delicious '' Letters from Troy , '' descriptive of the impact of modern ideas upon that remote ham - let .

		The doctrinaire reformer might learn a lesson of the greatest value if he were only capable of learning lessons from this artfully artless narrative of Troy 's temperance agitation and first parish council . ''

		The Exploits of Brigadier Gerard , '' by Dr.
A. Conan Doyle	PERSON	, can hardly be regarded as other than a pot-boiler , along with the
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	stories and other recent productions of this too prolific writer .

		The book contains eight stories , each an episode in the career of the supposititious narrator , who is a soldier of
Napoleon	PERSON	, and is characterized mainly by the boastful
Gascon	PERSON	spirit .

		His adventures are surprising enough , and he escapes from them creditably , if not always with success ; but one gets rather weary of his vaunts , and would gladly have him come to grief .

		The author 's inventive powers are badly strained in the effort to keep up an inter - est in the exploits of his hero , and there is a good deal of melodrama about the book .

		Mr.
Anthony Hope	PERSON	's '' Comedies of Courtship '' is a collection of six stories two fairly long ones and four short ones .

		The comedy of courtship , ac - cording to Mr.
Hope	PERSON	, is chiefly to be found in the sort of situation that leads to the tragedy of Goethe 's '' Elective Affinities , '' with the important difference that the right people find each other before the mar - riage ceremony has taken place .

		The stories are sprightly and entertaining ; it requires a consider - able amount of intellectual agility to keep up with them , but there is fortunately no great demand upon the sympathies , and we can view with equanimity the transfer of undying love from one object to an - other that so often and so unexpectedly takes place .

		We have long known Professor
C. G. D. Roberts	PERSON	for the foremost of Canadian poets , and the publi - cation of '' Earth 's Enigmas '' now calls upon us to recognize him as a writer of a high order of imag - inative prose .

		Slight as these stories are for no less than fifteen of them are crowded within the limits of a very small volume they are noteworthy for their artistic finish and poetic feeling , no less than for the fidelity with which they picture
Cana	LOCATION	- dian landscape and character .

		There are beauti - ful dreamy pages in this little book , a fine sense of life under primitive conditions and enveloped in the atmosphere of romance . ''

		A Tragedy of the Tides '' is perhaps the gem of the collection .

		Very different from these so remote from us in space and time are the strictly modern stories in the volume just given us by Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	. ''

		Cinderella , '' the first of them , is a Van Bibber story , and a rather flat one at that , compared with most of those that have preceded it .

		There are four others , three of which are readable , and the fourth wildly exciting .

		This story of '' The Reporter Who Made Himself King '' saw the light , we are told , in an earlier volume , but somehow escaped our attention .

		It is the '' comedy of a consulate '' on a
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 339 small
Pacific	LOCATION	island , and may be recommended with confidence to any reader who has a fairly developed sense of humor .

		We doubt if the author has ever spun a more fascinating yarn .

		The Youth of Parnassus , '' '' The Will to Live , '' '' The Claim of the Past '' these are taking titles , and they fulfil their promise , although not exactly in the way one expects .

		For they turn out to be not stories in any very definite sense , but rather meditations , or at the most episodes .

		They are the work of a young man who knows his
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, and succeeds in conveying something of the charm -LRB- and the melancholy -RRB- of life in the ancient university quadrangles .

		The work is at times positively bril - liant as in the '' Idyll '' which sketches in swift sure lines a familiar type of the American girl and is always clever . ''

		Buller Intervening , '' for example , is a sketch of a dozen pages only , but it has an idea , and treats it with singularly happy effect .

		We shall await with much interest the literary reap - pearance of Mr.
Logan Pearsall Smith	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Cram	PERSON	's '' Black Spirits and White '' offers us a collection of assorted ghosts European ghosts that harmonize with their environment of German castle and Italian convent .

		Some of them are too obviously theatrical to be convincing ; others are limned with considerable success .

		We think we like best the clammy and viscous ghost of '' No. 252 Rue M. le Prince , '' although the spirit that haunts '' The White Villa '' at Psestum has distinctly en - gaging qualities .

		Mr.
Cram	PERSON	's descriptive and nar - rative text creates a fitting atmosphere for the super - natural visitants that appear in his pages , and he contrives more than once to produce a genuine thrill of awe and terror .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Among the latest volumes in the
Agoodhistory Cambridge Historical Series	ORGANIZATION	, edited of
Australasia	LOCATION	.

		_ by Dr.
G. W. Prothero	PERSON	, we are glad to commend '' The History of the Australasian Col - onies '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Professor
Edward Jenks	PERSON	, a writer already known as a painstaking student of political science by an earlier work on the govern - ment of
Victoria	LOCATION	.

		The author has spent three years in
Australia	LOCATION	, and thus has been able to use the ar - chives at
Sydney	LOCATION	,
Melbourne	LOCATION	, and
Wellington	LOCATION	.

		The volume before us is an admirably concise and well constructed history of the group of communities linked together by allegiance to the British crown and the prevalence of British blood , manners , ideas , and hopes , chief among which is
Australia	LOCATION	, besides
Tasmania	LOCATION	, and the three islands known together as
New Zealand	LOCATION	.

		The author has avowedly limited the scope of his work , writing from the standpoint of the school which regards history as past politics and politics as present history .

		Hence he has paid close attention to the political and economic devel - opment of
Australia	LOCATION	.

		First tracing the growth of Popular discussions of Homer .


Australia	LOCATION	into five political states , he has shown how these states have reached their present position of self-governing and virtually independent commun - ities , though nominally colonies of
England	LOCATION	.

		What he has to say of the development of the cattle , wool , and -LRB- generally speaking -RRB- the agricultural industries , is by way of suggestive comment .

		The presence of the remarkable race known as the Maoris , the true natives of
New Zealand	LOCATION	, accounts for several problems in the history of
New Zealand	LOCATION	, legal , po - litical , and social , which the Australians had not to consider .

		Even to-day the Maoris possess large dis - tricts in the islands ; and they must be reckoned with for years to come .

		The best example of the author 's power of analysis is found in the chapter entitled `` Responsible Government and Modern Constitu - tions '' ; here he seems particularly strong .

		The con - cluding chapter is devoted to a brief presentation of such present-day problems as -LRB- i. -RRB- the question of colonial federation ; -LRB- ii . -RRB-

		the
Pacific	LOCATION	question as to which of the greater Powers shall exercise a con - trolling influence in the
Pacific	LOCATION	; -LRB- iii . -RRB-

		the Samoan difficulties ; and finally -LRB- iv . -RRB-

		the question of separat - ing northern from southern
Queensland	LOCATION	.

		Careless - ness has allowed '' east '' to stand on p. 4 for '' west . ''

		A noticeably complete index and two good maps bring the volume to a close . ''

		Art and Humanity in Homer '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a pretty little pocket volume in which Professor
William Cranston Lawton	PERSON	has collected some half dozen or more of his university extension lectures and `` At - lantic '' papers . ''

		The Iliad as a Work of Art , '' `` Womanhood in the Iliad , '' `` Odysseus and Nau - sicaa , '' '' The Homeric Underworld , '' these are some of the themes on which Professor
Lawton	PERSON	dis - courses with his customary genial fluency and sym - pathetic appreciation .

		Technical erudition would have been out of place in papers whose purpose is to stimulate and guide the general reader in the intelligent enjoyment of translations .

		But the au - thor shows himself well informed about matters to which his limits permit him only to allude , and his taste and judgment are elegant and sound .

		We can - not speak as favorably of his metrical ear .

		The original English hexameters in which his copious citations are given are a sorry representation of the '' strong-winged music of Homer . ''

		This is perhaps not his fault .

		He is attempting impossibilities .

		It is possible as a tour de force to write a good English hexameter composed of real dactyls and spondees .

		Witness
Kingsley	PERSON	's '' Lingered in rose-red rays on the peaks of Ionian mountains . ''

		to which it would be hypercritical to object that the I of Ionian is a trifle too long for the last syllable of a dactyl , and that its final syllable is made too heavy by the consonant in the next word .

		But neither
Kingsley	PERSON	, nor
Longfellow	LOCATION	, nor
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, nor Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	, can keep it up in the mon - osyllabic , consonantal
Saxon	PERSON	diction of English poe - try .

		And it is pure illusion to suppose that the accent 340 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, can often be trusted to alter appreciably the abso - lute weights of syllables , or produce anything but a tantalizing semblance of that alternation of slow - paced spondee and light-tripping dactyl which con - stitutes the genius of the metre .

		For no one can a stronger claim be advanced to a place in the English Men of Action '' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- than for
Thomas Cochrane	PERSON	, known later by his title of
Dundonald	LOCATION	, a hero who disputes with
Nelson	PERSON	the name of greatest among British sailors .

		The story of
Dundonald	LOCATION	's life as told by the Hon.
J. W. For	PERSON	- tescue is one of intense interest , yet it is a sad one .

		It shows us a genius capable of the most astonish - ing achievements united with a character so undisci - plined that its possessor was cut off from the oppor - tunities of serving his country , of doing great things that would easily have come to him , while his life was embittered and nearly wrecked by the passion - ate quarrels into which he rushed at every turn .

		That he was usually right in his contentions only makes the pity greater , for patience and tact would have smoothed his way to success , while his insub - ordination and folly only set against him all those in authority and blocked his way .

		Even worse , in the intensity of his hatred for the administration he refused the offer of a fleet and a glorious oppor - tunity to serve his country , and chose instead to thwart and discredit by factious opposition the gov - ernment that had failed to give him what he thought his due .

		Driven from the service in
England	LOCATION	, he enlisted in turn in the service of
Chili	LOCATION	,
Peru	LOCATION	,
Brazil	LOCATION	, and
Greece	LOCATION	, in every case doing wonders , and freeing the South American states from
Spain	LOCATION	and
Portugal	LOCATION	in spite of their own cowardice , treachery , and self - ish stupidity .

		It is a satisfaction to learn that after many stormy years he was restored to the British service , and that his wrongs were righted in large measure .

		The two series of expository lectures o ^ .

		Poetical science delivered at Cam - bridge during the Michaelmas and Lent terms of the academic year 1885-86 , by the late Sir
J. B. Seeley	PERSON	, have been prepared for book publication by Professor
Henry Sidgwick	PERSON	, and are issued under the title of '' Introduction to Political Science '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The little book should be in the hands of every student of the subject .

		Polit - ical speculation is still so deeply vitiated by the more or less fanciful a priori theorizings of
Rousseau	PERSON	and his predecessors that it is high time their scholastic brain-spinnings should give way to the fruits of a sounder method .

		A political science based on the widest possible induction from historical and an - thropological facts , from the phenomena displayed by the crudest tribal polities down to those of the most highly organized and intellectualized modern states , was
Seeley	ORGANIZATION	's ideal .

		The lectures enforce and illustrate throughout his familiar dual doctrine : -LRB- 1 -RRB- that the true method of studying political sci - ence is an essentially historical method ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the right method of studying political history is to study it as material for political science .

		No one is likely nowadays to question seriously the first proposition , whatever may be thought of the second .

		A somewhat lengthy categorical r .

		e P lv to .


Herr Max Nordau	PERSON	's sensa - tional diatribe against modern civili - zation is made by an anonymous but evidently prac - tised writer , under the title of '' Regeneration '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The book is furnished with a pungent introduction by Professor
Nicholas Murray Butler	PERSON	, who moderately commends his author , and scores
Herr Nordau	PERSON	pretty severely on his own account . ''

		Degeneration , '' says Professor
Butler	PERSON	, `` constitutes Nordau .

		He is himself an abnormality and a path - ological type .

		Every large hospital for the insane knows his representative the one sane man in a world of lunatics . ''

		The novelty of
Herr Nordau	ORGANIZATION	's pseudo-scientific paradoxes has worn off , and refut - ing him will seem to the class he pretends to repre - sent very like slaying the dead .

		There may be , however , some timid souls still overawed by his sci - entific position , and shocked at the strange shapes they have seen in his warped and fantastic mirror ; and these should derive comfort from the sane views and common-sense arguments of the present volume .

		Says Professor
Butler	PERSON	again : '' The author of ' Re - generation ' is successful in turning the flank of
Nordau	ORGANIZATION	's attacking forces at more points than one .

		He is able at times , without over-exertion , to con - vict Nordau not only of lack of knowledge , but of what is far worse knowledge of things that are not true . ''

		Origins of Folk-lore .

		An '' Introduction to Folk-lore , '' by Mr.
Marion Roalf	PERSON	e , is issued by Mr.
David Nutt	PERSON	in
London	LOCATION	and Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	's Sons in
New York	LOCATION	.

		The author 's pre - face begins with the words , '' This little book pre - tends , without arrogance , to answer a question , not infrequently heard , namely , What is folk-lore ? ''

		The point of view is anthropological only .

		The au - thor states that the treatment has been profoundly influenced by
Tyler	PERSON	,
Spencer	PERSON	, and
Lang	PERSON	.

		`` The Separable Soul , '' '' Animal Ancestors , '' '' Animism , '' '' The Other World , '' '' Magic , '' are titles of chap - ters presenting a considerable mass of material illus - trating the thought and philosophy of savages and barbarians .

		Clear summaries of the argument at the ends of chapters would have greatly improved the book .

		The reader who wishes to profit by the discussion must prepare such summaries for him - self .

		The style is clever and the data are usually trustworthy .

		The author is always unhappy , how - ever , in stating evidence from geology or archae - ology .

		The best and most practical chapter in the book is the final one , where the data already pre - sented , and presumably digested by the reader , are applied to the elucidation of myths and folk-tales .

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 341 BRIEFER MENTION .

		A new edition of
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	is not untimely in this age of reprints , and Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons , with their '' Mohawk '' edition , have seized the obvious opportunity .

		There are to be thirty-two volumes , at
$ 1.25	MONEY	each .

		Judging from The Spy , '' the first volume to be pub - lished , the edition will prove a satisfactory one .

		Typo - graphy , paper , and binding are all to be commended as simple , dignified , and attractive .

		The volume has a frontispiece illustration , and no apparatus of any sort , except the original preface of the author .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons are the publishers of a handsome two-volume edition of '' The Bible in
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		The work will not only please all Borrovians , but many others are likely to learn from it the peculiar fascina - tion that Borrow exercises over those who make his ac - quaintance .

		The editing of this edition was one of the last pieces of work done by the late
Ulike Ralph Burke	PERSON	, who supplied an introduction , footnotes , and a glossary .

		There are a few illustrations , but not as many as we wish there might have been .

		There is also a map for the purpose of enabling readers to trace the course of Borrow 's wanderings .

		The first number of a series of `` Economic Studies , '' to be published by the
American Economic Association	ORGANIZATION	, has just appeared from the press of
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It comprises two papers : '' The Theory of Eco - nomic Progress , '' by Dr.
John B. Clark	PERSON	; and '' The Re - lation of Changes in the Volume of the Currency to Prosperity , '' by General
Francis A. Walker	PERSON	.

		As a sup - plement to this series we have a '' Hand-Book of the
American Economic Association	ORGANIZATION	'' for
1896	DATE	, with con - stitution , membership list , and abstracts of the papers read at
Indianapolis	LOCATION	last
December	DATE	, on the occasion of the
Eighth Annual Meeting	ORGANIZATION	.

		Friends of President
M. W. Stryker	PERSON	of
Hamilton College	ORGANIZATION	will be glad to know that he has collected some fifteen orations and addresses , delivered by himself in the years since
1893	DATE	, which appear in a volume entitled ''
Hamilton	PERSON	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and Other Addresses , '' just pub - lished by
Messrs. William T. Smith & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Utica	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The edition is limited to one thousand copies .

		These addresses deal with a variety of subjects bio - graphical , educational , political , religious ; they are often marked by passages of very vigorous thought which make them well worthy of preservation .

		The place of honor is very appropriately given to an address on Al - exander
Hamilton	PERSON	.

		The reprinters have at last got around to
Captain Marryatt	LOCATION	, and it was time that they should .

		Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in this country , in cooperation with
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	, have planned an edition , in twenty-two volumes , of the novels of this ever-popular writer , to appear at the rate of two or three volumes monthly . ''

		Peter Simple '' and '' Frank Mildmay '' inaugurate the series , and show us how taste - ful is to be the execution of this noteworthy project .

		The books are bound in dark green English buckram , they have gilt tops and rough edges , and are beautifully printed on
Dickinson	PERSON	paper .

		Each volume has three etchings , and an ex libris design on the inside of the cover .

		Mr.
Richard Brimley Johnson	PERSON	is the editor of the series , and contributes to '' Peter Simple '' a careful critical and bibliographical introduction .

		The frontis - piece of this volume is very properly a portrait of Mar - ryatt .

		We congratulate the publishers upon the success - ful inauguration of this notable undertaking .

Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		Each vol - ume contains stories of a particular country ,
England	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	being the special subjects of the two thus far issued .

		The stories are by the best writers , living and dead . ''

		Reprinted Pieces , and The Lazy Tour of Two Idle Apprentices '' is the complex legend upon the title-page of the latest volume in the

Miguel Sanchez	PERSON	, `` La Isla Bdr - bara '' and '' La Guarda Cuidadosa , '' have been edited by collation of the seventeenth century editions and man - uscripts , and published by Dr.
Hugo A. Rennert	PERSON	, under the auspices of
the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	.

A. S. Cook	PERSON	of
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	for the best unpublished poem , of not more than one hundred lines in length , upon some subject connected with history or art , which shall be submitted by the writer on or before

T. Eeane	PERSON	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is published as a volume of the
Bohn Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		The same translation , issued in another form , was reviewed by us some time ago , but we note a few pieces that we do not remem - ber to have seen in the earlier edition . ''

		The Captain 's Daughter , '' of course , occupies the place of honor in the collection .

		It is interesting to note the present state of the '' Ox - ford English Dictionary '' as set forth recently in an official circular .

		I got from it a sense of new resources altogether ; of his striking a new chord ... What I allude to more particularly is what he seems to have been intending in the figure of the elder woman .

		That intention was surely one of the finest poetically , pictorially speaking , was n't it quite the finest that ever guided his pen ? ''

		369 THE DIAL 'S SCORE OF VOLUMES .

		If volumes meant years , THE DIAL would just now be entering upon the year of its ma - jority .

		The present issue completes the twen - tieth volume of the review , and carries it well into the seventeenth year of its existence .

		This discrepancy between years and volumes results , of course , from the fact that THE DIAL began as a monthly , and became afterwards a semi - monthly .

		The first stage of its career extended from
1880	DATE	to
1892	DATE	; the second stage has now covered four years .

		Since each of its score of volumes includes twelve parts , this issue of
June 16 , 1896	DATE	, is reckoned as the two hundred and fortieth , while the aggregate number of pages is about seven thousand .

		Throughout all this period
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	has remained under the same editorial manage - ment .

		During the first twelve years it bore the imprint of a well-known firm of book - publishers ; since then it has been issued by
The Dial Company	ORGANIZATION	, incorporated in
1892	DATE	under the laws of
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		This transfer of publica - tion meant , as our older readers are well aware , no essential changes in the character of the paper except those naturally resulting from enlarged opportunities and resources .

		Begin - ning with
September 1 , 1892	DATE	, THE DIAL be - came a semi-monthly , and added several new features , the most noteworthy of them being the leading editorial articles that have since appeared with every issue .

		It was felt by the editors that a critical journal devoted to the interests of literature should have , no less than the political or religious publication , a stand - point of its own , and that the general field of literary discussion offered , no less than any other , opportunities for the enunciation and defense of important principles in criticism , education , and public affairs .

		The editorial feature thus established was a new departure in critical periodicals of the class to which THE DIAL belongs , and abund - ant evidence of its acceptability has been af - forded by private communications and public comment upon our leaders of the past four years .

		The scope of this publication , broadly conceived , embraces many subjects besides those of strictly literary concern .

		Education , library management , important art movements , 348 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, the relations of scholarship to public affairs , the questions of copyright and the taxation of knowledge , and all other matters affecting the higher interests of culture , rightfully belong , and have upon appropriate occasions been brought , within its purview .

		Upon all of these subjects , and many others as well , we have sought to give expression to the sober intelli - gence of the nation , and to voice the lasting sentiments of the judicious rather than to echo the cry of the masses for the moment .

		Indeed , the leading editorials of THE DIAL , considered as a whole , may be taken as our confession of faith in questions of culture , as an index of those principles and ideals for which the re - view stands and may be expected to stand .

		In the performance of its function as a re - view of current publications ,
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	has sought to secure in all departments criticism that is both competent and readable , that is uninfluenced by prejudice , that is not weak - ened by the aimless sort of impressionism which so often usurps the name of criticism , that directs attention to the book under discussion rather than to the writer of the notice , and that tries to be as generous and appreciative as pos - sible without allowing inaccuracy , sciolism , and slovenliness to go uncensured .

		The list of spe - cial authorities who have contributed reviews to our columns is a very long and distinguished one , and includes the names of many scholars who stand foremost in their respective depart - ments of learning .

		It may be worth while to say , in this connection , that the unsigned re - views , or u Briefs , '' although editorial in '' style , '' are prepared by a great number of hands , and are assigned with no less care than is exercised in the case of the longer articles .

		This method of securing reviews , of course , makes it impos - sible for us to notice books without some delay , for promptitude is to be had only at the sacri - fice of deliberate and authoritative judgment , and we are content to leave to the daily news - papers the foolish ambition to rival one another in the speed with which they herald the advent of the new books , and the facility with which they produce opinions that may be read to-day but will surely be forgotten to-morrow .

		It has often been assumed , by persons un - familiar with the work of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, that it must give undue attention to the intellectual interests of the region in which it is produced .

		We need hardly say to any of our readers that this assumption is quite unwarranted , or that our field is as wide as the country itself .

		Al - though it is published in what
New Englanders	LOCATION	call the West , and in what publishers know as the great book-consuming centre of the Repub - lic , its constituency is as much
Eastern as Western	ORGANIZATION	, and its subscribers are pretty evenly distributed over all the States and Territories .

		Indeed , the charge has come more than once from Western literary coteries that THE DIAL ignores the literary product of the section in which its home has been made , and recognizes only work that has won the approval of the older centres of culture .

		This foolish accusa - tion is best offset by the equally foolish one , now and then made in
New York	LOCATION	or
Boston	LOCATION	, that THE DIAL is the '' literary champion of the West , '' and is jealous of the preeminence of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	men of letters .

		The simple truth of the matter is that we have never had , and never shall have , but one standard of judgment , the standard by which all work , good or bad , should be measured ; and that a book 's place of origin never counts for a feather 's weight in THE DIAL 'S scale of criticism .

		We may perhaps be pardoned the confession of a little pride in contemplation of the twenty completed volumes of THE DIAL , and in recol - lection of the difficulties that have beset the enterprise during the sixteen years of its his - tory .

		It was no easy matter to win for a paper of purely intellectual appeal the support and the position that have been won for THE DIAL during these sixteen years , or to resist the temp - tation to bid for popularity at the sacrifice , in some measure , of the high ideals set for the journal at the start .

		As a record of American literary activity during nearly two decades of the century , our score of volumes are , we be - lieve , unsurpassed in value , and we take par - ticular satisfaction in the thought that , pre - served for reference as they are in most of the large public libraries , and fully catalogued in such works as
Poole	PERSON	's '' Index , '' they will prove useful to the future student of American litera - ture , as they have been helpful to readers of their own time seeking guidance in current lit - erature and in the selection of books to add to the library .

		SHAKESPEARE IN
CHICAGO	LOCATION	.

		Whatever our opinion as to the modern deca - dence of the stage , we must admit that in the depart - ment of Shakespearian drama Chicagoans have never enjoyed a more extended or more varied sea - son than that of 1895-96 .

		Between the months of
September	DATE	and
June	DATE	the city has been visited by Mr.
Frederick Warde	PERSON	, Mr. THE DIAL 349
Louis James	PERSON	, Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	, and Mr.
Thomas Keene	PERSON	, veterans the quality of whose art is familiar to all ;
Miss Ada Rehan	LOCATION	and Mrs.
Julia Mario	PERSON	we -
Taber	PERSON	have appeared in Shakespearian roles , the former lady having practically opened the season with a three - weeks engagement in
September	DATE	and now closing it with a visit of a fortnight in
June	DATE	; Mr.
Walker Whiteside	PERSON	, Mr.
Otis Skinner	PERSON	, and Mr.
Robert Mantell	PERSON	have maintained their places as honest exponents of the classic drama , while Mr.
Oeston Clarke	PERSON	and the younger
Salvini	PERSON	have made courageous and not uninteresting essays in the same ambitious field , however rash and ill-judged their attempts may have seemed to be .

		Thus , eleven players of excellent repute have during the year submitted their interpretations of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, con - ventional or new , to more or less critical audiences in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		It may be added that notwithstanding the abnormal patronage accorded by large and .

		perhaps not less critical audiences to vaudeville and the '' continuous show '' with which
Chicago	LOCATION	has been afflicted no more than other American cities , these important engagements , with hardly an excep - tion , proved financially successful .

		The following tabulated statement of plays pro- duced , the number of performances , the actors and their dates , will be found of interest .

		It is under - stood that many other standard plays of the old '' legitimate '' stock were likewise seen during the period covered by these engagements . ''

		Virginius , '' '' Richelieu , '' '' The Fool 's Revenge , '' '' School for Scandal , '' along with the more modern melodramas in the repertoire of Messrs.
Irving	PERSON	,
Salvini	PERSON	, and
Mantell	PERSON	, filled in the intervals between the dates ; but the Shakespearian productions only are consid - ered notable .

		13 90 11 That is to say : thirteen of the best of Shake - speare 's plays have been set upon our boards , and the number of performances gives an aggregate of ninety .

		We have had two
Richards	PERSON	, two Macbeths , two Rosalinds .

		Three companies have appeared in one form or another of '' The Taming of the Shrew '' ; two companies in '' Romeo and Juliet . ''

		There have been seen three Othellos , five Shylocks , and seven Hamlets .

		From
September 25	DATE	to
October 12	DATE	, Shake - speare was played continuously for three weeks in
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Miss Rehan	LOCATION	and Mrs.
Taber	PERSON	appearing for two weeks of the three , simultaneously at different houses .

		Beginning again on
January 27	DATE	there were performances continuing three weeks to
February 15	DATE	.

		Mr.
Walker Whiteside	PERSON	, Mr.
Otis Skinner	PERSON	, and Mr.
Creston Clarke	PERSON	were all playing in the city at this ' time .

		Daring these three weeks , '' Hamlet '' was given fourteen times , and twice the theatre - goer had his choice of two interpretations .

		In
March	DATE	there were thirteen performances of Shake - speare ; and in
April	DATE	, sixteen .

		There was at least one performance in each month of the season except
November	DATE	.

		We rather doubt if any other city out - side of
Germany	LOCATION	can make as remarkable a show - ing as this .

		Of the varying values of these engagements it is not necessary to speak ; comparison with the past would also be gratuitous .

		The mere fact that the record stands as it does is a direct encouragement to those who love the true art of the stage in its most admirable expression ; it also supplies the strongest possible argument for disproving the com - plete degeneracy of our stage and the assumed gen - eral decadence of theatrical taste at the present time .


W. E. SIMONDS	PERSON	.

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		THE PARENTHETICAL ' SIC ' IN CRITICISM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In a communication in your issue of
May 16	DATE	, Mr.
F. H. Teall	PERSON	indulges in a form of criticism , as annoying as it is uncalled for , which may be styled the parenthetical sic ; and as the subject of the criticism is taken from an arti - cle by me , I crave the indulgence of a little space in which to enter protest .

		It is bad enough for the reviewer of a book to avail himself of this form of criticism ; for anyone else to use it is impertinent , using the word , of course , in its literal sense .

		As regards the special points to which Mr.
Teall	PERSON	takes exception , the first , the phrase '' little far from criminal , '' might perhaps be improved , though I should hesitate to entrust the improving to a writer who uses so dreadful a phrase as '' to exploit '' ; the second is a case of incom - plete ellipsis ; the third -LRB- which my critic introduces with that objectionable French phrase , en passant -RRB- is hardly met by using '' the initiatory word notwithstanding , '' whatever an '' initiatory word '' may be .

		As to the '' in - ference naturally drawn from this criticism namely , that Mr.
White	PERSON	asserts that little annotation is neces - sary , '' I can only say that my statement was based wholly on Mr.
White	PERSON	's practice , not at all on his theory .

		While I agree with Mr.
Teall	PERSON	that the dictionaries 350 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, .

		often set up a man of straw , I beg leave to differ with him about the meaning of admittance in `` The Merry Wives . ''

		Elsewhere in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	this word is un - doubtedly used in its modern sense , but both here and in a later scene in the same play it certainly has the force of fashion or good form , as we should say now , that which admits one to good society .

		In conclusion I would mildly protest against the too frequent carelessness of writers in the matter of refer - ences , of which Mr.
Teall	PERSON	's article furnishes a fair ex - ample .

		Of the five quotations from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	occur - ring there , two , or forty per cent , are incorrectly given , the passage from '' Cymbeline '' being from the third instead of the fourth scene of the first act , and the same being true of the extract from '' Measure for Measure . ''

		The '' p ` rythee '' in the latter the writer is perhaps not responsible for , though the apostrophe is of course not necessary .

		No more valuable advice was ever given to a literary young man than that of Dr. Bouth : '' Always verify your citations . ''

KILHAM	PERSON	DODGE .

		THE PASSIVE VOICE WITH AN OBJECT .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Mr.
Caskie Harrison	PERSON	did well to call attention , in your journal lately , to the fact that such sentences as '' he was asked a question '' are warranted by good English usage for centuries back .

		As those who object to this con - struction , however , generally treat it as an absurdity from the logical standpoint , Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	might have gone further and shown the inherent weakness of their logic .

		The difficulty with such critics is that they have not gone far enough in their linguistic investigations to dis - cover that a verb may be passive with reference to one person or thing without sustaining the same relation to every other person or thing with which the sentence may bring it into contact .

		When , from the active standpoint , we think of an officer giving a soldier his discharge , our conception is of an action affecting both the soldier and the discharge , the latter the more directly of the two .

		Now we change the point of view , and think of the sol - dier as the subject , saying that the soldier was given his discharge .

		Custom has decreed that the voice-form of the verb shall be governed by the subject , and so our critic raises his hands in holy horror at the outrageous anomaly of a passive verb with an object .

		The only anomaly is that in this age it should escape the notice of any fairly educated person that the relation of the verb has been changed with reference to but one of the two things -LRB- or persons -RRB- involved .

		To go back to the illustration , the discharge is evidently as much the object of the action as before , and rightly remains un - changed .

		In explaining this to a class , I should not say that when the voice of the verb is changed to the passive the accusative in question is retained ; this leads to the false idea that such a construction presupposes , in actual usage , the corresponding active locution .

		In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred , neither speaker nor hearer gives the slightest trace of thought to the active form .

		How - ever secondary the construction may be in its origin , it stands now upon its own basis in actual usage .

		The pupil should be told boldly that the accusative is the object of the verb ; and after he has come to apprehend the fact by a common-sense examination of the meaning of the sentence , he may then be given an account of the active form into which the thought may be thrown .

		At the same time , it is well that his attention should b & called to the futile efforts of the class of critics by whom we are denied the right to this logical and well-accredited form of speech .

		By the way , have these critics realized that such sen - tences as '' He has been told to go , '' '' I was taught to sing , '' etc. , are logically in the same category as the expressions which they condemn ?

		Or is it one thing to be taught language and quite another thing to be taught to understand language ?

		In one sense , at least , it cer - tainly is ; and with this suggestion as to the origin of the - criticisms which called forth Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's letter , I must close .

		GERMAN PHILOLOGY IN SHAKESPEARE CRITICISM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It is surprising to find in an article under such a head - ing as '' Shakespeare in Lexicography '' -LRB- THE DIAL ,
May 16	DATE	-RRB- no mention whatever of the most important of all dictionaries to the special student of the great dramatist , the '' Shakespeare-Lexicon '' of
Alexander Schmidt	PERSON	, published twenty years ago in
Koenigsburg	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	.

		A knowledge of that work would have pre - pared Mr.
Teall	PERSON	for a more intelligent discussion of the vocabulary of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Schmidt has , no doubt , erred at times in the creation of too many Shakespearian meanings of the same word .

		He realizes but imperfectly distinctions in the force of certain words in Elizabethan and nineteenth-century English .

		But to a German giv - ing English definitions to English words , more than this , may cheerfully be pardoned for the sake of the valuable material he has so arranged that one may , in many cases , let one 's own discretion be one 's tutor , spare a great deal of sheer memorization , and avoid thresh - ing general dictionaries that distinguish but scrappily between the English of our age and that of Shake - speare .

		Let us consult
Schmidt	PERSON	concerning two of the pass - ages quoted by Mr.
Teall	PERSON	.

		In '' The Merry Wives of Windsor '' -LRB- Act II. , scene 2 -RRB- ,
Ford	ORGANIZATION	commends Falstaff as a gentleman '' of great admittance . ''

		Schmidt defines '' admittance '' as '' permission to enter , reception . ''

		Passages cited include '' What admittance ? ''

		-LRB- '' Love 's Labour 's Lost , '' II. , 1 -RRB- explained as '' What reception did you meet with ? ''

		and the peculiar expressions `` Any tire of Venetian admittance '' -LRB- '' Merry Wives , '' III. , 3 -RRB- , explained as '' received , in fashion at
Venice	LOCATION	, '' and '' of great admittance '' -LRB- in the passage under discussion -RRB- , explained as '' admitted to the company and converse of great persons . ''

		That the last explanation is correct , is plainly shown by the context .

		That it differs for the better from Mr.
Teall	PERSON	's `` commanding much admit - tance , '' is equally clear .

		A more concise explanation than
Schmidt	PERSON	's would have been '' of admittance to the great . ''

		This would have shown that admittance has , as Mr.
Teall	PERSON	says , its present meaning , '' permission to enter , '' and that '' the part of the sentence that needs explanation is the two words of great '' words which Mr.
Teall	PERSON	has not explained correctly .

		Turning to the word divorce , I find in
Schmidt	LOCATION	three definitions : -LRB- 1 -RRB- `` Legal dissolution of the bonds of matrimony , '' -LRB- 2 -RRB- `` Any separation of love , '' and -LRB- 3 -RRB- '' That which separates . ''

		Of the last -LRB- given also by the
International Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Teall	PERSON	says : '' The word was never used and never could be used in this sense . ''

		1896 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 351 How about
Timon	ORGANIZATION	's apostrophe to the exhumed gold < Timon of
Athens	LOCATION	, '' IV. , 3 -RRB- ? ''

		thou sweet king-killer , and dear divorce ` Twixt natural son and sire ! ''

		So extraordinary is Mr.
Teall	PERSON	's denial of the possi - bility of divorce meaning '' that which separates , '' that - we may expatiate a little .

		In the appendix to
Schmidt	PERSON	's Lexicon -LRB- p.
1421	DATE	-RRB- is the following remark : u The kind of metonymy called Abstraclum pro Concrete is common to all languages , and scarcely to be numbered among the peculiarities of poetical license , but no poet has been nearly so bold in it as Shakespeare . ''

		The subjoined passages are instructive .

		Abstract nouns are still used in calling names .

		We do not wonder at finding Ther - mites calling to Ajax , '' Do rudeness , do camel . ''

		A re - markable instance of the same thing is Juliet 's calling the Nurse '' Ancient damnation ! ''

		Expressions like '' Farewell , fair cruelty ! ''

		and '' Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty ! ''

		were perhaps of influence on Sir
Piercie Shafton	PERSON	, whose '' My most dear Discretion ! ''

		and '' Ha , my Rusticity ! ''

		far enough removed from genuine euphuism , are a better reproduction of the foppish
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan than has always been admitted .

		Schmidt gives passages illustrating the metonymy in profusion .

		I should like to call attention to two beau - tiful passages in which I think '' death '' is used for '' the dead . ''

		They illustrate how fine and poetical this use of language may be when it arises from the uncon - scious instincts of inspiration .

		The first is from '' Comus '' -LRB- 560-562 -RRB- : '' I was all ear , And took in strains that might create a soul Under the ribs of death . ''

		The other is from `` Othello '' -LRB- Act II. , scene 1 -RRB- : '' O my soul 's joy I If after every tempest come such calms
May	DATE	the winds blow till they have waken 'd death ! ''

		It is not impossible to take these as personifications , but until I meet with some representation of Death as a sleeper I shall prefer my own interpretation , of the latter passage at least .

		I have already exceeded my limits , but may be per - mitted to add that
Schmidt	PERSON	's discussion of adjectives in the Appendix -LRB- pp.
1415	DATE	et seq. -RCB- makes clear many such usages as '' of great admittance '' and '' the long divorce of steel . ''

		The latter means '' the axe that causes long divorce . ''

		THE seventh volume of `` Germania '' is completed with the
April	DATE	issue , and a glance over the year 's numbers deepens our impression of the usefulness of the period - ical to students of the German language .

		Each num - ber contains a selection of good classical reading-matter , carefully annotated , together with simpler reading for those less advanced , and all sorts of syntactical and lin - guistic helps for the beginner .

		The editor , Mr.
A. W. Spanhoofd	PERSON	, shows a keen appreciation of the needs of the student , and deserves to have a large following .

		Encouraged by the success of the periodical , the pub - lishers have undertaken a similar work for French , and we have just received the first issue of '' L'Etudiant , '' edited in similar fashion by Dr.

		THE MAID OF ORLEANS .

		* The story is told of the English painter
Watts	PERSON	, that he replied to a question in regard to the figure of the youth trampled under foot in his '' Mammon '' '' Why did I paint the youth naked ? '

		Because he is a type of human - ity ; if he had been clothed , and therefore par - ticularized , he would have ceased to be a type . ''

		Much the same sort of observation might be made of the '' Personal Recollections of
Joan	PERSON	of Arc . ''

		The figure of
Jeanne Dare	PERSON	f is so clear and distinct , so refined , her life was so romantic and yet vouched for as few lives have been -LRB- hers is the only record of a human life the circumstances of which have come to us under oath -RRB- , that it seems a work of superero - gation to seek to clothe her with the drapery of romance .

		Since Mr.
Clemens	PERSON	has succeeded in so cleverly weaving the data of history into the narrative he has written , why did he not devote himself from the first to writing the life of his heroine ?

		The romantic element in the life of the Maid can not possibly be heightened by its use in fiction , nor can it be reduced by the strictest adherence to history , for in her life history and romance well-nigh coincide .

		This , Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	has realized ; and , as a consequence , from either point of view he has produced the preferable work of the two .

		But what that is new can be said of Jeanne Dare ?

		Nothing .

		1 1 can not reconcile myself to Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's usage
Joan	PERSON	of Arc ; nor again to the form
Jeanne d'Arc	PERSON	.

		As to the first , a name is too personal a thing to be denationalized , especially in the case of so national a character as
Jeanne Dare	PERSON	.

		Mich - elet conjectures that she may have been christened with the double form
Jeanne Jean	PERSON	, according to the French mode of giving female names to boys , and vice versa .

		That observa - tion , however , would in no way affect the fact of the name
Jeanne	PERSON	.

		In regard to the surname , whether it be d'Arc or Dare , I prefer the latter .

		Even if the name were derived from an ancestral village of Arc -LRB- c / ` ylrc -RRB- , the appellation would tend to have the force of a distinct surname , as in the case of
Jeanne	PERSON	's mother , Isabeau Rome'e , the form
Rome	LOCATION	* e having been derived from the circumstance that an early member of the family had been distinguished by a pilgrimage to
Rome	LOCATION	.

		So in the case of Jeanne Dare .

		This opinion is in deference to the authority of M. Valet de Viriville '' Nouvelles recherches sur la famille de
Jeanne Dare	PERSON	, ''
Paris	LOCATION	,
1854	DATE	.

		A portrait of the Maid by an unknown painter , in the
Hotel de Ville	ORGANIZATION	at
Rouen	LOCATION	, has the form `` Jeanne Dare . ''

		352 THE DIAL -LSB-
June	DATE	IS , , is true and beautiful , she will continue to be the world 's fresh ornament , the largess of whose soul made
France	LOCATION	and the world the richer for her having lived in it .

		Jeanne Dare was born
January 6 , 1412	DATE	, at
Domremy	ORGANIZATION	near
Vaucouleurs	LOCATION	.

		Her father ,
Jacques	PERSON	, was a native of Ceffonds in Cham - pagne ; her mother ,
Isabeau Romee	PERSON	, came from
Vouthon	PERSON	in the duchy of Bar .


Jeanne	PERSON	was thus Champenoise through her father and Bar - rois through her mother .

		As to
Domremy	ORGANIZATION	, it was divided by the little brook of Trois-Fon - taines , an affluent of the Meuse .

		The northern part of the village was a dependency of the
Lorraine	PERSON	chatellany of Vaucouleurs ; the south - ern part , in which
Jeanne	PERSON	was born , belonged to the lordship of
Gondrecourt	LOCATION	, which had held of the crown since
1308	DATE	.

		Her parents were farmer folk of the better class , not rich , but possessed of flocks and herds and able to aid their poorer neighbors .

		Jacques Dare enjoyed a certain distinction in the village .


Jeanne	PERSON	was the youngest of five children , three of whom were boys .

		The village was Armagnac in pol - itics , and the Armagnac party represented the national cause .

		By
1423	DATE	the English had pen - etrated into Champagne ; Domremy suffered from their incursion at that time .


France	LOCATION	was prostrate before the invader .

		Her people , not yet a nation because not yet out of the toils of feudal provincialism , for three generations had seen the lilies of
France	LOCATION	crushed into the dust by the foe , and so long as the alliance between
Burgundy	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	lasted the conquest would continue .

		But there was promise of morrow even in
midnight	TIME	.

		The Armagnac party , the dominant influence at court , was gradually growing to be the national party , not for any virtue of its own , but because of enmity to that of
Burgundy	LOCATION	.

		Even negative patriotism was better than no national sense .

		Fortunate was it for
France	LOCATION	that the king was in their hands , for the king , were he never so weak , still represented in his own person and privileged blood the idea , as yet unapprehended , of a native country .

		He reigned by grace of God , by divine right ; loy - alty to the king was therefore a Christian duty .

		But loyalty implied patriotism , and this is the meaning of the Coming of Jeanne Dare : she was the incarnation of French national senti - ment .

		Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	has grasped this fact ex - cellently well .

Paris	LOCATION	itself , with the immense moral influence implied in its posses - sion , was lost to
Charles VII	PERSON	.

		It remained for the English to force the barrier of the Loire at
Orleans	LOCATION	, and end the struggle .

		This was the moment chosen for the appearance of the Maid .

		Chosen ?

		By whom ?

		Was
Jeanne Dare	PERSON	moved by a sublime exaltation , or is she to be regarded as an interesting pathological study merely ? '

		Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	has wrought at the problem of her character , but guards himself from predeter - mining the reader .

		As for the
Sieur Louis de Conte	ORGANIZATION	, he believes that the influence in her soul was of God .

		Consider : the fifteenth century was a period of transition , when the old things that had ob - tained for centuries were passing away .

		It was an epoch of spiritual , intellectual , economic , , and institutional unrest , which already in
Italy	LOCATION	had culminated in the Renaissance , and was - destined ere long to combine
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	and Reformation phenomena together in
England	LOCATION	, .


France	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The great re - forming councils -LRB-

		1414-8 ;
Basel	LOCATION	,
1431	DATE	-RRB- ,
Wiclif	LOCATION	,
Huss	PERSON	, the Mys - tics , the lay and clerical societies , all showed that the Church was not supplying the relig - ious needs of the people .

		Because the apparatus of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	failed , the people sought other means .

		Far from being alienated , however , , from the God revealed to them through the Church , they were enabled to draw closer to - Him .

		But the
Church	ORGANIZATION	had not altogether lost its - authority , and the combined influence of this ancient authority and the new closer relation might easily have influenced a sensitive and pious soul like that of
Jeanne Dare	PERSON	to an undue degree .

		Again : what was the character of her early education ?

		Of learning , in the sense of that term , she had none .

		The paternoster and a few prayers and litanies had been taught her j she could neither read nor write .

		Her educa - tion was that of
Elijah	PERSON	.

		Behind the village of Domremy stretched away a vast forest : mighfe not those first temples , with their sombre aisles thridded here and there by sunbeams as through some mullioned window , the shade , the quiet , the reverence of the place , have appealed to the ten - der child-spirit ?

		How did her schooling differ , save in degree , from that of the prophets of old ?

		Might not the
Voice	ORGANIZATION	that spake on Car -

		THE DIAL 353 mel , and caused the Cedars of
Lebanon	LOCATION	to bow themselves , whisper to a maiden , too , in the fastness of a forest in the West ?

		After all , is not inspiration a question of degree ?

		Em - erson has somewhere said that a man should learn to detect and watch the gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within , and that the virtue of Moses and
Plato	PERSON	and
Milton	PERSON	is that books and traditions were ignored by them , while what they thought , because that conviction was so intense , was the universal sense .


Jeanne Dare	PERSON	came to
France	LOCATION	with the impassioned argument of a simple truth .

		And again : consider the place where her youth was spent .

		Domre * my was on the high - road between
Verdun	LOCATION	and Langres , along which much of the news of war must have passed .

		Its frontier situation on that debatable land be - tween the two combatants would give her unex - ampled opportunities .

		She knew the weariness and waste of war ; perchance she had seen the king himself ; she felt , at least , the royal hu - miliation , not logically , but almost out of in - stinct and intuition .

		But all is not yet ex - plained , nor even alluded to , in her character .

		Whence did this child learn wisdom ?

		As nat - ural as the simplest creature of creation , she was still supernatural almost superhuman in some traits .

		In the field she astounded the grizzled veterans by her conduct , yet she was unerring ; in the council chamber this girl of seventeen displayed a judgment superior to the
King	ORGANIZATION	's best counsellors .

		In the trial at
Rouen	LOCATION	her acumen confounded the judges .

		When pressed to reveal what was the mysterious '' sign '' she gave the
King	PERSON	, she refused .

		That sign was nothing less than her assurance to
Charles	PERSON	of his legitimacy , and therefore of his legal title to the French crown , a doubt which had never crossed the mind of anyone save the king himself , and which
Jeanne	PERSON	discerned either by intuition or revelation .

		But she knew the political importance of the secret -RSB- -LSB- she bore , and kept it well .

		Such capacity was not the conduct of a precocious child ; her mental structure was deeper and more massive than that .

		She was mature without being old ; she was experienced without having been tried .

		Moreover , there was nothing hectic about
Jeanne Dare	PERSON	; she was spirituelle , but never morbid .

		Bernard of
Clairvaux	LOCATION	and
Francis	PERSON	of
Assisi	LOCATION	starved the flesh that they might nurture the spirit ; but
Jeanne Dare	PERSON	was abounding in physical vitality .

		The antithesis between her and her age , striking as it is , is not more remark - able than the combination of ideal motive , nat - uralness , and practical shrewdness in her char - acter . ''

		You tell us , '' said
William Aymery	PERSON	, in the preliminary examination at
Poitiers	LOCATION	, '' that God wishes to free the people of
France	LOCATION	from their distress .

		If He wishes to free them , there is no need of the soldiers you ask for . '' ''

		In God 's name / ' she rejoined , '' the men-at - arms will fight , and God will give the victory . ''

		In the assault upon
Jargeau	PERSON	, when the Duke of
Alencon	LOCATION	held back , she said to him , '' Ah , gentle duke , are you afraid ?

		Do you not know that God helps those who help themselves ? ''

		Jeanne 's keenness and wit , her sense of the ridiculous , makes her intensely human .

		There are numerous incidents , known to be true , which show this and serve to complicate the prob - lem of her character .

		A friar who believed the English report that she was of the devil , fell to crossing himself vigorously at sight of her , at which she laughed merrily .

		Believing heartily in her mission as one divine ,
Jeanne Dare	PERSON	never pretended to any miraculous power .

		For the Church as an institution she had the deepest reverence ; but the hard and worldly priest-class of the
France	LOCATION	of that day she ab - horred . ''

		My Lord has a book wherein no clerk ever read , were he never so clerkly , '' was her comment upon their pretensions .

		Her winning manner and quiet dignity never failed her un - der the most harassing circumstances .

		At the close of a long day 's session , when three and four inquisitors had exhausted themselves in seeking to entangle her , she could say with a smile , with upraised hand , as six several ques - tions leaped at her from six pairs of lips at once , '' My good lords , I beg you , one at a time . ''

		Her keenness at the trial foiled her adversaries time and again .

		Urged to give de - tails regarding the character of the vision that pointed out the king to her at
Chinon	ORGANIZATION	, she sug - gested that they might send to the king , from whom doubtless they could get answer .

		When asked if she knew she was in the grace of God , she replied , '' May God bring me into his grace if I am not in it ; if I am in it , may He keep me there . ''

		Even the examiners were filled with admiration at the answer , for the question was a dilemma : if the answer were yes , it could be construed into unholy presumption j if the answer were no , it was a confession of guilt .

		Her retaliation to this double-edged query came , when , in reply to the question whether St.
Michael	PERSON	, who appeared to her , were clothed or not , she turned it by asking , '' Do you not think that God , who taketh care of the lilies of the field and clotheth the fowls of the 354 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, air , has not the wherewithal to care for his saints ? ''

		The lips of history are not dumb like the stone lips of the sphinx , but there is a riddle in the life of Jeanne Dare not yet divulged ; the facts of her life are like letters scattered upon the ground the message is and is not . ''

		I believe that she was led by the spirit of God , and that there was in her a virtue divine and not human , '' was the comment of a lawyer who had seen her at
Orleans	LOCATION	; and human in - genuity has not added anything essential to , or taken anything essential from , this verdict from that day to this .

		After four hundred years , in spite of the attentive study of schol - ars , the inquiry of science , the devotion of ad - mirers all of whom have conspired to erect into a cult the study of the life and character of
Jeanne Dare	PERSON	, in spite of everything , all explanations are tentative and imperfect , and themselves require explanation .

		But to return to
Orleans	LOCATION	upon the
Loire	LOCATION	, the uttermost outpost of
France	LOCATION	against the English , whither
Jeanne	PERSON	bent her steps after she had received the king 's support .

		Orleans was a city of perhaps twenty thousand people , who lived in a strongly fortified territorial cir - cumscription of about one hundred acres in extent .

		* The French army , when its new leader appeared , was demoralized , an insensate rab - ble without order , deficient in respect for au - thority , lawless , brawling , licentious , and cruel .

		LaHire 's notorious witticism `` If God should turn man-at-arms , He would be a cut-throat '' accurately illustrates the moral situation .

		The coming of the Maid changed the spirit of the army .

		LaHire himself ceased to swear by anything greater than his baton .

		The morale of the army , under the fire of her enthusiasm , was refined and purged of its dross .

		Its cour - age rose in degree . ''

		Before she came , '' wrote a French chronicler , `` two hundred English - men used to chase five hundred Frenchmen ; after her coming two hundred Frenchmen used to chase four hundred English . ''

		Jeanne 's theory of the art of war was plain : to hit hard and often , a practice at variance with the desultory military methods of the time , when weeks were occupied in a languid siege .

		Or - leans was saved ; the campaign of the
Loire	LOCATION	was followed by the coronation of
Charles VII.	PERSON	, who had hitherto been , and that for eight years , only dauphin .

		Yet the mission of
Jeanne Dare	PERSON	* The proportion between population and area presented in these figures indicates that overcrowding was a problem of urban life in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	as to-day .

		was not over .

		The real end of her mission was the deliverance of
France	LOCATION	;
Orleans	LOCATION	and
Rheims	LOCATION	were means to that end .

		But the 23d of
May , 1430	DATE	that month charged with so much fatality for her * witnessed her capture before
Compiegne	LOCATION	and her surrender to the English .

		The monarchy , under control of the infamous La Tremoille , stirred not a finger in her be - half .

		Charles was apathetic .

		Even the people , save in remote corners of
France	LOCATION	, were for the most part alienated or indifferent , for when circumstances for which
Jeanne	PERSON	was in no way responsible defeated her purposes , they wagged their heads in superstitious ignorance , think - ing God had forsaken her . ''

		From the time of her capture to her death , '' these are Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's melancholy words , `` there came to
Joan	PERSON	from the king she had crowned , from the council whose orders she had obeyed , and from the captains with whom she had served , not a word or a sign .

		Except for a few of her ene - mies who came at last to pity her , she was left alone .

		She lived and died as if king and court and soldiers and the French nation had ceased to exist '' -LRB- p. 234 -RRB- .

		She had to sanctify her mission with the incense of martyrdom ere awakened
France	LOCATION	realized that the peasant girl of Domremy was the trumpet of a prophecy .

		The process by which
Jeanne	PERSON	was tried was that of the Inquisition .

		It had to be so , for , by the laws of war as they then prevailed , a prisoner was the possession of her captor , who could put her to ransom if he pleased .

		Having purchased her for ten thousand pounds , the English government could not put her to death in cold blood , for the logic of the situation re - quired that it be willing , too , to accept a ran - som for her , if proffered .

		That none came , surprised the English .

		But some pretext had to be found to render control over her complete , even unto death .

		The Church afforded that recourse .

		Where the civil authority could not reach , that of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	could .

		The guilt of heresy was the only means whereby the death penalty could be inflicted according to legal process .

		It required , however , all the learn - ing that could be mustered by doctors bred to the bar , by professors from the
University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	, and by priestcraft , to compass the life of
Jeanne Dare	ORGANIZATION	.

		We have to thank Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	for a very lucid account of the law and the pro- cedure -LRB- pp. 259-60 -RRB- .

		Hour after hour , day after day , through the long and tedious trial , *
Jeanne Dare	PERSON	raised the siege of Orleans

		THE DIAL 355 the intrepid girl foiled her enemies by the per - fect candor of her speech , or disarmed them by the shrewdness of her retort .

		But she was be - tween hammer and anvil , and could not escape , though it required the last device of the exam - iners to incriminate her . ''

		Joan had asserted that she was God 's messenger , commissioned by Him through the voice of the saints and angels .

		It was possible , to say the least , that her inspiration was from the Devil .

		Was she willing to leave the question to the Church ?

		If she refused sub - mission , her guilt was established , for to deny the au - thority of the Church was at once the commonest arid the deadliest of heresies .

		If she submitted , then the ecclesiastical tribunal before which she stood was ready to assume the functions of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and to decide the question against her '' -LRB-
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	, p. 293 -RRB- .

		But conviction alone would not satisfy her im - placable foes .

		If she died unrepentant , the French might still believe in her , and that she had been put to death unjustly .

		Torture was evidently the only means which could break the spirit of the girl who had triumphantly stood out against those trained advocates .

		Weary , deserted , heartsick , homesick , in pain of body and in mental anguish , weakened by a year 's imprisonment under brutal jailers and the strain of the trial during the fast of Lent which she had faithfully kept , the sensitive girl for with all her divine qualities she was yet a woman shrank from the white-hot brazier that with hellish ingenuity was shown to her with threats whose meaning could not be mis - taken .

		For a moment the spirit wavered ; the strain was more than nature could endure ; the flesh cried out for relief she recanted .

		But the fire was not to be at once , though it was certain .

		The Inquisition now strained its last cord in order to send her to the stake confessing the justice of her punishment !

		The end was come .

		On

Rouen	LOCATION	, the courageous spirit was released ; she was given to the fire , '' from whose arms the winds , '' as was finely said of Shelley , '' took her and shook her broad - cast to the world . ''

		Has the reader followed so far , to come only to the threshold of these works ?

		Not so .

		Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's book , in what has been written , is behind us .

		It is serious , sober-suited history , conscientiously wrought out with fullest refer - ence to sources and authorities .

		The grandeur of the theme would make the book one of ab - sorbing interest apart from the grace of the writer .

		Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	's ''
Jeanne d'Arc	PERSON	'' -LRB- the reader will please forgive the three several forms of spelling her name -RRB- is rather a literary history .

		It is a gracefully written and sym - pathetic biography of the Maid .

		It will afford interesting reading for those who are fond of knowing results rather than processes , but the profit will be slight compared to that to be de - rived from reading Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	.

		Of the '' Rec - ollections of the Sieur Louis de Conte '' so much can not be said .

		As intimated , it can not claim that protection too often afforded the `` historical '' novel , for it has not the novel form it is without plot , while the pretension to be history makes it amenable to the criti - cisms to which historical writing must always be subjected .

		To be plain ,
Mark Twain	PERSON	, like Tennyson in '' The Princess , '' has made a gor - geous failure .

		The theme was too perfect to be marred by recourse to fiction .

		Moreover , by adopting the method he has , he has been forced to commit himself in places in which the cautious historian would hold judgment in abeyance .

		This was inevitable , for the '' Recol - lections '' are supposed to be the spontaneous outpouring of a heart devoted to her cause .

		But there are evidences that this spontaneity has been labored .

		Jeanne at times moralizes like a philosopher , as witness this nice bit of casuistry in a peas - ant lass : '' The Sieur
Bertrand	PERSON	was amused at
Joan	PERSON	's naive way of referring to her advice as if it had been a val - uable present to a hostile leader who was saved by it from making a censurable blunder of omission , and then he went on to admire how ingeniously she had deceived that man and yet had not told him anything that was not the truth .

		This troubled
Joan	PERSON	, and she said : '' ' I thought he was deceiving himself .

		I f orebore to tell him lies , for that would have been wrong ; but if my truths deceived him , perhaps that made them lies . ' ''

		She was assured that she had done right , and that in the perils and necessities of war deceptions that help one 's own cause and hurt the enemy 's were always per - missible ... Jean -LRB- her brother -RRB- said : ''
Joan	PERSON	, you told us yourself that you were going to
Uncle Laxart	LOCATION	's to nurse his wife , but you did n't say you were going further , yet you did go on to Vaucoleurs .

		There ! ' '' '

		I see now , ' said
Joan	PERSON	, sorrowfully , ' I told no lie , yet I deceived ... But the thing itself was right , and I would do it again ! '

		It seemed an over-nice distinc - tion , but nobody said anything '' -LRB- pp. 92-3 -RRB- .

		The Sieur de
Conte	ORGANIZATION	, too , attempts the phil - osophy of history , in a simple narrative , and that of the fifteenth century : * '
Joan	PERSON	was
France	LOCATION	, the spirit of
France	LOCATION	made flesh .

		That was a humble eye to see so great a truth where others failed ... And yet , after all , it was just what such natures do .

		When they love a great and noble thing , they embody it they want it so that they can see it with their eyes ; like Liberty , for instance -LRB- Verily , the French Revolution in
1492	DATE	-RRB- .

		They are not content with the cloudy abstract idea '' -LRB- p. 174 -RRB- .

		This edifying commentary upon the corona - tion might be a page from a history of
1789	DATE	: '' Of all the wise people in high office in
France	LOCATION	, only one knew the priceless worth of this neglected prize ... How did she know it ?

		It is simple : she was a peasant .

		That tells the whole story .

		She was of the people and knew the people ; those others moved in a loftier sphere and knew nothing much about them .

		We make little account of that vague , formless , inert mass , that mighty underlying force which we call ' the people ' an epi - thet which carries contempt with it .

		It is a strange attitude ; for at bottom we know that the throne which the people support stands , and that when that support is removed , nothing in the world can save it . ''

		How many popular revolutions can
Mark Twain	PERSON	point out in the Middle Ages ?

		For a monarchy built up , not on popular right , but on privilege , flanked by princes and barons instead of '' the people , '' the French monarchy was a pretty stable affair , since it lasted from 987 to
1789	DATE	.

		Page 89 presents us with so absurd a situation that , remembering
Mark Twain	PERSON	's former writ - ings , one laughs at once .

		Jeanne , while leading her little band through the forest at night , in the darkness stumbles upon some English sol - diers .

		A colloquy ensues between the English commander and
Jeanne	PERSON	, who has been mis - taken for an English trooper ; and
Jeanne	PERSON	, whose knowledge of the French language was not larger than the dialect of

		without betray - ing her identity .

		There are other evidences that the
Sieur Louis	LOCATION	de Conte must have experienced re - incarnation in
1835	DATE	.

		Such phrases as '' Tours was a humming town '' ; '' he went on pouring out a most pathetic stream , ... which broke Joan all up '' are unmistak - able American parlance .

		Criticism may not conclude here .

		As
Jeanne	PERSON	's page and secre - tary professes to be writing history , and espe - cially since the `` translator '' gives an extended list of authorities '' examined in verification of the truth of this narrative , '' that history must be judged by the dicta of historical literature .

Charles VI	PERSON	.

		The Battle of the Herrings was fought upon
February 12 , 1429	DATE	, and not two days later -LRB- p. 75 -RRB- .

		More - over , there is next to no proof that
Jeanne	PERSON	prophesied this event that is a fabrication of later days , an observation which the '' trans - lator '' should have made in a warning note .

		At
Chinon	ORGANIZATION	, '' several weeks '' -LRB- p. 107 -RRB- did not elapse , but only a few days , before
Jeanne	PERSON	saw
Charles	PERSON	; and the commission to inquire into her early life was not sent into
Lorraine	PERSON	until the investigation instituted at
Poitiers	LOCATION	.


Jeanne	PERSON	's premonitions of capture did not come a full year -LRB- p. 216 -RRB- before her taking at
Compicgue	ORGANIZATION	.

		Our knowledge of this fact is based on her own testimony ; the time between prophecy and ful - filment was not over two months .

		But the greatest blunder is made when the honor of selecting
Richemont	ORGANIZATION	for constable of
France	LOCATION	is ascribed to her -LRB- pp. 259-60 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	, too , has not wholly escaped er - rors , but they are of minor importance and concern
Jeanne Dare	PERSON	in no particular save once .

		The exception has reference to her cap - ture .

		It is probable

		MORAL AND RELIGIOUS EVOLUTION AT ANPOVER .

		* Professor
Harris	PERSON	, of
Andover Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	, has given us , in his work on '' Moral Evolution , '' a noble and notable contribution to the religious thought and life of
America	LOCATION	.

		The scope is comprehensive , embracing the essential principles and intimate relations of science , ethics , and religion .

		The spirit is pre - eminently sane and catholic .

		Nothing crude or narrow or intemperate disfigures these pages .

		There is great clearness of thought , without dogmatism ; deep earnestness , but freedom from intolerance ; a glad acceptance of science , and yet no surrender of the commanding truths of religion .

		The widest hospitality toward the revelation now unfolding is linked with an his - torical appreciation that makes us always rev - erent of the past , though not slaves to its wor - thies .

		An abundant learning shines through , but does not encumber , these discussions of vast themes .

		The author has evidently read widely and meditated at length upon the varied topics which he treats ; but instead of asking us to travel with him along all those weary and winding paths , he gives us , in short , clear , sug - gestive sentences , the discovery which he made by the way or the conclusion which he reached at the end .

		The literary method of the work is as satisfactory as its general temper .

		A fluent stream of discourse bears us onward through a varied landscape , always distinctly seen , and constantly opening into fresh views of truth and duty , both instructive and interesting .

		No attempt is here made to reconcile science and religion after the manner of the crude car - pentry of a quarter of a century ago ; and still , throughout these chapters , these realms lie be - fore us , not as rival , nor even as separate king - * MORAL EVOLUTION .

		doms , but as different phases of divine verities .

		Professor
Harris	PERSON	fearlessly carries the scientific method over into the region of piety , assuming that reverence will build an altar wherever the torch of discovery lights up the universe .

		He boldly appropriates for the service of religion every new truth that the scientist reveals , claim - ing that the more we really know the prof ounder must be our worship and the ampler our phil - anthropy .

		And everywhere he brings out the ethical import of facts and insists upon a more ethical ministry of the church , holding that knowledge must be made fruitful in human worth and that theology must make the moral law central .

		We have , therefore , a discussion that is com - pletely emancipated from the old apologetic tone , and yet it is a treatment of a great sub - ject that makes powerfully for a noble recon - ciliation , leaving both thought and worship free .

		While the teaching is lifted far above the petty preachments of small moralists , every sentence glows with an ethical passion which commu - nicates to the reader the enthusiasm of human - ity .

		And though cast in a mould very different from that of dogmatic theology , this is never - theless a discourse upon God , which leads us to find his presence in all facts , and to trace his ways , with the glow of wonder and worship , through all the manifold affairs of humanity .

		Withal , it is a plea for a religion that shall be rational and humane ; for a theology that shall be ethical and practical ; for an application of science that shall fruit in philanthropic service ; and for an interpretation of our ethical life that shall make it the human expression , through the method of evolution , of what is es - sential in
Universal Being	ORGANIZATION	.

		After some brief but pertinent remarks re - specting the misuse of the term '' Evolution , '' Professor
Harris	PERSON	traces the various bearings upon the problem of ethics of the great mod - ern discovery which this word represents .

		He criticises both Professor Huxley and Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	, holding , against the former , that the ethical law and life are included within the cosmical process ; and against the latter , that our spir - itual life is essentially rational .

		Ethics and evolution , he claims , are neither identical nor antagonistic , but moral sentiment unfolds in harmony with the general evolution of the cos - mos , and ethical principles come to expression in humanity through a process of evolution which is an essential part of the unfolding of the universe .

		The individual plays a large part in this eth - 358 -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, ical process ; and just because of this fact -LRB- which recent writers have been inclined to overlook -RRB- , `` self-realization '' is as divine an obligation as '' altruism . ''

		Here we have a needed corrective of what is unwise in ex - treme phases of socialism .

		While '' sympathy '' makes the community possible , '' self-love '' is just as necessary to build up individuals with - out whom there can be no prosperous or pro- gressive community .

		It is here that Professor
Harris	PERSON	makes his most original and valuable contribution to the discussion of ethics .

		He contends : '' The truth is that self-realization is as moral as altruism '' -LRB- p. 133 -RRB- .

		His survey and criticism of different ethical theories is interesting though brief , but his emphasis upon '' self - realization '' brings into prominence a somewhat neglected phase of moral truth ; and though he will probably meet with opposition at this point , there is so much of practical wis - dom in his words , and the spirit playing through them is so sober and thoughtful , that it is well worth while to have this forcible and suggestive presentation .

		Following this discussion of the rootage and character of ethical principles in general , Pro- fessor
Harris	PERSON	devotes the next seven chapters -LRB- VIII.-XIV . -RRB-

		to an application of these truths to religion .

		And this complicated subject he treats in a broad and forward-looking spirit .

		He brings religion and morality into close as - sociation , tracing the reactions of each upon the other .

		Religion flows into morality as in - spiration and motive power , while morality be - comes the test and fruitage of religion .

		The thought of God is given in our experience of nature : '' That which is intelligible has intel - ligence in it '' -LRB- p. 185 -RRB- .

		The love of God as the '' Good '' springs from our experience with human nature : '' The moral order , as observed in history , is a divine order '' -LRB- p. 191 -RRB- .

		The Christian ideal is described , both as a personal estate and as a social order , a plea being made for the use of the term '' Christian Ethics '' -LRB- following
Dorner	PERSON	and also
Smyth	PERSON	-RRB- , which seems far from wise , while a protest is made against overworking the idea of '' the kingdom of heaven , '' which , though an inspiring phrase , is not an exhaustive description of Christianity .

		The chapter on `` Degeneration , '' not very germane , and certainly inadequate as an exam - ination of the problem of moral evil , is followed by a longer discussion of the regeneration of the individual and of society .

		It is graciously admitted that regeneration is a process far wider than
Christendom	LOCATION	, while this process is defined with no reference to that supernatural - ism by which theologians so long obscured a spiritual awakening native to man as a man .

		Some conservative observations are devoted to economic methods and agencies , with a plea that the ethical element be more largely recog - nized , both in theory and practice .

		Judicious but brief remarks are made upon the Family , Democracy , and the Public Schools , especially as they contribute to that moral evolution which works itself out as personal and social regen - eration .

		While insisting upon the necessarily secular but not irreligious character of the com - mon school , the very obvious but often neglected truth is stated : '' It is inconsistent with our principles for the state to assume religious functions '' -LRB- p. 388 -RRB- .

		The last two chapters of the book are occu - pied with a discussion of the modifications in theology made inevitable by the new views re - specting both ethics and evolution .

		A few quo - tations very significant when we consider that they emanate from a professor in
Andover	LOCATION	Theological Seminary indicate how Professor
Harris	PERSON	interprets the trend and quality of mod - ern religious thought .

		It is very truly said : '' The centre of doctrine has been shifting from sovereignty to fatherhood .

		It is believed that power is directed by reason , and reason by love '' -LRB- p. 401 -RRB- .

		Revelation is described very broadly : '' Revelation and evolution are two sides of one and the same reality .

		... It is a mistaken view of revela - tion which sees in it only intervention ; only an excep - tional and disconnected breaking in upon orderly move - ment ... Revelation is not by occasional stroke , but by a continuous process .

		It is not superimposed , but in - herent ... All realities , then , are revelations .

		Nature , humanity , and genius , which is the epitome of human - ity , are embodiments of divine truth , goodness , and beauty '' -LRB- pp. 411 , 414 , 415 -RRB- .

		In setting forth the claim that Christianity is preeminently an ethical religion , whose gospel as proclaimed by Jesus himself made personal righteousness central , this condemnation is passed upon teachings still all too popular : '' Some evangelistic and revivalistic preaching in effect represents salvation as independent of character '' -LRB- p. 397 -RRB- .

		The old traditional theory of the atonement is criticised in these words : '' Until recently the usual representations of atone - ment were justly open to the charge of immorality .

		Even now , such representations continue to be made to a considerable degree .

		The moral sense is shocked at some of the reasons given for atonement .

		The impu - tation of our sins to Christ has been so stated that it seemed as if all regard for righteousness had been over - looked .

		The penal suffering of Christ was regarded as the philosophy of atonement .

		It was believed that God
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 359 laid on Christ the penalty of our sins , or a suffering equivalent to that penalty ... This disappearing theory fails to satisfy because it is immoral , because it places salvation somewhere else than in character , be - cause it converts the sympathy and love of Christ into legal fictions , because it places the ethical demands of justice above the ethical necessities of love '' -LRB- p. 407 -RRB- .

		It is strongly urged that the old interpretation of providence , which consigned millions to per - dition , is immoral : '' Still another immoral conception of God is that which represents him as leaving vast multitudes of his children to perish or to sink into hopeless perdition with - out giving them the truth which can save them ... The moral sense revolts from such an idea .

		Few preach - ers and theologians can now be found who believe that the masses of heathendom are eternally lost .

		From the logic of the premise that the earthly life is decisive of the destiny of all men , escape is sought in various ways ; as , that all souls have the essential Christ , that multi - tudes of heathen are renewed in character before death and only need the sunlight of
Christ	ORGANIZATION	's presence to de - velop those seeds of holy character which have already begun to germinate .

		These lame devices show that the conception of God is changing '' -LRB- p. 402 -RRB- .

		To the present reviewer , the least satisfac - tory part of this most hopeful and interesting volume is that devoted to the person of Jesus .

		There is everywhere most admirable candor and absolute freedom from dogmatism .

		It is delightful to read an author who , besides being just to opponents , is still a seeker for truth , and holds his views subject to revision .

		He readily admits that many beliefs about Jesus , once asserted as necessary to salvation , are no part of essential Christianity .

		Professor
Harris	PERSON	does indeed bring Jesus a long way out of the mists of tradition into the light of his - tory .

		A vast amount of supernaturalism is stripped off by this short sentence : '' The power of Jesus resides in his own character of good - ness '' -LRB- p. 304 -RRB- .

		The limitation of Jesus is freely admitted : '' In knowledge he was not om - niscient .

		He gained information as other men did .

		He shared the opinions of his time as to the universe , and in other essential respects was truly human .

		He had wonderful insight , but did not have omniscience '' -LRB- p. 404 -RRB- .

		It is noted with gladness that recently a radical change has occurred in the world 's thought of Jesus : '' The change has amounted to a recov - ery of his humanity '' -LRB- p. 403 -RRB- .

		This change is welcomed as a step forward : '' He is be - lieved in as a human incarnation and revela - tion of the God of holy love .

		This is a marked instance of the moral evolution of theology '' -LRB- p. 404 -RRB- .

		The miracles in general are looked upon with some uncertainty , and are considered at best as '' secondary in importance . ''

		The belief in the resurrection is admitted to be at - tended with grave difficulties ; while the virgin birth , though not denied , is not regarded as an essential doctrine of Christianity .

		Here is pro- gress indeed , but not that clearness of vision that would result from a frank acceptance of the existence of legendary elements in the Gos - pels , which is the position of the best Biblical scholarship of the day .

		THE HELLENISTIC EMPIRE ix
EGYPT	LOCATION	.

		* Mr.
Mahaffy	PERSON	's very able work on '' The Em - pire of the Ptolemies '' will be warmly wel - comed by every student of that great and fascinating Hellenistic world , created by the conquests of Alexander , which brought into their most intimate contact the civilizations of
Asia	LOCATION	and the Nile valley on the one hand , and of
Europe	LOCATION	on the other .

		For the first time in the world 's history , continental and race dis - tinctions are at this period effectually broken up ; the student feels that he is surveying the combined history of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	coun - tries and their neighbors , irrespective of geo - graphical lines or linguistic affinities .

		For the student of that
Europe	LOCATION	which finally emerged from this great inter-continental commingling , it is of vital importance to understand fully the complicated contact by which so much of ori - ental civilization was absorbed into western cul - ture .

		Nowhere in the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	basin can this phase of the Hellenistic period be studied so favorably as at
Alexandria	LOCATION	.

		Here the in - tense religious feeling of the orient , the highest level of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	achievement in industries , art , and architecture , in politics , typical oriental despotism , the best learning of the East in law , science , and religion , including that of the Jews , in fine , all the elements of the incalculably ancient civilization of the
East	LOCATION	, are found side by side and in daily contact with the complex life of cultivated
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The
Nile	ORGANIZATION	valley has preserved to us documentary and monumental remains of all this , as they have never been elsewhere preserved .

		The results of a study of these survivals are for the most part to be found only in learned and bulky treatises , quite inaccessible to the ordinary reader .

		Mr.
Mahaffy	PERSON	has therefore done great service in furnishing a scholarly and at the same time very readable account of the * THB EMPIRE OF THE PTOLEMIES .

		360 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, Ptolemaic or Hellenistic domination in
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		Besides his eminent fitness for the task as a scholar , Mr.
Mahaffy	PERSON	has enjoyed unusual priv - ileges in the study of the most recently discov - ered Greek papyri , which have often come di - rectly into his hands from the spade of the excavator in
Egypt	LOCATION	, as , for example , those unearthed by Mr.
Petrie	PERSON	.

		These papyri are of the greatest interest , and afford us glimpses of the life of the people such as are rarely to be found in the writings of the Greek or Roman historians .

		Sometimes it is a bill , again a deed , now a receipt , or it may be the court rec - ord of a lawsuit ; but out of it all we are grad - ually gaining a picture of the life of the com - mon people in the
Egypt	LOCATION	of a few centuries before and after Christ .

		The history of the Ptolemies is perhaps the most difficult to unravel in all the
Grseco	LOCATION	-
Koman	PERSON	world .

		It swarms with unsolved prob - lems ; and often , at the most interesting junc - ture , the paucity of materials , or their complete failure , preclude any safe conclusion .

		More - over , it is a new field .

		As Mr.
Mahaffy	PERSON	says in his preface : '' The writer on Ptolemaic history feels himself in some sort a pioneer , who is liable to be baulked by unexpected ob - stacles , misled by ardent expectations , diverted from his path by .

		false informations .

		Yet are all these risks and dangers unable to outweigh the intense interest of penetrating a country either unexplored or imperfectly described by former travellers . ''

		It must be said that the author has shown notable skill in meeting the unusual difficulties of his task .

		Of course , he owes much to his German predecessors in the same field ; but it is evident that he is quite master of his material , and capable of independ - ent judgment , even when he follows his Ger - man authorities rather closely .

		In one notable respect he is much superior to the Germans , and that is in the charming style which he commands .

		His history never degenerates into an arid chronicle .

		This is due to the nature of the man , but also to the fact that wherever his classic sources flow scantily he is able to fill out a meagre chronicle of political events with a vivid picture of the life of the times , taken from the welcome Greek papyri with which he is enviably familiar .

		The work is so largely concerned with in - volved detail , with complex political and gov - ernmental problems , that it is impossible to offer any epitome of the ground covered .

		A few points where the author 's conclusion may be open to question should , however , be noted .

		In writing on the first Ptolemy , Mr.
Mahaffy	PERSON	uses
Brugsch	ORGANIZATION	's translation , made twenty-five years ago , of the well-known hieroglyphic in - scription dating from the seventh year of the young Alexander .

		This translation is obsolete and very inaccurate .

		Its inaccuracy has affected the author 's conclusion on a very important point .

		He is inclined to think that it was as late as 305 B. C. before
Ptolemy I.	PERSON	`` formally called himself king '' -LRB- p. 58 -RRB- ; but in the second line of the above inscription
Ptolemy	PERSON	is referred to as '' king '' -LRB- Coptic owro -RRB- , which Brugsch has given its older meaning , '' great satrap , '' no longer conceivable at this late date .

		Moreover , in line eight of the inscription -LRB- and in other places -RRB-
Ptolemy	LOCATION	is referred to as '' his majesty . ''

		Now this is at least five years earlier than 305
B. C. However	PERSON	, the bulk of the material is in
Greek	LOCATION	, and it is not often that the author is obliged to take his translations at second hand .

		In the main , he has handled his purely Egyp - tian sources very well . ''

		Chem '' -LRB- p. 70 -RRB- is a mistake from
Murray	PERSON	's guide-book , and is given correctly '' Chnum '' on p. 489 .

		`` Hatasu '' -LRB- pp .

		128-9 and 387 -RRB- is apparently an error so deeply rooted that it will take another genera - tion to correct it .

		On p. 387 we have ''
Dayr	PERSON	- el-Medineh , '' but on p. 272 it was '' Deyr . ''

		We do not understand the reference to
Alex	PERSON	- andria -LRB- p. 77 -RRB- as being a hundred miles dis - tant from the
Fayum	LOCATION	.

		Even the shortest air - line across the desert is one hundred and twenty miles .

		The author 's conjecture -LRB- p. 273 -RRB- , in opposi - tion to
Diodorus	LOCATION	, that the Nubian king Er - gameiies was contemporary with
Ptolemy IV.	PERSON	, finds brilliant confirmation in the recent exca - vations at
Philae	LOCATION	.


Herr Borchardt	PERSON	writes me from the first cataract , that they have discov - ered , on
Philae	LOCATION	, a temple in which the name of the Nubian Ergamenes occurs together with that of the fourth
Ptolemy	PERSON	.

		On the whole , the author shows an evident inclination to idealise the Ptolemies , a tendency in which he is distinctly at variance with the Germans .

		Undue weight seems to be given to any indication of noble qualities in any mem - ber of the family .

		Nevertheless , this is one of the charms of the book , and undoubtedly the most readable passages in the treatise are those in which the fair side of the picture is presented .

		Especially admirable are the accounts of the institutions of
Alexandria	LOCATION	founded and main - tained by the Ptolemies for the cultivation of Greek literature and learning .

		Although so much remains to be done in this field , although

		THE DIAL 361 much is discovered every year , nevertheless Mr.
Mahaffy	PERSON	's book will long remain the standard work upon the Ptolemaic period for the scholar or the man of letters , and will be permanently useful even to the specialist .

		Its usefulness is much enhanced by a full chronological table and a complete index .

		The classical scholar will welcome the Greek text of the Decree of Canopus and the stone of
Eosette	LOCATION	, with critical notes .

		The typographical work is excellent , and externally the book shows the best of work - manship .

		BOOKS ABOUT BOOKS .

		* Voltaire made a most unfortunate observation when he said that rare books are worth nothing , since if they are worth anything they would not be rare .

		We know better nowadays ; or , at least , we may easily learn better if we will read some of the nu - merous books lately issued dealing with the facts or the philosophy of rarity in books .

		At the outset , we must be brave enough to ignore
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's im - plied reproach of those who seek a book for other reasons than its literary or human interest , and must admit without shame that we do care for the so-called '' externals '' of a book the binding , style , date , and the story of its individual existence .

		If we can - not enter into sympathy with
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, and his exquisite story of the book which he so coveted that for its sake the old brown suit was made to hang on six weeks longer ; if we can not understand why it is that it is never the ninety and nine treatises which a bibliomaniac has , but the hundredth which he has not , that entrances his mind and fires his ambition , filling him with the opium-eater 's bliss without the opium-eater 's bale then the gates of ex-libris land are probably barred against us for - ever .

		But if we do kindle at the thought of a '' first edition , '' if we do seek to know something of the principles of this noble industry and royal sport of book-hunting , which is as old as literature itself , the means of knowing are at hand .

		The novice , one who has not mastered so much as the technical phrases and terminology , will find just the authority the primer of the subject in Mr.
Brander Mattbews	PERSON	's recent work on '' Bookbindings Old and New . ''

		There he will learn the meaning and see tbe illustration of what are called , in book - * BOOKBINDINGS OLD AND NEW .

Sanderson	PERSON	, '' or by other names with which later study continually will bring him in contact ; will be shown the causes why bookbinding in the nineteenth century , while improving as a handicraft , has declined as an art , and in
America	LOCATION	has been retarded by causes outside of art .

		The great beauty of all the early bindings is in the lavish and tasteful ornamentation of the sides .

		In the early days of printing , and when the tradi - tions of manuscripts still were dominant , the shelves of a library inclined like a reading-desk , and the handsome volumes lay on their sides , taking their ease .

		Instead of being packed together on level shelves with only the backs visible , each stately tome stood forth singly , and the broad sides of the ample folios seemed to invite decoration .

		The chapters dealing with '' extra binding '' the covering of a single volume in accord with the fancy of the owner of that one book occupy about half of Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	's work , and are followed by equally lucid and profitable chapters on the more prosaic subjects of '' Commercial Bookbinding , '' '' Books in Paper Covers , '' and `` The
Grolier Club	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		The story of this
New York	LOCATION	club , named after a book-lover and collector who was born before this continent was discovered , is one of great interest .

		Its constitution declares that '' its object shall be the literary study and promotion of the arts pertaining to the production of books . ''

		That is to say , the
Grolier Club	ORGANIZATION	is interested in books , not as literature , but as works of art .

		Although many of its mem - bers are scholars and students of literature , it is with the art and mystery of the book-maker , the printer , the engraver , and the binder , and not with the secrets of authorship , that they concern them - selves ; as a result the
Grolier Club	ORGANIZATION	has established a standard of formal excellence in bibliography higher and more exacting than any now existing in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The reader will be specially grateful for the magnificence and abundance of the illustrations , presenting , as they do , examples of every form of the art from its earliest beginnings to the paper covers of the latest American magazine .

		As an equipment in the principles which govern the practice of book-buying , one may be referred to an essay on '' The Philosophy of Rarity , '' by Mr.
G. H. Powell	PERSON	the first and longest of the essays composing the volume called '' Excursions in
Libra	LOCATION	- ria . ''

		The '' philosophy '' here expounded is the craft and '' venerie '' of the book-hunter .

		It distin - guishes between different classes of books of which '' some are born rare , some achieve rarity , and some have rarity thrust upon them . ''

		Volumes of , so to speak , native rarity are those printed in relatively remote places , in small quan - 362 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, titles -LRB- either owing to the expense of production or peculiarity of the subject , or merely for the sake of the consequent rarity -RRB- , or at private presses .

		The collector who values books according to the locality of their origin will do well to have at his fingers ' ends the various dates at which printing was intro - duced into the different capitals and countries of the world , the degrees by which
Italy	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
the Netherlands	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	fall behind Ger - many , the more distant countries , the
East	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, coming of course later still ; for all these , the standard of rarity on account of place and date has to be shifted proportionately .

		Of the books which , though produced in plenty , have been reduced to rarity by recent demand , notable examples are the first editions of modern romances , which of late years have formed the chief big game of
London	LOCATION	booksellers .

		Artistic beauty of any kind is inevit - ably at a premium .

		Comparatively few modern pro- ductions , even when printed by hand on hand-made paper , are as attractive as the commonest manual or treatise of the fifteenth century .

		The volumes which composed the
Grolier	ORGANIZATION	library of three hun - dred years ago are now treated as veritable works of art ; they have their catalogue , like the pictures of a great painter or the plates of a great engraver , and are numbered .

		Erery existing book bound for
Grolier	ORGANIZATION	has its pedigree , and is traced lovingly from catalogue to catalogue of the great collectors .

		The rarity that is '' achieved '' results in a some - what fanciful and fluctuating form of value , being affected by artificial diminution of the supply , as by destructions through fire , invading armies , and like calamities , in some cases also by destructions through exceeding popularity .

		The plunder of the
Pisistra	LOCATION	- tian collection by Xerxes ; the burning of one-half of the Alexandrian library by the soldiers of
Julius Caesar	PERSON	, and of the other half some seven hundred years later by the
Khalif Omar	PERSON	; the ravages of the Goths , and of the French , Spanish , and German invaders of
Italy	LOCATION	, and scores of other mediaeval calamities , these and later accidents and crimes have swelled the tale of valuable books which are no more , or exist only in such quantity as to be prac - tically introuvable .

		Mr.
Powell	PERSON	suggests that the librarian of
King Osymandias	PERSON	, whose collection was formed , we are told , '' less than four centuries after the Flood , '' might have been able to tell us some - thing of the literature already known to be destroyed at that date !

		We are not to assume that high-priced catalogues , or auction duels terminating in rounds of applause , are things belonging to the nineteenth century .

		This first of libraries possibly possessed some priceless relic which the
Brunet	PERSON	of the day would have described as '' Ouvrage assez ancien ; Exemplaire portant 1 ` autographe de Japhet ; Quel - qties feuilles mouillees par le Deluge '' Of books that '' have rarity thrust upon them , '' the most conspicuous are those which , by rising to the high-water mark of the free thought of the age , have been persecuted or summarily suppressed by authority , bigotry , or high-placed corruption .

		One of the rarest books in existence is the tract of Ser - vetus entitled
Christianismi Restitutio	PERSON	, of which only one copy is known now to exist , nearly all the edition having been burned with the author , at the instigation of his former friend ,
Calvin	PERSON	, in
1558	DATE	; and next might come the same author 's three tracts on the
Trinity	LOCATION	, printed in italics ,
1532	DATE	.

		A work of which only two or three copies are said to be known is the
Cymbalum Mundi	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1537 -RRB- .

		Every kind of shocking impiety was long attributed to the author , till at last it occurred to one eminent bibliographer of the last century to read the book , which he ac - cordingly did , and found it of quite depressing pro- priety .

		During the interesting period of the revival of learning and thought , ecclesiastical damnation came to confer upon the volumes it honored a sort of hall - mark of excellence , or at least of candor and orig - inality , and the most select catalogue of books or - dered '' to be burnt by the common hangman '' would be very long indeed .

		Thus , often , bibliography be - comes a very material part of history .

		Many indeed are the books whose appearance marks the accession of something far more important than king or queen , nay of that which often may destroy kings , queens , and existing conventions generally , to-wit , a new idea .

		The final ripening of scientific conclusions , the impatient outbursts of long-shackled humor and good sense , the explosions of oppressed suffering , and the exultant happiness of peace and secured civilization all these leave their mark in the rec - ords of bibliography , and are more important and more interesting than all the official Acts of Sov - ereigns and States .

		Mr.
W. Roberts	PERSON	's small volume on '' Rare Books and their Prices '' ought to rebuke all who scorn the enthusiasm of the collector .

		Here , the antiquity of collecting is shown to be almost as great as that of the world itself , and the spirit of the collector to have undergone but little change during the
last two thousand years	DATE	.

		The list of collectors in ancient
Rome	LOCATION	includes many illustrious names , e. g. , Sallust the historian , in whose garden the Dying Gladiator was found ;
Asinus Pollio	PERSON	, the orator , poet , histo - rian , and friend of
Augustus	PERSON	, who once owned the Toro Farnese , now at
Naples	LOCATION	; whilst even
Anthony	PERSON	and
Brutus	PERSON	stand before the world clearly convicted of the hobby for collecting .

		The collecting instinct being more or less deeply grained in human nature , the difference between the boy who accumulates postage stamps or letter-heads and the man who collects books or pictures is simply a difference of taste and of money , and not of spirit .

		Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	takes up the subject in the four departments of Books , Pictures , Pottery and Porcelain , and Post - age Stamps .

		For notable acquisitions in any of these fields , nothing is plainer than that one has need to be as rich as
Croesus	ORGANIZATION	, or the person typified as the '' Chi - cago pork-butcher . ''

		To speak of books alone , we are told of one volume , the Psalmorum Codex , printed by
Fust	ORGANIZATION	and Schseff er in
1459	DATE	, which brought
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 363 the extraordinary sum of
4950	DATE	.

		This is the high - est price ever paid for a single book , and it is un - doubtedly the grandest specimen of typographic art in existence .

		It is the second book printed with a date .

		The very first works of the earliest printers have never been excelled in the beauty of their ex - ecution , and they will for all time stand as an incen - tive as well as a reproach to modern printers .

		The editions of the English Bible printed during the
earlier half of the sixteenth century	DATE	maintain high prices , but anything like a fair comparison is difficult , as the copies which have come under the hammer during the last fifty years vary much in the degree to which they are imperfect .

		The theory that reading a book sometimes becomes a deadly sin , assumes , in the eyes of a collector , a very prac - tical form in connection with the early English Bibles .

		The Bible 's extreme popularity with our forefathers , as a book to read , makes perfect copies extremely rare .

		An absolutely complete example would probably bring over 1000 .

		Of the publications of
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	,
England	LOCATION	's first printer , there are about 560 examples in existence .

		The highest sum ever paid for a
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	is
1950	DATE	, the book being the Harleian copy of '' King Arthur '' -LRB- the only perfect copy known -RRB- , and the purchaser -LCB- '' unfortunately , and to the lasting disgrace of En - gland , '' according to Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , an American collector , Mrs. Pope .

		The works of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, so far as the original quartos and folios are concerned , yield to no other in their advance in price among book-fanciers .

		At the time of publication , the quartos sold for a few pence .

		Now they sometimes realize between 300 and 400 .

		Of the first folio , a matchless copy is priced by a bookseller at
1200	DATE	.

		The attraction of a first edition over the second or subsequent issues falls into the category of things which are ffot explainable on ordinary prin - ciples .

		A writer in the '' Speaker '' has described the '' mania '' for first editions as a '' purely spirit - ual joy , '' and , as with all spiritual joys , the expe - rience thereof is a thing of feeling and not of argu - ment .

		The first editions of
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	realize very high prices when they possess the printed covers and the advertisements of the orig - inal parts .

		To the lay mind , a tastefully bound vol - ume offers attractions not possessed by a set of '' parts '' in their dingy wrappers ; but not so to the collector .

		The '' Poems by
Two Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, '' as issued in
1827	DATE	, in boards and with a paper label at the back , costs ten times as much as the most beautiful - complete modern edition of
Tennyson	LOCATION	; and a set of the latest complete edition of
Browning	PERSON	's works , substantially bound , in all sixteen volumes , costs less than a single copy of '' Bells and Pomegranates '' in the original parts .

		The outward and visible mark of the citizenship of the book-lover is his book-plate .

		To have a book - plate gives a collector great serenity and self-confi - dence , since few borrowers will have the temerity to ask for the loan of a volume dignified by a book - plate .

		To the list of authorities in this branch of art must now be added
Norna Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	, who writes of '' Ladies ' Book-plates '' in a beautiful and elabo - rately illustrated volume .

		The aim of the work is to trace the history of women 's plates , and to give some account of those ex-libris which seem to call for spe - cial attention , either from the interest attached to their owners or for the intrinsic merit of the designs .

		The plates of men and women ought to be essen - tially different .

		A spinster bears her paternal arms on a lozenge ; a married woman bears her paternal arms impaled with those of her husband on a shield , or if she is an heiress , or co-heiress , her husband marshals them upon his shield charged as an es - cutcheon of pretence ; a widow bears the same , but on a lozenge instead of a shield .

		Men continually adorn their plates with the figure of a woman , but women have seldom returned the compliment .

		The modern book-plate is commonly a pictorial effort to describe in one small vignette the varied tastes of the owner and the miscellaneous contents of the volumes of his library .

		Rumor has it that the inev - itable bicycle has even made its appearance upon a lady 's book-plate .

		Incongruous as this seems for a library , possibly the fleet wheels might serve as symbol of the swift flight of time when a book is the companion .

		Delightful as one may find it to linger in the realms of the four books we have discussed , yet for - tunate indeed is it that no one need be unhappy if debarred from the luxuries and splendors which they describe .

		For is not a happiness still greater to be found in a small working library where the books are well selected and thoughtfully arranged in accordance with one central code of taste , and may be consulted respectfully at any moment by the master of their destinies ?

		Even so genuine a book - lover and ardent a collector as
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	has declared : '' If fortune made me possessor of a book of excessive value , I should hasten to part with it .

		In a little working library , to hold a first quarto of ` Hamlet ' would be like entertaining a reigning monarch in a small farmhouse at harvesting . ''

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Froude 's '' Lectures on the
Council Fronde	ORGANIZATION	's lecturet o f Trent '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- were delivered on the Reformation .

		.

		\ . '

		- , , in 1892-3 , forming the first of three courses delivered during the eighteen months in which Mr.
Froude	PERSON	was in residence at
Oxford	LOCATION	as
Regius Professor of Modern History	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two of these courses , the lectures on Erasmus and on the English Seamen of the
Sixteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, have already been published .

		It is to be regretted that Mr.
Froude	PERSON	was not able to supervise the preparation of the present volume , as he would doubtless have im - proved it by some pruning and reshaping , and espe - cially by the addition of references to his authorities .

		The lectures , which are now printed substantially 864
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
June 1 $	DATE	, as they originally stood , were addressed to varying audiences of students , and hence contain more or less iteration of leading facts and insistence on ele - mental principles which , however well adapted to class-room exposition , may seem superfluous to the reader .

		But the book is of course extremely read - able and suggestive .

		It would have been next to impossible for Mr.
Froude	PERSON	to be trite or dull on any subject ; and in the Reformation he had a theme to stimulate to the utmost the peculiar pungency of his trenchant pen .

		Nearly two-thirds of the volume is occupied with the story of the Reformation , from the '' monkish squabble '' -LRB- as Pope
Leo	PERSON	phrased it -RRB- over indulgences , up to the convening of the Coun - cil in
1545	DATE	; the remainder being mainly devoted to the manifold diplomatic shifts and the doctrinal and disciplinary wranglings of that notable conclave , down to its suspension in
1552	DATE	, upon the advance on
Innspruck of Maurice of Saxony	ORGANIZATION	.

		This advance , we may say in passing , Mr.
Froude	PERSON	inclines to think was a matter of collusion between
Maurice	PERSON	and the Emperor , and not , as is commonly held , an act of treachery on the part of the former .

		There was certainly something both noble and pathetic in the long struggle of
Charles V.	PERSON	to save the unity of
Christendom	LOCATION	by pacific measures , and to quench the flames of the odium theologicum with the sweet waters of reason and charity ; and it seems not im - probable that the utter failure of his naive hopes of bringing warring ecclesiastics to compromise their doctrinal differences like reasonable men , and to secure the peace of
Europe	LOCATION	on a basis of broad apos - tolic Christianity , may have caused him at last to wash his hands indignantly of the entire matter .

		The advance of
Maurice	PERSON	on Innspruck came in
May , 1552	DATE	, and the peace of
Passau	LOCATION	followed in
July	DATE	, establishing toleration in
Germany	LOCATION	a sort of mo - dus vivendi which lasted till the bitter and devas - tating ordeal of the Thirty Years ' War ; and
Charles V.	PERSON	, as our author notes , took no part in the settle - ment , and interested himself no further in the quar - rels of Pope and Protestant .

		While Mr.
Froude	PERSON	clearly holds throughout a brief for the Reformers , he relies mainly on the testimony of Catholic writ - ers accepting for the nonce Cardinal
Newman	PERSON	's charitable view that Protestant tradition in the case is founded on `` bold , wholesale , and unscrupulous lying . ''

		That there may have been some mild pre - varication on the other side as well , seems probable ; but , nevertheless , Mr.
Froude	PERSON	rests his cause on ' Catholic documents of undoubted authenticity , on the testimony of Catholic witnesses antecedent to or contemporary with the Reformation . ''

		His main contention is that the Reformation was originally and essentially a moral and laical rather than a doc - trinal revolt .

		The Church had grown scandalously corrupt and unbearably tyrannical ; and
Europe	LOCATION	rose to demand a general cleansing of the Augean stables .

		The Church , conscious of guilt and dreading scru - tiny , resisted reform , resented the interference of the laity , ingeniously turned the moral controversy into a doctrinal one , and the great schism fol - lowed . ''

		The garment without seam was torn ; ' * and upon the papal party mainly rested the blame .

		Just how far the reforming zeal of the princes may have been inflamed and alloyed by their desire to lay hold of church property -LRB- almost a third of the land in
Germany	LOCATION	was in the hands of the clergy -RRB- , Mr.
Froude	PERSON	omits to say ; but candor compels us to admit a considerable tincture of regard for selfish and material interests in the stoutest supporters of the Reformation .

		To the German princes especially , the broad domains of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	formed a glitter - ing bait .

		To the common assertion that the Reform - ation '' settled nothing , '' Mr.
Froude	PERSON	replies , pretty effectually , that every one of the abuses complained of by the laity has been swept away : '' Popes no longer depose princes , dispense with oaths , or ab - solve subjects from their allegiance .

		Appeals are not any more carried to
Rome	LOCATION	from the national tribunals , nor justice sold there to the highest bid - der .

		Felonious priests suffer for their crimes like unconsecrated mortals .

		Too zealous prelates can - not call poor creatures before them ex officio , cross - question them on their beliefs , fine , imprison , or burn them at the stake .

		Excommunications are kept in bounds by the law of libel .

		Itinerant pardon - vendors no longer hawk through
Europe	LOCATION	their un - profitable wares ... These scandals are gone , and the devoutest Romanists would not wish to revive them . ''

		It would have been not only generous but just in Mr.
Froude	PERSON	to follow his somewhat harsh indictment of the
Romish Church	ORGANIZATION	by a tribute to the superb reforming movement which took place in that body under the pontiffs who held
sway during the latter half of the sixteenth century	DATE	.

		When the
Church	ORGANIZATION	finally armed herself to combat heresy , her first care was to check the scandals which men like Cardinal
Julian	PERSON	,
Contarini	ORGANIZATION	,
Sadoleto	PERSON	, and
Caraffa	ORGANIZATION	had long deplored .

		Volume III .

		is mainly taken up with the story of the quarrels and intrigues of the Directorial regime , and might prove rather dull reading were it not for the abundant anecdotes and caustic pen-portraits with which the ex-Director chose to spice his pages .

		The coup d'etat of the 18th Brumaire put an end to the Directory , and so formally relegated Barras to private life .

		From that date to the time of his death , in
1829	DATE	, he played no political role whatso - ever at least , no official one .

		Volume IV. , how - ever , covering this period of formal retirement from
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 365 the arena of politics , is much more interesting than its immediate predecessor , since Barras remained to the end one of the closest and hest-informed ob - servers of public events of his day , keeping in close touch with the chief actors , intriguing and plotting during the period of the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	and of the Em - pire , and even playing , in a way , the part of con - sulting statesman to
Louis XVIII.	LOCATION	,
Charles X.	PERSON	, and their Ministers .

		Like the earlier volumes , the con - cluding ones bristle with piquant personalities .

		The
Jacobinical Viscount	PERSON	was preeminently a man who dared call a spade a spade ; and one rejoices , for the credit of human nature in general , that his ran - corous accounts of most of his leading contempo - raries must be rather freely discounted .

		Bonaparte is , as before , the main target for his shafts ; and we are inclined to think that , with all its exaggera - tions , and perhaps falsehoods , the picture he draws of his arch-enemy contains elements of essential truth which conscientious historians must reckon with in the future .

		Barras was unquestionably a strong and able , if an unprincipled , man .

		He ex - ploited more adroitly than any other leading rev - olutionist , except perhaps his fellow - Provencal , Bare * re , the events of the time to his own profit ; and his record of those events , while somewhat warped and discolored by his personal animosities and invet - erate bent for calumny , can not be read without deep interest and -LRB- if read discriminatingly -RRB- profit .

		The copious introductory matter , furnished by
M. George Duruy	PERSON	, forms at once an admirable historical study of the period embraced by the Memoirs , and a use - ful touchstone by which its more doubtful elements may be tested .


M. Duruy	PERSON	has a very low opinion of Barras , and a correspondingly high one of Na - poleon ; so that , between author and editor , the ju - dicious reader should be able to arrive at a pretty accurate judgment .

		The volumes are well translated and handsomely made containing seven portraits in photogravure , together vriihfac similes , - plans , etc. .

		Under the title '' Historical Essays '' ittp Lightfooe , -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the trustees of the historical essay t. i .

		, ' i i
Lightfoot	PERSON	fund have gathered to - gether several miscellaneous papers of a historic nature , written at odd times since
1872	DATE	by the late
Bishop Lightfoot	PERSON	of
Durham	LOCATION	.

		Marked by zealous research and careful comparisons of authorities , the unfinished essay on the '' Manor-House of Auck - land '' is likely to interest the student who cares for out-of-the-way things in the history of English archi - tecture .

		In its fragmentary shape , however , it seems hardly worth publishing .

		In the four other papers which make up the volume the reader will seldom forget that he is listening to a churchman .

		At the game time , it must be said that these papers are charming in style , and admirably constructed to bring into clear outline the subjects with which they are concerned . ''

		Christian Life in the Second and Third Centuries , '' the first paper , delivered as three lectures in
1872	DATE	at
St. Paul 's Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	, before
Lightfoot	PERSON	was called to
Durham	LOCATION	, indicates at the outset the author 's constructive power .

		From a mass of material he has chosen a few telling incidents which serve to trace the slow but steady growth of Christianity during its most critical stage .

		Passing by the paper on the '' Comparative Progress of An - cient and Modern Missions , '' with its several rather startling conclusions , the reader will find himself under the guidance of a delightful companion in the course of the essay entitled ''
England	LOCATION	during the Latter Half of the
Thirteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The esti - mates of such men as
Earl Simon de Montfort	PERSON	,
Edward I.	PERSON	, and
Roger Bacon	PERSON	, are judicious and strong .

		An interesting comparison is drawn between the Pointed English architecture of the age of Ed - ward and the Doric style of
Greece	LOCATION	in the days of Pericles .

		The concluding study of ``
Donne	PERSON	, the Poet-Preacher '' gives a glimpse of that curious fig - ure among English churchmen .

		Throughout the volume , but notably in the last essay , the reader can not escape the spell of
Bishop Lightfoot	PERSON	's per - sonality : the themes were his favorites , and his finely-wrought mind dwelt upon them in a noble and inspiring way .

		of
St. Andrews	ORGANIZATION	, which contained reminiscences of the author 's life at
St. Andrews	LOCATION	-
from 1865	DATE	to
1890	DATE	, will be interested in learning that the same author has brought his pleasant rec - ollections down to the close of
1895	DATE	in a volume - entitled '' The Last Years of St. Andrews '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- .

		The characteristics of the author 's previous works , numbering over thirty volumes , are present in his last book .

		He relates in his usual happy manner a multitude of anecdotes about sermons , churches , and church dignitaries .

		His style is 366 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, notable for its purity and simplicity , although it occasionally becomes a trifle diffuse , and is always lacking in strength .

		The author has the Boswellian delight for details , and tells all his stories with a naive exactness .

		Dr.
Boyd	PERSON	should console himself with the thought that when Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	said his `` Recreations of a Country Parson '' was '' the dull - est book he ever read , '' he was not nearly so careful & s to the absolute truth of his statement as is Dr.
Boyd	PERSON	himself when he says of a certain sermon : '' It would be overbold to say the sermon was the dullest and stupidest I ever heard : because one 's experience is large .

		But I can say truly I never heard a duller or stupider . ''

		Perhaps this is what Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	really meant , forgetting for the moment that '' one 's experience is large . ''

		In view of this criticism , it was rather injudicious for Dr.
Boyd	PERSON	to make the sweeping statement that he has found all of Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's `` famous writings , both in prose and verse , '' '' tiresome , '' and his explanation of this inability to appreciate each other 's literary work as '' a deficiency in nature '' is certainly amusing .

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	on '' ' rhe Duties of Authors , '' one of the Social Eights chapters of Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's nd Duties .

		^ `` Social Rights and Duties '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- was commented upon by us at some length in a recent issue of THE DIAL .

		The two volumes of which this work consists are made up of addresses delivered to the Ethical Societies of
London	LOCATION	upon various occasions , discussing a variety of subjects of social interest , such as `` The Sphere of Political Economy , '' '' The Vanity of Philosophizing , '' '' For - gotten Benefactors , '' '' Heredity , '' '' Punishment , '' and ' Luxury . ''

		These addresses are in a more pop - ular vein than most of Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	's work , but it is hardly necessary to say that they make no con - cessions to commonplace minds , or that they reveal one of the deepest and most genial of living thinkers .

		Contact with such an intellect as Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	's is Always in the highest degree stimulating , for the author has a happy faculty for clothing abstract truth and close reasoning in the most fascinating garb of expression .

		The Societies for whom these lectures were prepared are much to be envied , and the larger reading public is to be congratulated upon the access to them now afforded .

		A substantial The vei 7 striking paper entitled '' Is philosophy of Life Worth Living ? ''

		contributed by Optimism .

		Professor
William James	PERSON	to a recent number of '' The International Journal of Ethics , '' has been reprinted fn a neat booklet by Mr.
S. Burns Weston	PERSON	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		We wish that the essay might find its way to many thousands of readers , for it is both impressive and helpful .

		The writer holds a brief for optimism , it is true ; but he knows how worthless are the stock arguments for the optimistic view , and , instead of sheltering himself behind the shallow platitudes that we hear so often , seeks in the very heart of philosophical thought for his refu - tation of the pessimist .

		The essential thesis is that '' our whole physical life may lie soaking in a spirit - ual atmosphere , a dimension of Being that we at present have no organ for apprehending . '' ''

		I con - fess , '' the author goes on to say , '' that I do not see why the very existence of an invisible world may not in part depend on the personal response which any one of us may make to the religious appeal .

		God himself , in short , may draw vital strength and increase of very being from our fidelity .

		For my own part , I do not know what the sweat and blood and tragedy of this life mean , if they mean anything short of this .

		If this life be not a real fight in which something is eternally gained for the Universe by success , it is no better than a game of private the - atricals from which one may withdraw at will .

		But it feels like a real fight ; as if there were something really wild in the
Universe	ORGANIZATION	which we , with all our idealities and faithfulnesses , are needed to redeem . ''

		One of the most amusing papers in
Schopenhauer	PERSON	's `` Nachlass '' is de - voted to a series of rules and prac - tical suggestions on '' The Art of Controversy . ''

		It describes thirty-eight stratagems , or Kunstgriffe , that may be employed in argument , and illustrates most of them by example .

		The discussion is as cyn - ical as
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	's '' Prince , '' and its avowed aim is to enable disputants to hold their own , per fas et nefas .

		We have long wished that someone might translate this essay , and are glad to note that Mr.
T. Bailey Saunders	PERSON	has at last added it , together with a few other papers , to the series of volumes in which the body of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	's minor writings is presented to English readers -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It makes the sixth volume of the series , and is to be followed by one more .

		We may find space for one of the simpler Kunstgriffe : '' If you observe that your opponent has taken up a line of argument which will end in your defeat , you must not allow him to carry it to its conclusion , but interrupt the course of the dispute in time , or break it off altogether , or lead him away from the subject , and bring him to others .

		In short , you must effect the trick which will be noticed later on , the mutatlo controversies . ''

		It is , we believe , one of the notes of For architects genius that , in speaking of what is and others .

		, ' .

		r .

		.

		here and now , it proves also to be speaking of what is always and everywhere .

		Whether the author who has taken the evil name of Solomon Gargoyle be a genius or not , is fortunately not to be definitely settled by these lines .

		But it is worth first mention , that although what is said of '' Five Sins of an Architect '' -LRB-
Riverton Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is said by an architect and of architectural matters , it is also of broader scope , and has therefore the especial charm of all work that is appreciably suggestive .

		In putting his finger on some of the weak places of architecture , the author indicates also some of the weaknesses of the larger structure of society ; his conception of a good architect , also , is not without its bearing on our conception of a good man .

		One
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 367 reads with a wider interest than would be excited in the general mind by a discussion of the faults and follies of any especial profession or art .

		But in dealing with a particular way of life , it has the advantage attaching to concrete cases .

		It is , then , a book which one will read with pleasure and pos - sibly to further advantage .

		We regret that we can - not say that '' there is not a dull page in it '' : in truth , the author is not always at his best as must of course be true of every honest man .

		Nor is he uniformly impeccable -LRB- giving evidence of some pet sins of his own -RRB- , but it will be more amusing to the reader to detect the said sins himself , and thereby taste the joy of commenting on the critic .

		Professor
Bernard Moses	PERSON	, in '' The Railwa 7 Revolution in
Mexico	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
The Berkeley Press	ORGANIZATION	,
San Francisco	LOCATION	-RRB- , deals with the changed industrial and material con - ditions of our southwestern neighbor , which have succeeded the recent and extensive building of rail - roads in that country .

		He shows that by the influx and use of foreign capital in the building of rail - roads within the past two decades ,
Mexico	LOCATION	, hitherto an isolated country , `` has suddenly been brought under the influences that make for social changes , and we discover here an excellent example of the transition from a stagnant to a progressive society . ''

		There is no attempt at exhaustive treatment , the book contains but ninety pages , but the author dis - cusses , successively , the order which has followed out of this new means of transportation , the ma - terial and moral improvement of the population , the opening of new and unworked fields for agricul - tural enterprise , and , especially , the wholesome eco - nomic effect which this new influence has had upon the cities of the interior .

		The story is pleasingly told and will repay a careful perusal .

		A map of
Mexico	LOCATION	would have added not a little to the interest of the book .

		`` Governments of the World To -
< %	PERCENT	> '' % Mr.
Hamblen Sears	PERSON	, is well calculated to interest the busy indi - vidual who wishes to keep in touch with current events in all parts of the globe .

		Indeed , it may be truly said , as appears on the title-page , that the book is '' an outline for newspaper readers . ''

		It aims to give satisfactory answers to '' references to contem - porary events , domestic and foreign , to men and things , which no paper can pretend to explain , which , in fact , the editors must take for granted as familiar to their readers . ''

		Useful statistical and historical information is given of forty-eight different govern - ments , alphabetically , beginning with the Argentine Eepublic and ending with
Venezuela	LOCATION	.

		These are followed with an appendix discussing briefly some features of a dozen other independent sovereign states .

		Maps are given of most of the countries treated , but they are so very small as to be of little value to the reader .

		An interesting table , showing the areas , populations , and other data of the British colonies , is found at the end of the book .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The bound volume of '' The Century '' magazine which includes the numbers from
November , 1895	DATE	, to
April , 1896	DATE	, is at hand , and is as full of interesting matter as any of its predecessors .

		Among the more noticeable features are Mr.
H. M. Stanley	PERSON	's account of '' The De - velopment of
Africa	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
C. E. Borchgrevink	PERSON	's story of '' The First Landing on the Antarctic Continent , '' Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's discussion of '' The Armenian Question , '' and Mr.
Marion Crawford	PERSON	's two papers on
Rome	LOCATION	.

		The serials include Professor
Sloane	PERSON	's '' Life of Napoleon , '' Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's '' Sir
George Tressady	PERSON	, '' and Mr.
Hopkin	PERSON	- son
Smith	PERSON	's ''
Tom Grogan	PERSON	. ''

		The illustrations are , of course , as distinctive and valuable a feature as ever .

		The cante-fable of '' Aucassin et Nicolete '' has hith - erto been known to English readers only in Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's exquisite version .

		A new translation , the work of Mr.
M. S. Henry	PERSON	and Mr.
E. W. Thomson	PERSON	, now appears in one of the prettiest booklets imaginable from the press of
Messrs. Copeland & Day	ORGANIZATION	.

		While we can not say that the present translators have caught the flavor of the original quite as successfully as did Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, they have nevertheless produced a very charming version of one of the loveliest strays of mediaeval literature .


Madame Darmesteter	ORGANIZATION	's charming monograph on '' Froissart '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- has been translated into English by
Miss E. Frances Poynter	PERSON	, and published in a volume that is made almost sumptuous by hand - some print , heavy paper , and illustrative plates .

		It is a beautiful book in spirit no less than in form , full of poetic feeling and sympathetic appreciation .

		It must surely help to make Froissart better known than he now is to English readers , and that is no unworthy task .

		The freshness and purity of the old Chronicler at his best are things '' that will never lose their value , '' but are likely rather to become more and more prized as the world grows older .

		Mr.
S. Baring-Gould	PERSON	describes his '' Curiosities of Olden Times '' -LRB-
Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- , as '' a small museum '' wherein he has preserved some of the quaintest relics which have attracted his notice during his antiquarian labors .

		The book certainly points to a vast overhauling of dusty tomes ; and the author presents his sufficiently curious odds-and-ends of forgotten lore and tradition in a sprightly and agreeable way .

		There are seventeen papers in all , under such titles as : `` The Meaning of Mourning ; '' '' Curiosities of Cypher ; '' '' Strange Pains and Penalties ; '' '' Some Crazy Saints ; '' ''
Sortes Sacne	PERSON	; '' `` Queen Culprits ; '' `` The Philosopher 's Stone ; '' etc. .

		The book is full of curious and suggestive reading .

		`` A Dictionary of Chemical Solubilities '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Dr.
Arthur Messinger Correy	PERSON	, has just been pub - lished .

		It is a work of enormous industry , and , although it deals only with inorganic substances , and is printed in the most compact form possible , fills over five hundred double-columned octavo pages .

		Storer 's '' Dictionary , '' published in
1864	DATE	, is the only previous attempt to deal with this subject , and , of course , the accumulated de - terminations of the past thirty years have added greatly to the material to be embodied in such a work .

		The authorities are given for the determinations , but no at - tempt has been made to verify them experimentally , and they often contradict one another .

		Recent work is likelv to be more accurate than earlier , and that is the nearest approach that may be made toward any general rule .

		Every chemist will find this work indispensable .

		So easily is it propelled that it has been widely nicknamed the '' easy-running Stearns '' ; and so truly have its builders gauged the wants of the average rider that no more comfortable or satisfactory mount can be found anywhere .
