		27 LITERATURE AND THE UNDER - GRADUATE .

		On the occasion of the death of
George Meredith	PERSON	, one of our college magazines justly plumed itself upon having recognized his genius a good while he - fore it was recognized elsewhere in
America	LOCATION	, and even before
England	LOCATION	had rubbed her eyes to watch him a little more closely .

		In that day , the `` pro- gressive '' spirit was less pronounced than it is now ; in literature as well as in social and political move - ments , the `` old fogies '' were still venerable rather than antiquated .

		But with the change in the mood of the age , the past has receded into a dismal Boeo - tian fog , the present has assumed the loveliest hues , and the future , arrayed in the magnificence of per - fect novelty , is apparently on the point of making even the present seem conventional .

		The most in - tellectually alert type of student has bid perfunctory adieux to the giants of the old order , is often bored by living writers of acknowledged genius or talent , and spends his time in scanning the horizon for giants of a new breed , manifesting a radical cosmo - politanism such as we never expected to find in the universities .

		With blaring trumpets the press-agents announce the Irish dramatists : our latter-day col - lege litterateur straightway parts company with Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, cries `` Who are they ?

		Hurray ! ''

		and flings his cap for Synge until he hears of a '' cork - ing '' play by
Wedekind	PERSON	.

		I have known students who '' specialized '' in the drama without enjoying even a nodding acquaintance -LRB- such as one gets in translations -RRB- with Sophocles or Euripides , Moliere or
Racine	LOCATION	, without so much as an ability to read the Elizabethan English of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	one of them , indeed , admitted to `` hating '' Shakespeare with par - ticular fervor .

		These same students are indisput - able authorities on dramatists and novelists of whom even their more `` progressive '' professors have barely heard , so that if a new Meredith were to appear to-morrow he would be instantly detected and lauded by a chorus of students in a number of universities and colleges .

		That would be well enough if Merediths were not so rare ; but it is un - fortunately true that our undergraduate watcher of the skies normally beholds , not new planets swim - ming into his ken , but only a succession of swift meteorites melting into non-existence .

		It may be that this strict contemporaneity -LRB- almost futurity -RRB- of interest , is not to be regretted .

		Amer - ican institutions of higher learning , unlike those of the Continent , have always been timid and conven - tional , without a strong desire for independent thought , and it is possible that the radical interests of our students may lead to a curiosity and breadth THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, of mind that have been only too rare in American education .

		Something will , indeed , suffer : deli - cately ornate poetry , prose that is strong because it is chastened and restrained , graceful comedy and opera , these are not for the new generation .

		The new gods are
Wells	PERSON	and
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	,
Meredith	PERSON	and
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	,
Ibsen	PERSON	-LRB- already a little old-fashioned -RRB- ,
Strindberg	LOCATION	, the Irish school , indeed any writers who put genuine '' red blood '' into their work , who have broken violently with tradition , who have u a deep love for the primitive , '' who are socialistic , who are tremendously free of thought and speech .

		The col - lege club devoted to Greek tragedy has been meta - morphosed into a group of young men with a rosy Socialistic vision , and some of our college papers are avowedly given over to Socialistic propaganda , one of them , for instance , asserting with modern openness that '' the Socialistic party , it is a truism to say , stands to-day as the one consistent , progres - sive , self-respecting party in American politics . ''

		Above all is the cry of young
America	LOCATION	in the colleges let us not be prejudiced and reactionary : let us be absolutely outspoken .

		We will spare no man and no institution , we will revere nothing , but look the facts in the eye and speak out what we think .

		Such is the attitude , not only when young men or young women gather in earnest discussion , but also when young men and young women meet for social pleasure no drawing-room prattle , as of overgrown children , but manly and womanly direct - ness , even when the most delicate , or indelicate , subjects are broached .

		All this may , I have said , lead to better things , and unfavorable comment may savor of old-fogeyism .

		We are told that what is radical to-day will be tame and conventional to-morrow ; we are told , specific - ally , that a new era of frankness , sex equality , and social service is dawning .

		These things it is not for us to deny .

		In any event , however , we are surely justified in assuming that some of the new virtues are replacing older virtues that are quite as precious , and that a good deal of the new attitude is little better than attitudinizing .

		Despite all our talk of advanced thought in the colleges , it is to be feared that college students do not really think as much as they did in more sober decades , that the love of reflection has been smothered in a passion for `` doing things , '' that action is tending to take the place of thought instead of following it .

		It is not yet clear that the reddest of red blood is better than true blue blood , or better than a favorable com - bination of the two purple , or royal , blood .

		Action is extolled at the expense of wisdom the prime token of a good king , a good student , a good man of any kind .

		So much for the gospel of
Red Blood	ORGANIZATION	as we find it in our colleges .

		It is the gospel of the most promising young men and women , those who are most alert and intelligent .

		If it is a sorry gospel , let us turn to another type of undergraduate who reads literature ; in him we shall find another , though perhaps not nobler , ideal .

		The second type of undergraduate who reads books -LRB- save in one or two colleges there are only two prominent types -RRB- is the student whose interests are not primarily literary .

		He is very likely spe - cializing in engineering , or agriculture , or chemistry , or music , and he reads for momentary amusement rather than for pleasure and profit .

		He probably takes a course or two in English literature , does the reading required of him , but makes a sharp division between literature prescribed by the instructor 's wisdom and literature prescribed by his own inclina - tion ; he will read a play of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's , if one is assigned , but when he reads for diversion he will prefer
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	to lago , and if he goes to the theatre will elect ``
Louisiana	LOCATION	Lou '' and not `` Twelfth Night . ''

		He is not ashamed of his tastes far from it , indeed so far that if you remind him that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is more worth while than
Conan Doyle	PERSON	he will assume that the burden of proof is yours .

		Just what this type of student the usual type of undergraduate reads , can hardly be known with - out extended inquiry .

		As a result of several investi - gations , both in the
East	LOCATION	and in the
West	LOCATION	, I present the following data .

		Most students read virtually nothing but magazines .

		Of our multitudinous mag - azines , by all odds the most popular is the ''
Satur	PERSON	- day Evening Post , '' partly because it costs less than the others , partly because it contains short stories in abundance .

		Next in order , but far less popular , are the `` Cosmopolitan , '' `` Everybody 's , '' `` Ladies ' Home Journal '' -LRB- in coeducational institutions -RRB- , `` Scrib - ner 's , '' `` Popular Mechanics , '' `` Red Book , '' then three or four others including the `` Review of Re - views . ''

		These are read primarily for the short stories , secondarily for a knowledge of current events , and lastly for scientific information .

		A large num - ber of students read no ephemeral novels ; those who do read them prefer novels of an adventurous or sentimental cast usually not the `` red blood '' fic - tion which one finds in a mild form in Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	and in a virulent form in Mr.
London	LOCATION	.

		An equally large number of students read no standard novels ; those who do , prefer
Dickens	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Cooper	PERSON	,
Steven	PERSON	- son , and other writers in whose works adventure , sentiment , and sentimentalism are prominent .

		Poetry is , generally speaking , never read for pleasure , mainly because it is regarded as `` hard to understand '' and is somewhat '' effeminate . ''

		Of the poems read in high school or college courses only those of Long - fellow and
Tennyson	PERSON	seem to make any impression on the student .

		As for the drama , the average under - graduate neglects whatever is worth his attention , calling it `` dry '' and `` deep , '' and attends as many musical comedies and vaudeville performances as his purse will countenance ; favorite `` shows '' are `` The Slim Princess '' and `` The Soul Kiss . ''

		No one , of course , would be foolish enough to deny that a great deal can be said in favor of each of these interests of the undergraduate ; in themselves , they are laudable enough .

		Combined , however , it is clear that they are regrettably frivolous .


1913	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , Now , as the immature mind is naturally somewhat frivolous , something like the foregoing state of affairs is what we should expect in any age provided the immature mind is permitted to roam unguided .

		Several decades ago , back to
1636	DATE	, if you will , the literary tastes of the undergraduate were guided with more care and success than they are to-day .

		Theo - retically , we still seek to guide his taste ; but it is hardly an exaggeration to say that we have never done so with as little care or success .

		We condemn the narrow Puritan ideal to-day , but we should not forget that the Puritans educated the young to sturdy morality and citizenship .

		The classical education in vogue until the scientific spirit cast it aside was per - haps also too narrow ; but whatever else it did or failed to do , it produced men whose tastes were less vulgar than are those of our day .

		Yet we should not condemn our present educational ideal merely on the ground that the reading habits it fosters are deplor - able .

		For one thing , cultivating a love of good lit - erature has been made extremely difficult on account of the noisily alluring yellow newspapers and mag - azines that belong uniquely to our own age ; trivial - ity and sensationalism have never surrounded the student , in a physical as well as figurative sense , as they do to-day .

		But the fact remains that the under - graduate 's reading betokens a kind of uncivilization for which the yellow journals are only in part probably in small part responsible .

		When the student interested in literature reads
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	and
Wells	PERSON	to the exclusion of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Thackeray	PERSON	-LRB- one intelligent undergraduate , by the way , remarks that he `` can not keep up with
Wells	PERSON	as he writes faster than I can read '' -RRB- , and when the student interested in other phases of human activity reads almost nothing but the poorer short stories of this age of the short story ; when , in brief , the love of good literature is on the verge of losing its last citadel , the college , we have reason to look with con - cern into the future .

		In our laisscz faire democracy -LRB- it is less of that than it was -RRB- , we are inclined to let the future take care of itself , assuming that if we go too far one way now , we shall in due time have a reaction and go the other way .

		Possibly this attitude is wiser than it seems .

		But before we follow the cur - rent blindly , we should pause to consider whether even materialism is not more effective if it is not altogether material , whether , granting the para - mount value of our present ideals , the present itself may not be bettered by the addition of some of the indirectly practical virtues .

		This idea is an old one , but it is not popular to-day certainly not with the undergraduate .

		For many a long year the cause of culture has suffered through the lusty growth of two laudable but relatively undesirable ideals : the athletic ideal , and the eagerness for practical training .

		The two are not without relation , since we are probably right in ascribing the athletic ideal to the gospel of
Red Blood	ORGANIZATION	, to admiration of the man who '' does things , '' the man of concrete achievement as contrasted with the man of thought .

		So long as the builder of bridges , of model barns , and of more or less solid Socialistic platforms enjoys our respect at the ex - pense of the man of taste and reflection and unreal - ized potentiality , so long will athleticism make us wonder what , after all , colleges are for .

		Colleges which are combating the exaggerated athleticism that distorts their aims , might more profitably com - bat the `` practical training '' fallacy by a readjust - ment in their requirements for degrees .

		We must understand clearly , before we can go far , the paradox already alluded to , a paradox that puzzles this age though it was clear enough to our forefathers , namely , that a `` practical '' education is less prac - tical than an impractical one .

		Fortunately we are once more beginning to grasp this truth , partly by reaction from the excesses of the elective system ; the new attitude or rather the return to the old point of view is manifested by the bold attempt to rehabilitate Greek and Latin at
Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	, by the requirement at
Oberlin	LOCATION	that every graduating student shall have taken a course in one of the arts , by the action of Rutgers in making the
Master	ORGANIZATION	's de - gree a symbol of two years ' study in '' elementary and liberal '' subjects , and by the tendency at
Harvard , Yale	ORGANIZATION	, and
Princeton	LOCATION	toward a general rather than special education .

		Signs , then , are not wanting that `` practical '' study is to be tempered by liberal study , that specialization will not be a luxury for freshmen , but rather a necessity for graduate students .

		With the waning of early specialization we shall have , doubt - less , a healthy decrease in the number of teachers of the latter-day Ph.D. type .

		The undergraduate ordinarily does not respect the new type of in - structor , whom he regards , often unjustly it is true , as a dry word-grubber , a lover of the dullest manu - scripts and palpably worthless books , a dehuman - ized precisian ; he is repelled and driven into the camp of the athletes , where he is reasonably sure to find a coach whom he can honestly respect ; or he is driven to his textbooks and to the laboratory , seek - ing , as men will , knowledge rather than wisdom .

		But if he is to make a man of himself , and not a physical or mental machine , he must be stimulated by humane instructors , professors of a type not often bred by our colleges as they are now conducted .

		No doubt we shall have more of these professors when specialization and '' quick returns '' are less eagerly sought and less readily obtained .

		Then , and not till then , will the love of good literature be found again in our colleges ; then will the fiery young man , who spurns bis professors of literature and , for want of guidance , holds admirable only what is novel and red-blooded , and the ordinary undergraduate , who , if he reads at all , finds pleasure only in light stories and Slim Princesses , then will both types of under - graduates have an opportunity to acquire a love of good literature .

		Perhaps some of them will even read poetry .

		THE DIAL -LSB- Jan 1 , CASUAL COMMENT .

		ROBERT COLLYEB 'S VOICE AND PEN never failed , up to the very end , to win him hosts of eager hear - ers and readers , though undoubtedly his living and breathing presence gave to his spoken word a power and a charm that could not be communicated to the printed page .

		`` I wanted to touch his garments to see if virtue would not come out of him , '' said one whom the preacher 's strong personality had attracted .

		For almost a score of years his home and the centre of his influence was
Chicago	LOCATION	, where he founded
Unity Church	ORGANIZATION	and , as its pastor , was widely known as the most famous preacher in the
West	LOCATION	.

		Under his heroic leadership his church went through the great fire -LRB- which destroyed the building and left only two houses of his parish standing -RRB- and came forth dis - mayed but not disheartened .

		`` At that time some - thing went out of me , '' he once confessed to a friend .

		`` Before that , thoughts pressed for utterance faster than I could write them .

		Now everything comes with effort . ''

		This helps explain his removal to
New York	LOCATION	and to a scene of less arduous labors a few years later .

		To that quieter afternoon of his life we owe some of his best published utterances .

		He wrote `` Nature and Life , '' `` The Life That Now Is , '' `` The Simple Truth , '' `` Talks to Young Men , '' `` Things New and Old , '' `` Father
Taylor	PERSON	, '' and a delightful autobiography , `` Some Memories , '' which latter , as he has said , `` stole out from the mists of time by no effort of memory , but as if they had been waiting for those quiet mornings when they were written , I dare not say by inspiration from on High , but will say the inspiration of a grateful heart . ''

		Of him can be truly said what he himself said of his friend ,
Father Taylor	PERSON	, whom he resembled in the rugged strength , the homely simplicity , the sweetness and beauty of his character , `` He had his limitations , but was so sincere and so right where the fastness of all Tightness dwells , in a man 's soul . ''

		This is the eighth consecutive year that he has performed this service for students and lovers of American poetry , and in these eight years he has witnessed what seem to him encouraging signs of an increasing appreciation of poetry on the part of the public , and of growing ability to produce good verse on the part of the poets .

		`` For the year just ended , '' he affirms , `` there can be no doubt in the face of the proofs that American poetic art has entered upon a new era an era that not only promises a better and higher quality of accomplishment , but also in which the commercial prosperity that formerly attended its publication will return . ''

		Among visible evidences of poetry 's im - proving condition he cites the publication of '' The Lyric Year , '' and four other notable collections of American verse , the establishment of two magazines -LRB- `` Poetry , '' in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and `` The Poetry Journal , '' in
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- devoted to the interests of the art , and the number and prominence of volumes of verse in the autumn output of books .

		Moreover , Mr.
Braith	PERSON	- waite has been assured by the editor of one of our foremost magazines '' that these annual articles on magazine poetry had the effect of compelling him to select ' distinctive ' verse for his periodical , and not merely good verse . ''

		As in former years , six leading magazines have been examined by the appraiser , and this year a number of other periodicals have also been searched for distinctive pieces of poetry .

		The sixty-eight best poems , out of three hundred or more good ones published in the year , are named by Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	; and from these , he says , he has chosen forty-two for his `` Anthology of Magazine Verse for
1912	DATE	. ''

		These forty-two he also names , and likewise the twenty-one of preeminent worth out of the forty - two .

		Finally he chooses six of the thrice-sifted twenty-one and publishes them with his review in the `` Transcript '' ; and these six are surely deserv - ing of mention even in so brief a summary of Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's work as the present .

		The titles , authors , and periodicals , as given by him , are as follows : '' He Whom a Dream Hath Possessed , ''
Shaemas O'Sheel	PERSON	, `` Forum '' ; `` Hungarian Love-Lament , ''
Ethel Syford	PERSON	, ''
Lippincott	PERSON	's '' ; '' To Little Ren ^ e , ''
William Aspenwall Bradley	PERSON	, '' Scribner 's '' ; `` The Wife , ''
Anna Spencer Twitchell	PERSON	, '' Delineator '' ; '' The Reveler : A Vineyard Song , ''
George Edward Woodberry	PERSON	, ''
Harper	PERSON	's '' ; '' As an Old Mercer , ''
Mahlon Leonard Fisher	PERSON	, `` The Bellman . ''

		Natu - rally , but unfortunately , the critic has excluded his own work from appraisal in this annual survey ; but those interested need go no further than to '' The Forum '' -LRB-
December	DATE	-RRB- to find an example of it .

		No recent writer has served the cause of poetry more zealously and lovingly than Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	.

		* WESTERN LITERATURE IN THE FAR EAST , espe - cially in
Japan	LOCATION	, is winning increased favor .

		Mr.
R. Matsushite	PERSON	, manager of the
Maruzen Company	ORGANIZATION	, the largest importers of books in
Japan	LOCATION	, has recently been in
London	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	for business purposes , and has of course been interviewed .

		His alleged assertion that the Japanese , though possessed now of a robust national consciousness , are humble at heart and still eager to learn from other nations , and that they study foreign languages and buy foreign books more than any other people , is easily credible .

		That they also buy more pure literature than books on science and industry , one is glad to believe .

		Foreign classics are read by them now more than ever before ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	being in especial demand ; but modern authors of note are equally popular , and Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	,
Strindberg	LOCATION	, and
Haupt	PERSON	- mann find many appreciative readers .

		America sends to
Japan	LOCATION	more books on commerce and indus - try than on other subjects , our business methods being gladly studied and adopted there , while Ger - many contributes medical works , and other European countries those books in which
Japan	LOCATION	considers them especially strong .

		The American short story , it is gratifying to learn , and also American books about
1913	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL
Russia	LOCATION	and from the Russian , are in favor with the Japanese ; but
America	LOCATION	's commercial influence on
Japan	LOCATION	has far exceeded her literary influence , as was to have been expected in this day and generation .

		A slight but significant sign of the times is to be noted in
Japan	LOCATION	's recent adoption of foreign stationery .

		Our pens and ink are rapidly invading the island kingdom , where two years ago no official document could law - fully be written in European fashion ; now , how - ever , the steel pen may legally take the place of the camel 's - hair brush or whatever the old-fashioned native implement may be .

		But after all is said , a feeling of regret will arise at these evidences of the u standardization '' of all modern civilization .

		Gain in uniformity means loss in picturesque variety .

		PENALTIES OF LITERARY GREATNESS might almost be proved to exceed those of literary unsuccess and obscurity .

		Among recent celebrities ,
Mark Twain	PERSON	lamented in his last years that his popularity and prominence made it impossible for him to gratify his longing to visit once more in a quiet way the scenes and friends of his youth .

		When a disguise was sug - gested he shook his head . ''

		No , '' said he , sorrowfully , `` my drawl would give me away . ''

		Mr.
A. C. Ben	PERSON	- son has in one of his books well depicted some of the annoyances thai ; his own acceptability with readers has brought him .

		The great
Dumas	PERSON	, to go back a few decades , probably enjoyed all the popularity he achieved ; but the later attachment of his name to works rather feebly imitative of his genius might not have pleased him so well .


Walter Scott	PERSON	was another who suffered at the hands of unscrupulous imitators .

		A writer in the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post '' calls at - tention anew to pseudo-Scott catchpenny publications foisted on an unsuspecting public in the days before the author of `` Waverley '' had revealed himself .

		`` Walladmor '' came out in
Germany	LOCATION	as an attempt to supply the demand for a
Waverley	ORGANIZATION	novel at the annual book-fair when no genuine product was forth - coming ; and , nearer home , one
William Fearman	PERSON	boldly issued a fourth and fifth series of `` Tales of My Landlord '' as from the hand of the Gandercleuch schoolmaster and parish clerk ,
Jedediah Cleish	PERSON	- botham .

		These spurious romances , `` Pontefract Castle '' and `` The Fairy of
Glas Lyn	PERSON	, '' their unscru - pulous fabricator extolled as equal in merit to their predecessors in the series , and he wrote an impudent letter to
John Ballantyne	PERSON	in answer to the bookseller 's protest against the fraud .

		But
Scott	PERSON	refused to take any action in the matter , confident that the counter - feits would enjoy but a brief currency ; and he was soon proved to be in the right , as the bogus '' Tales '' failed to reach even a second edition , while the gen - uine ones have been reprinted hundreds of times .

		THE VERSATILITY OF OUR LATE AMBASSADOR TO ENGLAND must impress all who review even hastily the extent and variety of his achievements .

		Born at
Xenia	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, in
1837	DATE	,
Whitelaw Reid	PERSON	not unnaturally went for his college education to the near-by
Miami University	ORGANIZATION	at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, little dreaming that another and more famous
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	would one day bestow upon him its most coveted degree of D.C.L. .

		The young man 's quickness to learn enabled him to complete the college course in three years and to get his diploma at the early age of nineteen .

		A few years of teaching followed , then came newspaper work , service as staff officer in the war , a three-years term as librarian of the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	, cotton-planting in
Louisiana	LOCATION	, further journalistic experience , and in
1872	DATE	the editorship and chief ownership of the
New York	LOCATION	`` Tribune , '' for which journal he built the first of the now too-familiar sky-scrapers .

		For this newspaper , too , he bought the first linotype machines , and organized a com - pany for their manufacture and sale .

		In the field of education he also figured prominently , rising to the chancellorship of the
University of the State of New York	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the diplomatic service , besides twice refusing the ministry to
Germany	LOCATION	, he has repre - sented this country in
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, and has accepted a number of extraordinary missions .

		As author he is known for his `` After the War , '' `` Ohio in the War , '' `` Schools of Journalism , '' `` Newspaper Tendencies , '' `` Problems of Expansion , '' and many other published utterances , including a large num - ber of public addresses on notable occasions .

		His well-selected library at his
New York	LOCATION	residence and that in his country house are ranked among the best of private libraries .

		So fine a union of statesman - ship , scholarship , and executive ability is rarely met with ... A CURIOUS TENDENCY IN WORDS , a tendency not without its deeper significance , is their well-known habit of standing for exactly contrary meanings , illustrating , as it were , the ease with which all things pass into their opposites , the fondness that extremes have for meeting .

		Without dwelling '' on the anomaly whereby `` fast '' means both `` firmly fixed '' and `` moving rapidly , '' or the puzzling fact that the neg - ative prefix un has a positive force in such words as `` unloose '' and `` unravel , '' or the bewildering way many Italian words have of not living , up to their derivation -LRB- why , for example , should '' scontraff are '' not mean the opposite of '' contraff are '' if `` scom - parire '' means the opposite of '' comparire '' ? -RRB-

		without adducing a multitude of similar instances , we will bring this little philological disquisition to a close with a brief reference to an account , in the Manchester `` Guardian , '' of the wager between two disputants as to the meaning of `` lurid , '' one making it mean `` deep red , '' and the other `` pale . ''

		All the dictionaries accessible to the parties to this dispute gave the meaning '' pale , wan , ghastly pale , '' but the `` Guardian '' has discovered that `` the latest and greatest English dictionary '' supports popular usage and gives the definition , `` shining with a red glow or glare amid darkness -LRB- said of lightning flashes across dark clouds or flame mingled with smoke -RRB- , '' and forti - fies its position with a quotation from
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		Nevertheless , the Latin luridus has commonly been taken to mean `` pale yellow , wan , ghastly '' ; but may 8 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, it not be that the ancient Romans , like the Greeks , were deficient in the color-sense , and that hence has arisen the vagueness and self-contradiction in the modern interpretation of lurid 1 ?

		NEW AIDS TO LIBRARY-USERS are constantly being devised by our alert and inventive librarians and their assistants .

		In the latest report of the
Pratt Institute Free Library	ORGANIZATION	occurs mention of a recently adopted plan for furnishing illustrations to technical literature .

		The illustration takes the form of the actual machine or other object described in the text - book .

		For example , a model marine engine has for some time been on exhibition at the library ; and now there has been secured from an automobile company `` a complete 30 H. P. four-cylinder gasoline engine with parts cut open to show the action '' a loan likely to benefit all parties concerned in the trans - action .

		Another somewhat novel feature at the same institution bears the name of the `` Dinner - pail Library , '' a designation sufficiently self-explan - atory to call for little further elucidation here .

		The collection seems to have grown from an original nucleus of a practical library for Dr.
Grenfell	PERSON	's Labrador mission , and now has its special card - catalogue and is in other ways brought to the atten - tion of mechanics and others likely to desire its privileges .

		Such developments as these on the popular and '' practical '' side of library service would not attract all who may chance to read this para - graph ; nevertheless they help to round out the gener - ous activities of the modern as distinguished from the grudgingly accommodating old-time library .

		AN ACHIEVEMENT IN EDITORSHIP AND BIBLIOG - RAPHY of which even the most industrious of German scholars might be proud is to be placed to the credit of Dr.
Edward Arber	PERSON	, whose death by accident a few weeks ago makes English scholarship the poorer by one of its most learned and productive represen - tatives .


Edward Arber	PERSON	was born in
London	LOCATION	,
Decem	PERSON	- ber 4 ,
1836	DATE	; served as clerk in the Admiralty from
1854	DATE	to
1878	DATE	; held a lectureship on English at
University College	ORGANIZATION	under Professor
Henry Morley	PERSON	from
1878	DATE	to
1881	DATE	; and from
1881	DATE	to
1894	DATE	was professor of English at
Mason College	ORGANIZATION	,
Birmingham	LOCATION	.

		Since
1894	DATE	he has lived in
London	LOCATION	as emeritus pro- fessor , being also a fellow of
King 's College	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	.

		He has also been English examiner at
London Uni	LOCATION	- versity and at
Victoria University	ORGANIZATION	,
Manchester	ORGANIZATION	.

		But his chief service to the world of letters lies in his series of '' English Reprints '' -LRB- 1868-80 -RRB- , whereby he has enabled the general public to gain easy access to an accurate text of early English authors that were formerly accessible only in rare and expensive editions ; his `` English Scholar 's Library , '' in six - teen volumes ; his ''
English Garner	PERSON	, '' in eight vol - umes ; '' British Anthologies '' in ten volumes ; and a series begun five years ago and entitled '' A
Chris	PERSON	- tian Library . ''

		He also , unaided , edited two monu - mental English bibliographies , `` A Transcript of the Registers of the
Stationers	ORGANIZATION	' Company , 15531640 , '' and `` The Term Catalogues , 1668-1709 , with a Number for Easter Term ,
1711	DATE	, '' edited from the quarterly booksellers ' lists .

		In all these , and in other productions not mentioned here , Dr.
Arber	PERSON	showed in full measure that peculiar variety of the scholar 's taste and that dogged perseverance to which our reference libraries owe not merely a debt too vast for measurement , but , as one might say , their very existence .

		CHAOS IN CARD CATALOGUES is in more than one public library taking the place of a former cosmos , now that the cards approved by the
A. L. A.	PERSON	and issued by the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	are making their way into drawers already partly filled with cards of a different pattern .

		Usually the old cards are nar - rower , so that if the old drawers can hold the new cards at all , the invaders project awkwardly above the aboriginal inhabitants , thus making the manipu - lation of the cards -LRB- already a process provocative of impolite language -RRB- more patience-trying than ever .

		Some libraries , especially the newer ones , adopt the obvious remedy of gradually replacing all the old cards with new ones of standard size .

		Others are con - tent , or at any rate are compelled , to leave the two sets of cards jostling each other in unsightly disorder .

		Still others , with even a million or more of old cards to re-write or re-print , will heroically and at great expense struggle into line with the latest standards .

		Attention is just now called to this troublesome ques - tion by the changes and improvements in prospect for
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	's fine library .

		In its new two-million - dollar building , and modernly equipped in every other way , the library will be forced to substitute for its old-fashioned card catalogue one more in harmony with the latest official sanction in such matters ; and the replacing of a million and a half catalogue cards is no small task .

		... COQUETTING WITH THE CLASSICS , rather than ear - nest and continuous study , is undoubtedly somewhat encouraged by the issue of so attractive a series of '' cribs `` as is offered at a moderate price by the publishers of the recently inaugurated ''
Loeb	PERSON	Class - ical Library . ''

		But many a piece of coquetry has ended in happy marriage ; and so there are likely to be some who , dipping into the
Loeb	PERSON	volumes as an easy way of brushing up their Greek and Latin , will be caught by the charm of the ancient text and gradually wooed to a complete disregard of the modern rendering on the opposite page .

		Relatively small though this number may be for Sophocles and
Lucretius	PERSON	are not the easiest of reading even after years of classical study its growth might have been further encouraged by the use of a larger and clearer type for the Greek and Latin texts .

		Even the English is none too handsomely treated in this respect , but the greater familiarity with one 's native tongue makes easily legible a size of type that would try the eye in reading a foreign language .

		Unwieldiness is of course to be avoided in the vol -
1913	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL umes now issuing under such happy auspices ; never - theless a little more regard for the comfort of those readers -LRB- no longer in the first flush of youth -RRB- to whom the
Loeb Library	ORGANIZATION	especially appeals , may not be out of the question in future volumes , and thus the bespectacled reader may be induced to do some - thing more than coquet with the Greek or Latin that faces the English translation .

		PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE ALCOTTS and their
Concord	LOCATION	home , the famous
Orchard House	ORGANIZATION	, now preserved as a memorial of the family , or more especially of the gifted
Louisa	PERSON	and her eccentric father -LRB- equally gifted in his peculiar way -RRB- , is at - tested by the number of visitors to the above-named little house under the hill on the outskirts of the village .

		Mr.
Frank B. Sanborn	PERSON	, in a recent ''
Boston	LOCATION	Literary Letter '' to the
Springfield	LOCATION	'' Republican , '' says : '' The
Orchard House	ORGANIZATION	has been visited by more than six thousand pilgrims to this Mecca of
Concord	LOCATION	since it was opened to the public
six months ago	DATE	, and they have contributed nearly
$ 1000	MONEY	to the fund for maintaining the good old house . ''

		In this connection he further remarks : '' It is a pity that the letters of Mrs.
Alcott	PERSON	to her husband and friends , which were carefully copied out by Mr.
Alcott	PERSON	after her death , were not wrought up into her biography by
Louisa	LOCATION	, who found she had not spirit enough for a work involving so many sad memories .

		Some of them afterward came out in the life of
Alcott	LOCATION	, in which were first published some thirty pages of
Emerson	LOCATION	, most of which have since been included in the Journals , or will be .

		They are among his most characteristic writing . ''

		THE FIRST QUARTER-CENTURY OF THE LIBRARY - SCHOOL IDEA has come to a close , and the advocate of a library-school education for librarians is no longer regarded as a crank .

		It was in
1887	DATE	that the
New York State Library School	ORGANIZATION	, the parent of all subsequent institutions of the sort , had its modest beginnings in the
Columbia College Library	ORGANIZATION	under the librarian 's direction .

		Now , at the end of its first twenty-five years , it has , after sundry shif tings and wanderings , found a home worthy of its prestige in the new
State Education Building	ORGANIZATION	at
Albany	LOCATION	, which has risen , not on the ruins left by the late disastrous fire in the
State Capitol	LOCATION	, but largely as a necessary consequence of that fire .

		A notable publication , in - teresting to all library workers , and to some others , marks the entrance of the school upon its second quarter-century and its instalment in its new home .

		`` The
First Quarter Century	ORGANIZATION	of the
New York State Library School	ORGANIZATION	'' is a generously illustrated , hand - somely printed pamphlet of sixty-two pages , wherein both Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	, founder of the school , and a num - ber of his disciples , and of those later graduates not his immediate disciples , indulge in pleasing remi - niscence or in more matter-of-fact history all to the glory of the
N.Y.	LOCATION	S. L. S .

		It is a most enjoy - able symposium .

		ONE WAY TO REDEEM THE HUMAN MIND FROM ERROR is well illustrated in the founding of the
Sturge Library	ORGANIZATION	for the Japanese of
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		This library , named in honor of Dr. and Mrs.
F. A. Sturge	PERSON	, known for their work of more than twenty - five years among the Japanese of the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , and of its chief city especially , had its formal open - ing recently in the Japanese Y. M. C. A. building , with addresses in Japanese from Consul-General
Nagai	PERSON	and Professor Guy of the
State University	ORGANIZATION	, and the ceremonial delivery of the key to Dr.
Sturge	PERSON	by Pastor
Miyazaki	PERSON	.

		The collection already num - bers eight hundred Japanese and thirteen hundred English books , with some hundreds of unbound peri - odicals in both languages .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		CHRISTIANIZING THE SOCIAL ORDER .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		May I call attention to a thought suggested by
B. R. Wilton	PERSON	's letter in your issue of
December 1	DATE	.

		He speaks of Socialism as a `` great far-reaching system of social moralization and regeneration that promises to every individual a rational hope of freedom and self - realization . ''

		All the inspiration of our race has flowed from that source of Life Eternal ,
Jesus Christ	ORGANIZATION	.

		Countless men , at countless times , have drunk deep of His Spirit and have been given new life and courage to press on towards attainment , some using Art , others the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and many whatever instrument was at hand , to make their fellow-men bow down at the foot of the Cross ; even the Agnostics , cast out by the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, jeered at by the orthodox , have builded , some of them perhaps uncon - sciously , their share of the structure at which humanity must ever toil , the human heart .

		Perhaps the task had been easier if only the
Peter	PERSON	in each one of us were not so ready to draw the sword , as did the
Peter	PERSON	of old in the
Garden	LOCATION	; the way is strewn with countless ears .

		Christ made no resistance when they came to arrest Him , nor did He seek to defend Himself against the hatred of the mob that jeered and mocked Him in the ensuing hours .

		Instead He shouldered the Cross with - out a murmer , and as His overflowing heart of love was released from the constraining bonds of the flesh He prayed that those who killed Him be forgiven !

		Then followed black days for the disciples , days of sorrow for the band of friends He left behind .

		Space will not permit me to follow the birth and growth of the early Church , nor to call attention to the psycho - logical tendencies which already were at work ; but it must be noted that many of those who were in the lead , notably St.
Paul	PERSON	, saw visions or were met by angels on the road , who gave them messages .

		And it was soon felt that organization , laws , and creeds -LRB- the very things which crucified Him -RRB- were necessary in order to save the message of Christ to the world ; so it began to be that a man had to join the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, conform to its ceremonials and support its sacraments , in order to reach Christ .

		Then came days of power and wealth , with '' Christian '' wars and '' Christian `` controversy , the very things which He had said must come , although He warned against them and never advocated them .

		Do we not at this point recall the disciples disputing as to which was 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, greatest , and the demands made at the trial that He show them His earthly Kingdom if He was King .

		This was the era of the Canonization of Love , and it has nearly passed .

		But now comes Socialism , with its systems of rnoral - ization and regeneration , and its promises of self - realization .

		Is not this but a '' legislating '' of that same Love which we all feel but have with so little suc - cess Canonized .

		Is the hope of humanity in any system of scientifically framed rules ?

		I can not think so , nor do I think that under any system of rules will humanity ever find freedom and self-realization , although it may ever so vainly hope to .

		But I stand ready to let it try , and know that when its earthly kingdom totters , it will be better able to listen to the One who said '' Come unto me all ye weary , and I will give you rest . ''

		We were warned that '' false Christs and false pro- phets shall rise , and shall shew signs and wonders to se - duce , '' and we were told to take heed .

		How , then , am I to measure this man or that , whether he be a false prophet ?

		Was St.
Paul	PERSON	, was Mohamed , was
Brigham Young	ORGANIZATION	, was Mrs.
Eddy ?	PERSON

		They all claim to have been instructed by an angel , and to speak with a voice of authority , as do the Catholic and Protestant Churches .

		They have their followers , and have each done his work , to be judged by others than we .

		I plead that those who have lost hope will forsake all other prophets , all other teachers , and will first open their hearts to the message which Jesus Christ laid down His life to give to the world , the heritage of every man and woman regardless of race or position in society -LRB- or the gutter -RRB- , which rests on His life and His words and not on any system of education , ethical creed , or political party , although these may have been devised by sincere men , to advance His cause , or make it more easy and pleasant to follow Him .

		Then will we uncover the source of all our proud - est hopes and aspirations , then will we have new inspira - tion , and then know that never again can humanity completely lose hope , for we can ever help it to find new life .

		ROBINSON CRUSOE AND
TOBAGO	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Very prominent misstatements in two recent books , relative to
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	's connection with the island of
Tobago	LOCATION	, seem to warrant a restatement of the facts .

		Alexander Selkirk was a Scotch sailor who was put ashore , at his own request , after a quarrel with his cap - tain , on one of the islands of the
Juan Fernandez	PERSON	group , in
September , 1704	DATE	.

		After four years and four months he was rescued .

		He afterwards became an officer in the
British navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was not shipwrecked .

		Accounts of his experiences were published , notably that by
Steele	PERSON	.

		There is also evidence that he placed his personal ac - count in the hands of
Defoe	LOCATION	.


Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	's
Island	LOCATION	, as it is now called , in the
Juan Fernandez	PERSON	group , is well known .

		Visitors there may to-day see his lookout and the cave , and members of the British navy have there erected a memorial to
Alexander Selkirk	ORGANIZATION	.

		Selkirk 's experiences were the undoubted basis for
Defoe	ORGANIZATION	's im - mortal work .

		It is customary when basing works of fiction upon real events to change the names and the circumstances .

		Defoe determined to have his hero shipwrecked , which was not the case with
Selkirk	ORGANIZATION	.

		He further wanted him to come gradually into contact with other members of the human race .

		The
Juan Fernandez	PERSON	islands are far away from much travelled water routes .

		There were no natives there .

		There was no probability that he might be visited by cannibals .

		For these reasons
Defoe	PERSON	arbitra - rily made his hero set sail from the coast of
Brazil	LOCATION	, and by a hurricane he was driven onto an island near the mouth of the Oronoco .

		This was a region much trav - elled , and the Caribs had a reputation as savages and cannibals .


Tobago	LOCATION	answers very well for the con ^ .

		itions as portrayed by
Defoe	PERSON	, and that island is therefore gen - erally agreed upon as the tropical island which
Defoe	PERSON	had in mind in writing his fiction .

		Mr.
Stephen Bonsai	PERSON	, in his new book on `` The American Mediterranean , '' speaks of
Tobago	LOCATION	as ''
Rob	PERSON	- inson Crusoe 's real home . ''

		In the fiction , this island was not the home of the hero , but the scene of his shipwreck .

		The expression '' real home '' is therefore misleading .

		Mr.
Lindon Bates	PERSON	, Jr. , in his '' Path of the Conquisadores , '' is still further from the truth .

		The first sentence of his second chapter says : '' The green slopes of
Tobago	LOCATION	, where the shipwreck of the real Alexander Selkirk inspired the '
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	' of
Defoe	LOCATION	, have been left behind in the dark mists of the
Caribbean	LOCATION	. ''

		As we have stated , Selkirk was not ship - wrecked , and we have no evidence that he was ever on the island .

		A more correct statement is found in Mr.
W. A. Aspinwall	PERSON	's '' The British West Indies , '' also recently issued : '' Though the story of that book is based on the adventures of
Alexander Selkirk	PERSON	, who was marooned on the island of
Juan Fernandez	PERSON	, it is a generally accepted fact that
Tobago	LOCATION	was the island which
Defoe	PERSON	had in his mind when he wrote his graphic descriptions of that tropical island on which poor Crusoe was wrecked . ''

		THE AUTHOR OF `` CANZONI . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I pause on a somewhat remarkable statement in your issue for
Dec. 16 , 1912	DATE	.

		The statement occurs in the opening article , wherein it is said that the prizes in the '' Lyric Year '' competition went '' to three men whose names are absolutely unknown to the general reading public . ''

		Two-thirds of this assertion I do not question , but I ask its reconsideration in the case of Mr.
T. ` A. Daly	PERSON	.

		In view of the fact that Mr.
Daly	PERSON	has been a prominent journalist for twenty years or more , that he is the most widely copied '' newspaper poet '' in the
United States	LOCATION	, that he is the author of three volumes of verse , the first , `` Canzoni , '' in its seventh or eighth thousand ; the second , `` Carmina , '' of which Mr.
Jewett	PERSON	, late American manager of the
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	, said he sold more copies than of any other poet , with the single ex - ception of
Francis Thompson	PERSON	; the third , ``
Madrigali	PERSON	, '' just off the press and a widely-sought gift book on the Christmas market , it seems impossible to say that this author is '' absolutely unknown to the general reading public . ''

		I do not speak of the newspaper men among whom , at least from
New York	LOCATION	to
Chicago	LOCATION	as witness Mr.
Franklin P. Adams	PERSON	's account of the
American Press Humorists	ORGANIZATION	' convention at
Detroit	LOCATION	this year , in a sum - mer issue of `` The Editor and Publisher '' `` Tom ''
Daly	PERSON	's is a name to conjure by .

		A final indication that Mr.
Daly	PERSON	is not an absolute obscurity is that he has been made the subject of an article in '' The American Mag - azine , '' in the department , '' Interesting People . ''

		THE DIAL 11 A GALAHAD OF ART .

		* '' One day
Gabriel	PERSON	took me out in a cab it was a day he was rich , so we went in a han - som , and we drove and drove until I thought we should arrive at the setting sun and he said , ' You must know these people ,
Ned	PERSON	; you will see a painter there paints a queer sort oJ pictures , about God and Creation . ' ''

		So runs a note written in the late fifties by
Edward Burne-Jones	ORGANIZATION	.

		The painter of the `` queer sort of pictures , about God and Creation , '' to whom
Rossetti	PERSON	was carrying the young man , was
George Frederic Watts	PERSON	.

		And the end of that cab-ride through the west of
London	LOCATION	was the beginning of an affectionate intimacy between the two masters whose work forms the most precious heritage of later British art , an in - timacy that ceased only with the death of the younger ,
forty years later	DATE	.

		The two were singu - larly alike in character and aspirations . ''

		I have no politics , '' said
Burne-Jones	PERSON	, `` and no party , and no particular hope : only this is true , that beauty is very beautiful , and softens , and comforts , and inspires , and rouses , and lifts up , and never fails . ''

		Watts , as well , might have written these same words .

		It is not many years since Lady
Burne-Jones	PERSON	published the widely-read `` Memorials '' of her husband ; and now , with equal fidelity and equal charm , Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	has performed a like service for her hero and for us .

		Her '' Annals of an Artist 's Life , '' in two stately volumes , are ac - companied by a third containing
Watts	PERSON	's writ - ings , published and unpublished .

		The text is supplemented by thirty-nine finely-executed photogravure plates portraits of
Watts	LOCATION	, photo - graphs of his homes , reproductions of his work , etc. .

		It would be a great pity if the third vol - ume were not later reprinted in separate and cheaper form , that its sane and eloquent coun - sel might have the widest possible circulation .

		Although disclaiming even the most ordinary aptitude for literary expression , Watts yet wrote with a simple nervous force that some of the giants of literature might well have envied .

		The jargon and dogmas of the schools , the technical small-talk of the studio , were alike distasteful to him ; in his writing , as in his art - work , he concerned himself only with the fundamental *

		verities of art and life , dealing always with the two in relation to one great purpose the progress of humanity .

		Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	did not come into the artist 's life until that life had been more than two-thirds lived .

		Thus she has had to construct her record for the sixty-nine years previous to his second marriage from his own and others ' recollections .

		Her first volume , covering this period , is conse - quently far less interesting than the second .

		The authentic man scarcely begins to emerge from her pages until the point where she began to see him in the intimacies of every-day association .

		But throughout she has acquitted herself well , in what we can readily believe was a task of much difficulty and delicacy .

		We can point to no graver faults than a haziness of chronology , and an mdefiniteness in the use of pronouns .

		It may seem to some readers that the tone of unvarying praise is maintained at too high a pitch .

		But to his wife , as to all who knew him well ,
Watts	PERSON	was `` a spirit without spot '' ; and if there are no lower lights in these pages it is only because there were none in that life of radiant spiritu - ality which they record .

		Watts 's history is in the main a long and out - wardly uneventful chronicle of laborious days .

		Whole-hearted devotion to work was the law of his being , and to that law all other considerations and interests were made to conform .

		His boy - hood was devoid of advantages or happiness .

		He had little schooling , save what he obtained for himself from Homer and Phidias .

		But a habit of settled perseverance in cultivating natural talents made his progress rapid .

		In his early twenties he carried off first honors in an import - ant competition , and with the proceeds was en - abled to go to
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Here he spent four fruitful and happy years , mainly in
Florence	LOCATION	, where he was admitted at once to that intellectual Olympus of which Lord and
Lady Holland	LOCATION	were the reg - nant deities .

		Later , both before and after mar - riage , he made an occasional journey abroad to
Greece	LOCATION	, to
Egypt	LOCATION	, and again to
Italy	LOCATION	.

		But tor the most part his life was that of his studio , either in
London	LOCATION	or in
Surrey	LOCATION	, where he painted or chiselled almost unremittingly from dawn until the failing of the afternoon light .

		Those who sought him out , as did all the choicest spirits of his time , found him prodigal of hospitality ; yet he rarely appeared in society or in public .

		In ; his self-seclusion there was no slightest trace of doistered indifference to the ordinary concerns of mankind , few men , indeed , have been more : ully in touch with the spirit of their time .

		It was simply the necessary habit of a great worker 12 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, sternly aware , on the one hand , of life 's brevity , and , on the other , of the immensity and high seriousness of his task .

		To him the petty pull - ing and hauling of conventional `` social duties were a self - sacrilege to which he would not and could not submit .

		Nothing chafed him more than the time , so sorrowfully great in the aggre - gate , which he was forced to waste '' in being sick and getting well . ''

		Until within a few weeks of his death , at the age of eighty-seven , his working hours were those of the birds and flowers . ''

		He was always so glad when the day of work began , and the duty of a night 's rest had been got over .

		I often wondered at the quiet joy that seemed then to come to him ; but as the old Egyptian poet said , '' That trans - porteth man to God even the love of the work that he accomplisheth . ' '

		A new day , '
Signor	PERSON	said one early morning , ' let us begin our chant of praise for it and see how well we can praise . '

		On one cold
December	DATE	morning at five o'clock he awoke to say , ' Oh , I am so glad the night is passed . ' '

		Why ? '

		I asked , seeing that he had slept like a child . '

		Because I want to get to my work , ' he answered , and then , if ever , I understood the life and hope there is in all creative work .

		Nearing eighty , frail and delicate as he was , neither creature comforts nor even necessary rest were grateful to him when compared with this work , that in its nature partook of the creative and of the eternal . ''

		`` Signor , '' it should be mentioned parentheti - cally , was the name by which
Watts	PERSON	was always known to his intimates .

		He disliked the harsh and unpoetic sound of his own surname , and it was rarely used in his hearing .

		It is remarkable that one so often considered chiefly or solely in the capacity of portrait - painter should have found this work repugnant and considered that his forte lay elsewhere .

		In refusing a portrait commission , Watts once wrote to Mrs.
Cameron	PERSON	: `` Nature did not intend me for a portrait-painter , and if I have painted portraits decently it is because I have tried so very hard , but it has ever cost me more labour to paint a portrait than to paint a subject - picture .

		I have given it up in sheer weariness ; now come what may , my time must in future be devoted to the endeavour to carry out some of my large designs , and if I fail either to make a living or to do anything worthy of an artist -LRB- as I understand the term -RRB- , I fail , but I submit to the drudgery of portrait-painting no longer . ''

		Happily , this resolve was not kept ; and though the subject-pictures were ever foremost in his thoughts , he yet came to consider portraiture as a not uncongenial interlude between his higher tasks .

		Passionate devotion to his work and to the truth , humility and simplicity and generosity of spirit , these are the dominant character - istics of the man , as revealed in Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	's record .

		With whatever persistence he toiled , the largeness and splendor of his vision so out - distanced his achievement as always to leave him dissatisfied .

		`` I wonder how it is that I can not do what I want , '' he would say sadly , looking about his gallery at those marvellous portraits .

		Praise was distasteful and even painful to him .

		`` I have no more wish to be praised for .

		my work than a bricklayer who builds a wall expects praise for his brick-laying .

		If the wall answers a good purpose that is enough ; of course it should be built as well as possible so much a matter of course that praise should not be called for . ''

		But some lowly word of gratitude for courage and conso - lation derived from his pictures always touched him deeply . ''

		The whole reward of my life lies just in those few sentences , '' he said of one such message .

		Determined that the magnificent series of `` ethical reflections , '' as he called the subject-pictures which formed his principal life - work , should go as a heritage to the nation , he refused time after time the most extravagant offers from private sources ; though he was never wealthy , or even what might be considered well-to-do .

		Yet the free and willing service of his brush could invariably be counted upon in any high disinterested cause .

		Twice he was offered a baronetcy , and twice he refused , feel - ing that to one of his ascetic ways the title was an incongruity .

		`` So you wo n't let them make you Sir
George	PERSON	, '' remarked one of his friends . ''

		Well , never mind , you will be
Saint George	PERSON	, anyway . ''

		And
Saint George	PERSON	he will be , so long as nobility of character finds praise in the world .

		While the figure of her artist-husband is always to the fore in Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	's pages , his great contemporaries pass in shining procession across the background .

		Tennyson is the one we see most of , but
Ruskin	LOCATION	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Meredith	LOCATION	,
Gladstone	LOCATION	,
Burne	PERSON	-
Jones	PERSON	,
Leighton	PERSON	,
Rossetti	PERSON	, and a host of others show forth here and there in casual glimpses .

		Though he had always with - held from painting
Ruskin	PERSON	's portrait through fear of not being able to do justice to his sub - ject ,
Watts	PERSON	's regard and respect for the Master were unbounded .

		`` How earnestly he pleads for all that would develop the best in humanity , '' he said one day to his wife . ''

		In another gener - ation he will be placed as the greatest thinker of the age . ''

		Early in life
Watts	PERSON	had once , in a mood of depression , put the word ''
Finis	PERSON	'' in the corner of one of his pictures . ''

		But the challenge to despair was given by Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	, who , on reading the word , took up the charcoal and added beneath , ' et initium . '

		If the end , then a beginning ; and so it proved to be . ''

		It
1913	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 13 is interesting to note the painter 's dictum that of all his sitters our own Motley was by far the finest talker .

		Carlyle 's inveterate contempt for art crops out amusingly in his opinion of the Elgin marbles '' There is not a clever man amongst them all , and I would away with them , away with them into space . ''

		Here is a glimpse of ''
Signor	PERSON	'' himself , as well as of others , as they appeared to a visitor -LRB- Lady
Constance Leslie	PERSON	-RRB- at
Little Holland House	ORGANIZATION	in the earlier days : '' It was in
1856	DATE	, when we were first engaged to be married , that
John	PERSON	took me to what was to me a new world something I had never imagined before of beauty and kindness .

		I was a very ignorant little girl , and oh how proud I felt , though rather unworthy of what seemed holy ground .

		The
Signor	PERSON	came out of his studio all spirit and so delicate , and received me very kindly as
John	ORGANIZATION	's future wife .

		Thackeray was there with his young daughters ,
Coutts Lindsay	PERSON	,
Jacob Omnium	PERSON	, and Lady
Somers	PERSON	glorious and benevolent .


Signor	PERSON	was the whole object of adoration and care in that house .

		He seemed to sanctify
Little Holland House	ORGANIZATION	.

		I also remember well the
Sunday	DATE	,
June 13 , 1858	DATE	, when we were dining with the Prinseps ,
Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	, Ros - setti ,
Tom Taylor	PERSON	,
Adelaide Sartoris	LOCATION	,
Edward Burne	PERSON	-
Jones	PERSON	,
Coutts Lindsay	PERSON	, and
Richard Doyle	PERSON	.

		Adelaide
Sartoris	PERSON	sang his own poems to
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		In later years arose the vision of beauty , dear May Prinsep , and I remember seeing Val carry young
Philip Burne-Jones	PERSON	upstairs such a contrast !

		Val as St. Christopher ! ''

		And , for a final quotation , we select this char - acteristic anecdote of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, not long before his death , when poet and painter come together for the last time : '' We were at Farringford by eleven .

		Lady
Tenny	PERSON	- son greeted us as of old even more tenderly with eyes brimming with gratitude , and after a few minutes the poet joined us .

		There was talk of everything but painting , and later we all , save the dear lady on her sofa , walked back to the Briary through the sweet old - fashioned garden , gay with
spring	DATE	flowers .

		Signor and
Lord Tennyson	PERSON	walked in front , falling naturally into their old habits , recalling old days and stories that made them laugh .

		But the poet had had a letter from a stranger which had touched him where he was made vulnerable because made poet ; and he complained bit - terly of the intrusive writer , working himself up so much that in the end he exclaimed in answer to Signer 's remark that ' such intrusions were but the cost of fame ' ' I wish I had never written a line in my life . '

		Where - upon
Signor	PERSON	took up his parable and remonstrated , ' Ah , now you would not have made your
Arthur	PERSON	speak like that ! '

		And the great man instantly turned penitent , and putting out his hand , said , ' Well , there , look at my hand ; it is the gout ! ' ''

		Facing the beginning of each chapter throughout these volumes is a quotation , in all but two instances selected from
Watts	LOCATION	's own writings .

		One of the exceptions is this from
Bacon	LOCATION	: `` Certainly it is heaven upon earth , to have a man 's mind move in charity , rest in
Providence	LOCATION	, and turn upon the poles of truth . ''

		Such a mind , surely , was that of
George Frederic Watts	PERSON	; and it is the especial service of his wife 's record that through it we come to realize that however great he may have been as an artist -LRB- and he was one of the greatest of any country and any time -RRB- , he was still greater as a man .

		His was the Greek conception of all life as an organic whole , to the advancement and enrichment of which art was the highest instru - ment .

		The old heresy of `` art for art 's sake '' was never more effectually refuted than by his work and his life .

		In his old age he wrote : '' My great and ever constant desire is to identify artistic outcome with all that is good and great in every creed and utterance , and all that is inspiring in every record of heroism , of suffering , of effort , and of achievement . ''

		It could not lie within the powers of any man to realize single - handed that splendid ambition which was his of creating a great pictorial
House of Life	ORGANIZATION	, a temple in which should be visualized the entire story of man 's ethical progress ; yet he did at least succeed in raising a noble portico to such a temple , within whose shelter mankind will ever find much of its noblest inspiration and comfort .


WALDO K. BROWNE	PERSON	.

		Two ANTHOLOGIES .

		* Like the writing of history , the making of an anthology is a thing of chance and peril .

		It is a matter about which many people are almost vitally interested .

		We have been told that fam - ilies were broken up over the dispute whether Gray or
Collins	PERSON	was the greater poet , and there is no doubt that the question of the supremacy of Goethe or
Schiller	PERSON	has occasioned duels .

		The man who sets up as the arbiter of such matters makes himself a conspicuous mark for criticism .

		We may pity him as a martyr , but our hands instinctively proceed to pelt .

		It is a mark of a change in the temper of the times that the Universities have begun to patron - ize poetry .

		Mr.
Quiller	PERSON	- Couch 's '' Oxford Book of English Verse '' is succeeded by Mr.
Louns	PERSON	- bury 's ''
Yale Book of American Verse	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Mr.
Lounsbury	PERSON	has so many claims to distinction in other fields that reputation as the mere gatherer of a garland can mean little to him .

		The law of making a satisfactory anthology * YALE BOOK OF
AMERICAN VERSE	ORGANIZATION	.

		Edited by
Thomas R. Lounsbury	PERSON	.

		New Haven :
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE HOME BOOK OF VERSE , American and English , 1580-1912 .

		With an Appendix Containing a Few
Weil	PERSON	- Known Poems in Other Languages .

		Selected and arranged by
Burton Egbert Stevenson	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		14 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, is this : to give nothing but the best , to give all the best , and not to be swayed by historic esti - mate .

		Modified a little by his wish to arrange his flowers effectively , that is the law which Palgrave followed in his '' Golden Treasury . ''

		It can hardly be said that Mr.
Lounsbury	PERSON	has been so guided .

		He seems a little afraid of the reputations with which he is dealing , or else in - disposed to let any two or three poets dominate .

		As far as the eight or ten best-known American poets are concerned , Mr.
Lounsbury	PERSON	has given them about an even chance , given them equal compartments in his book .

		Our first protest must be in regard to the treatment of
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		There are hardly more than a scant half-dozen of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's poems which have the completeness and concreteness , the movement and the atmosphere , of a genuine lyric .

		Two of the best of these , '' Uriel '' and '' The Romany Girl , '' Mr.
Lounsbury	PERSON	omits . ''

		Brahma , '' '' The Concord Hymn , '' '' Days , '' and '' Rhodora '' are admitted .

		The rest of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's poetry consists of bundles of gnomic sentences or almost unrelated gatherings of nature pictures .

		But many of these sentences are such as the Arabs would have written in gold on the walls of their mosques ; and many of the pictures have a grace and magic unmatched in our literature .

		The coldness of English crit - ical opinion as to
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's poetry , as distin - guished from his poems , is remarkable .

		From
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	down to
Churton Collins	ORGANIZATION	there seems to be but one opinion .

		Yet Arnold 's say - ing that
Longfellow	PERSON	's '' Bridge '' or
Whittier	LOCATION	's '' School Days '' is of more poetic value than the whole of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's verse is one of his most extraordinary lapses of judgment .

		As well say that a symmetrical block of quartz is of more value than a spadeful of blue earth in which are embedded a hundred diamonds .

		Surely we can - not be wrong in
America	LOCATION	in recognizing the exultant and triumphant ring of so many of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's lines and passages , the purity and perfection of so many of his pictures .

		For the glory of our poetry what is needed to do in an American anthology is to throw aside for the nonce any strict definition of lyric verse and to give these treasures , either in their shapeless mould or broken from the matrix .

		We need `` Each and All , '' `` Destiny , '' '' Woodnotes , '' '' Ode to Beauty , '' '' Give All to Love , '' '' Mer - lin , '' `` Bacchus , '' `` Fate , '' ``
Boston	LOCATION	Hymn , '' `` Voluntaries , '' '' The Titmouse , '' `` Terminus , '' and probably a good deal more .

		Mr.
Louns	PERSON	- bury gives none of this .

		He does give '' The Humble-Bee '' !

		`` I do n't like ` The Humble - Bee , ' '' said
FitzGerald	PERSON	, and we think he was right .

		He also gives '' The Fable , '' which is pretty trivial , and '' To
Eva	PERSON	, '' which is abso - lutely bad .

		With the exception of Bryant in '' O Fairest of the Rural Maids , '' the older
New England	LOCATION	poets never succeeded in pieces of love , admiration , or gallantry , and
Emerson	PERSON	is the coldest of them all .

		Bryant is the second or third in rank of Ameri - can poets , and for Mr.
Lounsbury	PERSON	's treatment of him we have nothing but praise .

		It is admirable , adequate , very nearly all-embracing .

		We might plead for the admission of a few more pieces , so that he should not be overtopped in number or quantity by
Holmes	PERSON	and
Whittier	LOCATION	, but ' t is very well as it is .

		Not so in regard to
Poe	PERSON	.

		It is the bounden duty of an American anthologist to put his best foot foremost .

		To change the phrase ,
Poe	PERSON	is the best card he has to play .

		No contemporary in
England	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	quite matches him in emo - tional thrill , the secret of haunting cadence , verbal perfection , and newness of note .

		Of such things as these is lyric poetry made .

		We have pleaded for
Emerson	PERSON	because of his nobility of thought and vividness of phrase .

		But in a lyric anthology the sermon must give place to the song .

		The eight pieces of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	which Mr.
Lounsbury	PERSON	gives are well enough selected , if we are to have no more .

		But we ought to have more , and the best critical opinion justifies the demand .

		Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	apparently considered '' Israfel ''
Poe	PERSON	's finest piece .

		Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	includes in his `` Oxford Book of Verse '' the poems , `` To
Helen	PERSON	, '' ``
Annabel Lee	PERSON	, '' and `` For Annie . ''

		Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	and some of the younger English critics set up '' The City of the Sea '' as
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's supreme poem .

		The early '' Lenore '' and '' Bridal Ballad '' are unsurpassed in melody and shot through with emotion .

		The lines `` To Helen '' perhaps taught Tennyson the secret of lyric blank verse .

		All these should be given , not for
Poe	PERSON	's sake , but for the benefit of the anthology .

		We must question Mr.
Lounsbury	PERSON	's award of fame , his roll call of titles , in the case of one more poet , and then we are done with cavilling .

		Aldrich is perhaps the surest classic of the more recent names .

		Mr.
Lounsbury	PERSON	at most ignores the profounder side of his genius evidenced in the highly imaginative `` Identity , '' and the pathetically thrilling `` Prescience . ''

		He does not give the finely phrased `` Memory , '' which
Whittier	LOCATION	insisted on Aldrich repeating to him again and again ; nor the two sonnets , `` Sleep '' and `` Enamour 'd Architect of Airy Rhyme . ''


1913	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 15 `` Forever and a Day '' has an exquisite lyric movement , and `` Thalia '' is perhaps
Aldrich	PERSON	's masterpiece of gaiety ; yet neither is included .

		One considerable poet is entirely ignored .


Bayard Taylor	PERSON	's '' Arab Song `` is the fieriest love poem in American literature .

		And his '' Song of the Camp '' has a charm and naturalness which have made it a general favorite .

		One suspects a slight preference in Mr.
Lounsbury	PERSON	's mind for popular over classic verse .

		This comes out in the very full measure he has given to
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	, and
Holmes	PERSON	.

		It is equally evident in the preservation of many fugitive poems which have had a vogue in our country .

		Among these are
Butler	PERSON	's `` Nothing to Wear , ''
Lucy Larcom	PERSON	's `` Hannah Binding Shoe 's , ''
Lytle	PERSON	's `` Antony and Cleopatra , ''
Nora Perry	PERSON	's `` After the Ball , '' and
Emma Willard	PERSON	's `` Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep . ''

		The collection is partic - ularly rich in war poems .

		Nearly all of the best martial verse written in
America	LOCATION	is enshrined here , including
Halpine	PERSON	's `` The Thousand and Thirty-Seven , ''
Hoffman	PERSON	's `` Monterey , ''
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	's '' Battle Hymn of the Republic , ''
McMaster	PERSON	's ``
Carmen Bellicosum	PERSON	, ''
O'Hara	PERSON	's '' Bivouac of the Dead , ''
Palmer	PERSON	's ``
San Jacinto	LOCATION	'' and ''
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	's Way , ''
Randall	PERSON	's `` My
Maryland	LOCATION	, '' Read 's ``
Sheridan	PERSON	's Ride , ''
Shanly	PERSON	's `` Fancy Shot , '' and the anonymous '' Home Wounded . ''

		We miss
Timrod	ORGANIZATION	's '' Little
Giffen	PERSON	'' and
Stedman	PERSON	's `` Ossawatomie Brown . ''

		As poetry can hardly do anything better than record and inspire heroism , so a national an - thology can serve no better purpose than in enshrining such poems of valor and devotion .

		Mr.
Lounsbury	PERSON	is to be thanked for giving so many of them .

		He is to be thanked too , we think , for his decision to include humorous verse .

		There is , of course , a certain lowering of tone consequent on such inclusion , and the English anthologists have as a rule avoided it .

		Except in the work of
Burns	LOCATION	, humorous poetry rarely rises to the heights , and the very idea of an anthology of poetry is to keep in the region of the heights .

		But humorous verse is a strong feature of our literature .

		In what might be called team work ,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Aldrich	PERSON	,
Bret Harte	PERSON	, and
John Hay	PERSON	certainly outdo and outplay Hood ,
Praed	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and
Calverley	PERSON	.

		And that brings us to the final question , what is the value of American lyric poetry in comparison with the work of contemporary English authors ?

		In mass of good work and in the handling of large conceptions , the Victorian poets unquestionably surpass their American rivals .

		Not so in quality , in freshness of note , or in delicacy and perfection of handling .

		The Victorian age in poetry is itself secondary and immensely inferior to the Georgian epoch .

		Between two ideal anthologies , English and American , of the fifty years from
1830	DATE	on , we believe that the weight of merit would tremble in the balance .

		Mr.
Lounsbury	PERSON	's collection is not an ideal one , but it approximates to what could be wished .

		To turn from this volume to Mr.
Burton Egbert Stevenson	PERSON	's '' Home Book of Verse '' is like turning from a slender tributary into the main stream into a veritable
Amazon	LOCATION	of poetry .

		Here is the lyric work of eleven gener - ations of the English-speaking race .

		Thoughts , passions , deeds of uncounted myriads which have found embodiment in words of winged song are crowded between the covers of one book .

		Such a volume has long been desired .

		All previous single-volume anthologies have neces - sarily irritated by lack of completeness .

		They give us a gleaning , and not a full harvest .

		In this book , however , there is `` God 's plenty '' the abundance of the earth and of the sea .

		The volume itself is one of the most compact and admirable ever issued from the American press .

		Printed on
India	LOCATION	paper , the text in clear type , it contains with introduction and indices nearly four thousand pages .

		One is tempted to quote after Macaulay the fable of the
Peri Banou	ORGANIZATION	's tent .

		It opens up a vista of what may happen if this thin paper comes into general use : how libraries will shrink ; how we may almost be able to carry the literature of the world in one trunk .

		Of course the number of pages in the book is of less importance than what the compiler has done with them .

		The first question that comes up is his method of arrangement .

		Most pre - vious anthologies follow the plain and simple method of introducing the authors chronologi - cally , each one shepherding his separate flock of poems .

		This plan not only gives no scope for the compiler 's artistic feeling , but it is annoying to the reader as well .

		The continued change in theme and style compels sudden alterations in the focus of the mind 's eye .

		The original Greek Anthology made some attempt at groupings by kinds and subjects ; but we fancy that it was
Wordsworth	PERSON	's arrangement of his works into Poems of the Affections , Poems of Fancy , Poems of Imagination , and so forth , which gave the idea of a new method .

		Bryant and
Coates	PERSON	, in '' The Household Book of Poetry , '' followed this 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, system , and
Palgrave	PERSON	used it in an infinitely more subtle and effective way .

		Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's groupings are still more elaborate , and his head - ings and titular poems evince a high order of taste and poetic instinct .

		He begins with '' Poems of Youth and Age , '' to which he pre - fixes
Keats	PERSON	's sonnet '' The Human Seasons . ''

		The sub-titles of this section are '' The Baby , '' '' In the Nursery , '' '' The Road to
Slumberland	LOCATION	, '' `` The Duty of Children , '' '' Khymes of Child - hood , '' '' The Glad Evangel , '' '' Fairyland , '' '' The Children , '' '' Maidenhood , '' '' The Man , '' '' The Woman , '' '' Stepping Westward , '' and '' Looking Backward . ''

		We can not follow him through the divisions of the other sections , the '' Poems of Love , '' '' Poems of Nature , '' '' Familiar Verse , '' '' Poems of Sentiment and Reflection , '' and '' Poems of Sorrow , Death and Immortality . ''

		Enough to say that he has put a great deal of thought into the ordering of his selections , and has shown a nice sense of values in the juxtaposition of them .

		A burning question in regard to such a col - lection is the admission of living poets .

		Mr.
Lounsbury	PERSON	put his foot down firmly . ''

		Nobody shall enter here but the dead , '' he says , and this has been the general rule .

		That it is a correct one , can hardly be questioned .

		The living poets are unplaced they have no right to take their seats with the immortals .

		But popularity is the note of Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's book : popularity is indeed necessary to support so expensive an undertaking .

		Novelty is a great spur to pop - ularity , and if the compiler is willing to risk his critical reputation in crowning or rejecting his contemporaries , we do not know that it much matters .

		That he has diluted his wine with a good deal of water we certainly do not doubt .

		Pip 's friend in '' Great Expectations '' expati - ated to him on the advantages of '' having a margin . ''

		Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	has been rather ex - travagant in the security which his margin of
India	LOCATION	paper gave him , and he has had to curtail sometimes to his cost .

		After all , the great things are mostly here .

		We get the central glowing core of English song , and if this is surrounded by a nebulous envelope why , this last may some time condense into planets .

		A certain lack of proportion is a more serious fault of the book .


William Collins	PERSON	is given three selections , and
Thomas Haynes Bayly	PERSON	seven .

		Allowing for all possible divergencies of taste , there is not that difference .


Thomas Gray	PERSON	, also , is somewhat scanted in .

		his sizings .

James Russell Lowell	PERSON	has four - teen poems , and
Elizabeth Akers Allen	PERSON	has eleven .


James Clarence Mangan	PERSON	has only one poem to his credit , and Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	is not any too well represented by eight .

		We do not believe that the latter , however , would endorse this comparative award .

		Chatterton gets one ticket to immortality , while
Hartley Coleridge	PERSON	has eight a judgment which would make the elder

		Eleven of
Milton	LOCATION	's poems and sonnets are quoted , and sixteen of
Proctor	ORGANIZATION	's songs .

		Scott has seventeen pieces , and
Thomas Moore	PERSON	thirty-three .

		We might go on to a considerable extent ` in exhib - iting these incongruities , but it is not worth while .

		They tend , we think , to show that Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	draws rather towards the light and trivial than to the grave and weighty things of poetry , which is probably all the better for the popularity of his book .

		Coming down to more specific inclusions or exclusions , Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	seems to be somewhat prejudiced against the ode as a form of poetry .


Dryden	PERSON	's ``
Anne Killegrew	PERSON	, '' Gray 's `` Bard , ''
Collins	PERSON	's '' Ode to Liberty , '' '' On the Poetical Character , '' and the great '' Highland Ode , ''
Cole	PERSON	- ridge 's ``

Venice	LOCATION	'' and ``
Napoleon	PERSON	, ''
Tennyson	PERSON	's `` Death of the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	, '' and
Lowell	PERSON	's ''
Commemo	PERSON	- ration Ode '' are all omitted .

		That an American anthologist should fail to give the last seems almost incredible .

		Ballads fare better .

		Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	's
Oxford Book	ORGANIZATION	was overweighted with old English ballads .

		Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	gives quite as many of these , which his `` margin '' allows him to carry .

		He also gives a considerable number of modern ballads .

		Scott 's `` Cadyow Castle '' and `` Cara - doc '' are missing , however , and Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's `` Lady
Geraldine	PERSON	's Courtship , '' `` Rhyme of the Duchess
May	DATE	, '' and `` Bertha in the Lane . ''

		Some of us are disposed to think these the most valuable part of her work .

		Rossetti 's powerful ballad-poems are also omitted .

		Running over the greater poets of the book , we should quarrel with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's represen - tation , especially in the sonnets .

		Fifteen are given , and two or three times that number would not have been too many , even if some of the other sonnet-sequences , old or new , had to be cut short .

		Only three of
Milton	LOCATION	's pieces of this kind are here .

		The two men are the supreme masters of the two opposed sonnet forms .

		They sounded all the notes of those instruments , and they are entitled to be heard in full .

		He is the only one whose lyrical poetry raises him to the rank of a great creative artist .

		But of course the poems in which he displays this power , `` The Jolly Beggars , '' `` The Holy Fair , '' `` Holy
Willie	PERSON	's Prayer , '' and pieces of that kind , are unsuited to a compilation of home verse .

		A whole side of
Burns	PERSON	's genius is there - fore unrepresented by Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	, or repre - sented only by `` Tarn O'Shanter . ''

		Of all the poets in the book ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,

Keats	PERSON	show forth most adequately .

		The selec - tions from each one may fairly be accounted perfect .

		This is hardly the case with

		But the philosophical turn of his mind is practically ig - nored .

		Nothing of the earlier pieces of thought , '' The Two Voices , '' '' Palace of Art , '' '' Vision of Sin , '' is given , and nothing of `` In Memoriam . ''

		As the great skeptical poem of the age ,
Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	's `` Omar , '' is quoted in full , though only a translation , the utter rejection of `` In Memoriam , '' the poem of struggling faith , seems somewhat remarkable .

		THE ^ ESTHETIC SIDE OF BOOK-MAKING .

		* An impatient world can never quite under - stand the scholar 's reasons for not being in haste to give forth the knowledge he has pa - tiently accumulated .

		No other man perceives the limitations of that knowledge so clearly as he who knows more about his chosen subject than anyone else knows .

		value accuracy for its own sake .

		To yield any satisfaction the work must stand the test of the most exacting and captious criticism .

		It is in this spirit that Mr.
Alfred W. Pollard	PERSON	writes about `` Fine Books . ''

		The treatise that he contributes to the excellent series known as `` The Connoisseur 's Library '' has been ten years in preparation , and , within that period , much of it has been rewritten two or three times .

		The result of this scrupulous care is a volume which every collector of beautiful books and every student of the history of printing and of book-illustration must find indispensable .

		This , of course , is what might be expected from a scholar of Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	's reputation .

		Of his qualifications it is hardly necessary to speak , as they are so preeminent and so widely known .

		Not only is his whole life spent among the fine books in the library of the British Museum , of which he is one of the Assistant Keepers , but he is consulted by other students throughout the world , his facilities for keeping informed of every new discovery , whether of past or present achievement , are unexampled , and he is the author of a number of books about books and book-making , all of which stand deservedly high .

		The aim of the present work is a survey of the whole ground from the beginning of print - ing and printed book-illustration down to the present day .

		So far as printing is concerned , this aim has been carried out ; very fully in the case of books published in the fifteenth and six - teenth centuries ; somewhat less so when dealing with seventeenth and eighteenth century books , because of the smaller number having conspic - uous merit ; and rather cursorily in the case of nineteenth century books .

		To the author 's great regret , the survey of book illustration could only be brought down to about
1780	DATE	.

		A chapter in which he intended dealing with the development of this branch of his subject during the succeed - ing one hundred and thirty years had to be abandoned , as the extent of the material made it impossible to describe it within the limits set for the volume , or to complete the task '' during his working life . ''

		The plan of the book is most admirable .

		In a preliminary chapter on '' Collectors and Collecting '' some general considerations are presented , and a plea is made for intelligent collecting and specialization . ''

		The bare plea - sure of collecting for the sake of collecting '' is happily stigmatized as '' an ignoble delight in indulging acquisitiveness , redeemed to some extent by the higher pleasure of overcoming difficulties and observing the rules of the game . ''

		18 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, This is well said , and we may commend also the statement that `` the ignorant book collector , until he has educated himself , is like a rose - fancier who can not distinguish one odour from another . ''

		That students ' and collectors ' pre - dilections for particular things should be some - what disproportionate to their intrinsic import - ance he regards as quite natural .

		`` I myself am conscious , '' he tells us , `` that I have looked at so many fifteenth century woodcuts , as com - pared with other works of art , that I distinctly overrate them . ''

		And to this he adds : '' Mr.
Robert Proctor	PERSON	, who knew more about fifteenth century books than any other man has ever known , or is likely to know , once said to me in all seriousness , that he did not think he had ever seen an ugly one . ''

		The contention that age and rarity can lend little or nothing to the attractiveness of books that are otherwise uninteresting is a point well taken .

		The qualities which ought to appeal to the collector are strength and beauty of form , and associations , historical , personal , or purely literary .

		All these furnish legitimate sources of delight to the cultivated mind .

		With the literary considerations that bring books within the collector 's scope the author does not attempt to deal .

		Instead he confines his scrutiny , for the most part , to such volumes as are '' prized either for their typographical beauty , their place in the history of printing , or the charm of their illustrations . ''

		With this brief introduction Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	pro- ceeds to review the work of the printers who have turned out books of any distinction , and the various kinds of fine books that have been produced since movable types were invented .

		The classification is conveniently made by coun - tries and towns as well as by periods .


Illustra	ORGANIZATION	- tion is treated in separate chapters , a method that involves some repetition but makes for greater clarity .

		There is a chapter about block - books , and several chapters are devoted to incun - abula .

		This slang expression and the selection of the purely arbitrary date 1500 , `` used to invest all fifteenth century impressions with a mystic value , '' Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	properly character - izes as '' misleading nuisances . ''

		His account of the beginnings of printing is a model of what scholarly writing should be .

		The evidences are presented succinctly and clearly , and while in - dicating his views regarding them , the reader is never in doubt as to his openness of mind .

		Con - clusions upon doubtful points are either avoided or expressed with extreme caution , as in the case of the
Coster	PERSON	legend , which is examined at some length .

		Despite the untrustworthiness of the evidences upon which it is based , Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	finds it '' difficult to dismiss it as less than a legend which must have had some element of fact as its basis , '' and considers it probable that some kind of printing was practiced in
Holland	LOCATION	'' not long after
1440	DATE	. ''

		Strangely he omits any notice of the contracts discovered at
Avignon	LOCATION	in
1890	DATE	by the Abbe Requin , in one of which , dated
July 4 , 1444	DATE	, a jeweller of
Prague	LOCATION	, named
Procopius Waldfogel	PERSON	, then living in
Avignon	LOCATION	, mentions two alphabets in steel , two iron forms , one iron vise or press , forty-eight forms in pew - ter , and various other forms necessary for the art of '' writing artificially . ''

		Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	's account of the development of printing is in sufficient detail to indicate clearly the various influences that gave it direction .

		The extraordinary quality of the printing done by
Fust	ORGANIZATION	and Schoeffer he attributes to their deter - mination to rival the best shop-made manuscripts .

		When the printed book displaced the work of the scribe , the printers no longer had the same standard for a guide , and commercial reasons soon brought about a rapid deterioration of the product of their presses .

		`` One of the legacies which the early printers received from the scribes , '' as Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	is careful to point out , `` was the art of putting their text handsomely on the page , and the difference which this makes in the appearance of a book is very marked , little as many modern printers and publishers attend to it . ''

		He might , indeed , have put the case even more strongly .

		It is not too much to say that no book can be regarded as '' fine '' unless the margins are right .

		The proportions which the author gives for the relation between the printed text and the page upon which it appears are excellent , though he does not attempt more than a general statement , and he does not indicate the necessity that the diagonals should coincide , perhaps for the reason that they must do so if the rule that he lays down be followed .

		Regarding Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	's dictum that '' one of the chief charms of the books of the fifteenth century is that they are so unlike those of our own day , '' opinions may well differ .

		No person of taste will question , however , the justice of his condemnation of the types used by
Aldus	ORGANIZATION	, and of the mischievous effects that followed the intro - duction of italics by that printer .

		Similarly his strictures upon the defects of
Estiennes	ORGANIZATION	's royal Greek types , and upon the evil influence exer - cised by
Plantin	PERSON	, will meet with hearty approval .

		In regard to book-illustration the author has somewhat pronounced views .

		Without doubt
1913	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 19 he is right in feeling that if a book is to be in any sense a work of art , unity of effect is an essential .

		This rules out all plates and illustra - tions of any sort except such as can be printed with the text and are so designed as to harmonize with it .

		But as to this it is well to remember that the primary function of books is not to de - light the eye , and that illustrations of the sort Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	approves must of necessity be decor - ative rather than informing . ''

		Graingerism '' comes in for unqualified contempt .

		When a book has been loaded with extra illustrations it truly `` ceases to be a book at all and becomes a scrap-album of unharmonized pictures . ''

		Much of the value of Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	's text is due to his catholicity .

		He has not confined himself to descriptions of notably fine books , but has covered the whole field of book printing and illustration , even noticing the books printed by
Stephen Daye	PERSON	and others at
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts , in the seventeenth century .

		In his enumeration of several broadsides printed in
1643	DATE	,
1645	DATE	, and
1647	DATE	, and the almanacs for
1647	DATE	and
1648	DATE	, as the only known `` remnants of this stage of the press '' he has overlooked one important item , '' The Book Of General Lauues And Libertyes Concerning The Inhabitants of The
Massachusets	LOCATION	, '' which was printed at Cam - bridge in
1648	DATE	.

		A copy of this book turned up several years ago and was described at the time in the columns of '' The Nation . ''

		In one respect only does Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	's book invite criticism : the index is not as ample as it should be .

		It may be regarded as an amusing commen - tary upon the author 's dislike of `` plates '' and their protecting `` flimsies '' that both of these features should find a place in his book .

		The forty excellent collotypes , however , which repro - duce noteworthy examples of typography and early forms of illustration , will be appreciated by all who have occasion to consult this most excellent volume .

		A PL.EA FOR INDIVIDUALISM .

		* Born in
1859	DATE	in
Scotland	LOCATION	, the son of a battle - scarred survivor of the Indian Mutiny , and one of twelve brothers early forced to make their own way in the world , Mr.
James O. Fagan	PERSON	, after a considerable experience of travel and adventure and a variety of bread-winning occu - pations in
South America	LOCATION	,
South Africa	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	, will readily be believed to speak * THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF AN INDIVIDUALIST .

		By
James O. Fagan	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		from earnest conviction when he protests , as he does in '' The Autobiography of an Individual - ist , '' against that curbing of personal initiative which necessarily makes itself increasingly felt as a country grows older and its governmental machinery and code of laws and system of accepted conventions become more complex .

		His previous books , '' Confessions of a Railroad Signal-Man '' and `` Labor and the Railroads , '' have marked him as a man not afraid to do his own thinking and to speak his mind after he has done so .

		An anecdote from Mr.
Fagan	PERSON	's school days in
Manchester	LOCATION	will illustrate his early advocacy of fair play and equal opportunity for all .

		In a competitive examination that was to determine the ranking of the members of his class he was dumfounded , as he tells us , to see his most feared rival deliberately '' cribbing '' from a half - concealed translation under his desk-cover ; and as this was not only a piece of unfairness and dishonesty , but also directly opposed to the spirit animating the class as a whole , he at once rose in his place and asked the master whether it would be in order to expose a case of cheating .

		`` Most certainly , '' was the reply , whereupon the culprit was named , and without a word of excuse he bluntly and frankly acknowledged his guilt .

		His immediate expulsion from the room was followed by the cheering of the class , which , concludes the narrator , `` gave me instantly to understand that I had not been mistaken in my estimate of the class spirit . ''

		The story reads a little like ``
Tom Brown	PERSON	at Rugby , '' but one is glad to accept it as a real incident of school life .

		Mr.
Fagan	PERSON	wishes it understood that he is endeavoring `` to write not simply the ups and downs of a somewhat adventurous career , but the plain history of a passion . ''

		Illustrative of that passion is the following passage from the account of his life in the
Transvaal	LOCATION	in the days of the first Boer war for independence : '' For reasons , then , which may or may not be apparent to my readers , I was in sympathy with those dissatisfied
Boers	PERSON	and those heathenish Kaffirs .

		In my ignorance of , or dissatisfaction with Society , I suppose I failed to appreciate the forced relationship that , practically speak - ing , existed and exists between profession and expediency .

		My mind , at the time , was honestly crammed with pre - cepts , proverbs , texts , and old saws about liberty , the pursuit of happiness , human rights and property rights ; and with these fundamentals forever buzzing in my brain , I could not , for the life of me , account for the conduct of Europeans in
Africa	LOCATION	.

		From my point of view , then , with Christianity as a background , the excuse for the African wars was reduced to the simple objections of the ordinary traveler , that the Kaffir , as a rule , lacked soap , and the Boer forgot to shave . ''

		It is the latter part of the book , dealing with 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, the author 's life in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	as a railroad man , that is of especial importance and interest .

		First as a telegraph operator in a railway station , then as switchman in a tower of the '' interlock - ing '' sort at
West Cambridge	LOCATION	, afterward as office assistant in
Boston	LOCATION	, with sundry other duties and interests interspersed , he lived a busy life and evidently kept up a tremendous amount of thinking the while , with eyes and ears open to gather material for these excogitations .

		A self-imposed drill in the written expression of his thoughts and an occasional appearance in print were among the natural attendants and consequences of all this intellectual ferment .

		As a matter of course , the strenuous individualist in him protested against the increasing use of red tape and office machinery in railroad man - agement .

		The elimination of human personality and the substitution of a soulless system did not strike him as likely to make our railways more efficient or safer for public travel .

		Labor unions , too , he characteristically found to be more restrictive than helpful to the laborer .

		One pregnant paragraph well states his conclusions . ''

		From the point of view of the individualist , then , the tendency of modern industrial methods and legis - lation is to reenslave the world .

		To a great extent this conclusion is arrived at from a study of the excessive demands and unfair policies of organized labor .

		The first item in this modern industrial programme is the surrender of the individual workinginan .

		He is called upon to sink his industrial personality and to stifle his industrial conscience in the interests of his union or his class .

		This class doctrine is not hidden under a bushel .

		It is proclaimed at every labor meeting , you read it in countless books , it is openly preached on street corners and in all public places of assembly .

		Finally the move - ment receives support from an army of well-meaning reformers , the victims of imaginative sociology , who are next in turn to be doctored personally and profes - sionally by some of their own theories . ''

		A knotty problem , surely , is this question of just how much external control is good for a person and for society in a civilization of twentieth-century complexity .

		Those who think we are suffering from over-legislation will enjoy much that Mr.
Fagan	PERSON	the individualist has to say in his book ; and they should also at the same time read , in the current ''
Hibbert	PERSON	Journal , '' Mr.
L. P. Jacks	PERSON	's leading article on '' Democracy and Discipline . ''

		Mr.
Fagan	PERSON	's book , treating intelligently as it does questions of present concern and growing importance , and written in a frank and engag - ing style that reveals in a most interesting way the dominant traits of a strong personality , is a refreshing and invigorating contribution to auto - biographical literature .

		p ERCy R BlCKNELL > THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD IN
AMERICAN HISTORY	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The third volume of Professor
Edward Chan	PERSON	- ning 's `` History of the
United States	LOCATION	'' brings the narrative from the quarrels over the `` writs of assistance '' in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and the `` Par - son 's Cause '' in
Virginia	LOCATION	through the American Revolution to the end of the government of the
United States	LOCATION	under the Articles of Confedera - tion .

		The treatment as a whole is developed from the thesis laid down at the conclusion of the second volume : that differing environment , acting upon an English stock already strongly affected by foreign admixture and by dissent from the established church of the home country , produced a second nation , which the imperialist ideals that dominated the British official circles of that day were not great enough to hold under a common government , and which was sacrificed to the commercial selfishness of the English people , in the narrower sense of that term .

		It is in .

		the emphasis which Professor Chan - ning gives to this element of commerce and in the freshness of his treatment that this exposi - tion of the principles and acts of the Revolution is most strikingly differentiated from the other general histories of this period .

		This may be deduced by comparing with the older accounts Professor
Channing	PERSON	's discussion of the Towns - hend Acts , the commerce of the colonies in
1771	DATE	,
Lord North	ORGANIZATION	's Tea Act of
1773	DATE	, and , above all , the trade of the .

		colonies and States with the
West India Islands	LOCATION	.

		This last topic is made prominent more than once : and of particular interest and value are the facts derived from the author 's exploitation of the shipping-lists of
St. Eustatia	LOCATION	and
St. Martin	LOCATION	, fortunately preserved at
The Hague	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nowhere are the commercial power of
England	LOCATION	and her vexatious use of it brought out more clearly , and the influence of economic considerations in bringing the war to an end .

		In many histories of the Revolution written by American authors , military affairs have loomed over-large .

		To this failing Professor Channing in no wise yields .

		The pages which he gives to the war on land and sea constitute something less than one-third the volume , and his handling of this theme is characterized by a judicious restraint .

		His most sweeping generalization we quote , and leave judgment thereon to the mili - tary critics . ''

		THE DIAL 21 of the spectacular ... No remarkable soldier emerges from the conflict , for
Washington	LOCATION	was a moral force rather than a general ; and of second - rate characters
Nathaniel Greene	PERSON	, alone , shines conspicuous .

		On the British side ,
Howe	PERSON	,
Clin	PERSON	- ton ,
Burgoyne	PERSON	, and the rest were mediocre men . ''

		As between
North and South	ORGANIZATION	, there is happily no sectional bias .

		Of the first attack upon the South , Professor
Channing	PERSON	says : '' At
Moore 's Creek	ORGANIZATION	and
Sullivan	PERSON	's Island the
Carolinians	LOCATION	turned aside the one combination of circum - stances that might have made British conquest possible . ''

		It may be questioned , however , whether the war in the
West	LOCATION	receives quite its fair share of notice .

		To the battle of
Benning	LOCATION	- ton , Professor Channing devotes three pages , and ten more to the rest of the
Saratoga	LOCATION	cam - paign : but the description of the battle of
King 's Mountain	ORGANIZATION	, which Professor
Channing	PERSON	calls `` the severest action of the war since Bunker Hill , '' fills but twenty-five lines .

		In the former case the movements of Colonel
Seth Warner	PERSON	and
John Stark	PERSON	are duly particularized ; but as to the latter , the reader is left to guess who '' Sevier ,
Shelby	PERSON	, and
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	'' may have been , for nothing more is told of them , before or after .

		Equally indefinite is the account of
Lord Dun	ORGANIZATION	- more 's War .

		The importance of the work of
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	is , indeed , made clear by Professor Chan - ning , who calls attention , however , to the fact that , in the negotiations which led up to the treaty of peace , he has found no allusion to this conquest of the western country .

		As to those negotiations , the author holds that the American commissioners were entirely justified in break - ing their instructions and in proceeding to the separate treaty with
England	LOCATION	, and that
Jay	PERSON	was rightly suspicious of the designs of
France	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	.

		For the presentation of the opposite view Professor Channing refers the reader to Professor
McLaughlin	PERSON	`` in his volume in
Hart	PERSON	's American Nation Series , '' which , somewhat curiously , appears to be the only mention of that important work in any of Professor Chan - ning 's ample and helpful bibliographical notes .

		Finally , in this connection , it may be noted that Professor Channing opposes the traditional view that the `` three remarkable Americans '' outwitted `` the complaisant
Oswald	PERSON	and the second-rate Strachey , '' and points to the very apologetic tone adopted by the commissioners themselves when they communicated the Treaty to
Livingston	PERSON	.

		Having disposed of the Treaty and the dis - banding of the army , the author passes to an enlightening account of the economic adjust - ment necessitated by the Revolution , emphasiz - ing , as we have said above , the activities of commerce .

		The succeeding chapters are devoted to political and constitutional developments , and here one begins to feel a sense of compression and omission which accompanies one to the end of the book .

		The analysis of the
State	ORGANIZATION	constitu - tions and the Articles of Confederation is brief , as is that of the financial history of the Confeder - ation and the effort to invest
Congress	ORGANIZATION	with a power to regulate commerce .

		The author then proceeds to a longer detailed narrative of the events which led up to the meeting of the Con - vention at
Annapolis	LOCATION	and to that at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	the next year , devoting some space to
Pelatiah Webster	PERSON	's pamphlet , to the ideas of
Madison	PERSON	and
Washington	LOCATION	, and to the stern realities of
Shays	ORGANIZATION	's rebellion .

		The entire account of the Constitution , the Convention which framed it , and the struggle to secure its ratification by the States , is compressed within the limits of a single chapter .

		Ten pages of this , or quite one - third of the whole , is taken up with
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	and its right to declare void statutes contrary to the Constitution .

		Much of this discussion , a reflection , without doubt , of that which has lately been evoked by Dean
Trickett	PERSON	and Mr.
Justice Clark	PERSON	, might well have been relegated to a foot-note or deferred until the occasion shall arise for an account of the case of
Marbury vs. Madison	ORGANIZATION	, for there remains to Professor Channing but little space in which to tell of the chronology and the inner workings of the Convention .

		Somewhat unusually , the treatment of the
Northwest Ordinance	ORGANIZATION	is taken up after that of the Constitution , an arrange - ment which would be entirely justified if the account of land matters in
1783	DATE	and
1784	DATE	were given more space and greater clarity .

		The explanation of the differing land-systems of the East and the South is , indeed , quite sufficient , but the relation of the land question to the general political and economic situation is not so fully brought out .

		In his final chapter , as is his wont , Professor Channing sums up the results attained during the period covered by the volume , with an interesting series of notes upon the social rela - tions of the new
United States	LOCATION	.

		He thus passes in review the topics of immigration , slavery , religion , education , and penal reform , closing with a very proper tribute to the great - ness of the accomplishments of the men of the generation which he has been describing .

		Thus is brought to its end another instalment of a 22 THE DIAL , -LSB-

		Dr.
Lumholtz	PERSON	visited the region chiefly for the purpose of reporting upon its economic possibilities , and his report on these conditions is hopeful .

		The mineral prospects are great ; more of the region could be brought under cultivation than people now realize , and the problem of water could be readily solved as soon as the need arose .

		While making these observations he frequently refers to the extraordinary adaptation of the plant and animal life to the arid conditions of the region , and notes certain indigenous edible plants which might be success - fully introduced into other arid countries .

		Among these is the '' root of the sand , '' which is especially grateful to the thirsty man and quickly appeases his hunger .

		Dr.
Lumholtz	PERSON	's chief delight seems to have been his life in the open , and he imparts to his reader some of his enthusiastic love of nature even as exhibited in desert places .

		To him `` the desert is radiant with good cheer ; superb air there certainly is , and generous sunshine ; and the hardy , healthy looking plants and trees , with their abundant flowers , inspire courage .

		One feels in communion with na - ture , and the great silence is beneficial . ''

		That this writing of trees and flowers in desert places is no contradiction in terms , Dr.
Lumholtz	PERSON	clearly shows in his botanical notes upon no less than twenty-five indigenous flowering plants .

		Scarcely less keen is his delight in being able to study the

		As with the Tarahumaras ten years previously , he entered fully into their life , worked his way into their method of thought and feeling , attended their great annual festival when the sahuara wine is made , talked with their medicine men , visited at some personal risk many of their secret places , and enlarged his collection of ethnological specimens .

		He regrets that in the contact with the higher civilization to which the Papagos are now being subjected , they are suffering deterioration both mor - ally and physically ; and he cites the fact that in a certain school for Indians , ninety per cent of the children have tuberculosis , in a region where , be - fore the effort to educate the Indians in insanitary school-houses , tuberculosis was unknown .

		The book contains numerous maps and colored plates , besides photographic illustrations to the number of a hun - dred or more .

		The vocabularies of the
Papago	LOCATION	,
Pima	LOCATION	, and
Cocopa Indians	ORGANIZATION	are of great scientific value ; while the text as a whole is written in such pleasing style as to make it of deep interest to the general reader .

		She is a native of
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and was married in
1861	DATE	to
Charles Moulton	PERSON	, a wealthy banker 's son resident in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Possessed of a remarkable singing voice , a charm - ing personality , and a great love of society , Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	was a social favorite in half a dozen coun - tries .

		Lowell ,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Garcia	PERSON	, and
Delsarte	PERSON	were her teachers ;

Gautier	PERSON	and Prince Oscar of
Sweden	LOCATION	were admirers who celebrated her beauty and talents in verse ;
Napoleon III.	PERSON	,
Garibaldi	PERSON	, and
Bancroft	PERSON	were her hosts .

		From the first page of her book , in which we find Professor Agassiz lecturing on `` trilobites and different fossils '' in his private school in Cam - bridge , while the young ladies `` try to imitate his funny Swiss accent , '' to the last , in which we find
Sarah Bernhardt	PERSON	, dressed in white trousers and jacket and smoking cigarettes constantly , engaged in modeling a bust of Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	's little daughter -LRB- `` not a very good likeness '' -RRB- , we are continually in the presence of notables , viewing them , however , always somewhat ironically and as material for bans mots .

		There are many professional humorists who might envy Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	's happy style and quick instinct for the ridiculous .

		Letters which lay such stress on the cheerful side of life naturally pass by the serious , much more the melancholy , with as little attention as possible .

		These memories cover the period of the American Civil War , the ill-starred expedition of
Maximilian	PERSON	, the Austrian and
Franco	PERSON	- Prussian Wars , not to speak of greater movements which touched her world less closely ; yet only two of these are mentioned , she speaks of the siege of

		Thus her volume is not , in even an approach to the degree in which such books usually are , an inside view of great events ; it is small talk , pure and simple , though always vivacious and usu - ally interesting .

		More of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's `` A monstrously lazy man lives in
South Bucks	LOCATION	partly by writing a col - deiectabie trifles .

		umn in the
Saturday	DATE	Daily News . ''

		Thus Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	describes himself in `` The Real Journalist , '' one of the several delightful papers of his new volume , `` A Miscellany of Men '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		Thousands of lazy busy men rejoice that one lazy man has the congenial task of writing such fetching discursions as these .

		In the preface to his new col - lection of mots , Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, though flashing and dimpling as ever , shows some inclination to regard his work more seriously than has been his wont .

		He seems to feel the necessity of offering excuses for his polemics , saying there are three kinds of writers : those who write superlatively well , those who write abominably , and those who write , to which latter class he says he belongs .

		He writes just because he can .

		Now the reader is inclined to differ on two counts .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	does not merely write : he writes unusually well .

		He is too modest and minifies his style , that is the reader 's first point of order .

		The second is that he magnifies his themes .

		No one would suspect , from reading these sketches , that the author was trying to do anything more serious than play the wise delicious fool in his old fashion .

		It must be admitted , however , that the polemic spirit here and there manifest does prevent `` A
Miscel	PERSON	- lany of Men '' from attaining the uniform charm of `` Alarms and Discursions , '' for instance .

		Some of the papers , like '' The Man Who Thinks Backwards , '' `` The Poet and the Cheese , '' `` The Architect of
Spears	PERSON	, '' and `` The Medieval Villian , '' show Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	at his best .

		Others , like `` The
Aristo	ORGANIZATION	- cratic ` Arry , '' fall decidedly below his best , and serve as a reminder that even Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	is no better than Homer .

		Possibly this master of
Topsyturvy	ORGANIZATION	- dom would be surprised and not entranced at being placed in the literary pigeon-hole with
Milton	PERSON	and
Bunyan	PERSON	; still his readers will not be startled at the comparison .

		He , like those mighty Puritans , is ever an Allegorist .

		The formula for almost every essay in the present volume is the same : a story , an ex - perience , and the deeper meaning .

		Sometimes that meaning is fanciful and vague ; sometimes it is child - ish ; but always it is surprising and suggestive .

		One other thing perhaps the critic of the future will point out .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	has performed a mighty feat of literary construction .

		He has carried the formula of the story over into the essay .

		In these sketches it is surprise , contrast , aposiopesis , the distinctive weapons of fiction , that compel us willy-nilly .

		Octogenarian reminiscences Caustic comment on men and insti - tutions as he has seen them in a long and reflections .

		and unusua ll y act i ve life is found in abundance in Mr.
Hubert Howe Bancroft	PERSON	's '' Retro - spection , Personal and Political '' -LRB-
Bancroft Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which , whether by chance or design , came from the press in the very month that marked its author 's completion of his eightieth year .

		That he is fearless and outspoken in this as in former utterances , his readers hardly need to be assured .

		A few of the topics and headings noted in the table of contents will indicate the book 's character .

		History , auto - biography , political philosophy , prophecy , and much else , go to make up the five hundred and fifty compactly printed pages of this noteworthy volume , whose chapters deal with such themes as the dark age of graft , the injustice of law , the evolution of high crime , the vagaries of society , waste in educa - tion , modern journalism , the throes of labor ,
Asia	LOCATION	and
Africa	LOCATION	in
America	LOCATION	, progressive government , and the significance of the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal .

		On the ques - tion of admitting cheap labor from
Asia	LOCATION	the author expresses himself at some length in its favor , remark - ing near the end that '' anything is better than the continuation of this dog in the manger policy of union labor , which will neither do the necessary work of the nation and of its people , nor permit others to do it . ''

		The best things in the book , unless one 's chief delight lies in controversy and caustic criticism , are the pages from the writer 's own life , telling of his birth in
Ohio	LOCATION	, his migration to
California	LOCATION	, his build - ing up of his famous library there , and the planning and writing of his long series of western - American histories .

		The vastness of this latter undertaking , and the amount of labor and travel and gathering of material that it involved , impress the reader and hold his willing attention .

		The chapters treating of the
California	LOCATION	gold-mining days , of the settling of
Granville	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, by some of the author 's progenitors and others , of his experiences as '' an artless adven - turer '' in the far West , of the evolution of his library , and his methods of writing history , are well worth reading .

		The style is that of a rapid and prolific writer , effective for the ends in view , and having the admirable qualities of strength and clearness .

		Its occasional defects of sentence-construction are readily pardoned in one who obviously has no time to waste in pondering his periods . ''

		Retrospection '' is as rich and enjoyable a volume of its sort as one could reasonably desire .

		The child records not what he really thinks but what he thinks he ought to think , and the inci - dents in his small world are set down with little regard to form or finish .

		Rarely , indeed , is such a record worthy of preservation .

		An exception must be made , however , in the case of a diary written between the years
1852	DATE	and
1872	DATE	by a school-girl , 24 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	,
Caroline Cowles Richards	PERSON	, and now published under the title `` Village Life in
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		Left motherless at the age of seven , the writer was one of four children sent to live with their grandparents .

		At ten , she looks back on this `` past , '' and even indulges in a philosophy of life in this fashion : '' People must think this is a nice place for children , for they had eleven of their own before we came .

		Mrs.
McCoe	PERSON	was here to call this afternoon and she looked at us and said : ' It must be a great respon - sibility , Mrs.
Beals	PERSON	. '

		Grandmother said she thought ' her strength would be equal to her day . '

		This is one of her favorite verses .

		She said Mrs. McCoe never had any children of her own and perhaps that is the reason she looks so sad at us . ''

		At the age of eleven , the diarist makes acquaintance with `` Gulliver 's Travels , '' but under certain restrictions .

		`` There is a gilt picture on the green cover of a giant with legs astride and little Lilliputians standing underneath who do not come up to his knees .

		Grandmother did not like the picture , so she pasted a piece of pink calico over it , so we could only see the giant from the waist up .

		I love the story of Cinderella and the poem `` Twas the night before
Christmas	DATE	, and I am sorry that there are no fairies and no
Santa Claus	LOCATION	. ''

		A good many dignified , amusing , and remarkable personages , the school - girl 's contemporaries , teachers , or friends , are pic - tured in these pages , in a manner at once artless and shrewd ; and when we recall how eventful were the two decades between
1852	DATE	and
1872	DATE	there is a special satisfaction in seeing the spirit of that time so skilfully set forth in the record of this quick - witted young person who is so very different from her prototype of to-day .

		There is scarcely another practical p roblem in social c .

		ontro1 .

		that de - serves a larger consideration and a truer scientific understanding than the problem of alcohol ; and there is none that receives less , none that is more beset with prejudice and ignorance and mis-statement and all the evils of irrational prop - agandism .

		For this reason alone Dr.
G. E. Part	PERSON	- ridge 's '' Studies in the Psychology of Intemperance '' -LRB-
Sturgis & Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- deserves a large circulation .

		May it receive the benefit of the feeling of good will which its appearance at this time invites !

		It is composed of one-fifth practical advice , and four-fifths investigation of the facts of the case for and against alcohol .

		This is quite the reverse of the usual pro- cedure , which upon slight basis of knowledge and that both selected and distorted grows eloquent in prescription and proscription , intolerant of opposi - tion , and suspicious of motives .

		It becomes evident from Dr.
Partridge	PERSON	's volume that the craving for alcohol is largely a myth , and its relation to moral obliquity a distortion .

		Its use is no more a besetting sin than is its avoidance an index of virtue or capa - city .

		The leading nations are the largest consumers of alcohol .

		Even more fundamental is the fact that the alcohol habit represents an inherent expression for the life abundant ; an understanding of the prac - tical problem of its regulation must not ignore nor yet distort the actual facts of its use and abuse .

		This refers not alone to the stultifying inclusion of a chap - ter on alcoholic abuse in text-books for babes , but to the equally intolerant attitude of reformers impressed by evils which they do not understand .

		To one and all a volume of this kind has an important service to perform .

		As an antidote to the unreason circulated in regard to alcoholic poisoning , this book may be highly recommended .

		It is important not because it offers a new view of the effects or a new remedy for the abuses , but because it offers the basis for an understanding of the problem , whatever may be the solution in this or that environment .

		It also pro- vides for a reasonable attitude towards regulation , which means that it is an instrument of sanity and not of prejudice .

		Adventures and Life is tame and monotonous in our explorations in well-regulated civilization when com -
oia Babylonia	LOCATION	.

		p are -LRB- j w ith such experiences as those described by Dr.
Edgar J. Banks	PERSON	, in his `` Bismya , or The Lost City of Adab '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		After a most extraordinary game of battledoor and shuttle - cock with the Turkish government for three exas - perating years he finally secured in
1903	DATE	, practically at the demand of an American battleship , a permit to excavate for two years in
Babylonia	LOCATION	.

		He went out as
Field Director	ORGANIZATION	in
Babylonia	LOCATION	of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such a story of Turkish intrigue , offi - cial graft , chronic dilatoriness , and resourcefulness in piling up obstructions , has rarely appeared in print .

		Dr. Banks had to encounter almost incredible cunning and duplicity on the part of many of the persons and officials with whom he had to deal .

		After some months of hard desert travel and Turk - ish official delays , he reached
Bismya	LOCATION	, the old Baby - lonian ruin which he was to excavate , in
December 1903	DATE	.

		It lies about eighty miles southeast of the site of old Babylon , and about 120 miles nearly south of
Bagdad	LOCATION	, and about twenty-eight miles southwest of Nippur where the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	has been digging up treasures since
1888	DATE	.

		Bismya is a collection of mounds about a mile long by half a mile wide .

		Dr. Banks , with his company of officials , attendants , and workmen , prosecuted excavations in this mass of ruins for nearly six months in
1903-4	DATE	.

		He brought to light some notable archaic remains , particularly a marble statue of very ancient type , though this is not , as he claims , '' the oldest statue in the world . ''

		He likewise uncovered quantities of cuneiform tablets from the Sumerian age , many of them `` contracts , '' and also seal cylinders , rings , vases , pottery , tombs , drains , and small statues .

		The temple foundations were also laid bare , revealing one of the primitive types of that important part of an ancient city .

		We must challenge the ancient name of the city in the sub-title ; the real name found in the inscriptions is Ud-nun -LRB- - ki -RRB- , not Adab .

		The book is most interestingly written , and is illu - mined by numerous illustrations .

Ralph Waldo Emerson	PERSON	, under Journals .

		t jj e care f u l editorship of Dr.
Edward Waldo Emerson	PERSON	and Mr.
Waldo Emerson Forbes	PERSON	, goes steadily forward , the latest instalment covering the years
1845 55	DATE	in two volumes of substantial bulk .

		In richness of thought and in freedom and beauty of expression these volumes , showing their author at or near the prime of his powers , are even more enjoyable than their predecessors .

		His second visit to
Europe	LOCATION	, 184748 , falls within the period covered by the first of these two volumes , and furnishes matter for note - worthy comment and shrewd observation .

		Of
Carlyle	PERSON	he takes occasion to say , after renewing his acquaint - ance with the
Chelsea	PERSON	sage : `` An immense talker , and , altogether , as extraordinary in that as in his writing ; I think even more so .

		You will never discover his real vigor and range , or how much more he might do than he has ever done , without seeing him ... He is not mainly a scholar , like the most of my ac - quaintance , but a very practical Scotchman , such as you would find in any saddler 's or iron-dealer 's shop , and then only accidentally and by a surprising addi - tion the admirable scholar and writer he is . ''

		Note also this : ``
Carlyle	PERSON	and his wife live on beautiful terms .

		Their ways are very engaging , and in her bookcase all his books are inscribed to her , as they come from year to year , each with some significant lines . ''

		A chance definition that catches the eye on a later page is worth quoting : '' Culture teaches to omit the unnecessary word and to say the greatest things in the simplest way . ''

		Illuminating and often amusing are
Emerson	PERSON	's keen criticisms of his inti - mate friend
Alcott	PERSON	, to whose foibles he was by no means blind , highly though he esteemed that inef - fectual genius .

		Of
Thoreau	PERSON	, too , he has considerable to say , and of
Ellery Channing	PERSON	, and others whom we are glad to look at anew through his eyes .

		Six por - traits add to the interest of these volumes ; they show us Emerson himself in
1846	DATE	,
Carlyle	PERSON	in the same year ,
Samuel Gray Ward	PERSON	,
Ellery Channing	PERSON	,
Margaret Ful	PERSON	- ler
Ossoli	PERSON	, and
Charles King Newcomb	PERSON	.

		The syn - optical tables of contents and the page-headings serve , as in the earlier volumes , to direct the reader quickly to what will most interest him .

		It may come with a sense of surprise TWO histories ^ many readers that the discipline .

		.

		with which we associate the novelty of experimental investigation by laboratory methods should have a history that requires volumes to set forth .

		Yet here are two works -LRB- and others are announced -RRB- dealing with the historical aspects of Psychology .

		Mr.
G. S. Brett	PERSON	's `` History of Psy - chology '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is confined to the ancient and patristic field , and reaches nothing later than
Augustine	PERSON	.

		The other , a translation of Professor
Max Dessoir	PERSON	's `` Outlines of the History of Psy - chology -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , though it spans the ages from the beginning of thinking to the present in the com - pass of 250 pages , is itself an abridgment of a much larger work .

		The two books are clearly not com - parable in any manner .

		Yet they both reflect a growing interest in the historical antecedents of present-day interests .

		It can not be said that the genealogy in the direct line is clearly determined .

		The records are very largely devoted to collateral issues .

		The psychological eddy is commonly lost in the philosophical stream .

		This is less notable near the sources , and particularly in the refreshing Greek sources where psychological interests emerge clearly , and are often prophetically suggestive .

		For the most part the interest in such volumes as these must be sustained by the collateral interest in phil - osophy ; and the message for the modern student of psychology remains incidental .

		But history is ever dominant because irrevocable , and the development of the human interests of which we are the heirs whatever our specialties is a matter of moment .

		It is fortunate that records of this kind are now available to English-reading students .

		True to their several traditions , the native English product is more readable , is addressed more to the scholar , and re - flects a more sensitive sense of proportion ; while the translated volume is more in the nature of a student 's manual with didactic intent , overrates the Teutonic contributions , is less catholic , and less attractive in its presentations .

		Gleanings from Mr -
Lawrence J. Burpee	PERSON	is the com - the literature piler and sympathetic editor of six of
Canada	LOCATION	.

		ii tt j e volumes published by the Musson Book Company of
Toronto	LOCATION	, '' -LSB- Canadian Eloquence , '' `` Canadian Essays , '' `` Canadian Sonnets , '' `` Flowers from a Canadian Garden , '' `` Songs of French Canada , '' and `` Fragments of
Sam Slick	PERSON	. ''

		The contents are apparently well chosen that is to say , they include representative work of the Canadian writers with whom an American reader is likely to be familiar , and a considerable number of interest - ing selections from men less widely known on this side of the border .


Thomas Chandler Haliburton	PERSON	, the only author who is awarded an entire volume , occupies a place in all discussions of American humor , yet the `` Sam Slick '' sayings here collected may surprise many readers by their variety and their cleverness .

		The songs of French
Canada	LOCATION	are inter - esting for their content , but they suffer , as all songs must , from translation .

		Perhaps the least satisfac - tory volume is `` Canadian Eloquence . ''

		Few of the orations by white Canadians are remarkable , and the speeches , or supposed speeches , of
Tecumseh	LOCATION	,
Logan	LOCATION	, and other Indian chiefs seem like padding .

		The sympathetic American reader of the series is likely to make two observations : that Canadian literature is strongly and frankly provincial , and that provincialism in literature is not , after all , such a bad thing .

		There is not a great poem in the ``
Cana	LOCATION	- dian Sonnets '' or the '' Flowers from a Canadian Garden '' ; but , on the other hand , there is nothing of the `` strain and rage , '' the obvious striving to be distinctive , which characterizes so much recent verse-making .

		One finds a quiet pleasure in reading these little anthologies which is notably different 26 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, from the effect produced by the writings of recent English or American poets of equal rank .

		The indi - vidual volumes are attractively printed and daintily bound .

Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the true American is fond of superlatives .

		To assert our Americanism , let us hasten to say that Dr.
Crothers	PERSON	has once more demonstrated that of all living American essayists he is the most delightful .

		Most humanly does he speak wisely and humorously .

		His range of topics , in his latest collection , is for the most part restricted -LRB- if that is the word -RRB- to the American temperament of our day and of the new day shining before us dimly and tantalizingly .

		`` That the old order is passing is obvious enough .

		That a new order is arising , and that it is on the whole benefi - cent , is not merely a pious hope '' with this inspir - iting conviction does Dr.
Crothers	PERSON	write of modern
America	LOCATION	.

		Of the nine essays , we single out `` In the Hands of a Receiver '' as the freshest , wittiest , and most penetrating .

		-LRB- How insistent is that in - stinct for the superlative ! -RRB-

		In this essay we are introduced to the inimitable Bagster , who is busy reforming everything and everybody save himself , who bids us '' concentrate on every point , '' and who writes the '' Song of Obligations , '' in the manner of Whitman , containg one perfect if unpoetic line : `` The duty of doing your Christmas shopping early enough in

Salem	LOCATION	, the city where the author of '' The Scarlet Letter '' was born , and where that masterpiece itself was written , seems at last to be assured , in spite of the disfavor in which many old Salemites have long held '' that lazy
Nat Hawthorne	PERSON	. ''

		There are still standing in the '' Witch City '' several bouses that at different times served as home to the unappreciated genius ; but the plan as announced is to pass these houses by and erect a monument in the shape of a statue of the man himself , the sculptor chosen for the occasion being Mr.
Bela L. Pratt	PERSON	, whose qualifica - tions for the task are beyond dispute .

		For many years the late Professor
George N. Olcott	PERSON	was keenly interested in the development at
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	of a small but well-selected collection of antiquities to aid the work of the department in Roman archseology .

		In almost every visit to
Italy	LOCATION	he secured for this purpose noteworthy specimens .

		At the time of his death there were temporarily included in the collec - tion a number of objects for the purchase of which no funds bad as yet become available .

		It is now proposed , if a sufficient amount shall be subscribed , to acquire these objects for the collection as a memorial of Dr.
Olcott	PERSON	's tireless devotion .

		An elaborate two-volume work on '' Ancestral Re - cords and Portraits '' will be issued by the
Grafton Press	ORGANIZATION	from material compiled by Chapter I. , The Colo - nial
Dames	PERSON	of

		It contains the story of the ancestors of a number of the members of this Chapter , arranged in chronological order , beginning with an early progenitor and coming down to the present day .

		When a marriage into another line occurred , that line has been taken up at an early period and brought down to the time of the inter-marriage and then the main line is continued .

		As the members of the Chapter are descended from prominent families of
New England	LOCATION	, the
Middle States	LOCATION	, and the South , tbe work covers an unusual amount of territory , and shows the common an - cestry of the early settlers in

		NOTES 63 LIST OF NEW BOOKS ... 63 SCANDINAVIAN CULTURE IN THE UNITED STA TES .

		We are always glad to welcome any move - ment which has for its object the furthering of intellectual and artistic relations between the American people and the peoples of the
Scandi	LOCATION	- navian countries .

		The mutual reactions of such efforts can not fail to be helpful and salutary on both sides , for each has much to offer by which the other may profit .

		Readers of modern
Scandi	LOCATION	- navian literature are constantly apprised , by apposite allusion and stated fact , of the appeal which our republic makes to the Scandinavian imagination , of the frequency with which our example is made to point a moral or adorn a tale .

		Those Scandinavians who have visited us and those who have observed us only from afar have alike felt the American influence , and reflected it in the expression of their literary , social , and political thought .

		As far back as
1865	DATE	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	was moved by the death of Lincoln to the composition of one of his most striking poems , in which '' the shot heard yonder in the West '' was invested with a portentous signifi - cance for European culture .

		In later years many of the most eminent Scandinavian men of letters have sojourned upon our shores and explored our
Hinterland	LOCATION	, with results that have impressed themselves upon their writings .

		Such men as
Bjornson	PERSON	,
Kjelland	LOCATION	,
Hamsun	LOCATION	,
Nansen	PERSON	,
Kristofer Janson	PERSON	, and
Holger Drachmann	PERSON	have made their report upon us , and brought home the message of the gospel of freedom to the peoples who of all those who dwell upon the Continent have been perhaps the most eagerly receptive listeners .

		This is not surprising when we con - sider the extent to which the Scandinavian strain has entered into our population , and the millions of individual and family relations that have thus been established between the two countries .

		Symptomatic of these relations are such matters as the recent exchange of lectureships between the
United States	LOCATION	and
Denmark	LOCATION	, and the dedication of a Danish-American park in the neighborhood of
Aarhus	LOCATION	.

		We were informed not long ago by a Danish publisher that one of Mr.
Robert Herrick	PERSON	's novels was a `` best seller '' in
Denmark	LOCATION	.

		A less felicitous illustration of American influence was gleaned from a casual acquaintance on a railway journey , who informed us proudly that he had introduced American 36 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, chewing-gum into
Norway	LOCATION	, and had just built a house out of the proceeds of the nefarious busi - ness .

		We suppose that countries which come into relations with each other must trade their vices as well as their virtues , although this partic - ularly disgusting vice is the last we would have thought likely to find a foothold on European soil .

		In the matter of travel between the Scan - dinavian countries and the
United States	LOCATION	, the long-established Danish line of steamships has won cordial commendation from the tourist public , and it is soon to have a rival in the Norwegian company which is about to put two magnificent new steamships into the trans - atlantic service .

		We commented in
1911	DATE	upon the organization at
Chicago	LOCATION	of the Society for the
Advancement of Scandinavian Study	ORGANIZATION	, which has already held two annual sessions of great interest , and has just issued the third series of its Proceedings .

		This organization of Scandinavian scholarship is evidently in the field for good , and much may be expected from its activities .

		Its objects in - clude both publication and propaganda , the latter meaning a persistent effort to further American interests in the literature of the Scandinavian countries , and to secure for the Scandinavian languages the recognition that is due them in our schools and colleges .

		That these languages have a high cultural value is evident to all who are acquainted with them , and it is gratifying to learn that an ever-increasing number of col - leges are offering courses in them , and even ac - cepting them for the entrance-requirement .

		It seems proper to say that only French and Ger - man among modern languages exceed them in cultural significance for education , and that they hold the balance fairly even with Italian or with Spanish .

		Of the wisdom of the effort to make them elective subjects in high schools we are somewhat in doubt .

		Our high schools can not do very much , at best , with modern language study , and we should be sorry to find any num - ber of students substituting them for the French and German which are so absolutely essential to culture .

		And there is always the danger of their being elected as `` snap courses '' by lazy young people who are left to shift for themselves in planning their high school work .

		We have just received the initial number of '' The American-Scandinavian Review , '' a mod - est but exceedingly interesting bi-monthly pub - lished in
New York	LOCATION	.

		There have been other ventures of this sort , notably the ''
Scandinavia	LOCATION	'' of the late
Professor N.C. Fredriksen	ORGANIZATION	which ran its course of nearly three years in
Chicago	LOCATION	in the eighties , and the demise of which we deeply regretted .

		The new periodical seems assured of better support , being published by the
American-Scandinavian Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, a corpora - tion which has the pleasant duty of administer - ing , for the purpose of a better understanding between the countries concerned , a bequest of more than half
a million dollars	MONEY	made by the late
Niels Poulson	PERSON	.

		Another enterprise under - taken by this trust is the notable exhibition of Scandinavian painting and sculpture , represent - ing some one hundred and fifty artists , now in
New York	LOCATION	, and soon to be sent to
Chicago	LOCATION	and other cities .

		Still other purposes are the granting of travelling fellowships to students from both sides , the publication of Scandinavian classics , and the establishment of institutes and reading-rooms in the chief Scandinavian cen - tres of this country .

		Working with this
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	is an Amer - ican-Scandinavian Society which already num - bers nearly a thousand members , and with which all Americans interested are invited to affiliate ^ The stated objects of this organization are '' To cultivate closer relations between the people of the
United States of America	LOCATION	and the Scandinavian coun - tries ; to strengthen the bonds between Scandinavian - Americans ; to advance the knowledge of Scandinavian culture among the American public , particularly among the descendents of Scandinavians . ''

		The last point seems to us of vital importance .

		Qur Scandinavian immigrants , in their eager - ness to make Americans of their children , are too apt to withhold from them the noble heritage of history and literature which is their birth - right .

		All over this country , young Swedes and
Danes	PERSON	and Norwegians are growing up in ignor - ance of the language and deeds of their ancestors .

		This wanton waste of cultural opportunity should be severely condemned .

		It is perfectly easy to keep a child in full possession of his racial heri - tage without in the least impairing his command of the English language , or making him any the less a good American citizen .

		We owe much to the sturdy qualities of our Scandinavian im - migrants , but we would owe them much more if they were made to recognize as a sacred obliga - tion the preservation of their own cultural char - acteristics .

		We trust that the Society will place all the stress possible upon this obligation , to the end that the rising generation of
Scandi	LOCATION	- navians , when they make the acquaintance of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, shall not be allowed to forget
Holberg	PERSON	, the glory of their own race , to say nothing of such other significant figures as those of Oehlenschlager ,
Ewald	PERSON	,
Tegner	PERSON	,
Runeberg	ORGANIZATION	, .

		Bjbrnson , and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL 37 THE METAPHYSICAL AND THE HISTORICAL MIND .

		Strictly speaking , Hindoo literature owns no histories .

		The few facts that loom up from that race 's antiquity or middle past are in a welter of confusion as to date , place , and personage .

		The most important events and works can not be placed with any certainty in century or period .

		Conversely ,
Hindoo	PERSON	thought , perhaps the most penetrating and most affluent the world has ever known , rises from the springs of the Rig -
Veda	LOCATION	in ever-increasing flood and buries the monuments and ruins of empires in its path .


India	LOCATION	let the jewelled reigns of her kings slip through her listless fingers , while she turned her solemn eyes out on the Universe or inward to her brooding soul . ''

		She let the legions thunder past , And plunged in thought again . ''

		What is apparently the earliest creative work of Hindoo literature the
Ramayana	ORGANIZATION	may have some historic import , may in a remote way record the movement of the ruling race toward the South .

		But the love-story of
Sita	ORGANIZATION	, the reincarnation of Krishna in
Rama	LOCATION	, his alliance with the monkey hordes , and the Lucifer-like character of
Ravana	LOCATION	, have less rela - tion to reality than the characters and incidents of early European epics .

		And the
Mahabharata	ORGANIZATION	is an immense mingling of mythology , metaphysics , and confused and cloudy wars , threaded through with a very human story .

		What is true of
India	LOCATION	is mainly true of all
Asia	LOCATION	.

		Mother of mysteries religion after religion , phil - osophy after philosophy , has issued from her womb .

		But human history she has disdained .

		She has held her myriad races cheap , and thought only the eter - nal important .

		She has furnished the ore which European artists have reduced and refined ; she has supplied the matrix studded with precious stones for the miners and lapidaries of the West to pick out and cut and polish .

		The historical instinct first rose clear and keen in
Greece	LOCATION	.

		It held there , for a while , a perfect balance with the metaphysical mood ; and between them were evolved the literature , art , and science which make modern culture .

		To
Rome	LOCATION	, history ^ was more than thought , and as a result a certain hardness was impressed upon all the products of its life and mind .

		Afterwards for nearly a thousand years the historical sense was swept aside by the irruption of religions and philosophies from
Asia	LOCATION	.

		In recent times , the historical side of the human mind has again become dominant .

		Man and his doings have become all in all , and God has retired into the background .

		Mod - ern science is almost wholly an historical affair .

		It not only works in a utilitarian spirit , but it reads the records of the rocks , writes the romances and novels of the elements , the plants and stars .

		Yes , the historical mind has had its innings with a vengeance during the last hundred years .

		Things hold together .

		Like
Wordsworth	PERSON	's cloud , the human mind `` moves altogether if it moves at all . ''

		It has marched directly away from its cosmogonies , its divinities , its high imaginations and great exception - alities ; it has marched toward the common , the usual , the trivial , and the apparently explicable .

		Literature no longer `` begins from Jove , '' but from the grocer at the street corner .

		It is delightful to know that we are all equally important that we are all going to the heaven of fame , and that Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is of the company .

		But the historical method run `` mad defeats itself .

		We can not see the forest for the trees .

		And when every - thing is recorded everything is soon forgotten .

		The people of the future will have their own interesting selves to think about , and they will have little time to waste on the interminable records of to-day .

		The greater part of our present literature will soon be like yesterday 's newspaper .

		But the people of the future will doubtless recur , as we do , to the large-featured typifying represen - tative literary creations of the past .

		Art , which is kneaded with thought shot through with philosophy , must hold its own .

		If there were no sorrow or dreams or death in the world , the historical mind might very well always be regnant .

		Human vanity might always be satisfied with seeing its actions as in a mirror . ''

		Go write a play about myself and my son-in-law , '' says the French bourgeois to the dramatist , '' and I will come to see it . ''

		But to the poorest mind there come moments when the usual round of existence fails to satisfy : when the great realities of sorrow and death press upon it .

		Then is born the metaphysical mood .

		It would be foolish to say that the vivid spectacle of life its carelessness , gayety , sensuousness , charm is not worthy of any artist 's skill ; that we ought not to take delight in its representation .

		I suppose there are few of us who do not read ten trivial novels to one great piece of literature .

		We read them , but we forget them and we do not forget the masterpieces .

		Even great comedy is profound .

		Its flowers
spring	DATE	from a volcanic soil ; its dazzling frost-work is broken by crevasses , abysses that go straight down to the centre of things .

		Aristophanes opposes the world-wisdom of the sophists with a wisdom of poetry .

		Rabelais makes the Schoolmen look fool - ish with their own science .

		Cervantes mocks the ideal of chivalry with an ideal of superior merit .

		But it is the poets , tragedians , and philosophers , who are at furthest remove from the mere historical outlook on mankind , who are least the chroniclers and cata - loguers of fact .

		The hymns of the Rig-Veda , the Book of Job , the Biblical Prophets , the Prometheus and Agamemnon , the
Divine Comedy	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's great tragedies ,
Paradise Lost	ORGANIZATION	,
Faust	LOCATION	, and
Manfred	PERSON	, all these are almost pure products of the meta - physical mind .

		Aye , and the briefer strains of the Muse the poems of Pindar and
Horace	PERSON	, the son - nets of Petrarch and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, the odes of Gray , the songs of
Burns	PERSON	, the lyrics of
Shelley	LOCATION	, are all pregnant with philosophy .

		Metaphysical thought is a normal necessity of man , and when expressed in 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, poetry it comes as near to being immortal as any - thing in our shifting world can reach .

		The sciences are not soluble in poetry as metaphysics are .

		The fact , however , that great poets are most greatly moved by the profundities of life does not preclude them from dealing with it in a lighter fashion .

		Their comedy , as we have said , is apt to be dark under its dazzle , but they can turn their hands to mere chroni - cling .

		But this is not their mitier , otherwise it would be difficult to explain the dulness of JEschy - lus 's Seven against
Thebes	LOCATION	in comparison with the Prometheus , Agamemnon , or even the Persians ; or the inferiority of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's histories to his tragedies , romances , and best comedies .

		The water simply was not deep enough for them to swim in .

		While the historical mind has been dominant for the last two or three generations , yet the importance of metaphysics is enough evidenced by the fact that
Schopenhauer	PERSON	and his pupil
Nietzsche	PERSON	are a fair set - off in influence and power to
Darwin	PERSON	and his whole school of scientists .

		This may seem a strong asser - tion , but it will hardly be contradicted by anyone who is familiar with the trend of European thought .

		We have associated the modern scientific move - ment with the historical mind ; and , in fact , it is a phase of that side of man 's nature .

		There are not wanting signs that the scientific movement is wear - ing out .

		It is not so confident , so dogmatic , as of old .

		Many of its best exponents are taking the back - track to metaphysics and religion .

		It has ceased to satisfy human needs , as for a time it seemed to do .

		Its very development is fatal to it .

		Everywhere it is up against an impasse .

		It looks out at the
Universe	LOCATION	and it can not explain Gravitation ; the
Nebular Theory	ORGANIZATION	breaks down ; it is in doubt about the Wave Theory of Light ; it is not sure as to the
Conservation of Energy	ORGANIZATION	.

		And the Ether what of that prodigious problem ?

		Hydrogen gas weighs something like three hundred thousand tons to the cubic mile ; yet if the ether only weighs one grain to the cubic mile , there is enough of it within the bounds of the known stars to make three hundred million Universes as great as ours is supposed to be .

		And the best scientific opinion says that its density is far beyond that of lead .

		The stars are merely fragile far-scattered foam-flecks on this immense ocean .

		Or turn to the other end of the scale .

		In - vestigate the littleness of things .

		Try to arrive at the size of the ultimate atom .

		The discovery of radium startled the world , and it is at least question - able whether its action is explainable by any atomic theory .

		But before it was known , there were facts that made material atoms seem impossible .

		Take the classic chemical example of a small quantity of musk perfuming a large chamber for years , yet los - ing no appreciable part of its weight .

		That was a radium of the nose .

		Or take the well-attested fact of a dog 's scent .

		It is beyond question that certain dogs can , on being given a man 's shoe or glove to smell , track the person for miles , through crossed tracks or amid crowded streets .

		If they are guided by a material effluvium , this must exist in a state of incredible tenuity .

		But these wonders are merely trifles .

		The thirtieth trituration of a drug is in common use in homoeopathy .

		But the thirtieth trit - uration would have to be expressed by a decimal point with thirty ciphers , in others words , a single drop of the original drug is , roughly speaking , diluted in a body of water equal to the orbit of the moon around the earth .

		And the drug tinctures and affects the whole mass , so that a portion of the mixture pro- duces certain and definite results .

		But far '' higher powers , '' as they are called , than the thirtieth tritu - ration are used in homoeopathy .

		There is a story of a
Philadelphia	LOCATION	physician who started as a young doctor with his vials filled with the regular dilutions of the drugs , and who never renewed them during a practice of sixty years .

		As his bottles began to ebb , he filled them up with water , shook them , and went on prescribing .

		The amount of the original drugs in final use could not be expressed in `` num - bers which have name . ''

		Hahnemann , in his `` Organon , '' gives a recipe for a very powerful homoeopathic dose .

		`` Take a single pellet of a high potency of the required drug , '' he says , '' place it in a vial , leave it tightly corked for a few hours , then unstop the bottle , place it to the nostril and inhale a single whiff of the medicated air . ''

		But all these matters of terrestial experience leave us only on the threshold of the possibilities of the infinite divisibility of matter .

		There are nebulae in the sky which , from their distance and apparent size , must be billions of miles in bulk ; yet , plunged in the centre of these vast fields , a focal star or nuclei sends its light undimmed by any opposing obstacle .

		The matter in those prodigiously extended nebular clouds must be immeasurably more rare than that in a
Crookes	ORGANIZATION	's vacuum tube .

		Yet their dreamy light has place and persistence in the universe .

		Is the world a spirit , or a thing of sense ?

		The greatest English chemist recently said , '' There is no matter , '' formulating thus the dogma on which is founded the most amazing religious cult of modern times .

		What wonder , then , that men are again preparing to turn to metaphysics for something that may satisfy the reason and the soul ?

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		MISTAKES OF
BROWNING	PERSON	'S BIOGRAPHERS , with characteristic details of the poet 's habits and family life , as communicated to Professor
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	by Mr.
Barrett Browning	PERSON	at the latter 's home near
Florence	LOCATION	in
1904	DATE	, furnish matter for an inter - esting article in the
January	DATE	`` Century . ''

		With Mrs.
Orr	PERSON	's `` Life and Letters '' of the poet , says Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	, the son and the sister '' were both bitterly disappointed , and corrected the worst and most glar - ing mistakes , and made many suggestions .

		Mrs.
Orr	PERSON	brusquely replied , ' I can not change the proofs . ' ''

		Of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's book the poet 's son `` said the work was filled with errors ; the mistake that appar -
1913	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 39 ently perturbed him the most was the statement that
Browning	PERSON	was in weak health and ' declining ' in the last years .

		On the contrary , he insisted that
Brown	PERSON	- ing was tremendously vigorous up to the last ; that no change had taken place in his appearance , man - ner , or habits ... During the last few days he told many good stories and talked with the utmost vivac - ity .

		There was never any ` decline , ' and the son seemed almost fiercely to resent Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's statement . ''

		With some surprise one learns of
Browning	PERSON	's increasing hatred of his pen .

		In later years `` his work became so distasteful to him that he would rather do almost anything else .

		He rose early , before his son ; they had coffee together ; then the father was never visible till lunch .

		He did all his composition and letter-writing in the morning .

		After lunch , he would not touch a pen if he could help it , and seemed always immensely relieved to have the morning 's work over .

		He gave the impres - sion of liking many things in life much better than poetry or literature . ''

		In the course of his talk the son justified his action in publishing his parents ' love-letters .

		Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	's incidental citing of `` the uproar occasioned by
Froude	PERSON	's printing of all the
Carlyle	PERSON	letters '' prompts one to remind him that
Froude	PERSON	's error was one of exclusion rather than of inclusion , of misleading omissions and wilful distor - tions rather than of wholesale publication of the now famous letters , many of which have been given to the world since
Froude	PERSON	's death and in consequence of his unfair suppressions and omissions .

		Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	's excellent article appears to have been held back until after the death -LRB- last
July	DATE	-RRB- of him whose geniality and hospitality it so pleasantly pictures .

		A NOBLE MONUMENT TO
LINCOLN	LOCATION	, which the world at large knows too little about , was recently erected by the
State of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	in the fine
Lincoln Hall	PERSON	, dedicated to the study of the humanities , at
the University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	.

		To be accurate , the dedication has not yet formally taken place , but is appointed for the coming anniversary of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's birthday .

		A '' provisional program '' of the dedi - catory exercises , with a handsome illustrated pam - phlet describing the new building , has already been sent out .

		Among the expected speakers are Pro- fessor
Bliss Perry	PERSON	, of
Harvard	LOCATION	, Professor
Frederick J. E. Woodbridge	PERSON	, of
Columbia	LOCATION	, Dr.
Albert Shaw	PERSON	, Editor of `` The Review of Reviews , '' Dr.
Hugh Black	PERSON	, various officials of the
State	ORGANIZATION	and of the Uni - versity , and , finally , in the place of honor at the end of the programme ,
Bishop McDowell of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, who will make the address of dedication .

		It was four years ago , in the
Lincoln	LOCATION	centennial year , that the
Illinois	LOCATION	legislature appropriated a
quarter-million dollars	MONEY	for the purposes of this Lincoln memorial , and to-day it stands , in the words of the official de - scription , '' one of the noblest monuments thus far erected in this country to our martyred president . ''

		Among its notable features are the ten terra-cotta panels across the front of the building , giving sig - nificant scenes from
Lincoln	LOCATION	's life , the
Gettysburg	LOCATION	address in brass letters sunk in the floor of the entrance hall , the numerous and well equipped study and class rooms , each with its special library and other aids to research , and the two museums , of classical archaeology and art , and of European cul - ture .

		Lincoln 's expressed wish that his labors might conduce '' to the preservation of those institutions under which alone we can expect good government and , in its train , sound learning and the progress of the liberal arts '' finds in this building promise of a gratifying degree of fulfilment .

		COLONEL ROOSEVELT ON THE HISTORIAN 'S ART had things of moment to say in his late address before the
American Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	at its annual convention in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		As was to have been expected from one whose veins pulse so ardently with life , whose zest for all that human experience has to offer of a wholesome sort is so keen , he dwelt especially on the `` human appeal '' -LRB- to use a hack - neyed phrase -RRB- of the drama of history , and dispar - aged the strictly scientific school of historical research .

		`` The true historian , '' he declared , `` will bring the past before our eyes as if it were the present .

		He will make us see as living men the hard-faced archers of
Agincourt	LOCATION	and the war-worn spearsmen who fol - lowed Alexander down beyond the rim of the known world .

		We shall hear grate on the coast of
Britain	LOCATION	the keels of the low-Dutch sea-thieves whose chil - dren 's children were to inherit unknown continents .

		We shall thrill to the triumphs of Hannibal . ''

		In this vein the speaker continued at some length .

		Multitudes of readers will join in the applause at the following passage : '' Many learned people seem to feel that the quality of readableness in a book is one which warrants suspicion .

		Indeed , not a few learned people seem to feel that the fact that a book is interesting is proof that it is shallow .

		This is particularly apt to be the attitude of scientific men .

		Very few great scientists have written interestingly , and these few have usually felt apologetically about it .

		Yet sooner or later the time will come when the mighty sweep of modern scientific discovery will be placed by scientific men with the gift of expres - sion at the service of intelligent and cultivated laymen .

		Such service will be inestimable . ''

		All honor , however , to the hardy pioneer in science , whether the science of history or astronomy or chem - istry or whatever other department of learning , who has neither time nor talent for being popularly interesting .

		... GREEK TRAGEDY IN THE GREEK MANNER , or what the best modern scholarship assumes to have been the Greek manner , has been delighting appre - ciative audiences at
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	.

		From the published accounts of the recent performance there of the `` CEdipus Rex , '' it would seem that moderation , restraint , and a noble simplicity char - acterized the staging and acting of that fine drama .

		For instance , the final entrance of the king with 40 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, blinded eyes was free from disagreeable or exag - gerated detail , and his crouching on the steps with his little daughter , while
Creon	PERSON	, the new ruler of
Thebes	LOCATION	, stands above him , was an effective as well as somewhat novel bit of stage `` business . ''

		Yet , as the
London	LOCATION	`` Times '' remarks , there was color and life in it all , as well as dignity .

		Costumes were rich and at the same time archaeologically correct ; `` The lighting , '' continues this account , `` is cleverly and simply managed .

		While the protagonists main - tain the degree of stillness which the conditions of Greek tragedy demand , a certain amount of fluidity is attained by the movements of the chorus .

		There is no dancing ; no waving of arms ; none of the exper - iments that we have recently seen tried in
London	LOCATION	; but there is an almost constant gentle circulation of all or part of the chorus .

		And the chorus is so important a feature of a Greek play that we make no - apology for putting them first among the players . ''

		The division of the play into three so-called acts , with a rather meaningless lowering and raising of the curtain to mark this division , was a concession to modern custom that must have seemed to many rather out of harmony with the spirit of the presen - tation as a whole .

		WRESTLING WITH RHYME and telling off his syllables on his fingers , the poet , however inspired , must become conscious at times that even his loftiest strains have something of verse-carpentry about them .

		This prosaic necessity of paying careful heed to rhyme and rhythm forms the subject of an enter - taining article from the pen of Professor
Charles F. Richardson	PERSON	in the current `` Yale Review . ''

		`` The Morals of the Rhyming Dictionary , '' as he heads his remarks , gives many instances of oddities in English rhyme , and may well make a modern poet envious of the laxities freely allowed themselves by the elder bards .


Herrick	PERSON	, for example , could rhyme Julia with say , but one must now be a very great poet indeed to escape censure for so compar - atively slight an offense -LRB- more to the eye than to the ear -RRB- as the rhyme , sister , vista .

		In a piece of verse at this moment before us in a daily newspaper , occurs the rhyme , lies , paradise , which would have excited no remark in a
Wyatt	PERSON	or a Waller , but to - day grates on the critical ear , although even Ten - nyson permits himself a similar license in rhyming face with gaze , and peace with seas .

		From the revolt against the tyranny of rhyme headed by
Roger Ascham	PERSON	in
1570	DATE	, and ended in
1603	DATE	by the publication of
Samuel Daniel	PERSON	's `` Defence of Rhyme , '' we have now reacted to what might seem the ex - treme limit .

		Is the pendulum likely to swing back again before long , and will assonance and other sub - stitutes for the ear-tickling rhyme once more enjoy any degree of favor ?

		A PIECE OF LITERARY PORTRAITURE of Unusual charm is among the good things in the current num - ber of `` The Harvard Graduates ' Magazine . ''

		The grandson of her whose Shakespeare readings fired him who was to become the foremost of Shakespeare scholars to enter upon his `` New Variorum '' edition of the plays , draws in a few firm but delicate strokes the living likeness of his famous fellow-townsman , lately deceased .

		Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	,
Harvard	ORGANIZATION
' 82	DATE	, contri - butes a half-dozen most enjoyable pages on Dr.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	,
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	' 54 .

		Referring to the deaf scholar 's keen appreciation of such apt colloquialisms as reached him through his silver ear - trumpet or in his reading , the writer says : '' What breadth and liveliness of taste does this not show in a scholar whose early education and fifty years of deafness had given him an English by-gone , nearest kin to
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's !

		For through the ear-trumpet talk was condensed and abbreviated of necessity , and thus from fifty years of never hearing the light turns of contemporary speech , his own quite special , quite charming , phraseology had about it something of lavender , something of mahogany . ''

		And of his relish for the humorous we read : `` Some people do not laugh well , there is in their make-up something askew , and their performance is harsh , thin , or false ; Dr.
Furness	PERSON	laughed with a whole soul , musically and contagiously ; I am sure that this cheered him often in his struggle through dark ways .

		He could tell anecdotes at his own expense until he and the listener would be rocking helplessly , tears of mirth coursing down their cheeks . ''

		Then follow a few per - sonal anecdotes , mirthful and serious .

		Those who fail to read Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's sketch will miss a treat .

		HENRY
CAREY BAIRD	PERSON	, nephew and disciple of the noted economist ,
Henry Charles Carey	PERSON	, and himself a prolific writer on subjects of finance and political economy , as well as a publisher of such works , de - parted this life with the going out of the old year .


Philadelphia	LOCATION	was the scene of his activities through a life of eighty-seven years .

		There he was born in
1825	DATE	, there he went to school , and there at sixteen years of age he entered the publishing house of
Carey	PERSON	and
Hart	PERSON	, of which his uncle ,
Edward L. Carey	PERSON	, was head .

		In
1849	DATE	he established the house of
Henry Carey Baird & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, which he conducted to the end of his life .

		A zealous and well-informed advocate of protectionism , he was at the same time -LRB- as read - ers of Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	's life of his father will have noted -RRB- strongly opposed to that full pro- tection of authors ' and publishers ' interests which only adequate legislation , of international scope , can secure .

		He was one of the founders and leaders of the once vigorous
Greenback Party	ORGANIZATION	, and he wrote `` Fiat the Sign and Token of Real Money . ''

		Also to be credited to his pen are '' American and English Banking Contrasted , '' ``
John Sherman	PERSON	A Critical Examination of his Claims to Statesmanship , '' `` The South Shall it Ever Become so far Civilized ... , '' `` The Supreme Court of the
United States	LOCATION	on the
Law of Association	ORGANIZATION	, '' and other pamphlet trea - tises .

		With us his memory lingers as of one who always had the courage of his convictions , however mistaken some of those convictions may have been ; perhaps the more mistaken and the more hopelessly in the minority he was , the more resolute his stand .

		THE DIAL 41 A SCHOOLBOY 'S PITIFUL PLEA , tending to show that not yet is there everywhere a perfect cooperation between public school and public library , appears in '' The Chronicle '' of
Augusta	LOCATION	,
Georgia	LOCATION	.

		These are the lad 's words : `` Why not the city of
Augusta	LOCATION	or the schools of the city have a large library ?

		There is not a school in the city , grammar or high , that has a good library for their pupils to refer to .

		All that any of them have is an encyclopedia .

		Instead of having several books by different authors concerning one thing , they have an encyclopedia of five or six volumes concerning thousands of things .

		How do you expect us children to learn when we have noth - ing to learn from ?

		What libraries we have contain more cheap novels and plays than anything else .

		I have not been able to find the needed books con - cerning the scientific departments and English and American literature anywhere in the city .

		I have seen several boys in the school I attend given zero by their teacher in the last three weeks for failing to bring in information they could not find .

		Why do not the schools of the city come together and erect a good library for the use of the school chil - dren if the city will not ?

		I hate to find fault , but I hate to see a city as large as
Augusta	LOCATION	expect her - children to become educated and do wonders in their schools when they have nothing to do with .

		Why not somebody make a move ? ''

		This ought to wake up the city fathers of
Augusta	LOCATION	, and , if given wider than local publicity , the governing bodies of other cities also ... THE BREAKING OF VIRGIN SOIL IN
BIBLIOGRA	LOCATION	- PHY must be credited to Mr.
Charles Evans	PERSON	, whose ''
American Bibliography	ORGANIZATION	, '' now in its seventh volume , presents in scholarly and handsome form a chronological list of '' all books , pamphlets , and peri - odical publications printed in the
United States of America	LOCATION	from the genesis of printing in
1639	DATE	down to and including the year 1820 , with bibliographical and biographical notes , '' and also with a statement of the '' auction value '' of each extant publication , so - far as known .

		A circular from the compiler to librarians sketches the origin and growth of this .

		monumental work .

		The need of such a bibliog - raphy was felt by Mr.
Evans	PERSON	thirty years ago when he was himself engaged in library work , and he applied himself to the task of meeting the need , until at last , with a great mass of material collected , no new items were discoverable , and he became con - vinced of the approximate completeness of his data , so far as completeness was humanly possible .

		The volume just issued covers the years 1786-1789 .

		Librarians and others interested in the work and not yet acquainted with it , should communicate with Mr.
Evans	PERSON	at
1413 Pratt Avenue	ORGANIZATION	,
Rogers Park	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		... THE SALE OF
ANDREW LANG	PERSON	'S BOOKS , or of such of them as were not retained by the family , is reported as having taken place at
Sotheby	ORGANIZATION	's in
London	LOCATION	, with the result that something short of nine hundred pounds was realized for three hundred and one lots , the highest price paid for any one book being forty-one pounds for
Keats	PERSON	's `` Lamia and Other Poems , '' first edition , with a slip inscribed by
Lang	PERSON	, `` The generous gift of a lady unknown to the beneficiary . ''

		Of books from his own pen , `` The Black Thief '' elicited the highest bid , eight pounds .

		`` Very rare indeed ; the author 's only dramatic work , '' he had written on the catalogue slip .

		His '' Ballads in
Blue China	LOCATION	, '' first edition , brought only thirty shillings .

		Of course there were many books on Scottish history , and others about the Maid of Orleans ; but all these , pathetic reminders of his labors in his chosen fields , were sold at prices repre - senting their intrinsic rather than their sentimental or associational value .

		The scattering of an author 's library , especially its sale under the auctioneer 's ruthless hammer , always seems a sort of sacrilege ; and in this instance the books seemed to carry with them more of their former owner 's personality than in the case of many a larger and more famous col - lection ... MILITANT METHODS OF SPELLING-REFORM are urged by the managing editor of the '' Standard Dictionary , '' who believes the time has come for the reformers '' to profit from the experience of their more aggressive sisters , the suffragets . ''

		This calls up fearful visions .

		Shops displaying signs or an - nouncements in unreformed spelling , publishing houses unconverted to the phonetic faith , bookstores selling literature in the orthography of our fathers , schools teaching the said orthography , restaurants offering on their bills of fare '' doughnuts '' instead of `` donuts '' these and a hundred other innocently offending establishments would become the scenes of window-smashing , head-breaking , and other angry antics .

		Peaceful citizens , suddenly challenged on the street to spell pharyngitis or pharmacopoeia , would be liable to phrensied -LRB- or , rather , frenzied -RRB- assault with the first stammered ph from their trembling lips .

		Marching brigades of spelling - reformers would make the night shuddersome with their shrill slogan , and at all hours of the day the welkin might be subjected to the indignity of being made to ring with ear-piercing campaign songs , which would naturally take the form of stridently chanted spellings after the rules in force at No. 1

		Truly , a terrifying prospect !

		* THE LURE OF THE SHOW-WINDOW , as utilized by booksellers as well as candy-dealers and haber - dashers and others , might be made contributory to the public library 's greater usefulness .

		Indeed , one such library in a certain large city
St. Louis	LOCATION	, to be specific before moving into its present palatial building -LRB- palaces have no show-windows -RRB- exulted in the possesion of six large plate-glass windows in a row , on the ground floor , looking onto the sidewalk ; and these splendid display spaces were turned to good account for the exhibition of all sorts of tempt - ing literary wares , with results gratifying to the head of the circulating department .

		But with the 42 THE DIAL -LCB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, library 's removal to more stately quarters it neces - sarily ceased to lure the sidewalk-saunterer in the old way ; and now Dr.
Bostwick	PERSON	, the librarian , as quoted in the `` Library Notes and News '' of the
Minnesota Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, sorrowfully asks : `` When , oh , when shall we have libraries -LRB- branches at any rate , if our main buildings must be monumental -RRB- that will throw themselves open to the public eye , luring in the wayfarer to the joys of reading , as a commercial window does to the delights of gum-drops or neckties ? ''

		AN IMPENETRABLE LITERARY MYSTERY Or , at least , impenetrable until the
Psychic Researchers	ORGANIZATION	shall succeed in getting into undoubted communica - tion with the disembodied spirit of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	is the `` Mystery of
Edwin Drood	PERSON	. ''

		Many have essayed a solution of the problem how the unfinished novel was meant by its author to end ; and
Wilkie Collins	PERSON	's published attempt to answer the question is familiar to the reading public .

		The latest notable essay in the same field is that of Dr.
W. Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	, who is reported to have had access to new material bearing on the question , and he has writ - ten a book entitled `` The Problem of
Edwin Drood	PERSON	, '' which has just appeared on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		It will find eager readers among those who delight in literary knots and tangles .

		THE DISCOVERY OF UNPUBLISHED TURGENIEFF MANUSCRIPTS of considerable importance is reported from
Russia	LOCATION	.

		A close friend of the Russian au - thor has recently died , and an examination of his personal effects reveals the existence of two unsus - pected products of
Turgenieff	ORGANIZATION	's pen , one a drama without title , the other a novel bearing the name , `` The Adventures of Captain Bubnof . ''

		The latter is described as `` representing in a Romanesque fash - ion a true adventure taken from Russian low life , '' which may mean that here we have something in an entirely new vein from the author of `` Spring Floods . ''

		At any rate , curiosity waits on the appear - ance , in print and in translation , of one or both of these unearthed treasures .

		COMMUNICATION .

		ILLINOIS HISTORY IN THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		May I take advantage of your space to correct some misstatements which I have found in the article on `` Illinois '' in the new -LRB- eleventh -RRB- edition of the '' Ency - clopedia Britannica '' ?

		In the account of the discovery of the western coun - try given in the course of the article it is said that '' in
1672	DATE	,
Jacques Marquette	PERSON	, a Jesuit father , ... explored the country around
Chicago	LOCATION	. ''

		This passage is followed by the account of the expedition led by
Joliet	LOCATION	and Mar - quette in the next year -LRB- 1673 -RRB- .

		The writer thus states as a fact that
Marquette	ORGANIZATION	had visited this region in the year previous to that in which the discovery of the
Upper Mississippi	LOCATION	and the '' country around
Chicago	LOCATION	'' was made .

		There is no hint of such a visit by Marquette given anywhere in the '' Jesuit Relations '' ; Parkman makes no mention of it ; and even
J. G. Shea	PERSON	, whose exhaustive investigations concerning the activities of the missionaries is well known , seems to be unaware of any such visit in
1672	DATE	.

		Indeed , the article entitled '' Marquette '' in the '' Britannica '' refers to the part taken by the missionary in these words : '' In
1673	DATE	he was chosen with
Joliet	LOCATION	for the exploration of the Mis - sissippi , '' etc. , there being no mention whatever of a previous visit to the regions discovered .

		In Volume LIX. , page 87 , of the '' Jesuit Relations '' it is said that
Father Marquette	ORGANIZATION	had long premeditated making a journey of discovery and exploration , having heard from the Indians who visited him at his mission on Lake Su - perior of the
Great River	LOCATION	and the nations of the West , and he had made '' several efforts to commence this undertaking , but ever in vain '' and then follows the account of the expedition of
1673	DATE	.

		It would also seem that the name of
Marquette	ORGANIZATION	is made unduly prominent in the account of the discovery , the impression being given that he was the leader ; whereas it is a fact that
Joliet	LOCATION	was the officer in com - mand and Marquette the accompanying missionary , in accordance with the custom in all such expeditions sent out by the French .

		There was , indeed , '' glory enough for both '' in this great achievement , but the order in which their names should be given is to place
Joliet	LOCATION	's first .

		Shea , quoting Father Dablon , says that both Frontenac and Talon had '' selected for the enterprise the Sieur Jollyet , whom they deemed competent for so great a design , wishing to see Father Marquette accom - pany him . ''

		Further on in the course of this article on
Illinois	LOCATION	it is said that the explorers
Joliet	LOCATION	and
Marquette	PERSON	-LRB- the writer of the article invariably places
Marquette	ORGANIZATION	's name first -RRB- , on their return from the discovery of the Missis - sippi , `` ascended the
Illinois	LOCATION	river as far as
Lake Peoria	LOCATION	; they then crossed the portage to
Lake Michigan	LOCATION	. ''

		But surely they ascended the
Illinois	LOCATION	river to a point much farther north than
Lake Peoria	LOCATION	.

		Marquette himself in his journal says that the party found a village of
Illinois Indians	ORGANIZATION	called
Kaskaskia	LOCATION	, a name , by the way , which was afterwards transferred to another locality in the southern part of what is now the state of
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		This village was situated about where the town of
Utica	LOCATION	now stands , and from thence the explorers were guided by Indians to
Lake Michigan	LOCATION	.

		Of course it was possible even from the village mentioned to reach the lake over at least three different portages , though it is generally believed that they entered the lake by way of the Desplaines-Chicago portage .

		The statement , therefore , that the party made a portage into
Lake Michigan	LOCATION	from
Lake Peoria	LOCATION	can not be correct .

		It is said again that in the War of
1812	DATE	the Indians , owing to their dissatisfaction with the treaties of
1795	DATE	and
1804	DATE	, espoused the cause of the British , '' and in
1812	DATE	they captured
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	on the present site of
Chicago	LOCATION	, and massacred many of the prisoners . ''

		This gives a distinctly wrong impression , and it would seem that an equally brief statement -LRB- if brevity was neces - sary -RRB- might have been made conveying a more accurate description .

		The fort was abandoned , not captured , and the garrison was massacred after it had left the fort .

		Neither the men composing the retreating force nor the women and children accompanying it were prisoners at any time previous to the attack , and only those who sur - vived became prisoners .

		THE DiAJL 43 THE AUTHOR OF '' IJAVENGRO . ''

		* On a cursory view , and from the standpoint of the average man ,
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	's life seems curiously and unnecessarily disappoint - ing .

		With an extraordinary facility in ac - quiring languages , with an intense enthusiasm for everything romantic , with the restlessness of the born wanderer , with a physique that allowed him when past seventy to swim in the icy waters of the fen ponds in
Richmond Park	LOCATION	, and with a marvellous knack of getting on terms of intimate intercourse with the romantic flotsam of a dozen races , he found only two opportunities for real service .

		The first was when the
Bible Society	ORGANIZATION	sent him to
Russia	LOCATION	to edit a Manchu version of the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	.

		After his return from
Russia	LOCATION	he was sent to
Spain	LOCATION	to print and distribute the
New Testa	LOCATION	- ment in Spanish .

		In both these enterprises Borrow showed such zeal , coupled with extraor - dinary business sense and ability in overcoming all the obstacles which those two dilatory and unfriendly governments could devise , that one can only marvel at the blindness of that agent of
Providence	LOCATION	, the British and
Foreign Bible Society	ORGANIZATION	, in leaving `` the door shut '' upon such a signally gifted servant as
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	.

		While at
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	, Borrow printed `` Targum : or Metrical Translations from Thirty -LSB- actually , thirty-five -RSB- Languages and Dialects , '' a book remarkable for its wide range of sources , o but hopelessly mediocre in metrical charm , and unfortunate in its place of publication , if Borrow had any idea of reaching an English audience .

		On his return from
Spain	LOCATION	Borrow made , in
1841	DATE	, a moderate but promising be - ginning of literary fame by his `` Zincali , or The Gypsies in
Spain	LOCATION	'' a venture along hitherto untra veiled byways .

		This auspicious opening he followed up in
1842	DATE	by The Bible in
Spain	LOCATION	, '' which was immediately and satisfyingly popular .

		Thus prosperously started on his career as man of letters , he disappointed the public of his own day by '' Lavengro '' and '' The Romany Rye '' ; did not increase his popularity by `` Wild Wales '' ; and brought ridicule upon himself by * LETTERS OF GEORGE BORROW TO THE BIBLE SOCIETY .

		his last venture , the ''
Romano Lavo-Lil	PERSON	, '' in
1874	DATE	, which revealed the seeming paradox that , as Mr.
John Sampson	PERSON	phrases it , `` A great but careless linguist , Borrow was assuredly no phil - ologist . ''

		After that he dropped out of sight so completely that the announcement of his death in
July , 1881	DATE	, startled people who knew his books , for they had thought him long since dead .

		Even Mr.
Theodore Watts-Dun	PERSON	ton , whose veracity has not usually been called in question , '' lost caste '' in the late seventies be - cause he brazenly maintained that he had re - cently been in the company of Borrow and of
Robert Latham	PERSON	, both of them men '' who were well known to have been dead years ago . ''

		On the face of the returns , then ,
George Borrow	PERSON	gave to the
Bible Society	ORGANIZATION	seven years of his life , and for seventeen thereafter was engaged in writing books profitable to himself and delightful to the public ; but the last fifteen years of his life , like the first thirty , were spent in aimless , discontented , unaccomplishing rest - lessness .

		Nevertheless , though the fact remains that the seven happiest and fullest years of his life were those he spent in the service of the
Bible Society	ORGANIZATION	, his work has proved astonishingly permanent , and his fame and popularity have been steadily growing .

		The Manchu version of the New Testament which Borrow edited nearly ninety years ago is still in use .

		His '' Zincali '' attracted to the gypsies and to the study of Romani the very men who thirty years later were horrified by his ''
Romano Lavo-Lil	PERSON	. ''

		The German scholars have confined themselves to irony and exclamation points when dealing with Borrow 's philology , but the English gypsy - scholars have all recognized and praised the won - derful sureness with which Borrow '' sensed '' gypsy ways and gypsy thought ; in the words of `` that perfect scholar-gypsy and gypsy-scholar , ''
Francis Hindes Groome	PERSON	, `` he communicates a subtle insight into Gypsydom that is totally wanting in the works '' of others .

		Moreover , the books which disappointed Borrow 's own gener - ation have been steadily growing more popular .

		Sufficient evidence of the truth of this state - ment may be found in the fact that to-day seven British publishers issue complete editions of Borrow 's works , and a half dozen others have on their lists '' Lavengro '' and '' The Bible in
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		It is not surprising , then , that in this year of grace thirty-odd years after Borrow 's death , and seventy years after the first appear - ance of `` The Bible in
Spain	LOCATION	'' we have his '' Letters to the Bible Society , '' and two new biographies , with a third in prospect .

		44 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, A glance at Sorrow 's bibliography will suffice to show that few men have been as successful as he in throwing about their simplest annals a veil of mystery .

		After his death in
1881	DATE	three friends
Whitwell Elwin	PERSON	,
A. Egmont Hake	PERSON	, and
Theodore Watts	PERSON	sent to `` The Athe - naeum '' articles about him ; and Mr.
Hake	PERSON	later wrote for the '' Dictionary of National Biog - raphy '' a brief sketch , based on personal ac - quaintance , but with little access to material , and consequently furnishing only meagre de - tails , some conjecture , and some positive misin - formation .

		The first extended biography was Dr.
William I. Knapp	PERSON	's '' Life , Writings , and Correspondence of
George Borrow	PERSON	, '' in two vol - umes .

		This appeared in
March , 1899	DATE	eighteen years after Borrow 's death , and was issued ap - propriately in
England	LOCATION	by the house of
Murray	ORGANIZATION	, which had published Borrow 's seven chief books , and in
America	LOCATION	by the Putnams , who in
1843	DATE	had re-issued '' The Bible in
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	's equipment was in many ways exceptional .

		He was himself a good deal of a linguist , had trav - elled extensively in
Spain	LOCATION	, and was able to devote himself for several years to following in Borrow 's footsteps .

		He had access to the con - siderable material in Mr.
Murray	PERSON	's possession , acquired many MSS. , and met many of Borrow 's kinsmen and acquaintances .

		Unfortunately , Mrs.
MacOubrey	PERSON	, Borrow 's step-daughter , re - fused to communicate with him , and the officials of the
Bible Society	ORGANIZATION	were unable to find Borrow 's letters to them until -LRB- the bitter irony of it is almost tragic -RRB- a week after Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	's book appeared !

		In spite of this failure to get hold of some of the important documents , however , the book is likely to remain the basic life , because Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	spoke with many people now dead , and visited many spots now changed , and because his pioneer work in tracing Borrow 's wanderings , checking up his chronology , and running down his etymologies , is subject only to minor correc - tion and revision .

		The defects of the book are that while it is elaborately and usefully doc - umented , its procedure is analysis and dissection , so that we do not get as a total result a vivid - ness or clearness of impression quite in keeping with what the real
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	indubitably was .

		The next attempt at a life of Borrow was made by Mr.
R. A. J. Walling	PERSON	of
Plymouth	LOCATION	, in
1908	DATE	.

		His ''
George Borrow	PERSON	: The Man and His Work '' gathers up a few sources of information denied to
Knapp	PERSON	, but its chief service is in clear - ing the memory of Sir
John Bowring	PERSON	from the mud with which Borrow 's hatred had so liberally plastered it .

		Now at last , some dozen years after their rediscovery , appear the `` Letters to the Bible Society . ''

		This volume comprises 106 letters and four reports addressed to the Society or to its officials from
Russia	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	, connected and explained by much transcript from the rec - ords of the
Society	ORGANIZATION	and from its letters to Bor - row .

		Borrow 's communications are given entire ; one could wish that the
Society	ORGANIZATION	's letters to him , especially the Rev.
Andrew Brandram	PERSON	's , had not been condensed .

		Mr.
Darlow	PERSON	says very truth - fully that `` certainly no other society ever pos - sessed such an astonishing correspondent , '' and calls Borrow `` this most remarkable of its ser - vants . ''

		As Mr.
Jenkins	PERSON	says : '' In all probability the
Bible Society	ORGANIZATION	has never had , , and never will have again , an agent such as Borrow , who on occasion could throw aside the cloak of humility and grasp a two-edged sword with which to discomfit his enemies , and who solemnly chanted the creed of Islam whilst engaged as a Christian missionary .

		There was something magnificent in his Christianity ; it savoured of the Crusades in its pre-Reformation virility .

		Martyr - dom he would accept if absolutely necessary , but he preferred that if martyrs there must be they should be selected from the ranks of the enemy , whilst he ,
George Borrow	PERSON	, represented the strong arm of the Lord . ''

		The effect which Borrow had upon the Rev.
Andrew Brandram	PERSON	, as we see it reflected in this volume , excites both to mirth and to melancholy .

		The reverend Secretary was exactly what one would expect the holder of such a position in the thirties of the
last century	DATE	to be : sincere , zealous , rather obtrusively pious in manner and speech , without much imagination or ability to understand a man so entirely unconventional and untamed as Borrow .

		One of the many '' tongues '' .

		to which Borrow turnjed his attention was the religious lingo current in
Bible Society	LOCATION	circles , and it is highly diverting to see the way in which
Brandram	PERSON	was often moved to prayer and reproof by
Borrow	ORGANIZATION	's imperfect mastery of its idioms .

		In his biography , Mr.
Jenkins	PERSON	repro - duces a capital silhouette of
Brandram	LOCATION	, which so exquisitely corresponds with the personality revealed in his letters that we suspect the
Bible Society	ORGANIZATION	did not care to print it with the `` Let - ters . ''

		Still , even when we put silhouette and correspondence together , we think the candid reader must agree with Mr.
Darlow	PERSON	's carefully qualified statement that `` though there was con - siderable demand on both sides for patience and tolerance , yet as a whole the relationship proved creditable to all parties concerned . ''

		But if we were called upon to characterize the
Society	ORGANIZATION	's action in depriving itself of the further services
1913	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 45 of Borrow , we hardly think our choice would fall upon the word `` creditable . ''

		It is difficult to say which section of these letters is the more absorbing , those from Rus - sia , which cover new ground for Borrovians , or the others , which furnish so much comparison with '' The Bible in
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		It is enough to say that Borrow made use of not more than one - third of the material of these letters , and that they corroborated by the records of the
Bible Society	ORGANIZATION	show us not only Borrow the restless adventurer , with his strange and dramatic alter - nations of agonizing melancholy and hilarious exultation , but a Borrow hardly glimpsed else - where , a skilful diplomat , an expert man of affairs , possessed of almost superhuman energy and resourcefulness in carrying through the work of the Society .

		Although Mr.
Herbert Jenkins	PERSON	's '' Life of George Borrow '' appeared only a few weeks after the '' Letters , '' Mr.
Jenkins	PERSON	fortunately had free use of typewritten copies of them .

		In addition he unearthed much material in the
Public Record Office	ORGANIZATION	, and received generous help from many Borrovians , a number of whom were able to get for him hitherto unpublished letters .

		All of this new material made it possible for Mr.
Jenkins	PERSON	to write a Life which both corrects and supplements Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	's , especially in the chapters on Borrow in
Russia	LOCATION	and in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		To this part of Borrow 's life , indeed , Mr.
Jenkins	PERSON	devotes nearly half his book .

		In truth , those seven years were the only ones in which Borrow put forth all his energies in successful effort `` concentrated '' years , his biographer calls them .

		The pity of it is that from all accounts Borrow might just as well have had twice as many more like them .

		The second biography is Mr.
Edward Thomas	PERSON	's '' George Borrow : The Man and His Books . ''

		Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	claims to offer no new information about Borrow , and attempts '' only a re-arrangement of the , myriad details access - ible to all in the writings of Borrow and about Borrow . ''

		Nevertheless Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	has done at least two things that his fellow biographers have tried to do only incidentally : he has given a full-length portrait of Borrow , very largely in
Borrow	ORGANIZATION	's own words , and on the background of the romantic and the unusual on which Borrow loved to present himself as the domi - nating figure ; and he has analyzed Borrow 's mind and style .

		Since in these two respects the book is a new departure in Borrovian liter - ature , and since it finds ample justification in its success , let us quote a few sentences .

		Of Borrow 's style Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	says -LRB- pp .

		195-6 -RRB- : '' Very little of Borrow 's effectiveness can seriously be attributed to this or that quality of style , for it will amount to saying that he had an effective style .

		But it may be permissible to point out that it is also a style that is unnoticeable except for what it effects .

		It runs at times to rotten Victorianism , both heavy and vague , as when he calls
El Greco	PERSON	or Domenico ' a most extra - ordinary genius , some of whose productions possess merit of a very high order . '

		He is capable of calling the eye the ' orb of vision , ' and the moon ' the beauteous luminary . '

		... The beauteous luminary ' vein and the Biblical vein may be said to be inseparable from the long cloak , the sombrero , the picturesque romance of mystery of
Spain	LOCATION	, as they appeared to one for whom romance and mystery alike were never without pomp .

		But with all his rant he is invariably substantial , never aerial , and he chequers it in a Byronic manner with a sudden prose reference to bugs , or a question , or a piece of dialogue . ''

		His dialogue can hardly be overpraised .

		It is life - like in its effect , though not in its actual phrases , and it breaks up the narrative and description over and over again at the right time . ''

		Of Borrow himself and the way he puts him - self into his books , he says in his Conclusion -LRB- p. 317 -RRB- : '' He sings himself .

		He creates a wild
Spain	LOCATION	, a wild
England	LOCATION	, a wild
Wales	LOCATION	, and in them places himself , the Gypsies , and other wildish men , and himself again .

		His outstanding character , his ways and gestures , irresistible even when offensive , hold us while he is in our presence .

		In these repressed indoor days , we like a swaggering man who does justice to the size of the planet .

		We run after biographies of extraordinary monarchs , poets , ban - dits , prostitutes , and see in them magnificent expansions of our fragmentary , undeveloped , or mistaken selves .

		We love strange mighty men , especially when they are dead and can no longer rob us of property , sleep , or life : we can handle the great hero or blackguard by the fire - side as easily as a cat . ''

		Borrow , as his books portray him , is admirably fitted to be our hero .

		He stood six-feet-two and was so finely made that , in spite of his own statement which could not be less than true , others have declared him six-feet-three and six-feet-four .

		He could box , ride , walk , swim , and endure hardship .

		He was adventurous .

		He was solitary .

		He was opinionated and a bully .

		He was mysterious : he impressed all and puzzled many .

		He spoke thirty languages and translated their poetry into verse . ''

		Moreover , he ran away .

		He ran away from school as a boy .

		He ran away from
London	LOCATION	as a youth .

		He ran away from
England	LOCATION	as a man .

		He ran away from
West Brompton	LOCATION	as an old man , to the Gypsyries of
London	LOCATION	.

		He went out into the wilderness and he savoured of it .

		His running away from
London	LOCATION	has something grand and allegorical about it ... '' In addition to the general mystery with which Borrow surrounded himself by vague allusions and by shuffling dates and incidents , he has left two special mysteries for Borrovians to speculate upon .

		One of these is the '' veiled period '' from
1825	DATE	to
1832	DATE	.

		Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	was able to show that 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, Borrow was in
London	LOCATION	and
Norwich	LOCATION	at various times during these seven years , so that he could not have been wandering all the time .

		Mr.
Jenkins	PERSON	gathers up Borrow 's various allusions to places which he visited , if at all , during these years , and comments -LRB- p. 77 -RRB- : '' It may be argued that Borrow was merely posing as a great traveller , but the foregoing remarks are too casual , too much in the nature of asides , to be the utter - ances of a poseur .

		A man seeking to impress himself upon the world as a great traveller would probably have been a little more definite ... There is every prob - ability that he roamed about the Continent and met with adventures he was a man to whom adventures gravitated quite naturally ... '' But Mr.
Jenkins	PERSON	goes on to remark that , as the
Foreign Office Records	ORGANIZATION	show , if Borrow went abroad , he certainly did so without obtaining a passport .

		Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	thinks that `` A little too much has been made of this ` veiled period , ' not by Borrow , but by others .

		It would have been fair to surmise that if he chose not to write about this period of his life , either there was very little in it , or there was something in it which he was unwilling perhaps ashamed to disclose ; and what has been dis - covered suggests that he was in an unsettled state ... Borrow himself took no great pains to preserve the veil . ''

		If we know all that we are to know , then it seems that Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	's surmise is the right one that `` there was very little in it , '' for it seems incredible that `` a man to whom , '' as Mr.
Jenkins	PERSON	has reminded us , '' adventure gravitated quite naturally , '' should have done very much wandering in those years without finding mate - rial for more than vague allusions ; and that there was anything in them of which he was '' ashamed '' except because of lack of romantic adventure is extremely unlikely , when we re - call how clean the rest of his life was , and espe - cially how , in all his association with the riff-raff of
Europe	LOCATION	, he never descended to their level of speech or conduct , but maintained always his own respect and theirs .

		The other mystery is the question , Did Bor - row actually write in seven days the `` Life and Adventures of
Joseph Sell	PERSON	, the Great Travel - ler '' ?

		Or is it merely one more of the `` ghost books '' that haunt our literature ?

		Knapp thought it a short story ; Mr.
Jenkins	PERSON	believes in it .

		He comments -LRB- p. 55 -RRB- : '' In favour of the story having been actually written , is the knowledge that Borrow invented little or nothing .

		Collateral evidence has shown how little he deviated from actual happenings , although he did not hesitate to revise dates or colour events .

		The strongest evidence , however , lies in the atmosphere of truth that pervades Chapters LV-LVII of Lavengro .

		They are convincing .

		At one time or another during his career , it would appear that Borrow wrote against time from grim necessity ; otherwise he must have been a master of invention , which everything that is known about him clearly shows that he was not . ''

		Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	says that `` There is no evidence except that the account sounds true , and might very well be true . ''

		Inasmuch as Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	has found `` The Dairyman 's Daughter , '' which Sir
Richard Phillips	PERSON	commended to Borrow 's attention , someone may some day find a copy of `` Joseph Sell . ''

		Mr.
John Sampson	PERSON	, it may be added , is entirely sceptical .

		In his Introduction to `` The Romany Rye '' he writes : '' The name ' Sell ' which in some curious fashion seems to carry conviction to Professor
Knapp	PERSON	's mind , seems to me a singularly inauspicious one , especially when coming from a writer who , like
Pakornovna	PERSON	, was ' born not far from the sign of the gammon , ' and who boasts in his appendix of having inserted deliberate misstatements in his books in order to deceive and mis - lead the critics . ''

		For further light upon Borrow 's life there seem to be left just two possible sources of information .

		No one has thus far been able to trace Borrow 's letters to the one man with whom he seems to have been really intimate the
Dane	PERSON	,
John Hasfeldt	PERSON	, whom he first met in
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	.

		Are those letters still in exist - ence ?

		If they are , they should be almost worth all the rest .

		The other source is in what may have been left in the hands of Borrow 's step - daughter
Henrietta	LOCATION	, Mrs.
MacOubrey	PERSON	.

		She died at
Great Yarmouth	LOCATION	in
1904	DATE	, and in
1907	DATE	Mr.
Clement Shorter	PERSON	announced that `` All her lit - erary effects , including many interesting MSS. , have been passed on to me by her executor , Mr.
Hubert Smith	PERSON	, and these will be used in my forthcoming biography of Borrow . ''

		This biog - raphy was announced for issue a year ago .

		but Mr.
Shorter	PERSON	has written that it will not appear before next
spring	DATE	at the earliest .

		He does not divulge what light these
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		may throw upon the questions we have touched on ; but if he makes as good a biography as either of the two here reviewed , he will have the gratitude of all good Borrovians a tribe that increaseth daily .

		The sculptor does what few artists have been willing or able to do , he analyzes his own impulses and ideas , explains their formula - tion in his works , and indicates their relation to modern life and to the art of other periods .

		This unusually frank and generous self - revelation is of course the most interesting element in the book .

		The man appears as a vehemently sincere and philosophical student of reality , the centre of whose belief is in constant work carried on by the inspiration of a universal sympathy and by a method which is an unexhausted probing of surface actualities in the search for their subtlest meanings .

		As Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	says , in a recent witty review in the
London	LOCATION	`` Nation , '' ''
Rodin	PERSON	... knows what is important and what is not , and what can be taught and what can not ; ... apart from the acquired skill of his hands , which he shares with any stone mason , he has only two qualifications to make him the divinest workman now living .

		One is a profounder and more accurate vision than anyone else 's .

		The other is an incorruptible veracity . ''

		The vision ,
Rodin	PERSON	insists again and again , is the result of the veracity .

		If the first commandment of an artist 's religion is , he says , to understand thor - oughly the modeling of a leg or an arm , it is because without ceaseless striving for an exact knowledge of forms the artist can never hope to convey successfully the significance of his work , his own sense of its inner spirit .

		Nature , tire - lessly watched and questioned and interpreted , makes it possible for the sculptor or the poet or the musician in his poem , whether the medium be bronze or words or tone , to raise the veil a little from the face of life , and in particular to show us something of the value of the emotions that are our deepest experiences .

		And it is by this illumination cast fearlessly into every nook and cranny of our world , that the artist group serve their fellow-men .

		The philosophic theory touched upon through - out this sesthetic is as alive and modern as the figures in which the sculptor has best ex - pressed it and himself .

		Instinct and intuition , those long-despised human tools which specula - tion is only just beginning to rank equally with intelligence , are understood as playing an im - portant part in our comprehension of reality .

		Something very like the `` will to power '' of
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, the elan vital of
Bergson	LOCATION	, is con - ceived as working itself out in the complex unity of our struggling life , giving to its every mani - festation an infinite value , and apprehended by us through our warmest feelings quite as in - tensely , indeed more intensely , than by our coolest thoughts .

		It is because to a passionate sympathy nothing is meaningless or ugly that
Rodin	PERSON	so emphasizes tolerance of judgment , so insists on a broadening of our appreciations that will compel us to see a terrible beauty even in so deformed a wreck as `` Le vieille Heaulmiere . ''

		Surely her creator has shown that the old woman carries a poignant history in herself , not only of her own career but of the age that made her pos - sible .

		His mission -LRB- the religious term is not ill-applied to an ideal envisaged with so much fervor -RRB-
Rodin	PERSON	describes as this apprehending of individual values and the attempt to commu - nicate them to his contemporaries .

		Since he sees further than he has yet taught most of us to see , his work , like that of every other seer , has naturally been regarded askance by his generation and labeled ugly and immoral by those who do not understand it .

		Everything new is strange and uncomfortably puzzling to us habit - ridden and unad venturous creatures , every unaccustomed freedom , especially of bodily pose or motion , is by the majority eyed suspiciously when not hastily covered up or severely frowned down .

		From this public conservatism springs the ancient and yet ever - fresh controversy over the relation of art to morality .

		But the old problem never troubles a creative genius ; he leaves its solution to the critics and is content to go on formulating truths as he grasps them , sure that from the new paths he is hewing out , our view of nature will slowly widen and deepen .

		If
Rodin	PERSON	had his way we would all be artists .

		His Utopia , like
William Morris	PERSON	's , is founded on a vision of universal creative joy .

		Would it not be delightful , he says , if every man could take the pleasure in his particular task that the artist takes in his ?

		Then we should have carpenters who rejoice in the sawing of beams , masons revel - ling in the cutting of stones , teamsters finding satisfaction in treating their beasts well .

		If more of such joy-bringing enthusiasm for individual 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, work were prevalent , more of us would '' walk the earth like gods , '' with eyes for the number - less marvels before us ; to more of us would be given the sympathy and the vision that are the essence of the artist 's mind .

		It is impossible in the brief compass of this notice to suggest more than the central point of view of this wonderfully stimulating and sug - gestive book ; the artist will find in the volume itself endless delight , and to the layman it will open many fresh interests .

		The very beautiful illustrations , which include two portraits and numerous reproductions of small studies not found in the French editions , add great value to the text ; the half-tones are perhaps not so suc - cessful as those in the less pretentious
Paris	LOCATION	pub - lication , but the photogravures are much finer .

		Unfortunately , the English text has none of the charm of the original ; it is a literal rendering of
M. Gsell	ORGANIZATION	's lively idioms , but so faithful to Gallic turns of phrase as to sound foreign in English and not a little stiff and ungraceful .

		Delicate shades of meaning , playful turns of wit , exuberance of enthusiasm , all these qualities of the original are here levelled into the some - what plodding style of a conscientious linguistic student .

		Yet even through so disappointing a medium there glows the spirit of the book 's author , his whole-hearted worship of life and its beauty , his undaunted devotion to his difficult

		LOUD BYRON AS A SATIRIST .

		* The `` noble minor '' whose `` Hours of Idle - ness '' received the lash in the ``
Edinburgh	LOCATION	Review '' of
1807	DATE	, and who was stung by the censure -LRB- of
Jeffrey	PERSON	, as he thought -RRB- into becom - ing a poet more worthy of consideration , had enjoyed little training of the proper sort for the career of letters as indeed he afterwards disclosed : '' And thus , untaught in youth my heart to tame , My springs of life were poisoned . ''

		It is common to make a sharp antithesis between `` life '' and `` books '' between the discipline in school and the discipline without ; but it is also vulgar , and we can not justify the antithesis by reason .

		Unfortunate in his early surround - ings , unsettled in his schooling ,
Byron	PERSON	grew up an omnivorous and uncritical , though biased , reader , with a long memory for the substance of history , epic poetry , and the drama ; but he had a * LORD

		slipshod verbal memory that interfered with the precision of his acquirements , and he lacked the fine sense for the use of words which represents an inner clarity of thought and definiteness of emotion , and which distinguishes the poet from the occasionally felicitous rhymster which dis - tinguishes
Horace	PERSON	, whom as a boy he '' hated so , '' from the author not only of `` English Bards and Scotch Reviewers , '' but of `` Beppo , '' ``
Don Juan	PERSON	, '' `` The Vision of Jiidgment , '' and even `` Hints from
Horace	PERSON	, '' written at a time when the Roman poet had become an object of
Byron	PERSON	's admiration .

		If one 's springs of life are so poisoned as to be permanently vitiated , if mind and heart are so undisciplined that the brain at length becomes '' In its own eddy boiling and o'erwrought , A whirling gulf of phantasy and flame '' -LRB- whatever that may mean -RRB- , the flow of language from such a well is unlikely to be English pure and undefiled .

		The truth is , even when he has become more stoical ,
Byron	PERSON	is no literary artist ; he often loses control of his medium , and of ten carelessly abuses it .

		If
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Milton	PERSON	, for example , in the use of words and figures , and indeed in every element of style , exhibit the sureness of touch that characterizes a great painter like Rembrandt or
Da Vinci	PERSON	in the laying on of pigments , or a great composer such as Beethoven in the choice and arrangement of musical notes , Byron by comparison is wholly lacking in sensitiveness as to the details of the English language and its syntax .

		Now , to return , this sensitiveness is largely a matter of early discipline of heart and head , and in the mature writer is an element of his personality .

		It is an element in Swift , as in Juvenal or
Horace	PERSON	.

		It is an element in the character of a great satirist , as it is in that of a tragic or an epic poet .

		Even though the satirist debases his medium , and for his own purposes departs from the accepted usage , he must do so with a full , and not a fumbling , sense of what is right .

		And yet , if he was trained for anything ,
Byron	PERSON	was trained for the writing of satire .

		His poetry has its immediate roots in the poetry of `` The Anti- Jacobin '' ; its models , so far as the native literature is concerned , are to be found in
Pope	LOCATION	and
Dryden	PERSON	; his best efforts sprang from the influence , direct or indirect , of the Italian school of
Berni	PERSON	and
Pulci	LOCATION	; he was not untouched by the severer part of
Dante	LOCATION	; and he ultimately harks back to Juvenal and
Horace	PERSON	.

		With the main body of European satire , outside of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	,
Byron	PERSON	was more or less familiar ; some
1913	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 49 authors , as
Horace	PERSON	and Pulci , he studied with attention .

		Nor is it without significance that the opening of `` English Bards and Scotch Review - ers '' is an imitation of the first two lines in
Juvenal	LOCATION	.

		Byron had also seen the world , as the say ing goes not
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's world , nor more than a third of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's , and hardly so much as the world of Lucian .

		He knew `` life '' not an abun - dant life , not life seen steadily and as a whole , but life externally diversified and shifting .

		He knew men , including certain good men like
Scott and Moore	PERSON	, and was interested in them though not in Christian men as such nor in virtuous women .

		In the region where satire has interests in common with literary criticism -LRB- which is also a criticism of life -RRB- , Byron eventually gained some special knowledge .

		He is not unacquainted with certain documents of great significance in poeti - cal theory .

		He translated and adapted the '' Ars Poetica '' of
Horace	PERSON	, and can speak jocularly of the treatises of Aristotle and
Longinus	LOCATION	.

		At the same time , he regards the theory of literature as a set of arbitrary rules and precepts , not as a body of living principles ; and his own critical estimates and predictions in `` English Bards and Scotch Reviewers '' turned out to be mainly wrong as
Aristophanes	LOCATION	's criticism of ^ JEs - hylus and Euripides did not .

		Nevertheless ,
Byron	PERSON	is in vital contact with literary tradition in many important ways ; and in respect to his satiric vein particularly he merits special study .

		Such study has been accorded him by Dr.
Claude M. Fuess	PERSON	, whose work , entitled ''
Lord Byron	PERSON	as a Satirist in Verse , '' is an outgrowth of certain investigations pursued at
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	in the field of English satire , especi - ally that of the eighteenth century .

		His book appears in the series of ''
Columbia Studies	ORGANIZATION	in English and Comparative Literature . ''

		In his collection of facts relating to the activity of Byron as a satirist Dr.
Fuess	PERSON	has shown commendable industry ; nothing of great importance seems to be omitted .

		Moreover , the material has been arranged in good order ; and the style of the monograph , if it betrays no unusual distinction , is clear and straightforward , and is pleasant to read .

		Direct references to
Byron	PERSON	and his works are adequately supplied in the footnotes .

		One could wish that all refer - ences to other matters of fact , and to various authorities consulted , were given as fully .

		The allusion to Professor
Tucker	PERSON	on page 2 is in - sufficient ; the attribution of '' The Simpliciad '' to
Richard Mant	PERSON	, on page 62 , needs substan - tiation from a recent article on the subject if there is a reference to that article elsewhere in the monograph , I have missed and can not find it , for the Index is inadequate ; and there are other small defects of a like nature .

		The Bibliography '' includes only the more import - ant sources of information '' for the treatise .

		It does not include '' La Legende de Don Juan '' by
Georges Gendarme de Bevotte	ORGANIZATION	, which ought to have been consulted .

		Chapter XI .

		of that work is indispensable to every student of
Byron	PERSON	, and bears directly upon the subject of investi - gation selected by Dr.
Fuess	PERSON	.

		Nor does the list include the '' Studien iiber
Byron	PERSON	und Wordsworth '' of
F. H. Pughe	PERSON	, which contains something to the purpose .

		In the main , how - ever , this number of the
Columbia Studies	ORGANIZATION	may be characterized as honest , painstaking , and substantial .

		When we come to the more philosophical aspects of the subject , Dr.
Fuess	PERSON	leaves some - thing to be desired .

		They who wish to under - stand
Byron	PERSON	as a satirist must possess a first-rate acquaintance with Latin satire , above all with that of Juvenal , if not with Greek satire and
Lucian	PERSON	; and they who , in particular , would like to set a value on the satiric literary criticism of Lord Byron , or any other modern poet , had best begin by studying Aristophanes , especially in the '' Frogs . ''

		In the work of Dr.
Fuess	PERSON	there is no indication that he has properly considered
Byron	PERSON	with reference to a classical background .

		Two or three allusions to the Roman poet are not enough to put the modern in a due per - spective .

		And there is no mention of
Aristo	ORGANIZATION	- phanes .

		Now Byron may or may not have undergone much influence from the Greek , though he personally knew two translators ,
Frere	PERSON	and
Mitchell	PERSON	, of `` a certain comic poet , '' regarded the version of
Mitchell	PERSON	as '' excellent , '' and at least on one occasion borrows from the `` Clouds '' ; there is some evidence , too , of his interest in
Lucian	LOCATION	.

		If we divided all the English poets according to their tendencies and likings into Greeks and Romans -LRB- and it is no bad division for the comparative study of liter - ature -RRB- ,
Byron	PERSON	, of course , would be labelled a Roman .

		But whatever his bias , and whether he has read Greek or Latin , or both , or neither , in the observation and comparison of literary types we are bound to examine him primarily with reference to ultimate rather than proximate standards .

		Dr.
Fuess	PERSON	has carefully followed out the indebtedness of Byron to the mock - heroic verse of Pulci and the rest of the Italians a task well worth doing in detail , although the French work on
Don Juan	PERSON	, noted above , sketches the topic in a masterly fashion .

		Yet 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, this is not enough .

		We must have a standard for
Berni	PERSON	and Pulci , too .

		And , not to trench upon the disputed question of the Greek or Latin origin of satire , we must draw our stand - ard in the main from classical writers , and , of these , in the main from Juvenal not because he was '' conventional , '' or had followers who were uninspired , but because he marked out certain lines which satire must take , so long as human nature remains the same .

		In Roman satire , these lines are unmistak - able , hence we find in Juvenal the topics , treated with some regard to unity and coherence , to which Byron continually returns since it is his misfortune never to have done with a given phrase or subject .

		But more than this , we find in Roman satire that the nature of the type is not alone what Dr.
Fuess	PERSON	seems to think it .

		The essence of satire is not alone to be destruc - tive .

		The proper effect of it is also partly in - dicated by the familiar Latin term , satura lanx , suggesting the full platter of various comes - tibles , including things tart , and savory , and even sweet and not all bitter .

		Such are the sights and sounds of a monstrous city , though we must confess there is little that is savory in
Juvenal	LOCATION	's description of
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Yet one may compare
Byron	PERSON	's representation of
London	LOCATION	in Canto 11 of ''
Don Juan	PERSON	'' with the third satire of Juvenal , or indeed with one or other of the modern imitations of that famous dish
John	PERSON	- son 's ''
London	LOCATION	, '' for example , or perhaps Book Seventh of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's '' Prelude . ''

		If Canto 11 of `` Don Juan '' shows Byron at or , near his best as a satirist -LRB- and Dr.
Fuess	PERSON	thinks well of this and the following cantos -RRB- , it must be con - fessed that he is far behind both
Johnson	PERSON	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	not only in power of construction but also in wealth and choice of detail .

		Turning to one or two minor points , we may say , first of all , that Dr.
Fuess	PERSON	clearly under - rates the mock-heroic `` King
Arthur	PERSON	and his Round Table '' of
Hookham Frere	PERSON	as
Byron	PERSON	did not underrate it .

		In point of time , we must remember , it lies between the brilliant work of Frere for '' The Anti- Jacobin '' and his even more brilliant translation of Aristophanes .

		Nor does there seem to be any good reason for going behind
Byron	PERSON	's own opinion that his reading of '' the ingenious Whistlecraft '' -LRB- i. e. ,
Frere	PERSON	-RRB- led him to write in the vein of
Berni	LOCATION	and
Pulci	ORGANIZATION	.

		In fact , to the present writer it would seem that the supple spirit of
Frere	PERSON	has better adapted itself to the mock-heroic ottava rima of the Italians than either Merivale or
Byron	PERSON	.

		Even so , if one had not read Whistlecraft , one might credit the following stanza to
Byron	PERSON	himself , except that the style is more correct than is usual with him .

		Incidentally it helps to illus - trate the theory of satire : '' We must take care in our poetic cruise , And never hold a single tack too long ; Therefore my versatile ingenious Muse Takes leave of this illiterate , low-bred throng , Intending to present superior views , Which to genteeler company belong , And show the higher orders of society Behaving with politeness and propriety . ''

		Compare also the delicate irony at the beginning of Canto 3 : '' I ' ve a proposal here from Mr.
Murray	PERSON	'' which has quite the tone of
Byron	PERSON	's communi - cations to the same publisher .

		Again , Dr.
Fuess	PERSON	is unable to see why
Byron	PERSON	continued to attach so much importance to his `` Hints from Horace '' ; but to me , at all events , this adaptation constitutes one of the permanent gifts of Byron to English literature .

		Finally , I can not help believing that Dr.
Fuess	PERSON	on the whole has rated
Byron	PERSON	's satire too highly , partly because of a conventional attitude to the poet which has arisen on the Continent .

		There ,
Byron	PERSON	has been overpraised , simply be - cause very good critics who speak and think in another language can not have a sure feeling for the niceties of English , and are unaffected by such a manner as would disgust them in their own tongue .

		As for his substance , or what underlies it , his standards of judgment ,
Byron	PERSON	, after all , as Dr.
Fuess	PERSON	remarks , is negative .

		He whips hypocrisy and vice , but does not by impli - cation magnify virtue .

		His saeva indignatio is not , like that of Juvenal , supported by a basic love of rectitude and decency .

		One could not say of Juvenal what Praed makes
Byron	PERSON	say of himself properly enough in the very stanza which
Byron	PERSON	took from
Whistlecraft	LOCATION	and the Italians : `` But I have moved too long in cold society , Where it 's the fashion not to care a rush ; Where girls are always thinking of propriety , And men are laughed at if they chance to blush ; And thus I 've caught the sickness of sobriety , Forbidden sighs to sound , and tears to gush ; Become a great philosopher , and curled Around my heart the poisons of the world . ''

		And I have learnt at last the hideous trick Of laughing at whate'er is great or holy ; At horrid tales that turn a soldier sick , At griefs that make a Cynic melancholy ; At Mr.
Lawless	PERSON	, and at Mr.
Brie	PERSON	, At Mr.
Milman	PERSON	, and at Mr.

		THE LIVING MACHINE .

		* Everyone who undertakes to philosophize , even mildly , about biological matters is pres - ently compelled to make up his mind about a very puzzling question .

		Of course , nobody settles the question by making up his mind .

		But everyone can , and in fact does , settle what shall be his attitude or point of view respecting this fundamental question of the form of the vital equation .

		There are three , and essentially only three , possible decisions .

		Either Life = Inorganic matter + physico-chemical energy and forces + nothing more what - soever , which is the mechanistic conception of life ; or Life = Inorganic matter 4 - physico-chemical energy and forces 4 - a special vital element different in kind , and in toto , from every - thing not living , which is the vitalist 's rendering of the equation of life ; or , finally , Life = Inorganic matter - f - physico-chemical energy and forces + f -LRB- cc -RRB- , where x denotes the great unknown beyond the bound - aries of the meagre store of knowledge of life which biological science has so far accumulated , which is the position of the rational agnostic , who simply believes that the present state of knowledge does not warrant him in definitely asserting that x is what either his vitalistic or his mechanistic friends say it is .

		The distinguished biologist
Jacques Loeb	PERSON	is one of the most ardent and uncompromising of living advocates of the first rendering of the equation .

		As such , he was invited to address the
First International Congress of Monists	ORGANIZATION	held in
Hamburg	LOCATION	in
September , 1911	DATE	.

		His paper , '' The Mechanistic Conception of Life , '' gives the title to a book which brings together ten papers and addresses originally published at various times during the last twenty years .

		general purpose is to furnish a popular presen - tation of some of the chief results of the author 's investigations .

		The essays touch more or less closely upon all the great fields of biology .

		The
Monist Congress	ORGANIZATION	address serves as a general introduction and survey of the problems .

		The next three papers deal with the functioning of the nervous system and psychology .

		Then fol - lows a lecture on experimental morphology , first printed in
1893	DATE	, in which experiments are de - scribed to show that the laws of form production and organization are derived `` from the common source of all life phenomena , i.e. , the chemical activity of the cell . ''

		The next three essays deal with different aspects of what are perhaps Professor
Loeb	PERSON	's most brilliant investigations , those on artificial parthenogenesis , which is an intensified way of speaking about the causation of the development of offspring without pater - nal participation .

		The ninth essay belongs essentially in the same group as the preceding three , though it deals specifically with `` Role of Salts in the Preservation of Life . ''

		The con - cluding address , on the '' Influence of the Envi - vironment on Animals , '' was delivered at the
Darwin Celebration	ORGANIZATION	in
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		It is in - cluded , no doubt , to show us how the mechanist looks at the broad problems of evolution .

		While this book thus ranges well over the whole field of biology in its subject matter , it attains a degree of unity not to be found in many works of much more limited scope .

		This comes from the insistent maintenance of the same viewpoint , regardless of what may be the problem attacked , or what may have been the conventional way of looking at it before .

		Pro- fessor
Loeb	PERSON	states at the beginning of the first paper that its object is `` to discuss the question whether our present knowledge gives us any hope that ultimately life , i. e. , the sum of all life phenomena , can be unequivocally explained in physico-chemical terms . ''

		It might with equal fairness be said to have been the object of the author 's working life to answer this same question .

		Every experiment has been planned to bear on this problem .

		With such a whole-souled devotion to a basic leading idea it could but be expected that results would follow .

		Such , in fact , has been the case to a remarkable degree .

		However much one may disagree with Professor
Loeb	PERSON	as to the gen - eral and fundamental conclusions to be drawn from his experimental results , and some biolo - gists do disagree , no one can deny that his work has had a profound influence on the progress of biological science during the past twenty-five 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, years .

		It has opened up new fields of research , and has given new angles of approach to old problems .

		His first work on the reactions of organisms to stimuli may fairly be said to have given the start to the modern development of the analytical study of animal behavior and com - parative psychology .

		His theory of tropisms , to which one chapter of the present book is devoted , has been a Streitfrage , \ n the battling over which a host of new facts about how animals actually do respond to forces has been brought to light .

		The researches on the causation of the develop - ment of the egg through chemical and physical means have given an altogether new conception of the fundamental nature of the process of fertilization .

		The investigations regarding the influence of the chemical elements singly and in various combinations on the vital processes of living tissue have had far-reaching consequences for scientific medicine and experimental physi - ology , not only on account of the novelty and value of the results obtained , but also because they have furnished a new way of attacking problems .

		The salient results of all this research when looked at as a whole , as is possible in such a book as the present one , certainly make an imposing record of achievement .

		As has been intimated above , there are per - haps fewer who will follow to the end
Loeb	PERSON	, the philosopher , than will gladly go with
Loeb	PERSON	, the biologist , and indeed wish for the indefinite ex - tension of so profitable a journey .

		The difficulty is that to many minds the step from the utmost that is now known of the physics and chemistry of living material to the somewhat bitter end of the mechanistic philosophy , which avers that `` we ourselves are only chemical mechanisms , '' is too wide to be gracefully accomplished .

		The contentions of the mechanist may be entirely true , but to some it seems wiser to wait a bit , without in the least prejudging the case to the detriment of either the mechanist or the vitalist .

		In eight short chapters dealing with such topics as '' Heredity and Environment , '' `` Marriage , '' `` The Possibilities of Race Improvement , '' etc. , she gives a distinctly readable introduction to ` the subject , and makes a forceful plea for the wider extension of eugenic ideals .

Johan August Strindberg	PERSON	, one should be a late - nineteenth century Swede , an habitue of

		Failing in all these qualifications , the present writer approaches his task with a humble spirit .

		He might even have been catalogued by
Strind	PERSON	- berg among the `` right-minded , '' though I trust not .

		One may still love his wife -LRB- at least in

		In the first place , no one can read a play of
Strindberg	LOCATION	's without receiving an intellectual jolt .

		There comes the startling conviction that here is the transcript of a great mind .

		One may or may not agree that what one reads is great drama or great literature ; but there is no doubt that the big , restless , cutting , probing spirit of the man who wrote it is a stupendous human spectacle .

		It is common for critics to see in
Strindberg	LOCATION	a type the restless , honest pessim - ism of the
last quarter	DATE	of the nineteenth century , an epoch recognized by most contemporaneous philosophers as a `` transitional era . ''

		This is true in a very real sense ; and still I find

		Nowhere else have I come upon such utter desolate pes - simism ; but it is an earnest pessimism : there is nothing of the fermentation of the cynic in it .

		On every page is the nervous anxiety to find happiness , joined to the rational despair of find - ing it .

		The writer does not seem like a man who has turned bitter because his own life disap - pointed him -LRB- though no doubt that was tragic -RRB- ; his pessimism is biological , and so complete .

Sharlie	PERSON	when her big mastiff was rolling him around in the street ; but nevertheless it is real .

		The student of life must ever find the entertainment satis - factory when a big man like
Strindberg	LOCATION	gives the world what `` is coming to it , '' and more .

		Even though the beating may seem undeserved , it is impossible to withhold admiration for the honesty and courage behind the blows .

		Karl XV .

		admired the viking spirit of `` The Outlaw , '' and no one can miss the same god - defy ing inde - pendence and solemn man-reliance throughout all the work of this mighty modern Swede .

		For all that , he is intensely vulnerable at one point , which shall be touched later .

		`` The Stronger , '' an episode in one scene , seems to me the strongest dramatically of the plays here considered .

		The target is neither high nor low nor far , but the scene hits the bull 's - eye .

		It is a small thing , and the form is a dramatic miniature ; but its perfection makes it notable for all that .

		Its simplicity is unique : a waitress brings a cup of chocolate , Mrs. X speaks and Miss Y remains silent .

		That is all ; and anything more would be too much . ''

		The Outlaw '' is a scene from the early con - flict between Paganism and Christianity in the North .

		It shows promise of the author 's later and better historical work in its considerable dramatic intensity .

		But all the figures , with the exception of the outlaw , are `` lay '' fully as wooden as the figure-head on the viking 's ship .

		The daughter 's independence toward her lover , an important bit of the complication , is belied by her frightened subservience to her father ; and all the action at the last becomes muddy and unconvincing .

		Moreover , it is difficult to dis - cover any meaning to the whole , for the attitude of the young writer shifts with the wind , now directing a satire against
Christianity	ORGANIZATION	, and now subscribing conventionally to its faith .

		But the sketch of the Outlaw is good , and very likely one should ask nothing more of this kind of play . ''

		The Father '' and '' Miss Julia '' are the most important of the works under discussion ; in fact they are usually regarded as
Strindberg	LOCATION	's greatest plays .

		The extravagant encomiums bestowed upon the former will prove somewhat of a bewilderment to many readers in
America	LOCATION	, especially those of the `` Philistine '' `` right - minded '' type .

		The play is saturated with the darkest misogamy .

		The theme , that no father is sure of his own fatherhood , is the final cause of the
Captain	ORGANIZATION	's madness .

		The wife , who shows traces -LRB- but only traces -RRB- of a type , is a creature who appears to believe genuinely that she is jus - tified in her persecutions and harassments .

		Mr.
Edwin Bjbrkman	PERSON	, the translator , in one of his admirable introductions , says that
Strindberg	LOCATION	placed woman midway biologically between the man and the child .

		In this I do not seriously question his science .

		But
Laura	PERSON	, who unques - tionably represents Woman Fighting for her Offspring , is not midway bet wen the man and the child ; she is somewhere between the ape and the tiger .

		The whole thing lacks edifica - tion , and fails to convince that there was ever such a silly strong man as the Captain , or such a good devilish wife as
Laura	LOCATION	; and it is at least an open question whether the play possesses enough general truth to give it literary value .

		`` Creditors , '' belonging to the same middle `` Naturalistic '' period of
Strindberg	LOCATION	's work , presents the like wholesale strictures on woman .

		Tekla is a chameleon , taking character from the lapel of the coat of him on whose breast she happens to be leaning .

		Even Mr.
Bjorkman	PERSON	doubts if there ever was a Tekla in real life .

		There is a word of wisdom in this play which
Strindberg	LOCATION	must have written under a spell , for throughout his work elsewhere he appears un - conscious of it : ''
Tekla	PERSON	.

		What you mean with all this , of course , is that you have written my books . ''

		Adolph .

		No , that 's what you want me to mean in order to make me out a liar .

		I do n't use such crude expressions as you do , and I spoke for something like five minutes to get in all the nuances , all the halftones , all the transitions but your hand-organ has only a single note in it . ''

		Tekla .

		Yes , but the summary of the whole story is that you have written my books . ''

		A dolph .

		No , there is no summary .

		You can not reduce a chord into a single note .

		You can not trans - late a varied life into a sum of one figure .

		I have made no blunt statements like that of having written your books . ''

		One can not escape the feeling that
Strindberg	LOCATION	's powerful instrument reduces the chord of
Tekla	LOCATION	and
Laura	LOCATION	to a single note . ''

		Miss
Julia	PERSON	, '' as far as construction goes , deserves all the praise it has been accorded .

		Its unity and mass are admirable in their art , THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, even if , like all art , they are a bit unnatural .

		The long and famous introduction by
Strind	PERSON	- berg is extremely interesting , and pregnant with practical suggestions in stage-craft .

		The trans - lator , too , deserves the grateful homage of an English-reading public for an extraordinarily brilliant translation .

		I judge little or nothing is lost in bringing the work to us from the Swedish .

		Take it all in all , '' Miss Julia '' represents
Strindberg	LOCATION	's peculiar genius in one of his most successful climaxes , so it is signifi - cant .

		Still , even '' Miss Julia '' does not quite bear out the promise of the elaborate introduc - tion and the play 's immense reputation .

		Strind - berg admits , or announces rather , that he has made Julia an '' exception to prove a rule '' a sort of thing , by the way , that seems difficult to square with pedestrian logic .

		She decidedly impresses us as an exception , and there are so many contributing causes suggested for her lapse and consequent tragedy that we are be - wildered and chagrined .

		Her mother 's shady past , her father 's foolish ideas of education , her own complex nature , her insulation against de - cent marriageable men , the license of the Mid -
summer	DATE	's Night dance , her father 's absence ,
Jean	PERSON	's superficial gentlemanliness , all these things , we are asked to believe , combined and brought it about that
Julia	PERSON	most brazenly threw herself into the arms of an unimaginative boor , and was afterward shaken by alternating cur - rents of remorse , passion , ecstasy , and hatred , ending in the deepest self-loathing and , presum - ably , suicide .

		We agree that it may be true , but what of it ?

		It merely goes to show that nature and chance and the author can form a combin - ation too much for a human girl .

		Miss
Julia	PERSON	is honorable , nay more , noble .

		It is because of her nobility that her tragedy is a real one .

		Nevertheless , it is difficult to sympathize with those who find this play '' too sad . ''

		Julia is too great an exception to feel sad over .

		It is very good realism , but it is not reality .

		This brings us to the touch-stone .

		Is there nothing but sex , sex , sex to write about ?

		Why do all roads in modern fiction and drama lead into lovers ' lanes ?

		It would seem that we are more primitive than our ancestors , who could find pleasure in tales of friendship and heroism , sometimes omitting , as in
Beowulf	LOCATION	-LRB- a Swedish hero , by the way -RRB- the lady in the case .

		Our age has been sex-mad , and
Strindberg	LOCATION	is a symptom .

		There is still an other , and more vital , criticism , the vulnerable point I have above alluded to .

		Strindberg is big , but not big enough .

		He is courageous , but singularly fearful about the pain in the world .

		Without aiming at being philoso - phical , I should call him an extreme Hedonist .

		Pleasure to him is a serious End and a Good in Itself .

		He never learned the lesson
Carlyle	PERSON	beat into the head of the nineteenth century , that Duty , and not Pleasure , is the chief end of In his later semi-mystical plays partic - man .

		ularly , such as '' There Are Crimes and Crimes '' and `` The Dream Play , '' the hedonistic philos - ophy is responsible for the pessimism .

		The tragedy of '' The Dream Play '' is the endless re - currence of duties .

		Personally , I shall reserve my pity for the man or woman who does not have this endless round of duties .

		God have mercy on the victims of the drug , dilettantism .

		The philosophy which can not understand pain and suffering and duty in the world , but merely inveighs against them , is not big enough .

		One play from his third , or `` Symbolistic , '' period stands almost alone .

		This is `` Easter . ''

		There is a sweeter , saner , more life-giving spirit about it .

		I should like to believe that it repre - sents without irony the older and riper
Strind	PERSON	- berg ; but it seems to have been nothing more than an eddy , a moment of spiritual rest in his tumultuous life-and - thought stream .

		In this Swedish `` Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	, '' where every - thing comes out right in the end ,
Strindberg	LOCATION	says to the little child , the world : `` Here 's a quarter for you .

		Run along and buy some sweets with it .

		I know they will make you sick , but I do n't care this time . ''

		Somewhat similar in tone , though belonging among
Strindberg	LOCATION	's early work , is '' Lucky Pehr . ''

		It is an allegory that brings up many associations , chief among them being Ibsen 's ''
Peer Gynt	PERSON	, ''
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's '' The Blue Bird , '' and Balzac 's '' The Wild Ass 's Skin . '' ''

		Lucky Pehr '' is not unpleasant reading , but it con tans no large or vital truth except perhaps the in - cidental one that happiness comes from striving rather than wishing .

		This sentence from
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	appears at the head of a biographical note in the volume trans - lated by
Edith	PERSON	and Warner Oland : '' I tell you , you must have chaos in you if you would give birth to a dancing star . ''

		This is altogether apt for a volume of
Strindberg	LOCATION	's plays .

		You feel the whirling chaos in him , and he does give birth to occasional dancing stars .

		But the domi - nant impression one has on closing the book , on capping the telescope after a survey of the
Strindberg	LOCATION	firmament , is that a vast lot of star - dust in chaos remains merely nebular .

1913	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 55 FORCE AND FINANCE vs. HUMAN FRATERNITY .

		* The ten articles contained in Captain
Mahan	PERSON	's new book , '' Armaments and Arbitration , '' have previously appeared in the magazines , and are here assembled with immaterial alterations .

		The position of Captain
Mahan	PERSON	maybe surmised from his previous works .

		He perceives that arbitration , which origin - ally was merely a tool in the hands of diplomatists , has gradually developed in scope until by reason of '' the coercive influence of public emotion , perhaps more in love with the name than comprehensive of the facts , '' governments find themselves losing their freedom to reject arbitration at discretion .

		To this tendency Captain
Mahan	PERSON	raises a series of objections .

		To begin with , he urges that the triumphs ac - credited to arbitration are in many cases deceptive , as arbitration was not accepted by the disputants from `` love of right or of essential justice , but from a wish to escape the material damage of war . ''

		Be - cause the states were nearly equal in strength they accepted arbitration , which would have been rejected had either state possessed superior force .

		It is fur - ther objected that the ideal implied by the expres - sion , `` law in place of war , '' is impracticable .

		The law can settle only questions which involve the prin - ciples of law , and which are covered by existing legislation ; whereas international differences are often questions of policy , involving claims which have no recognition in law .

		Law is , therefore , inadequate . ''

		Law could not have abolished slavery ; could not have given the impetus which achieved German unity ; could not have dispossessed
Turkey	LOCATION	of her misgoverned territories , nor
Spain	LOCATION	of hers ; could not have extorted from the
Kriiger	PERSON	regime fair treatment for the foreigner , nor established equal rights in
South Africa	LOCATION	as it was ; could not have vindicated the natural rights of
Japan	LOCATION	against the encroachments of
Russia	LOCATION	in the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		Diplomacy using force accomplished in these instances results to which law was unequal ... The great objection to law , however , is not merely that it is inadequate , but that in most of the above cases it would have been in - equitable would have perpetuated injustice by sanctioning outworn conditions or inapplicable principles . ''

		Force or the threat of force , which is the same thing , can , in Admiral
Mahan	PERSON	's opinion , alone settle questions like these .

		It is also objected that the schemes to enlarge the scope of arbitration especially those which would make arbitration compulsory at the demand of one of the parties , besides depriving governments of their former freedom , tend to undermine the prin - ciple of independent nationality , to modify the * ARMAMENTS AND ARBITRATION .

		sovereignty of the state upon which all present in - ternational relations rest .

		Nations as nations have materially aided progress ; the principle of nation - ality '' has for the past four hundred years been the dominant factor in the development of
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		Therefore , it should be preserved at all odds against the encroachments of arbitration , on the one hand , and of socialism and kindred schemes , on the other , which would break down international boundaries and substitute internal and class struggle .

		This latter , for some reason , Captain
Mahan	PERSON	thinks would be a relapse to conditions of the middle ages a period , by the way , in which force , though not always national , was paramount .

		National boundary lines must not be disrupted because
Europe	LOCATION	will need all the strength she can muster in the coming struggle with Asiatic civiliza - tion . ''

		This not only impends , but has begun , and in it the strength of
Europe	LOCATION	is the principle of nation - ality , developed as it is now . ''

		Now , if this '' prin - ciple of nationality '' is so sacred and so necessary , why do European nations themselves respect it so little ?

		They , as much as the proponents of arbi - tration , have drawn national integrity into question : they have violated the sovereignty of
Turkey	LOCATION	,
Persia	LOCATION	, and
China	LOCATION	.

		And by so doing they have set
Asia	LOCATION	an example which they may have occasion to regret .

		It may presently appear that the promotion of arbi - tration is a less objectionable way of infringing upon national sovereignty than the armed intervention of a strong state in the affairs of another without other sanction than that of force .

		To Captain
Mahan	PERSON	the very circumstance that a nation can not avert invasion is in the last analysis the justification of the invasion .

		`` Armament is the ultimate exponent of national independence and power . ''

		It is a fault to be weak , and the penalty for weakness is oppression .

		This militarist is not one of those who would advocate peace even if he believed peace to be practicable ; he believes in force .

		`` The existing political status of the planet rests , and in my judgment rests beneficially , upon force . ''

		With these views upon the finality of force , the reader must wonder why Captain
Mahan	PERSON	takes such great pains to justify the action of the
United States	LOCATION	in
Panama	LOCATION	both legally and ` morally , as he does in his last chapter , entitled ''
Panama	LOCATION	: A National Dis - honor ? ''

		Why talk of law and morals if force is the ultimate test ?

		The only dishonor possible for the
United States	LOCATION	would have consisted in lacking force , or in failing to use it effectively .

		In general the views of Captain
Mahan	PERSON	seem to rest on local and one-sided considerations .

		He rea - sons from the basis of a single nation , whereas the world contains many nations ; and he assumes that nation to be victorious in its enterprises , whereas if there is a victor there must also be a vanquished , a plain fact which is here simply ignored .

		In short , this military philosophy can not be final or universal , for it leaves one half of the problem , and the more damaging half , out of account .

		A nation must possess force in order to repel some possible foe ; 56 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, but where lies the advantage of force if that foe , acting on the same philosophy , also acquires force ?

		Clearly what we need is not force , but more force ; and our possible foe , still actuated by the same views , also acquires more force !

		Now who is the visionary , the peace advocate who avers that this increase of force can not continue indefinitely , or the militarist who insatiably calls for greater force , but has never explained how it is possible to increase armaments perpetually without drifting into finan - cial difficulties which will make war the very evil armaments are said to be preventing the lesser of two evils ?

		The financial difficulties of militarism are so ob - vious and already so real that every rational man must wonder why we have been blind to them so long .

		This phase of the matter is treated by Dr.
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	in his little book , `` The Unseen Empire , '' which undertakes `` to tell in part the story of the bondage of the nations due to the cost of war and of war preparations . ''

		It aims to show `` that civilized nations are one and all in their degree under the dominion of a power stronger than Kings or Parliaments , more lasting than Armies and
Navies	ORGANIZATION	, that is , the
Unseen Empire of Finance	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		War and armaments cost vast sums of money , which must be raised by governments in some way .

		Taxes and tariffs have long since proved insufficient , and governments are led by military rivalry to make loans .

		These loans may properly be called `` war debts , '' because had it not been for war and war preparations the natural income of the nations would have easily paid off all indebtedness , including that borrowed for industrial and commercial expansion .

		The objection of President
Jordan	PERSON	to these war debts is not primarily that they are unethical in placing a burden on coming generations , or that they are part and parcel of a system of living beyond national means .

		He is not opposed to deferred payments , as such ; there are proper loans which do place a bur - den on a coming generation .

		The test of a proper loan is the purpose for which it is made , whether for banking or for '' pawnbroking . '' ''

		Banking , properly speaking , deals with ' going concerns . '

		It is a provision by which free or idle money may be gath - ered together and converted into active capital .

		Through the banker , money on deposit is placed in the hands of those who by industrial or commercial enterprise can make it grow . '' '

		Pawnbroking , ' broadly speaking , deals with failure or waste .

		Its usual function is to afford means for some act of extravagance , or escape from some complication of past folly or misfortune .

		The extravagance , folly , and misfortune among nations is summed up in war .

		Pawnbroking among nations thus concerns itself mainly with past war or future preparation , in either case withdrawing the revenues con - cerned from all productive use . ''

		In this respect Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	is at complete variance with
Captain Mahan	PERSON	, who writes : `` It is also per - haps worth noting that the immense debt of
Great Britain	LOCATION	was contracted in establishing , by military means , the territorial , commercial , and industrial conditions which underlay her long continued su - premacy ; that debt was in the nature of an invest - ment , not barren of returns . ''

		To this Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	would , among other things , reply that the returns came to the wealthy classes and not to the average Englishman , who was little the better for the debt .

		It may also be inquired whether
England	LOCATION	's debt would have been a good investment had she been defeated ?

		And what kind of an investment was the debt contracted by
England	LOCATION	's vanquished foes ?

		Still , wastefulness is not the greatest harm com - ing from public debts .

		That harm is the dominance which debts give to the nation 's creditors , who are the kings of finance .

		These , to be sure , do not hold all or even a majority of a nation 's bonds ; but they do control the financial institutions and the media sometimes even the officials through which govern - ments must float bonds if they place them at all ; and , therefore , they control a state 's credit . ''

		The control of a railway system does not necessitate ownership , but simply the control of its debt and its needs at critical moments .

		Just so with nations .

		It is the need for more borrowings that makes the old loans dominant .

		In proportion to the bulk of their debts and the acute character of their need for money are they subject to dictation .

		The ordinary creditors or bondholders have little to say .

		It is the necessity for further loans which places control in the hands of the financier .

		This may be exercised quietly as befits the business of the banker , but it is none the less potent and real . ''

		The `` Empire '' which dominates governments is not a well defined organization ; it is rather a loosely coordinated system , the parts of which , by virtue of a far-reaching family relationship , as in the case of the
Rothschilds	ORGANIZATION	, and by virtue of a common aim , cooperate for their mutual gain .

		It is privilege , and privilege everywhere affiliates with privilege .

		It does not stop at controling a nation 's credit : it largely dictates a nation 's policy for good or ill ; it is inter - ested wherever large capital is required , and hence in armament manufactories and syndicates .

		How detrimental this may be to a people is patent . ''

		It is a fact , more or less well known , that the arguments that ' expansion of armaments is necessary to insure peace / that ' big armies and navies are the insurance premiums of peace , ' and that ' to insure peace a nation must always be prepared for war , ' rest heavily on the desires of the arma - ment syndicates to keep up their business .

		The armament lobby of
Europe	LOCATION	is the most powerfully organized instrument of its kind in the world .

		Its operations are consciously and carefully planned . ''

		The chief weapon of the
Armament Syndicate	ORGANIZATION	, because the most effective one for persuading a nation to go more and more deeply into debt , is the ' war scare . '

		Always the one nation is pitted against the other .

		Always there is imminent danger from our neighbors . ''

		The criticism may be leveled at Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	's little book that it makes assertions which it does not prove , and the criticism seems to be just .

		However , this does not prove that the author 's contentions are un - true .


Ludwig Pfeiffer	PERSON	has just come forward with a three - volume work entitled '' Kriegsgeist '' which attempts to prove the existence of the `` Unseen Empire . ''

		Whether proved or not , there is still evi - dence that such an empire exists , and every attempt to expose it is commendable .


1913	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 57 The attack upon war in literary form , first made popular by
Baroness	PERSON	von Siittner in '' Die Waffen nieder ! ''

		is revived in `` The Pride of War , '' trans - lated from
Gustav Janson	PERSON	's Swedish story , `` Log - norna . ''

		By abandoning the form of a personal narrative employed in the earlier work , the argu - ment becomes natural at all points , and is free from the outbursts of sentiment which fill the pages of '' Ground Arms ! ''

		Indeed , as literature , '' The Pride of War '' is much the superior of the two ; the chap - ter `` Hamza and Hanifa '' is idyllic in its perfection , and is the one part of the book in which the trans - lation is so excellent as to pass unnoticed .

		And yet the work is not fiction in the conventional sense : there is no dominant character , and the love theme is absent .

		It is a series of connected studies in story form of the way the Turko-Itaiian war is imagined to have affected typical individuals engaged in it .

		That the author had some personal and intimate knowledge of the opponents in this struggle is mani - fest ; and his project of showing how the strife affects the individual man touches the very core of the op - position to war .

		The bravery and patriotism , the noble action and splendid unanimity , which form the staple of most writers about war , fade when the individual soldier , as
Janson	PERSON	pictures him , comes to be considered .

		The characters upon whom are hung the argument are not caricatures , but real personalities .

		Captain
Vitale	PERSON	, who as much as anyone is the central figure of the book , personifies war .

		He unthinkingly ac - cepts the traditional views respecting national rivalry and war as the means of progress .

		Implicit obedience to military discipline is his ideal , and the soldier who renders it fares well at his hands .

		All individ - ual initiative must , however , be surrendered .

		Hence he acts as a blight upon all who come under his sway .

		The Anarchist ,
Alfonso Zirilli	PERSON	, who repre - sents the reflective peasant , loses his individuality and becomes a cog in a machine .

		Hamza , the non - combatant , who asked no more of the world than to be allowed to dwell in peace under his desert palms , is caught in the maelstrom , and , though innocent and ignorant of the why of it all , is heartlessly killed .

		The Turkish officer ,
Assan Bey	PERSON	, discovers in the lawlessness of war a chance for exploitation and self-enrichment which peace had not afforded .

		The Bedouin ,
Djafar	PERSON	, finds the troublous times well adapted to political treachery and the acquisition of power over his fellows .

		Rivarato , the dashing young Italian lieutenant , who had gone to the front with high hopes of the future that lay before him , emerges a physical wreck a bit of the waste of war , used up in his prime and destined to be a burden instead of a prop to society for the remainder of his days .

		The Italian scholar ,
Pietro Fontanara	PERSON	, is the strong - est character in the book .

		He had lived among the Moslems , engaged in studies which promised great benefit to men .

		His breadth of experience , his knowl - edge of the Turk , had given him something of what has been called the international mind .

		To him war against men whom he had come to regard as equals and brothers was hateful ; but the sense of duty to his country impels him to abandon his work and to enlist .

		The acclamation of the press at his act makes him wonder , `` If there was really something worth recording in the fact that a strong man , healthy in mind and body , hurried to the aid of his country , then it was proof that war was an out-of-date ideal . ''

		This is only the beginning .

		Every day has its experiences , every experience its revelation , until finally he sees the sordidness and falsehood of it all ; and he becomes the chief spokesman of the book against war .

		The chapter entitled '' Lies , '' in which he speaks , is an indictment of warfare which the militarist , who distinguishes truth from policy , will have difficulty in answering .

		European civilization must rest on force , says the militarist , if it would successfully resist
Asia	LOCATION	in the conflict which has already begun .

		Eesisting is not the same as attacking , and
Janson	PERSON	thinks the European has been the aggressor and has left the Asiatic no alternative but retaliation in kind .

		Using Dajfar as his mouthpiece he says : '' Civilization ... I scarcely know what to answer you . ''

		I ask for thoughts , and you give me a name , Civiliza - tion , as if I , too , had not turned the word over and over with my tongue .

		It has a vile taste and I spit it out again .

		Civilization is your answer .

		When the Italian ironclads cast anchor outside the roadstead off
Tripoli	LOCATION	, civilization ordered that the Turkish garrison should leave the town without striking a blow .

		But it in no way prevented the Italians from shooting its houses in pieces with their can - nons , or from slaying the people to whom the houses be - longed , if any were still there .

		I have a feeling of nausea every time I hear the word ' civilization . '

		What I know of it is , that it bestows excellent weapons on the Unbelievers , together with the power of making the most reckless use of them , whenever there is anything to be gained ... '' For all their disunion the Europeans are not afraid of acting all the world over in the same fashion .

		Civilization has never stood in the way of their slaying and plundering .

		It is in every respect a boon for them , but in most cases an evil for others .

		The good it bestows namely , the quick - firing guns and far-reaching rifles we can turn to our own use .

		Whether we like it or not , we must take that course .

		The nations of
Europe	LOCATION	can not ask us to treat them otherwise than they are treating us ... Do you now see what I am driving at ?

		Very well , then !

		The sons of the Prophet outnumber the Europeans ... Get us weapons and also men to teach us how to use them that is your job ... There is really a God Turk .

		And righteousness is no empty word , as is the civilization of the Europeans . ''

		Dr.
Butler	PERSON	's new book , '' The International Mind , '' consists of the addresses delivered by the author as Chairman of the
Lake Mohonk Conferences on Inter	ORGANIZATION	- national Arbitration .

		As such they are naturally general in character , and are good summaries of progress rather than original contributions .

		Pres - ident
Butler	PERSON	believes that for the present the ques - tion of disarmament should be wholly avoided .

		He prefers to work for a restriction of the further growth of great armies and navies without impairing the efficiency of those that exist .

		Though this appears to be conceding a vital point to the militarist , it is for the present only .

		In the meantime , law and a sense of justice must be developed .

		High confidence is placed in these .

		58 THE DIAJL -LSB- elan .

		16 , '' Even if we speak in the most approved language of militarism itself , it is apparent that a fleet a mile wide will not long protect
England	LOCATION	from attack or invasion , or from starvation , if the attacking or invading party is in command of the full resources of modern science and modern industry .

		But if justice be substituted for force ,
England	LOCATION	will always be safe . '' ''

		To say that men have always , as a last resort , settled their differences and difficulties by force , and that therefore they will always continue to do so is simply silly .

		To say that a nation 's honor must be defended by the blood of her citizens if need be , is quite meaningless , for such a nation , although profoundly right in its contention , might be de - feated by a superior force exerted on behalf of a wrong and unjust view . ''

		Nations again and again yield to arguments that have no compulsion behind them other than public opinion ; and public opinion is the final and the only means by which , in these days of popular sover - eignty , any law , national as well as international , is made effective .

		The growth of the power of the people is a disturbing factor to militarists , some of whom bemoan its tendency to weaken the ideals of military discipline and organization .

		Dr.
Butler	PERSON	himself is not willing to trust the people altogether .

		`` A judiciary made dependent on changes of popular temper or on varying , often contradictory , manifesta - tions of popular will , would become a mere adminis - trative device under the control and direction of the executive power of the moment . ''

		By taking this position he at least escapes the inconsistency of an age which seeks to develop an international judiciary at the same time that it is destroying popular faith in the national courts .

		Apart from the judiciary , Dr.
Butler	PERSON	has great faith in the people .

		`` Govern - ments , however popular and powerful , have ceased to dominate ; everywhere public opinion dominates governments . ''

		This steady development of popular sovereignty is more significant to the historian than force .

		Democracy is the foe of force and the cure for war . ''

		The history of civilization might be written in terms of man 's progress from fear to faith .

		As he has ceased to fear his neighbors and as he has come to have trust in them , he has been able to build up institutions that have lasted . '' ''

		The international mind is nothing else than that habit of thinking of foreign relations and business , and that habit of dealing with them , which regard the several nations of the civilized world as friendly and cooperating equals in aiding the progress of civilization , in developing commerce and industry , and in spreading enlightenment and culture throughout the world .

		BKIKFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		The Chinese Among books purporting to give a people intimately full and elaborate portrayal of Chi - portrayed .

		nege jjf ^ f ew j laye a pp eare -LRB- J i n recent years more meritorious than Dr.
J. Macgowan	PERSON	's `` Men and Manners of Modern
China	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The writer has spent fifty years as a missionary in
China	LOCATION	, and his interpretation of the people of that land bears abundant evidence of long-continued and acute observation .

		The book is remarkable for the abundance of its pic - turesque descriptive detail .

		The land and its gov - ernment , the ancient outworn military system , the literary degrees of the now defunct examinations for civil service , the classical books , schools , and school-masters of the old regime , ancestor worship , plays and play actors , punishments , lynch law , these and other topics are treated in chapters which gradually develop in the mind of the reader a lively image of the teeming and strange life of the old Empire .

		The author describes with quite unusual vividness such picturesque phases of exist - ence in
China	LOCATION	as river life , farmers and farming , doctors and doctoring , beggars , Chinese cities ; and elucidates the obscure subject of home life and the still more hidden mysteries of `` face . ''

		The book shows insight gained through long and intimate contact , and sympathy developed by the gradual revelation through these years of the best traits of Chinese character .

		The writer has found the ad - mirable virtues of the long-lived Chinese race , and arouses the respect of the reader for their patience , perseverence , fortitude , humor , and everlasting good nature .

		A sense of the teeming millions of the land engaged in their unremitting and age-long labor with muscles hardened by heavy loads and hearts subdued by long familiarity with the struggle for bare subsistence , and yet with laughter lying ready at the least provocation this feeling of the teeming life of
China	LOCATION	is very well conveyed by Dr.
Mac	PERSON	- gowan 's book .

		The grotesque , disgusting , and hor - rible lines in the portrait are also clearly marked , indeed so clearly that one doubts whether this is the best drawing of the Chinese for American readers .

		We have had only too much information that ele - vates our own race at the expense of the Asiatic peoples .

		To correct warped notions of these unlike nations it is safe to dwell even to some excess upon their virtues and attractions in portraying them for Anglo-Saxon readers .

		This is not done by Dr.
Mac	PERSON	- gowan 's book .

		Respecting the Chinese race as he does , the author yet constantly compares it with the English people to the advantage of the latter .

		The instances in which the scales are shown to tip the other way are too few to offset the total impression of the strange deficiencies of the Chinese as com - pared with the British people .

		But a cosmopolitan view of races can not set up any one race as a norm to which all others must approach , and it is to be seriously doubted if comparisons of a foreign peo - ple with one 's own nationality can ever be wholly

		THE DIAL 59 fair .

		Those books about foreign peoples do the best service which seek to explain and excuse , or at least condone , their obliquities , and to hold up all their virtues for the instruction of the home race , though one must , of course , endeavor , first and foremost , to tell the truth .

		Yet deviations from the path of charity and deficiencies in cosmopolitan breadth are , after all , not of so serious a character in `` Men and Manners in
Modern China	LOCATION	'' but that the book is to be heartily welcomed for its remark - able vividness of portraiture of a race destined to play a great role in future history .

		One must regret the serious crudities of composition and expression that occur rather frequently throughout the book .


Denmark	LOCATION	's ^ n ^ e eleventh century the life of greatest
Christendom	LOCATION	reawakened with a hero - great relief .

		With the passing of the year
1000	DATE	A. D. , it was revealed that after all the heavens were not to be rolled up like a scroll nor the elements to melt with fervent heat ; and men began once more to look round upon the kingdoms of this earth as desirable property ; the mighty game of conquest was once more worth playing .

		Of the figures stalking over the stage at that time , at least two men achieved careers which have not been al - lowed to sink into forgetfulness
William	PERSON	the Nor - man and Canute the Dane .

		They shared the century between them , but their lives , so far as strenuous activity was concerned , did not lap or even touch .

		Canute , at the age of forty , was laid away at Win - chester thirty-one years before the battle of
Hastings	PERSON	, but after winning an empire , with the triple crown of
Denmark	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
Norway	LOCATION	.

		With what - ever truth our average readers can say `` Saxon and
Norman	PERSON	and
Dane	PERSON	are we , '' they must confess a robust ignorance of the great Viking an ignorance usually lightened by only two legends .

		But Profes - sor
Laurence M. Larson	PERSON	, of the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, in the latest volume of the `` Heroes of the Nations '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , has left this ignorance without further excuse .

		With infinite patience and a fine historic sense he has assembled all materials deriv - able from the chroniclers , annalists , and sagas , and has blended them into a consistent and continuous narrative .

		How cautiously he handles his sources may be seen by his constant use of such restrictive phrases as `` presumably , '' `` possibly , '' `` probably , '' `` apparently , '' `` appears to have accompanied , '' `` almost certainly , '' etc. .

		This makes his conclusions , when confidently asserted , the more trustworthy .

		He has had , of course , the aid of such modern Norse scholars as
Vigfusson	LOCATION	, the two Bugges ,
Steenstrup	PERSON	, and others ; but he has used them with a healthy and detached judgment which sometimes differs with theirs , and helps his own book to the position of an original contribution to biographical literature .

		Out of the somewhat confused sources there emerges finally the figure of a man , not of the highest hero - ism , but a man who was quick to see and to seize every opportunity created by his own shrewdness or offered by the weakness of others .

		In the words of Professor
Larson	PERSON	, '' Canute possessed in full measure the Scandinavian power of adaptation , the quality that made the
Northmen	PERSON	such a force in
Normandy	LOCATION	and
Naples	LOCATION	.

		He grasped the ideals of mediaeval Christianity , he appreciated the value of the new order of things , and undertook to introduce it among the Northern peoples .

		But he did not permit the new circumstances and ideals to control him ; only so long as they served his purpose or did not hinder him in the pursuit of that purpose did he bow to them .

		When other means promised to be more effective , he chose accordingly . ''

		Of the two legends above mentioned the story of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's visit to the monks of
Ely	PERSON	-LRB- '' Sweet sang the monks of
Ely	ORGANIZATION	, when Canute rowed thereby '' -RRB- , and the still more familiar one of his rebuke to the flattering courtiers before the resistless advance of the tide , Professor
Larson	PERSON	remarks that the former is intrinsically probable .

		The latter is quietly dismissed as `` a myth too patent to need discussion ; there was nothing of the Oriental spirit in the Northern court . ''

		We shall have to com - fort ourselves with the reflection that such stories retain their moral value long after their historic props have been knocked away .

		Early religious ?

		Ir ' Sidne 7
Heath	PERSON	's `` Pilgrim Life pilgrims and in the Middle Ages '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- pilgrimages .

		was designed , the author tells us , '' to serve and entertain the general reader who is inter - ested in the religious pilgrimages of olden days . ''

		If the general reader were himself on pilgrimage , and carried a scrip large enough to hold this sub - stantial volume , we can well believe that he would be served by it , for portions of it would make a use - ful guide-book ; but by no part of it would he be entertained .

		It abounds in information concerning the ancient pilgrim roads and shrines and customs of
England	LOCATION	; but this information is so scrappy and incoherent , so intermingled with trivialities and errors , and expressed in such curious English that a sense of impatience rather than of entertainment accompanies the reader 's progress through its three hundred pages .

		It is difficult , indeed , to treat with seriousness a historical work that gravely cites '' an anonymous writer '' as authority for a historical statement , and that quotes ' The Daily Mail '' as one might quote Green or Macaulay .

		Moreover , for a writer dealing with mediaeval pilgrimages , Mr.
Heath	PERSON	knows singularly little about Chaucer .

		He refers to the poet 's career at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	, apparently unaware that Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	de - molished this part of the '' Chaucer legend '' twenty years ago .

		He naively remarks that , thanks to the labors of the
Chaucer Society	ORGANIZATION	, the poet may now be '' read fluently in his own language , '' and then pro- ceeds to interpret '' burdoun '' in the line , '' This Somonour bar to hym a stif burdoun , '' as '' a long walking-staff , '' and `` enclite , '' in the line , u He koude songes make and wel endite , '' as '' recite . ''

		Nor does he use his own language with much more accuracy than he interprets
Chaucer 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		He talks of '' an ex - pended force , '' when he means a spent one , of 60 THE DIAL -LSB- Jan 16 , `` temporal punishment in this world and the next , '' of Chaucer 's language being '' partly Teutonic and partly
Saxon	PERSON	, '' of science `` scotching '' the germ of faith , and he draws a most uncomfortable picture of `` bands of people ... praying and mortifying as they went , '' thus adding a new and unheard of ter - ror to the wayfaring life of the fourteenth century .

		A writer on the customs of the mediaeval Church might also be expected to know that
St. Gudula	LOCATION	of
Brussels	LOCATION	was not a man , and that a Franciscan house is not and never was called an abbey .

		In spite of these defects , the general reader will find some curi - ous and interesting items in these pages , if he have patience to hunt for them , among them , one that `` will probably reconcile him to the martyrdom of the saintly
Becket	LOCATION	.

		We read that being '' ' busie at his prayers in the garden at
Otford	LOCATION	, -LSB- he -RSB- was much dis - turbed by the sweet note and melodie of a nightin - gale that sang in a bush beside him , and in the might of his holinesse commanded all birds of this kind to be henceforth silent . '

		So the song of the nightin - gale was banished from Otford . ''

		A J anese The cheerful and amusinganddelight - artist 's childhood fully ingenuous Japanese artist and and youth , author who has caused hosts of read - ers on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to smile and chuckle over his queer but always vividly picturesque English , offers them another book of personal reminiscence and reflection in `` When I Was a Child '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which opens with a most ingratiating portrait of the author , from a photograph , and is further illustrated with many admirable drawings from his own prac - ticed hand .

		In twenty chapters of incident and characteristic comment , Mr.
Yoshio Markino	PERSON	tells the story of his early home life at Koromo -LRB- '' a small mountainous village in
Mikawa	LOCATION	, and although the view is beautiful , no pilgrims ever stop their feet at Koromo '' -RRB- , of his adoption into another family after his mother 's death , of his trying experiences at a mission school , his narrow escape from death in a terrible earthquake , his `` stepping on the highroad to ambition , '' and finally his emigration to
America	LOCATION	and his hardships in
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		Thus the ac - count of his life is brought to the point where `` A Japanese Artist in
London	LOCATION	'' begins .

		Two chapters of a philosophical and religious nature `` Ethic and Religion '' and '' Science and Human Sense '' close the book .

		The things told are interesting in them - selves , and the manner of their telling is now amus - ing , now pathetic , and always remarkable for its vividness and quaint imagery .

		A passage from the preface , describing the conflict of imagination with memory in the author , will remind the reader of another and more famous instance of this tendency to `` remember everything , whether it happened or not . ''

		`` When I was a child , '' says Mr.
Markino	PERSON	, `` I had rather good memory , and if my memory was absent there was only a dark blank in my brain .

		To-day it is different with my brain .

		Since I am grown I began to have such a great imagination .

		-LRB- I think I have got much imagination since I have become an artist .

		For artists are obliged to make pictures entirely from their imagination , especially to illustrate some fictions , etc. -RRB- . ''

		But he has tried to check this imaginative tendency by getting his facts from relatives at home .

		The book 's title is a little mis - leading .

		The author , born in
1874	DATE	, brings his narra - tive down to his twentieth year or beyond and we should have been glad to have him continue it to the present day .

		Fine examples The beauty of well-chosen phraseol - of old-school ogy and carefully-ordered periods oratory .

		distinguishes the `` Essays and Ad - dresses '' -LRB- Neale -RRB- of Judge
Roger A. Pryor	PERSON	, as issued , with a brief and modest introduction and use - ful explanatory notes , in a choice selection of eight public utterances , in a small volume adorned with a likeness of the speaker in his more vigorous prime .

		Judge
Pryor	PERSON	, soldier , diplomat , jurist , statesman , as he must be styled by reason of the variety and importance of his activities , is a native of
Virginia	LOCATION	, where he began the practice of the law in
1849	DATE	; was sent as Special Minister Plenipotentiary to
Greece	LOCATION	in
1855	DATE	; sac in the Thirty-sixth
Congress	ORGANIZATION	; was a member of the
Confederate States Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and a brigadier-general in the
Confederate States Army	LOCATION	; after the war he was admitted to the
New York	LOCATION	bar , and was appointed judge of
the Court of Common Pleas	ORGANIZATION	and , later , justice of
the Supreme Court of New York	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1894-99 -RRB- .

		Among his speeches now published are to be especially noted his defense of Southern independence upon the report of the Reso - lutions of the
Committee of Thirty-three	ORGANIZATION	, in the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Representatives ; his address at the first reunion of Federal and Confederate soldiers ; and his dis - course on `` The Influence of
Virginia	LOCATION	in the
Forma	LOCATION	- tion of the Federal Constitution . ''

		We are tempted to quote one paragraph of an address to law students , because of its charm of old-fashioned stateliness . ''

		A lucid and logical arrangement of topics so per - spicuous as instantly to reveal their own significance and force ; a diction choice but not fastidious , rich yet not redundant ; an exhibition of learning short of pedantry , but sufficient for information ; a concate - nation of argument , compact and convincing ; and an elocution graceful , animated , and earnest these are the qualities of speech by the concentrated spell of which even the most austere and impatient court will be fascinated into an involuntary thralldom . ''

		Could a Burke or a
Webster	PERSON	have done it better ?

		Dr
Hosmer	PERSON	's ^ r ' J ames -
K. Hosmer	PERSON	's reminiscent gleanings from volume , `` The Last Leaf '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , many fields .

		chapters of which have already de - lighted readers of the `` Atlantic , '' the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Tran - script , '' and the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post , '' owes much of its breadth of interest to the number of vocations successfully followed by its author in the course of his four-score years .

		As minister of religion , soldier , author , college professor , lecturer , librarian , and what else beside we will not attempt to say , he has seen life in many aspects and rubbed elbows with men of many sorts and conditions .


1913	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 61 Patted on the head in his infancy by
Lincoln	LOCATION	, he communed with
Emerson	PERSON	in his prime , and but to mention other names after these great ones would be to incur the risk of an anticlimax .

		His war mem - ories and his experiences in
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	at the outbreak of the conflict between those two countries are just sufficiently stirring to make doubly , agreeable by contrast the record of his intercourse with the illustrious men of peace , the scholars and writers and statesmen , whom it was his fortune to meet from time to time .

		The style of these chapters from a richly varied life pleases by its apt allusion , its well-chosen phrase , its quiet humor , and its play of fancy .

		Of his intercourse with
Simon Newcomb	PERSON	at
Harvard	LOCATION	, he says : '' We became very good friends .

		He was a genial fellow , capable as I have said of taking or making a joke , yet his moods were prevail - ingly serious , and he had already hitched his waggon to a star . ''

		The following bit of literary autobiog - raphy is of especial interest : `` In
1857	DATE	I sent a poem to the
Atlantic	LOCATION	then just beginning under his -LSB-
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's -RSB- editorship .

		My poem came back with the comment , ' Hardly good enough , but the writer certainly deserves encouragement . '

		This frost , though not unkind , nipped my budding aspirations in that direction .

		I hung my modest harp on the willows and have almost never since twanged the strings . ''

		The book 's closing pages contain some * ' eupeptic musings '' that show the author to be a determined optimist , as indeed was little doubtful before , and as might have been surmised from his portrait , which appears as frontispiece .

		A new volume In the volume entitled `` Essays in of studies by Radical Empiricism '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB-
William James	PERSON	.

		Mr
Ralph Barton Perry	PERSON	has col - lected a number of studies by the late
William James	PERSON	which represent that part of his philosophical work which the author regarded as more funda - mental than his provocative theory of pragmatism .

		His radical empiricism , he felt , could be accepted by those who were not pragmatists , although the pragmatic theory involved an empirical attitude .

		The particular doctrine which
James	PERSON	labelled radical empiricism was , however , more than the mere insist - ence upon the facts of experience , the determination to start philosophizing from particular facts and per - ceptions , which was insisted upon by the earlier phil - osophers of the school of
Hume	PERSON	, Mill , and others .

		This doctrine not only says that the only things that shall be debatable among philosophers are things definable in terms drawn from experience , but the relations of things which the older philosophers explained by some such unexperienced thing as an Absolute or Unknowable are in this doctrine re - garded as themselves matters of direct experience .

		These essays , which are for the most part of a some - what technical nature , deal with the use of this theory in the consideration of various philosophical problems .

		The thought-economy of the theory is insisted upon , and Mr.
James	PERSON	avows that it enables him to read the universe religiously and even theis - tically , though the god it enables him to postulate is not omni-anything , but simply `` the experiencer of widest actual conscious span . ''

		The rather startling title of the first essay , `` Does ' Consciousness ' Exist ? ''

		simply implies that to this theory consciousness as a state is not a reality but that only thoughts in the con - crete are real , and that they '' are made of the same stuff as things are . ''

		The sisters In Miss
Sarah G. Pomeroy	PERSON	's series of some of sketches entitled `` Little-known famou * men .

		Sisters of Well-known Men '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- are depicted the lives of a few from among the many women who have renounced their own gifts and aspi - rations that they might better serve the interests and fame of their brothers .

		It is similar in idea and plan to the well-known book of many years ago , `` Some Noble Sisters '' by
Edmund Lee	PERSON	, and the later and more familiar volume , `` Famous Sisters of Great Men '' by
Marianne Kirlew	PERSON	.

		Although the studies were prepared -LRB- as we are told in the Introduction -RRB- for academic degrees , there is a deplorable lack of authentic information regarding sources of material .

		Far too many of the long extracts are uncredited ; and in the Bibliography we note at least two errors in exact titles .

		But notwithstanding these flaws , and a painful effort to connect some of the sketches by `` a chance bond of time or place , '' the book is interesting and appreciative .

		We look in vain for a few names , notably that of
Caroline Herschel	PERSON	.

		After a general Introductory chapter , there are life stories of
Mary Sidney	PERSON	,
Mary Lamb	PERSON	,
Dorothy Words	PERSON	- worth ,
Elizabeth Whittier	PERSON	,
Sarianna Browning	PERSON	, Har - riet
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Sarah Disraeli	PERSON	,
Sophia Thoreau	PERSON	, and
Eliza Parkman	PERSON	.

		In tracing the devotion of the sis - ters of
Sidney	PERSON	,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, and
Disraeli	PERSON	, the author has given valuable glimpses of the home - atmosphere of these authors .

		Her attempt to portray the high - spirited , keen , but elusive
Sarianna Browning	PERSON	has met with better success than previous essays ; yet the outlines are still indefinite .

		The American women ,
Elizabeth Whittier	PERSON	,
Eliza Parkman	PERSON	, and
Sophia Thoreau	PERSON	, are treated with sympathy and insight .

		The fine mind , executive ability , and scien - tific knowledge of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's sister are duly ac - knowledged , sometimes in unassigned quotations .

		The lighter element in
Elizabeth Whittier	LOCATION	should be blended in memory with her earnestness and zeal .

		Speaking generally , the study of .

		fossils has < l uite 3 ustl y been regarded by persons who were not inspired devotees at the palaeontological shrine as a rather dull and dry sort of business .

		In '' Evolution in the Past '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- Mr.
Henry R. Knipe	PERSON	, F.L.S. , endeavors with fair success to show that if properly told the story of the orderly progression of living things in the history of the earth , as revealed by fossils , is not without interest .

		The tale begins with the lowly protozoa , sponges , jelly-fishes , and the like , in the Cambrian period of the Palaeozoic age .

		A clear account is given of what these creatures were like , how they lived , and what sort of a world it was 62 THE
DIAX	ORGANIZATION	, -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	in which they found themselves .

		In succeeding chap - ters the fauna and flora of each geological era are treated in the same way .

		The birth , growth , and final extinction of some great groups of animals and plants are traced .

		Finally we are brought in this way down to the present age .

		The chief defect of the book is found in the fact that it includes too much detailed information .

		The forest is somewhat ob - scured by the luxuriant growth of trees .

		Further - more , it is difficult to conceive why it was thought necessary to give the scientific name of nearly every organism mentioned .

		The old lady 's criticism of the dictionary as a piece of light literature applies with considerable force to the present work : there is an abundance of pleasant and informing words but the plot is a bit difficult to follow .

		The numerous illus - trations by Miss
Alice B. Woodhouse	PERSON	and Mr.
Ernest Bucknoll	PERSON	are a valuable addition to the book ; from both the artistic and the scientific standpoints they are excellent , particularly those done by the first - mentioned artist .

		Outlines of Most histories of Italian literature modern Italian pay extensive attention to the great literature .

		writers of the classical period , and deal but meagrely with the writers who came after
Ariosto	PERSON	and
Tasso	ORGANIZATION	.

		In giving us a history of '' Modern Italian Literature '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Lacy Collison-Morley	PERSON	has supplied a real want of English students of the subject , and placed us considerably in his debt .

		His work is essentially a history of Italian literature in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , with an introductory chapter upon the decadent period between
Tasso	ORGANIZATION	and
Metas	PERSON	- tasio .

		The writers who have chapters to them - selves are Metastasio ,
Goldoni	LOCATION	,
Alfieri	PERSON	,
Manzoni	PERSON	, and
Leopardi	LOCATION	.

		Later writers who are considered at some length are
Giusti	ORGANIZATION	,
Carducci	PERSON	, d'Annunzio , and
Fogazzaro	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of the latter , the author says : `` The fact that we can close this book with such a writer makes us look forward with confidence to the future of literature in
Italy	LOCATION	, '' as well it may .

		Mr.
Collison-Morley	PERSON	has much to say of the influence of English ideals on the Italian spirit , and his crit - ical outlook is philosophical .

		His book is a happy blend of exact information with intelligent criticism , and his illustrative extracts , although sparingly in - dulged in , are always well-chosen .

		His chapters on
Leopardi	LOCATION	and
Manzoni	PERSON	are models of sympathetic exposition .

		The whole work is a compendium , of course , but a highly readable one ; and we would not know where in English to look for a more satisfac - tory account of the letters of modern
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Mid-Victorian
Ifc	ORGANIZATION	has been said > Probably more than memories of once , that artists make the best sub - an art-critic .

		j ects f or biography .

		If that is SO , they should also be not bad subjects for autobiog - raphy as has been convincingly enough proved by
Cellini	PERSON	and
Haydon	PERSON	and
Vedder	PERSON	, to name no others .

		Mr.
Frederick Wedmore	PERSON	, though rather a critic than a practitioner of the fine arts , has certainly enough of the artist about him to bring him within this class of agreeable autobiographers .

		His '' Memories '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- will be enjoyed by all who take delight in the cultured expression of a mind stored with the remembrance of cheerful yesterdays .

		Artists , actors , authors , editors , preachers , and others , pass across his pages , each leaving the impression of a distinct individuality , each drawn for us in a few strokes by the hand of a literary artist .

		Dickens ,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Henry Irving	PERSON	,
Walter Pater	PERSON	,
Whistler	LOCATION	,
Henry Ward Beecher	PERSON	, and others too numerous to mention , give variety and interest to his brief and anecdotal chapters .

		An amusing story of a conver - sation between old
Lady Southampton	LOCATION	and
Queen Victoria	ORGANIZATION	represents the former as saying : k ` Do not you think , Ma'am , one of the satisfactions of the
Future State	ORGANIZATION	will be not only our reunion with those whom we have loved on
Earth	LOCATION	, but our opportunities of seeing face to face so many of the noble figures of the Past of other lands and times ?

		Bible times , for instance .

		Abraham will be there , Ma'am .

		Isaac , too , and
Jacob	PERSON	.

		Think of what they will be like !

		And the sweet singer of
Israel	LOCATION	, He , too .

		Yes , Ma'am .

John	PERSON	playing cards .

		jft n g y an
Rensselaer	LOCATION	, who twenty years ago wrote a book -LRB- now out of print -RRB- entitled `` The Devil 's Picture Book , '' is a study of a rather baffling subject , the origin and antiquity of playing cards having hitherto been enveloped in a cloud of much misapprehension and uncertainty .

		The pre - vailing notion that cards were first invented for the amusement of a crazy French king is of course dis - missed at once as absurdly erroneous by Mrs.
Van Rensselaer	PERSON	, who carries back their origin to `` the mysteries of ancient days , '' and assures her readers that `` the heraldic devices of
Mercury	ORGANIZATION	, which are the emblems of what has always been called , by his - torians , ' The Book of Thoth Hermes Trismegistus , ' are in themselves mute proof of the connection of the Tarots -LRB- as they are now called -RRB- with the cult of Mercury . ''

		Many plates , of curious interest , are provided , and the writer makes good use of sources of information not accessible to earlier writers on the subject .

		But one is tempted to smile at the serious - ness with which the virtues of cards as aids to the revealing of the future are treated .

		At the very outset , the book -LRB- on its wrapper -RRB- professes its ability to teach any person the art of fortune-telling ; and in the middle of the volume the invention of the French pips is spoken of as being '' as well adapted for play - ing as were the original Tarots suited for divining the lives and characteristics of mankind . ''

		Neverthe - less the work is packed with unusual erudition , and will delight all who take their card-playing seriously * The addition of an index and of a glossary -LRB- ety - mological , if possible -RRB- of unusual and foreign terms would enhance the value of any subsequent re-issues of the book .

		110 THE PUBLIC SCHOOL UP TO DATE .

		One of the most interesting educational pub - lications we have ever seen is the unpretentious pamphlet of thirty-two pages just issued by the
Russell Sage Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, and entitled '' A
Comparative Study of Public School Systems	ORGANIZATION	in the Forty-eight States . ''

		Students of any particular phase of the subject of public educa - tion usually find themselves greatly handicapped by the difficulty of obtaining accurate statistical information upon current conditions , and can often do no better in their comparative showings than to set side by side variously dated figures from different parts of the country .

		This diffi - culty is due in part to the fact that many school reports are inexcusably belated in publication , and in part to the fact that the method of pre - senting reports is not standardized , thus making it extremely difficult to determine the relative efficiency of the school systems of the several states in some very important matters .

		Even the reports of the
United States Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	are made faulty by lack of time - liness , and by the fact that , in spite of their bewildering array of figures , they are frequently found not to contain the very things that the investigator most wants .

		The pamphlet now under consideration represents what must have been an enormous amount of labor , and for the first time presents in simple form what may be called a bird 's - eye view of present conditions in all the essential phases of the subject .

		There are sixteen special showings in this pamphlet , each of them , as a rule , made by means of a graphic chart , a statistical column , and a few pertinent explanatory notes .

		Take the first of them , for example , which deals with '' children in school and out , '' and it shows us at a glance the relation of the school population of each state to the total child population of school age .

		The display ranges from
Vermont	LOCATION	, with 92.7 per cent of her children in school , to
Louisiana	LOCATION	, with only 55.3 per cent , or a little more than half .

		A note suggests that '' Ver - mont ,
Maine	LOCATION	, and
Connecticut	LOCATION	, with more than 90 per cent of the children of school age actually in school , are making better investments in future citizenship than
Alabama	LOCATION	,
Texas	LOCATION	,
Nevada	LOCATION	, and
Louisiana	LOCATION	, with from 35 to
45 per cent	MONEY	of 82 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, their children of school age not receiving school - ing . ''

		We might easily devote an entire article to this subject alone , or to any other single exhibit of the pamphlet , but at present we can do no more than to pick out suggestive nuggets of fact here and there from this rich mine of pedagogical information .

		In the statistics of school revenue the range is from
New York	LOCATION	, with over fifty millions of annual revenue almost all of it taxes to
Nevada	LOCATION	, with about half a million , or approximately one per cent of what the larger state collects .

		This represents a far greater discrepancy than the rela - tive populations would warrant , which makes it evident either that
New York	LOCATION	exceeds its duty , or that
Nevada	LOCATION	falls short of it .

		It is interesting to learn that local taxation supports the public schools , from 97 per cent in the case of
Massa	LOCATION	- chusetts to only 2
7 per cent	MONEY	in the case of
Georgia	LOCATION	.

		It is highly desirable that the local communities should learn not to look to the state for aid for their schools , and in this matter
Massachusetts	LOCATION	,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, and
Kansas	LOCATION	, who are above the 90 per cent mark , furnish examples that the other states should seek to emulate .

		Six states get from 10 to
20 per cent	MONEY	of their school income from permanent land grant funds ; allowing for this , the honor list of states which do not lean heavily upon state taxation should be consider - ably increased .

		But there is not much to be said for the local governments of
Kentucky	LOCATION	,
Georgia	LOCATION	, and
Alabama	LOCATION	, which call upon the state to collect and distribute more than half of the funds applied to the purposes of the schools .

		There are no more vitally important figures in this statistical exhibit than those which give the investment in school plant , the expendi - ture per child of school age , the ratio between wealth and school expenditure , and the daily cost of the child 's schooling .


Massachusetts	LOCATION	has put
115 dollars	MONEY	for each of her children into school buildings and grounds ;
Missis	LOCATION	- sippi has provided the munificent sum of four dollars .

		This is the best available index for a state of the past educational interest of its people .

		The amount annually spent for each < ?

		hild is from thirty-two to three dollars in
Washington	LOCATION	and
South Carolina	LOCATION	, respectively .

		A note points the moral : `` In the long run , states , like individuals , purchase about what they pay for , not much more and not much less . ''

		For each hundred dollars of wealth in the state , the amount paid annually for schools is
75 cents	MONEY	in
Oklahoma	LOCATION	and
19 cents	MONEY	in
New Hampshire	LOCATION	.

		It would seem to be in order for the
White Mountain State	ORGANIZATION	to quadruple its educational budget without delay , unless it is content to be permanently shamed by what was only a few years ago the Indian Territory .


Nevada	LOCATION	, which makes a rather poor showing in most respects , comes magnificently to the front in the matter of the daily cost per child in its schools , pro- viding no less than
39 cents	MONEY	, as against the
seven cents	MONEY	of
Georgia	LOCATION	and the
Carolinas	LOCATION	.

		Low cost , of course , means cheap teaching , and the wages that we pay our teachers , the conntry throughout , are nothing less than a national scandal .

		This latter subject deserves a paragraph of its own , and the statistics of average salary in the forty-eight states show some surprising con - trasts .


California	LOCATION	and
Arizona	LOCATION	, with averages of
918 dollars	MONEY	and
817 dollars	MONEY	, respectively , set the pace for even
New York	LOCATION	and
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, whose averages are
813 dollars	MONEY	and
757 dollars	MONEY	, respectively .


North Carolina	LOCATION	is disgraced by the fact that its teachers receive salaries averag - ing only
200 dollars	MONEY	, and this of course means that there are thousands of individuals receiving far less than this average .

		The average for the entire country is only
485 dollars	MONEY	, which is less than the average for factory workers and com - mon laborers . ''

		The fact that teachers ' wages are lower than those paid for almost any other sort of service means that as a nation we are neither asking for nor getting a high grade of service , and that as a nation we place a low valuation on the teacher 's work . ''

		It seems to be about time for public speakers to stop boasting about our national devotion to educa - tion .

		Stated in aggregates of millions of dol - lars , the figures are doubtless impressive ; stated in any rational way , with reference to the num - bers of teachers and taught , or with reference to our resources in wealth and taxation , they constitute a pitiful exposure of our national niggardliness .

		We must pass over the exhibits concerned with days of schooling , with compulsory attend - ance , with school mortality , with illiteracy , with legislation upon building construction , with free text books , and with medical inspection , in order to reach the final showing , which judges each state by the ten most important tests of effi - ciency , and gives to each a general rank in accordance with the way in which it meets these tests , besides giving in separate columns its rank under each separate test .

		Taking as an example our own state of
Illinois	LOCATION	, we find that while its
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 83 general ranking is eight , its special ranking is as follows : Children in school ... 14 School plant 7 Expense per child ... 8 School days per child ... 8 Length of school year ... 15 Attendance 11 Expenditure and wealth ... 28 Daily cost 13 High schools ... .

		20 Salaries 11 It obviously behooves us as a commonwealth to spend upon education something like twice what we now spend , which would give us third place in the scale , to do much more than we now do for high schools , to lengthen the school year in the rural districts -LRB- for it is they that now bring it down to 171 days -RRB- , and to get more of our children into school .

		These are the reforms that are ear-marked for us by the pamphlet , and , effectively made , would enable us to feel fairly proud of our state .

		Of course , as a counsel of perfection , each state of the forty - eight should wish to get into the first place , but as this is obviously impossible , should aim to outdistance as many of the others as possible . ''

		The object of this booklet , '' we are pithily informed , `` is to make the indifferent different . ''

		It can hardly fail of this effect upon the mind of anyone who gives it an intelligent examina - tion .

		A LITERARY PEACE MOVEMENT , At a banquet recently held in
Paris	LOCATION	, when the spectre of a European war had barely been ban - ished , a German speaker proudly asserted that
Maupassant	PERSON	was as familiar to German readers as any native modern writer ; and a French speaker pointed with pride to the familiarity of French literati with the works of Sudermann and others , adding , with a shaft of sarcasm directed at his own people , that even the `` Faust '' of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, long a favorite through the opera of
Gounod	ORGANIZATION	, was being prepared for production by
M. Antoine !	ORGANIZATION

		There was enough , however , in the addresses of the evening that called to mind some remarks of
Romain Holland	PERSON	, who perhaps knows his French and knows the Germans as well as any Frenchman or German living : '' We must not indulge in illusions .

		We are at present more ignorant of the world than the men of the past .

		Translations of a few foreign novels and a rapid survey of the papers do not suffice to make one penetrate the genius of another people .

		They only relieve us too easily of any personal effort at knowing them first hand , they favor ignorance , vanity and laziness .

		Compare with that shabby curiosity the eagerness of mind and the untiring labor of a
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, a
Diderot	ORGANIZATION	, an Abbe Provost and their friends , not to mention
Leibnitz	PERSON	or Goethe . ''

		There is little doubt that , notwithstanding the greater facilities of travel , the rapid interchange of news through the press and the telegraph , and other features of modern international intercourse , famil - iarity and sympathy with the intellectual achieve - ments of the neighbors across the Rhine were greater in the period of the Huguenot immigration into
Germany	LOCATION	, of the royal
Francophile Frederick the Great	PERSON	, and of the French encyclopedists , than it is now .

		If , however , the Germans seem more familiar with French letters than the French with German literature , it is well to remember that the Huguenot element was so thoroughly assimilated in the Ger - man people that its influence lingers in many a German town , and in a part of
Berlin	LOCATION	which they had called Moabit , where French is to this day the dominant language in a college likewise dating from that period .

		But the violent reaction against any - thing French which succeeded the Napoleonic inva - sion of a century ago seems no less justified than the indifference of the French to-day towards German literature of the decades following upon the war of 1870-1 .

		For the patriotism of a people is ever at the beck and call of the powers who need the backing of the mass for the realization of their plans , and the chauvinism of a nation is rooted in ignorance and nurtured by misguided patriotism .

		Yet the tide of intellectual sympathies does not always swell and subside with the tide of political developments .

		Said
Ludwig Borne	PERSON	in '' Die Wage '' in the year
1836	DATE	: '' The political history of a people is the biography of its egotism , but the literature is the history of its humanitarian life , for it does not stop before legal barriers , or geological frontiers , but leaps across laws , customs , antipathies , and prejudices . ''

		Thus in the wake of the post-Napoleonic Franco - phobia in
Germany	LOCATION	had come the romantic school , with its revival of a cosmopolitan culture which had distinguished the writers of the past .

		In
France	LOCATION	,
Gerard de Nerval	ORGANIZATION	had translated ''
Faust	PERSON	, '' and had published an anthology of German verse embracing selections from
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Schiller	PERSON	,
Bttrger	PERSON	,
Uhland	LOCATION	,
Korner	PERSON	,
Jean Paul	PERSON	, and
Heine	ORGANIZATION	.

		Heine himself had made
Paris	LOCATION	his home , and wrote for German maga - zines on French letters , music , and art , and for French reviews on German philosophy and litera - ture .

		In the course of the century many other less known writers served as mutual literary interpreters between the two politically hostile nations .


Rudolf Lindau	PERSON	, the gifted though less popular brother of
Paul Lindau	PERSON	, wrote in French and German .

		The polylingual feuilletonist ,
A. Mels	PERSON	, who died in
Chi	LOCATION	- cago a year after the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	, which he attended as foreign correspondent , had when a resident of
Paris	LOCATION	in his prime written for German , French , English , and Spanish papers .

		With the Franco-German war came a brief reac - tion against this literary internationalism in both countries .

		But the generation of Germans that grew THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, , up after the glamor of military glory had faded again sought in
France	LOCATION	the source of much of its inspira - tion , and trained its literary talents upon the models of French masters , foremost among them Zola .

		Nor was the younger generation in
France	LOCATION	slow at recog - nizing the one great personality that rose above the horizon of the new German empire
Nietzsche	PERSON	, who with the penetrating searchlight of his genius covered the world 's culture , past and present , and found it '' all too human . ''

		Through him was revealed to independent French thinkers the intellectual re - valuation that had begun in
Germany	LOCATION	, when the glit - ter of the wealth acquired by the war had vanished and symptoms of intellectual stagnation and moral decadence had begun to appear .

		Nietzsche intro - duced the young Germans to the philosophy of Gobineau and to the subtle art of Stendhal-Beyle .

		He was an admirable mediator between
Teuton	PERSON	and
Gaul	PERSON	, and a light-bearer to both .

		But while the French intellectuals studied
Nietz	PERSON	- sche 's philosophy , the literature which followed in the wake of his iconoclasm remained practically un - known in
France	LOCATION	.

		Of that young
Germany	LOCATION	which gives such striking proofs of his far-reaching influ - ence , and of the lessons learned from
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	,
Tolstoi	LOCATION	, and Zola , only
Gerhart Hauptmann	PERSON	has reached a French audience eager to know something of the forces at work in the literature of the so-called arch - enemy across the
Rhine	LOCATION	.

		Even of the extent of German interest in French letters , of the amazing number of German editions of French authors , the French themselves are supremely ignorant .

		For chauvinist currents are strong in the intellectual world of
France	LOCATION	.

		Even the faculty of German let - ters at the Sorbonne was made to feel these influ - ences a few years ago , when Professor
Andler	PERSON	and a number of his students , returning from a journey to
Germany	LOCATION	undertaken for purposes of study , were made the butt of hostile demonstrations on the part of the `` nationalist '' students backed by
Maurice Barres	PERSON	.

		Thus there is decided room for a propaganda of better mutual understanding , such as was inaugu - rated not quite a year ago and culminated in the banquet referred to at the beginning of this article .

		There was truth in the remark of one of the speakers that even though the achievements of the two nations were known and appreciated by a small minority on both sides of the
Rhine	LOCATION	, there was need of having the men and women behind those works meet face to face and found upon the basis of social relations the work of mutual understanding .

		That is one of the most practical aims in the programme of the society `` Pour Mieux Se Connaltre , '' and of the most direct appeal .

		The number of Germans residing in
Paris	LOCATION	has been estimated at six thousand .

		A large percentage consists of members of various intellect - ual professions , teachers , students , artists , writers , whose opportunities for direct personal contact with their French colleagues are limited .

		There is the Alsatian element , whose position whether on this or the other side of the
Rhine	LOCATION	is surely not enviable .

		The very existence of these people is at all too fre - quent intervals menaced by the war-clouds that keep looming up on the political horizon of the two coun - tries .

		The mission of the society is of vast import - ance , and its possibilities are equally vast .

		For the French senator ,
Baron	PERSON	d'Estournelles de Constant r who said , '' Le rapprochement franco-allemand est la condition de la paix du monde , '' has given voice to a sentiment the truth whereof can scarcely be doubted .

		Nor can this mutual approach be more successfully attained than by an inofficial intercourse between representatives of both nations and by the intellectual exchange which mutual familiarity with their science , art , and letters insures .

		For , after all , the world of intellect is neutral ground , and if repre - sentatives of both nations can meet at international congresses of science for the exchange of experiences , and by striving in common for the promotion of knowledge forget the barriers that separate them in the political arena , there is no reason why men and women in the world of art and letters should not meet for the purpose of personal acquaintance and a more intimate understanding of the foreign mind , and by mitigating the spirit of mutual distrust pro- mote the possibility of peace .

		The membership of the society bids fair to repre - sent that intellectual world which should know no national boundaries .

		Among its French members one notes Octave Mirbeau ,

		The secretaries are

Pere Hyacinthe	PERSON	, who made his debut as dramatist some years ago and is now editing a mag - azine , and Guilbeaux , a Belgian by birth , and a poet and critic of rare ability , who writes on German letters for French and on French letters for Ger - man reviews .

		The propaganda of this movement for an intellec - tual Franco-German `` rapprochement '' includes the arrangement of exhibitions of French art and con - certs of French music in

		Among the works of this kind to be presented in
France	LOCATION	is the monumental double drama by
Carl Hauptmann	PERSON	, ''

		A review called `` Cahiers
Franco	PERSON	- Allemands '' is the temporary organ of the society ; but a large review , taking its name from the one dreamed of by
Heine	PERSON	, ''
France	LOCATION	- Allemagne , '' is to be founded , and will be devoted to the discussion of Franco-German problems and to the exchange between French and German letters .

		This propaganda of ideas , supple - mented by banquets and other social reunions , is likely to bring about relations between the French and the German members which will deliver both from the burden of preconceived notions and enlarge their vision towards an appreciative understanding of the spirit of the people whom the political machi - nations of the powers would make their enemy .

		The influence radiating from such a nucleus of unbiased minds seems one of the most promising factors in the propaganda for a permanent peace between the French and the Germans , whom Victor Hugo called '' les deux nations maitresses '' and whose perpetual misunderstandings disturb the whole world .

		A. VON ENDE .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE LURE OF THE NOVEL loses nothing of its strength with the progress of the suns and the enormous increase in the number of novels .

		But it is encouraging to note at the same time an occa - sional sign of the increasing attractiveness of other departments of literature .

		In the city of Wash - ington , for instance , the people are learning , not to like fiction less , but to like history and science more .

		In the current yearly report of the
Public Library of the District of Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Bowerman	PERSON	, the librarian , records with satisfaction a nearly station - ary condition in the number of story-books circu - lated in recent years , with a marked increase in the circulation of more serious reading matter .

		In brief , the fiction figures for the last eight years show a relative shrinkage amounting to twenty-six per cent in the total circulation of to-day ; that is , from a fiction circulation of
eighty-four per cent	MONEY	in
1904	DATE	, there has been a gradual fall to fifty - eight per cent last year .

		Without reference to a possible change in readers ' tastes , the factors supposed to have produced this encouraging result are the per - sonal help and guidance given by assistants , pro- gressive extension of the open-shelf system , and special displays of works on various subjects in a case labelled '' Some Readable Books '' and holding about two hundred and twenty-five volumes , which need frequent replenishing .

		The library 's plan of compiling its occasional press notices into a monthly bulletin , and of cooperating with other institutions or associations in the preparation of bibliographic aids , calls for commendation .

		A CHEERFUL PESSIMIST , facing unabashed the world 's prone ness to evil , and having always as a final resource the courage of despair , is a more inspiring personage than the fatuously smiling op - timist , reiterating his optimism with the unconvinc - ing emphasis of him who protests too much .

		Mr.
Alfred Russel Wallace	PERSON	, who has just completed his ninetieth year , declares with the Preacher : `` I have seen all the works that are done under the sun ; and , behold , all is vanity and vexation of spirit . ''

		Im - mense industrial and scientific progress has been witnessed by this eminent man of science , but he is reported as denying that man has advanced in morals or intellect in the last seven thousand years . ''

		Everything is as bad as it can possibly be .

		From top to bottom our whole social system is rotten , full of vice and everything that is bad . ''

		Yet the outlook ahead seems to him hopeful , perhaps because of what the new science of eugenics , in which he is said to have great faith , is expected to accomplish .

		And to hasten the coming of the good time he has in pre - paration a work of which he says that it is '' a book suggesting the necessary work for the labor party in its campaign against poverty , and laying down what I believe to be the fundamental principles and means by which continuous progress in the well-being of the community can be secured . ''

		Meanwhile , as a sort of counterpoise -LRB- however light -RRB- to the weight of this eminent thinker 's utterances , the jocular Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	is declaring himself in the press a staunch unbeliever in the good things promised by the eugen - ists , and he has a new book about to be issued on '' The Evil of Eugenics . ''

		But he will have abund - ant time and possibly sufficient cause to change his mind before he is ninety years old .

		POSTAL LEGISLATION FOR THE DISCOURAGEMENT OF EDUCATION now stands on the statute-book , and should receive early revision .

		By the terms of the new parcel-post law , potatoes and turnips and other produce may be mailed for local delivery at
five cents	MONEY	for a single pound , or
fifteen cents	MONEY	for eleven pounds , with corresponding rates between these weights ; but a book weighing a pound must bear
eight cents	MONEY	in stamps , and no book exceeding four pounds may be sent by mail .

		Packages of books aggregating eleven pounds in weight would call for at least
eighty-eight cents	MONEY	' worth of stamps as com - pared with
fifteen cents	MONEY	for the same weight of bricks or cabbages or shingle nails .

		A public library or a bookshop may not supply its near-by patrons with reading matter through the mail at a lesser rate than
eight cents	MONEY	a pound , but the grocer or dry-goods dealer is allowed to fill the orders of his customers throughout a fifty-mile zone at a postal rate varying from
five cents	MONEY	for a single pound to
thirty-five cents	MONEY	for eleven pounds .

		When the old rate on merchan - dise other than printed matter was fixed at
one cent	MONEY	an ounce , it was considered a handsome concession 86 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, to the cause of education and of literature to allow books to go by mail at one-half that rate .

		But now the general merchandise rate for short distances has been diminished about eighty per cent , while the book-rate remains as before .

		That this unfair dis - crimination may soon be corrected is the prayer of all who handle books or are interested in the spread of literature and learning .

		THE PASSING OF THE PERIOD , in sentence construc - tion , such as our ancestors knew it , is not cause for unmixed satisfaction .

		An impatience that can not tolerate a period of more than twenty words , or of more than two clauses , is not an impatience to be humored .

		The present mode of cutting up one 's written discourse into snippets , or ver bless interjec - tions , makes in reality hard reading and produces an unsightly page .

		In a recent piece of writing by an author of repute occurs one sentence of only ten words with three full-stops , two of which might much better have been commas .

		The mail has just brought to us an anonymous communication in the form of a copy of our sentence beginning at the bottom of the first column of page 40 of our last issue , with a parenthesized exclamation-point added , presumably in protest at the length of the sentence .

		Yet it con - tains only forty-five words .

		We have this moment , at the very first page turned up in opening
Ruskin	PERSON	, chanced on a sentence of one hundred and seven words which is short for
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		-LRB- The sentence is the second in the third chapter of `` The Seven Lamps of Architecture . '' -RRB-

		It is true our own sen - tence contains a double involution , a relative clause within a relative clause ; but who with any head at all on his shoulders need get lost in so unintricate a maze ?

		After ten minutes ' reading of Macaulay or
Gibbon	PERSON	the offending passage might almost strike one as curt .

		Scott and
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	, not to mention
Meredith	PERSON	and Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, do not hesitate to pack into a single sentence all that it can comfortably carry .

		But those of us who can not stand the strain of sentences more than ten words long can always go back to our primer and enjoy the brevity and lucidity of its style . ''

		See the cat .

		The cat has caught a mouse .

		The cat will eat the mouse .

		Poor mouse ! ''

		... FICTION AS A PLEASANT POISON has withstood unnumbered attacks of the anti-fictionists , and will withstand unnumbered more .


Canon Barry	ORGANIZATION	, writ - ing in `` Everyman , '' is the latest bitter foe to the novel ; and
Temple Scott	ORGANIZATION	, in the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript , '' rushes valiantly to its defense .

		`` The tyranny of the novel , '' avers the churchman , `` betokens that faith has given way to feeling , and that feeling is debauched by excitement following on the loss of long-cherished ideals . ''

		`` We can not be so bad as the
Canon	ORGANIZATION	pictures us , '' is the reply , `` or he would not take this trouble to make us see the error of our ways .

		There must be a sense for the right in us if he expects us to respond to his appeal . ''

		Of course the whole discussion will only leave each side more firmly fixed in its opinion than before .

		Instead of wasting so much good printer 's ink in obvious gen - eralities the contestants might wisely have come to a short and simple agreement to the proposition that there are novels and novels , the best of them good for the head and good for the heart , the worst too worthless to claim an intelligent person 's attention , and the middling ones regrettably numerous and by no means tonic in their action on the reader , but less injurious than many forms of diversion or sensation - alism that lure those who know not the pleasures of reading .

		, .

		THE INCINERATION OF ''
TOM JONES	PERSON	, '' which was solemnly performed the other day at
Doncaster	ORGANIZATION	by order of the committee of the
Doncaster Free Li	ORGANIZATION	- brary , will happily not deprive the rest of the world of the privilege of reading that masterpiece in early British fiction .

		It seems that one of the worthy
Yorkshire	LOCATION	men composing the committee or govern - ing body of the above-named library chanced to take the book home , having never read it before , and was scandalized at certain characteristics of the author 's style .

		He reported the story an immoral work and thus precipitated a heated debate in the committee room , where , though one member staunchly stood up for the book as being superior to history as a faithful picture of Fielding 's times , the prevailing sentiment was adverse to its retention on the shelves of the Doncaster library ; and so it was sentenced to death by fire , and met its cruel fate with the true martyr 's noble fortitude .

		But , as hinted above , there are other copies of the famous work known to be still extant , and for the next few weeks booksellers and delivery-desk attendants are likely to note an in - crease , slight but nevertheless perceptible , in the demand for the book , because of the action of the
Doncaster Corporation Free Library Committee	ORGANIZATION	.

		Thus it is that the cause of morality is advanced as they imagine in
Yorkshire	LOCATION	.

		A NEW `` GAME OF AUTHORS '' might take the form of preposterous proof that every writer 's works were written by somebody else ; that
Wordsworth	PERSON	, for example , wrote
Scott	PERSON	's novels , and that Lamb wrote
Shelley	PERSON	's poems .

		The Baconians have led the way in this recreational exercise , and Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	hilariously follows suit in a late amusing contribu - tion to the '' Illustrated
London	LOCATION	News . ''

		Under the heading `` Who Wrote Bacon ? ''

		he proceeds to de - monstrate , in a manner calculated to convince those who have just indulged in `` a heavy and Pickwickian Christmas dinner , '' that the author of
Bacon	PERSON	's writ - ings was none other than
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The histori - cal proofs are handled with masterly skill .

		After referring to the execution of Essex and
Southamp	PERSON	- ton 's imprisonment in the Tower , and to the friend - ship between
Essex	ORGANIZATION	and
Bacon	PERSON	and that between
Southampton	ORGANIZATION	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, he concludes , with irrefutable logic : `` Could anything in Baconian mud be clearer ?

		Shakespeare in some state of penitence -LRB- or drink -RRB- told
Southampton	LOCATION	that he himself was ` Bacon . '

		Southampton was just about to warn his friend Essex against the impostor , when the impos -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 87 tor had the sense to strike first and kill the man who might know , and imprison the man who did know and only fawn on him when his tongue was free .

		Is it not a connected story ?

		Is it not a conceivable hypothesis ?

		Why , no ; it is a new Christmas game . ''

		`` CUMULATIVE '' BIBLIOGRAPHY , as devised and practiced by the
H. W. Wilson Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Minneapolis	LOCATION	, has its history related in an interesting illustrated pamphlet issued by the above-named publishing house .

		It was in
1889	DATE	that the first modest beginnings of the present business took shape in a partnership between two students of the
University of Minnesota	ORGANIZATION	who un - dertook -LRB- on a capital of one hundred dollars , partly borrowed -RRB- to deal in students ' text-books and supplies .

		This firm ,
Morris & Wilson	ORGANIZATION	, lost its senior partner when he was graduated in
1892	DATE	, and since then Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	has been head of the house , which is now an incorporated company .

		Its cumulative-catalogue work dates from
1898	DATE	, and includes the now well - known and , to library workers and book-dealers , almost indispensable `` Cumulative Book Index , '' `` United States Catalogue , '' and `` Readers ' Guide to Periodical Literature , '' with an increasing list of other bibliographic aids such as `` Library Work '' -LRB- now taken over by the `` Library Journal '' -RRB- , `` Book Review Digest , '' a series of handbooks for debaters , a fiction catalogue , and a catalogue of children 's books .

		The now large business and large body of employees , with their `` cafeteria '' lunch-room , their annual Christmas tree and
summer	DATE	picnic , and their evident esprit de corps , make an impressive appearance as the outgrowth of that tentative student enterprise of two youths working their way through college .

		A MEMORIAL TABLET TO THE AUTHOR OF `` THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER '' was unveiled , with ap - propriate ceremonies ,
January 11	DATE	, in the
Mt. Vernon Place Methodist Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Baltimore	LOCATION	, the site of the house in which
Francis Scott Key	PERSON	died just seventy years earlier .

		The tablet was presented to the church by the
Baltimore	LOCATION	Chapter of the Daugh - ters of the American Revolution , and was afterward set in its permanent place on the corner of the build - ing , facing Charles Street .

		Mrs.
Charles W. Bassett	PERSON	, honorary regent of the chapter , conceived and largely brought to accomplishment this tribute to Key , and the
Baltimore	LOCATION	sculptor , Mr.
Hans Schuler	PERSON	, designed the tablet , a medallion portrait set against a partly - furled flag , with appropriate inscriptions and orna - mentation .

		In her address Mrs.
Bassett	PERSON	called attention to the little-remembered fact that the

		A STAUNCH DEFENDER OF SHAKESPEARE against the assaults of the Baconians died at his home in
Boston	LOCATION	on the thirteenth of
January	DATE	.

		Judge
Charles Allen	PERSON	, formerly of the
Massachusetts Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, but latterly a gentleman of leisure devoting himself to literature and authorship and travel , uttered his protest against the Baconian madness in a volume modestly entitled '' Notes on the Bacon-Shakespeare Question , '' which was published in
1900	DATE	and won the warm commendation of Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	and others whose praise was worth having .

		Judge
Allen	PERSON	, as an experienced jurist , naturally devoted himself espe - cially to a refutation of the charge that the Shake - spearean plays contain such evidences of legal learning as Shakespeare could not have possessed .

		This and other points in the controversy are ably , succinctly , and interestingly treated .

		The combined brevity and cogency of the argument are in marked contrast to the diffuseness and inconclusiveness of the custom - ary Baconian contention .

		Judge
Allen	PERSON	had attained the ripe age of eighty-five years and nine months -LRB- lacking four days -RRB- when he died .

		NEW BOOKS FOR OLD , if cried through the streets , might bring the crier not a few treasures almost as precious as
Aladdin	ORGANIZATION	's wonderful lamp .

		A hasty and afterward much regretted exchange of this sort was not long ago made by Sir
Herbert Maxwell	PERSON	, as report avers ; and he is now cautioning others to learn a lesson from his experience .

		Desiring the latest edition of a standard work of reference , and feeling unwilling to pay out the thirty-five pounds demanded for it by the bookseller , he searched his library for something to offer in exchange , and chanced upon a set of `` The Sporting Magazine '' complete -LRB- 1793-1870 -RRB- , which he innocently offered for the reference work .

		The offer was accepted without delay .

		Not many weeks afterward he ex - perienced a sensation upon reading that a set of the periodical in question had just been sold at auction for nine hundred and fifty pounds .

		And now he is advising deliberation and care in the weeding out of old books from one 's library .

		WHY THE DIERESIS AND HYPHEN TO INDICATE PRONUNCIATION ?

		CTo the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Will you not add your Amen in a tilt against the habit of attempting to teach the pronunciation , or for - mation , of words by means of the dieresis and hyphen ?

		Authors , editors , typesetters , proofreaders , and even general readers , will surely welcome the suggestion .

		Labor and worry will be spared all these classes , and a deal of expense to the community will be avoided .

		The dieresis and hyphen are almost the last of some five thousand symbols , contractions , or abbreviations of words , elisions of suffixes , etc. , invented by the copyists of the middle ages to save labor and vellum .

		The palimpsest is an eloquent proof that the tax for vellum was severely felt .

		With the exception of a very few they suddenly disappeared when printing and paper were invented .

		In the French language a few were retained , but it is suggestive that often the modern French author does not write them in his copy , but leaves the typesetter to put them in according to old custom and rule .

		His 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, acute , grave , and circumflex accents indicate quality not emphasis , while we long ago gave up both attempts .

		The Germans still retain the umlaut , and we the dier - esis , hyphen , and , half ashamed of it , the ligature .

		This last , one may note in passing , by hurry and shortening , degenerated long ago into the dieresis and hyphen .

		We English have grown to disuse the ligature except in the antique ce and ce , rapidly now and at last passing into obsolescence .

		As to the dieresis , it is self-evident that printing is one art , pronunciation another , the two at best most awkwardly and ineffectively interrelated .

		The printed form of words inevitably drifts into fixedness and uni - formity , while pronunciation varies constantly in place and time .

		The labors of the mirthful bands of spelling reformers are in proof , and still more , the failure of their labors .

		Take a multitude of our words such as cooperate , coincide , zoology , zoophilist , reenter , reinter , reiterate , does the dieresis or hyphen iu the least aid a person of intel - ligence and education to write or pronounce them cor - rectly ?

		If so it is plain that the rule should be observed in a thousand words not now so marked .

		Many of these , moreover , can not possibly be given the dieresis , for instance , coincide , ptomaine , reiterate , etc. , because three dots would be required over one i. If , also , the rule is necessary in one class of words , it should be in others , such as react , to distinguish it from other words of similar spelling but pronounced as one syllable .

		Extra - ordinary is another example , and so on indefinitely .

		Do rational folk believe that cooperation needs the dieresis to avoid confusion with the idea of the cooper , his barrels , or his trade ?

		A learned bookmaker once so contended .

		The linotype and other typesetting machines have recently revolutionized the typographer 's business , and writers and proofreaders have already been tormented by the machines ' omission of the dieresis as well , also , in the output of a million typewriting machines and , if dictionary slaves , they have been compelled to order the plaguey dots reinserted by hand .

		In oomycetes , oophorectomy , zoology , and scores more , are we in danger of pronouncing the first three or four letters as if they constituted one syllable ?

		Gott bewahr !

		Lastly , why persist in the ludicrously unnecessary use of the hyphen to hold together parts of words which need not and should not be separated either a little or wholly ?

		Proofreaders and editors often seem to think that anti , for example , demands the hyphen before it can be joined to toxin , while on the same page they will omit the Siamese-twin ligament in antipathy , antimony , antinomy , and so on .

		ART IN THE MAGAZINES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the '' Century '' for
January	DATE	appears a colored picture named '' The White Rose , '' after a painting by
Henry Golden Dearth	ORGANIZATION	: one of a series representing mod - ern American art .

		I am assured on the best authority that this picture '' is representative of one branch of the impressionist school , '' and that Mr.
Dearth	PERSON	's work in this school '' was considered last year the hit of the artistic season . ''

		So be it ; but I do not know how to describe the effect it had on me by any word milder than disgusting .

		I felt quite upset for some hours .

		The feelings of a single individual , no expert in artistic mat - ters , are of little or no consequence in themselves ; but if -LRB- it is impossible to be original , even in one 's distastes ! -RRB-

		they are representative of any large body of opinion , or especially of any fundamental truths , they may be worth taking into account .

		Even speaking objectively , we may venture to maintain that a lady whose mouth , nose , and eyes are all awry is contrary to good anatomical princi - ples , and take some stand on this point , though our hatred of her expression and our abomination for the lurid un - natural colors be dismissed as psychological curiosities .

		It is impossible for an English-speaking person who reads at all not to feel some sense of proprietorship in the '' Century . ''

		It is one of our great
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- American institutions , quite as much as if it were a public building , nay , more so , since a building can not be on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	at once .

		It has published at different times many beautiful pictures , and to this extent has contributed to the general taste for good art .

		It there - fore follows that one who is convinced that this and other of our standard magazines are giving us some essentially bad , and therefore immoral , illustrations , has good cause to be alarmed .

		The particular picture now criticized would not be so distressing , were it not an extreme example of a general type .

		Our fiction , our drama , our presentation of life in all forms , suffers from the same disease .

		This is , perhaps , a desire to cheaply attract notice , a product of our modern commercialism .

		It is not true that all standards have been abandoned ; on the contrary , the most offen - sive products exhibit a large amount of technical skill .

		This skill , however , is considered the chief thing , while good taste , based on fundamental morality , is forgotten , or perhaps not forgotten because never thought of .

		This description must not be taken as literally applying to every case ; it merely indicates a tendency , which in itself justifies the language used , but which , as a matter of fact , varies through all degrees in its intensity .

		Creatures of our age , we who condemn it can perhaps not wholly avoid its influence .

		If this point of view is in any degree sound , it is use - less to argue that these things are produced because the public demand them .

		Those who control in these mat - ters are in the same position as teachers , whose duty it is to bring before their classes whatever is good , wise , and true .

		No practical teacher doubts the fact that it is more than easy to degrade the tastes and morals of his young people , he has seen it done in many a school .

		In the present state of education in this country , our adults are as children , the majority of them readily responding to degrading influences , while magazine literature also reaches the young .

		It has been suggested that we can not successfully combat these tendencies .

		Whether we can do so depends on what we call success .

		There never will be a time when the struggle for good things can be abandoned , for lack , if you put it so , of windmills to tilt against .

		In a sense , all attempts at education are doomed to failure , but in another sense they are bound to succeed .

		I think it would be very interesting to know how '' The White Rose , '' in the '' Century , '' affected a num - ber of people .

		May I , with the Editor 's permission , ask the readers of THE DIAL to send me postcards describing in a few words how the picture affected them when first seen ?

		In addition , I should greatly like to hear what may be said in its favor by those who think well of it .

		Should I receive a number of communica - tions resulting from this request , I will prepare a sum - mary or abstract of them for THE DIAL .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 89 THE CONQUEST OF THE SOUTH POLE .

		* Captain
Amundsen	PERSON	and his book on '' The South Pole '' make their appearance among us at the same time , and both are cordially wel - come .

		The man is of as much interest to us as his gallant exploit in the Antarctic regions , and his engrossing account of that exploit is both a faithful picture of the author himself and a modest but detailed representation of the diffi - culties and dangers faced and overcome by the explorer and his trusty band of followers .

		That within three years of Captain
Peary	PERSON	's attainment of the northern extremity of the earth 's axis its southern end would likewise be reached , was probably expected by few familiar with the history of Polar exploration and the considerable intervals commonly separating one step of marked advance from the next .

		And , indeed , there is a good deal of what some might call lucky accident , but others would more truly call intuition and genius , to explain the quick following of victory in the South upon the heels of success in the North .

		Captain
Amundsen	PERSON	was in the very act of preparing for his five - year drifting voyage across the
North Polar Sea	LOCATION	, which he still purposes accomplishing , when the telegraph flashed the news of the
North Pole	LOCATION	's discovery -LRB- if the word `` discovery '' is permissible in this connection -RRB- , and he at once altered his plans , but kept his own counsel in the matter , so that not until the good ship `` Fram '' had touched at and departed from Funchal on her supposed voyage around the Horn to
Alaska	LOCATION	did he explain to his company as a whole that his destination was at the antipodes of the one attributed to him .

		This occurred in the
summer of 1910	DATE	.

		Early in Jan - uary of the following year the vessel anchored in the
Bay of Whales	LOCATION	, and after a whiter -LRB- our
summer	DATE	, of course -RRB- in camp at that point the polar party made its successful dash to ninety degrees south , and was back in camp on the twenty-fifth of
January , 1912	DATE	, the exact date set down beforehand in the leader 's schedule .

		While every part of the programme may seem to the hasty reader to have been carried out with a happy concurrence of favoring cir - cumstances , and the final success may present * THE SOUTH POLE .

		An Account of the Norwegian Antarctic Expedition in the `` Fram , '' 1910-1912 .

		By
Roald Amundsen	PERSON	.

		Translated from the Norwegian by
A. G. Chater	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		With maps and illustrations .


New York	LOCATION	:
Lee Keedick	PERSON	.

		itself somewhat in the light of a lucky accident so little emphasis does the chronicler lay upon his far-sighted plans for the avoidance of un - toward conditions a careful study of the nar - rative reveals indications of forethought and generalship , and of reliance upon the prompt - ings of something very like genius , that greatly heighten one 's admiration for the ability and courage of the Norwegian explorer .

		It was con - trary to the apparent teachings of Sir
Ernest Shackleton	PERSON	's experience for Captain
Amundsen	PERSON	to make the Bay of Whales his landing point and the site of his winter quarters .

		The great southern barrier of ice was supposed to be afloat there , with extensive tracts of the bay 's borders continually crumbling away and drifting sea - ward .

		But by entering this inlet the `` Fram '' would be able to land the explorers nearer their destination than would elsewhere be possible , the leader had studied the problem and chose to take the risks , and the result showed the soundness of his judgment .

		Again , both Captain
Scott	PERSON	and Sir
Ernest Shackleton	PERSON	had declared against Eskimo dogs and in favor of
Manchu	LOCATION	- rian ponies as a motive power for the sledges in Antarctic exploration .

		Indeed , a motor car was taken along in the
Shackleton	LOCATION	expedition , so little confidence was felt in the traditional method of polar sledging .

		But here , too , the Norwegian trusted to his instinct , or to instinct and judg - ment combined , and provided himself with a hundred picked Eskimo dogs from
Greenland	LOCATION	, though the possibility of transporting them , alive and in a condition for service , across the equator was derisively denied by the wiseacres .

		It is true that Captain
Amundsen	PERSON	was not with - out some experience of Antarctic conditions ; nevertheless he showed remarkable prevision on this occasion .

		In respect to the time allowed by him for the work in hand we read in the opening pages of his narrative : '' I worked out the plan as here given , at my home on Bundelfjord , near
Christiania	LOCATION	, in
September , 1909	DATE	, and as it was laid , so it was carried out to the last detail .

		That my estimate of the time it would take was not so very far out is proved by the final sentence of the plan : ` Thus we shall be back from the Polar journey on
January 25	DATE	. '

		It was on
January 25 , 1912	DATE	, that we came into Framheim after our successful jour - ney to the
Pole	LOCATION	. ''

		Another rather novel item in the equipment of this expedition novel at least to readers of American and English accounts of polar exploration was the supply of ski instead of snowshoes for travel over the great white plains in the high latitudes .

		The advantage of this form of foot-gear to the Norwegian , who is used 90 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, to it from boyhood , is apparent enough .

		Speed and a great extent of bearing surface on yielding snow , or on the thin crust bridging a crevasse , were thus secured .

		There were no leads or open channels of water to be feared on the final dash to the southward , as was the case in Captain
Peary	PERSON	's strenuous race to the
North Pole	LOCATION	and back , with the ever-present danger of finding himself marooned on an ice-floe ; but there were regions treacherously cut up by concealed chasms of unknown depth , over whose frail snow-bridges the Norwegian ski could carry a man much more swiftly and safely than the American snowshoe .

		What the expedition accomplished in addi - tion to the attainment of the
South Pole	LOCATION	should not fail to receive mention .

		While the leader with four companions made his dash for the goal , Lieutenant Prestrud and two others started on an eastward exploring journey to the little - known
King Edward VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		Land which Captain
Scott	PERSON	had discovered in
1902	DATE	.

		A considerable section in the second volume of the book is devoted to Lieutenant Prestrud 's narrative of this expedition and what it accomplished .

		Another section is given up to Captain
Nilsen	PERSON	's account of what he and his shipmates achieved in the way of oceanographic research with the stout ship `` Fram '' during the long winter while the land party was reduced to com - parative inactivity at Framheim .

		The south
Atlantic	LOCATION	between
Africa	LOCATION	and
South America	LOCATION	was traversed and investigated , temperatures taken , specimens of the plankton collected , and much information added to the world 's knowl - edge of that part of the ocean .

		Appended papers at the end of the book contain many details of meteorology , oceanography , and other matters interesting to the student .

		To return for a little to the more popularly pleasing sections of the work , one can not but note the buoyant , high-spirited , adventurous tone of the narrative as a whole .

		There is more of frolic and fun in
Captain Amundsen	LOCATION	's pages than we are accustomed to in those of his north - polar rival , or colleague , Captain
Peary	PERSON	which is natural enough , in view of the Norwegian 's comparative youth .

		The entire expedition assumes something of the complexion of a grand lark in such passages as the following , which takes up the story immediately after the ship 's destination had been made known to all on board , upon her departure from Funchal : '' It was pure enjoyment to come on deck the morning after leaving
Madeira	LOCATION	; there was an added note of friendliness in every man 's ' Good-morning , ' and a smile twinkled in the corner of every eye .

		The entirely new turn things had taken , and the sudden change to fresh fields for thought and imagination , acted as a beneficent stimulus to those who , the day before , had contemplated a trip round the Horn .

		I think what chiefly amused them was their failure to smell a rat before . '

		How could I have been such an ass as not to think of it long ago ? '

		said
Beck	PERSON	, as he sent a nearly new quid into the sea .

		Of course , it was as plain as a pikestaff .

		Here we are with all these dogs , this fine `` observation house , '' with its big kitchen-range and the shiny cloth on the table , and everything else .

		Any fool might have seen what it meant . '

		I consoled him with the remark that it is always easy to be wise after the event , and that I thought it very lucky no one had discovered our destination prematurely . ''

		Then followed a great amount of reading-up in Antarctic literature on the part of these newly-enlightened members of the party .

		The ship 's library numbered three thousand vol - umes or more , and from Captain Cook to Cap - tain Scott the Antarctic voyagers were well represented .

		`` I considered it an imperative necessity , '' says oar author , `` that every man should acquaint himself as far as possible with the work of previous expeditions ; this was the only way of becoming in some measure familiar with the conditions in which we should have to work . ''

		Wintering within the
Antarctic Circle	ORGANIZATION	, in cold immeasurable by ordinary thermometers , ' and in all but total darkness so far as sunlight is concerned , would not seem a very exhilarating experience ; but the Norwegian party appears from the narrative to have taken it much in the spirit of a picnic , and to have found an abundance of both work and play ready to hand .

		Snow-tunnelling and cave-digging , to enlarge the available accommodations for the company of nine , occupied considerable time and energy ; and there was a great amount of preparation of sledges and dog-tackle to fill in spare moments , not to mention the daily routine of housework and mending or alteration of garments , and other humble tasks .

		The snug quarters at Framheim , cheerfully lighted and comfortably heated with petroleum , became homelike to the occupants , and with unlimited seal steak and an abundance of other good provisions the chief of the party avowed that he never before had lived so well .

		But now let us turn to some of the perils and hardships attending the great work of the expedition .

		After the start for the Pole had been made with five men and four sledges , trouble was encountered with crevasses , which revealed themselves unexpectedly be - neath the snow .

		At one moment a sledge broke through and threatened to drag all its thirteen
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 91 dogs to destruction .

		But a rope and two pairs of strong arms saved the day while a cool - headed volunteer climbed down , with another rope around his body , to relieve the suspended sledge of its load , two of his comrades hauling up as he unlashed .

		`` These two fellows moved about on the brink of the chasm with a coolness that I regarded at first with approving eyes .

		I admire courage and contempt for danger .

		But the length to which they carried it at last was too much of a good thing ; they were simply playing hide-and-seek with Fate .

		Wisting 's information from below that the cornice they were standing on was only a few inches thick did not seem to have the slightest effect on them ; on the contrary , they seemed to stand all the more securely . ''

		A later passage gives an idea of the sufferings caused by the extreme cold and raging winds .

		When the mercury rose to zero , Fahrenheit , the hardy Norsemen called the temperature sultry and oppressive .

		We read , for example : '' The warmth of the past few days seemed to have matured our frost-sores , and we presented an awful appearance .

		It was Wisting ,
Hanssen	PERSON	, and I who had suffered the worst damage in the last south-east blizzard ; the left side of our faces was one mass of sore , bathed in matter and serum .

		We looked like the worst type of tramps and ruffians , and would probably not have been recognized by our nearest relations .

		These sores were a great trouble to us during the latter part of the journey .

		The slightest gust of wind produced a sensa - tion as if one 's face were being cut backwards and for - wards with a blunt knife .

		They lasted a long time , too ; I can remember
Hanssen	PERSON	removing the last scab when we were coming into
Hobart	LOCATION
three months later	DATE	. ''

		In making this final dash , Captain Amund - sen adopted tactics quite different from Captain
Peary	PERSON	's in his similar adventure at the North .

		The American had started with five detachments , sending back first one and then another until he with a single one of his company and four Eskimos were left to complete the perilous jour - ney .

		No tents were used , but igloos , or snow huts , were built at each stage .

		The Norwegian , on the other hand , pushed on with his original party , camped each night , or day , as the case may have been , under cover of a tent , celebrated -LRB- briefly -RRB- with his comrades the attainment of the Pole , and returned with no loss of life except the dogs killed and eaten on the way .

		The Pole was reached on the day planned long beforehand ,
December 14 , 1911	DATE	, and the return to Fram - heim , as already noted , was on schedule time .

		Captain
Amundsen	PERSON	's book has a fulness and variety of interest , and is written in a bright , often amusing , style , that distinguish it among works of its kind .

		The translator , too , has done his part well .

		One would not suspect the book of being a translation , unless told before - hand .

		The many illustrations , maps , charts , and other subordinate features of the work help to make it the complete and satisfactory pro- duction it is found to be .

		The author 's earlier account of his memorable Northwest-Passage voyage in the `` Gjoa '' had aroused expectations of a noteworthy book as the literary fruit of this more difficult undertaking , and these expecta - tions have not been disappointed .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		THE BRILLAT-SAVARIN OF THE DRAMA .

		* When my attention was first attracted to Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's new book , ostensibly dealing with the making of plays , I not unnaturally concluded that it would embody rules and precepts for the guidance of the beginner , the tyro , who wished to be given an adequate recipe for constructing a play .

		Perusal of the work itself quickly dis - pels any such notion .

		The title is at once allur - ing and deceptive .

		The discovery one speedily makes is that this is not , in reality , a book for the dramatic craftsman .

		Indeed , the author begins with the asseveration that there are no rules for the writing of plays , and even disclaims writing for the benefit of would-be playwrights .

		Confessedly , he writes for the `` many people with moderately developed and cultivable faculty '' ; and modestly ventures the hope that `` even the accomplished dramatist may take some interest in considering the reasons for things which he does , or does not do , by instinct . ''

		The reason for all this is not far to seek .

		Mr.
Archer	PERSON	is a dramatic critic , concerned with plays not as a constructive craftsman , but as an analy - tical critic .

		It is inevitable that his treatment parallels the phase of his dominant interest .

		So we actually have , not a book on play-making , but an analysis of the made play .

		In a word , we have a book of definitions , of criteria , for analyzing plays .

		The real title of the book , I venture to suggest , might more fittingly be , `` How to Write Good Dramatic Criticism . ''

		This is not , in any way , to minimize the value of the book , but simply to arrive at a just descrip - tion of its scope .

		At the same time , we shall find , on further examination , that in analyzing the structure of the drama , the author not only holds out sane standards for the observation of the dramatic critic , but often consciously , more often unconsciously , sets up warnings and pre - cepts for the instruction of the practicing craf ts - * PLAY-MAKING .

		A
Manual of Craftsmanship	ORGANIZATION	.

		By Will - iam
Archer	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	: Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		92 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, man .

		This latter is the role in which Mr.
Archer	PERSON	shows up to least advantage .

		Mr.
Archer	PERSON	, ac - cording to his own admission , is lacking in the innate competency of the dramatic craftsman which , to be sure , in no sense invalidates his conclusions as a critic of the drama .

		Also , if I remember aright , the bureau for the purpose of advising budding playwrights , which Mr.
Archer	PERSON	opened in
London	LOCATION	, was short-lived .

		As given in the present book , Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's advice is , for the most part , either too general or too self - contradictory to carry with it the momentum of constructive helpfulness .

		An excellent example of Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's weakness in this department is found in the following inimitable specimen of innocuous shilly-shally : '' It might in many cases be wiser to warn the aspir - ant to keep himself unspotted from the play-house .

		To send him there is to imperil , on the one hand , his originality of vision ; on the other , his individuality of method .

		He may fall under the influence of some great master , and see life only through his eyes ; or he may become so habituated to the current tricks of the thea - trical trade as to lose all sense of their conventionality and falsity , and find himself , in the end , better fitted to write what I have called a quack hand-book than a living play . ''

		Apparently , it is the idea that the young aspir - ant has no power of originality , no strength of individuality , which prompts Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's fears .

		Such an intellectual invertebrate as Mr.
Archer	PERSON	posits may perhaps not be worth while worrying over .

		He goes on , however , to hedge with too facile glibness : `` It would be ridiculous , of course , to urge an aspirant positively to avoid the theatre ; but the common advice to steep himself in it is beset with dangers . ''

		It may well be that Mr.
Archer	PERSON	is thinking of
Ibsen	LOCATION	; for after a certain point in his career was reached , Ibsen absented himself deliberately from all contact with the playhouse .

		It must be clearly pointed out , however , as a fact of crucial signifi - cance , that
Ibsen	PERSON	began his career with the most attentive and pertinacious study of all the actual details of the theatre , of production , representa - tion , the art of acting , in the playhouses of
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope , as well as of
Norway	LOCATION	.

		It was only after he had acquired a mastery of the materials of his art , both by practice and by intensive study of the theatre itself , that he felt strong enough to assert and maintain his independence .

		It is just as well that Mr.
Archer	PERSON	did not at - tempt to write a book of receipts for play-making .

		It is related of
Bronson Howard	PERSON	that , on being asked to compile a book of rules for playwriting , he declined on the ground that he feared being tempted to follow them !

		Mr.
Archer	PERSON	has done , rarely well , something that needed to be done for our particular generation : the narration , in easily understood terms , of the structural history of the play , as it has developed , biologically as it were , up to the present time .

		As Mr.
Archer	PERSON	wisely says : `` One thing is certain namely , that if any part of the dramatist 's art can be taught , it is only a comparatively mechanical and formal part the art of structure . ''

		Per - haps Mr.
Archer	PERSON	somewhat underestimates the relative importance of the art of structure .

		Pro- fessor
Matthews	PERSON	takes the view that anything which may be learned can be taught ; and if we carry this principle to its logical conclusion , the indispensable part of the art of playwriting , namely the art of structure , may be taught , since it undoubtedly can be and always must be learned .

		Dramatic genius the faculty for situ - ation , the sense for character , the stereoscopic imagination this is innate , and can not be ini - tially imparted through any system of instruc - tion : it can only be strengthened and developed through exercise , furnished both by self-acquired knowledge of the conditions of dramatic repre - sentation and by practice in the making of plays .

		It will be recalled that
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	once violently ban - ished from his presence a young playwright who wished
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	to hear the reading of his latest play because , forsooth , the nincompoop had no scenario !

		A study of the various drafts of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's plays , made at different stages in their evolution , reveals the truly remarkable way in which the structural broadening and deepening of the bases of a play forwarded the psychologi - cal purposes of the creator of character and the master of climax .

		Upon one occasion , Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	was asked to define the precepts that govern the dramatist in his selection of themes and methods of treatment .

		In his reply to that question , which is too long to be quoted here in its en - tirety , he shamelessly confesses : '' I find myself possessed of a theme in the following manner .

		I am pushed by a natural need to set to work to write down conversations that come into my head unaccountably .

		At first I hardly know the speakers and can not find names for them .

		Then they become more and more familiar ; and I learn their names .

		Finally I come to know them very well , and discover what it is they are driving at and why they have said and done the things I have been moved to set down . ''

		I am not to be deceived into thinking this just a piece of Shavian fooling ; for I have often seen Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	at work , in trains and elsewhere , doing just what he describes himself as doing .

		A
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , series of conversations by imaginary characters not even fully individualized is the natural start - ing point for the dramas of a play writer who has invented the drama of dialectic and has the hardi - hood to label a play a '' Conversation . ''

		A germ idea of general significance ; usually arising out of an incident in real life , experienced or , as Ibsen phrased it , '' actually lived through , '' fur - nished the starting point for the majority of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's greatest plays such certainly is the evidence furnished by the volumes of his
Nach	PERSON	- gelassene Schriften .

		Indeed , nothing so piques the fancy as the image of the master craftsman , whoever he be , spinning out the threads of his creative imagination and weaving the magic pat - terns of human life which shall enrapture mul - titudes in that palace of light and sound , the theatre .

		A profoundly interesting book on play - making yet remains to be written , embodying the true relation of the methods actually em - ployed by dramatists of rank in the writing of their plays .

		The significance of Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's book the feature which constitutes it a popular substitute for any work on the technique of the drama now available rests in the fact that it is , for the most part , couched in simple and compre - hendable terms .

		It is a sort of Scotch
Frey	PERSON	- tag , for the '' man in the street . ''

		Dispensing with the horrible jargon of the academic student of the drama , Mr.
Archer	PERSON	manages to put in all the essential facts in regard to structural detail , without expressing himself in `` hifalutin '' terms .

		We can not blame him for coining the word '' Peripety '' -LRB- Greek , peripeteia -RRB- to indi - cate a complete reversal of fortune ; and we are grateful for the skill and perspicuity which char - acterize his definitions and distinctions , notably the distinction between '' character-drawing '' and ' ' psychology . ' '

		Peculiarly clarifying are the chapters entitled respectively , '' Foreshadowing , not Forestalling , '' and '' The Obligatory Scene . ''

		Much profit may be derived from careful perusal of the chapter , '' Curiosity and Interest . ''

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	and I am sure some incidents narrated to me by
Madame Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	justify the implication in regard to
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	once defined the drama , or at least the temperamental con - dition under which drama is created , as '' sane hallucination . ''

		This , however , can not serve to convey any working basis for an adequate de - finition of drama .

		The boldest of Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's chapters is entitled `` Dramatic and
Undra	LOCATION	- matic . ''

		Here he tilts squarely against those contemporary critics , with Brunetiere at their head , who see in drama a clash of contending wills .

		`` The theatre in general , '' said
Brune	PERSON	- tie `` re , '' is nothing but the place for the develop - ment of the human will , attacking the obstacles opposed to it by destiny , fortune , or circum - stances . ''

		And again , '' Drama is a representa - tation of the will of man in conflict with the mysterious powers or natural forces which limit or belittle us ; it is one of us thrown living upon the stage , there to struggle against fatality , against social law , against one of his fellow - mortals , against himself , if need be , against the ambitions , the interests , the prejudices , the folly , the malevolence of those who surround him . ''

		Mr.
Archer	PERSON	boldly denies that struggle is the indispensable differentia of the dramatic form , basing his denial upon the difficulty of forcing many plays to conform to such confinement of definition .

		He prefers to discover the marrow of drama in crisis .

		Such a definition , interesting though it be as a critical tentative , is far less comprehensive , it appears on reflection , than the definition of Brunetiere .

		It may be said with equal justice that crisis is a defining character - istic of the short-story .

		In the short-story , all the lines converge to a predestined end or crisis .

		When that crisis is reached , the story is com - plete .

		Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's differentia thus breaks down for the drama .

		On the other hand , some of the greatest short-stories in the world are in - dependent of any conflict of human wills , and so fall outside the definition of drama as posited by Brunetiere .

		A crisis is a turning-point in the progress of a series of events ; and is as - suredly a concomitant attribute of drama , which is a series of events , physical or psychological , induced in general by a struggle of wills .

		In other words , Mr.
Archer	PERSON	has made the rather trivial blunder of choosing for his differentiat - ing characteristic merely one phase , the culmi - nant phase , of that struggle which he maintains is not the quintessential attribute of drama !

		In recent years , there has been a sharp break , among the younger playwrights , away from the restrictions of the ancient standards .

		Mr.
Granville Barker	PERSON	, whose `` The Voysey Inheritance '' reads like a novel of the mid - Victorian era , has proposed the drama of the future as one which `` leaves Aristotle out . ''

		So far has this new movement of secession and revolt progressed that many dramatic critics of to - day , suffering from no obsession by Aristotelian definitions , have frankly recognized that the so - called `` laws '' of the drama are nothing more than integrated formulations of the prevailing practice of dramatists up to any given date in the drama 's history .

		There is certainly some - 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, thing to startle a
Matthews	PERSON	or a
Walkley	ORGANIZATION	in Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's statement : '' The only really valid definition of the dramatic is : Any representa - tion of imaginary personages which is capable of interesting an average audience assembled in a theatre . ''

		How broad , how marvellously inclusive , is this iconoclastic definition !

		Un - fortunately , Mr.
Archer	PERSON	has been guilty of another of those lapses in logic which betray him always in the hour of his sorest need .

		Clearly , such definition fails to correspond with Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's former definition of drama as that art-form the essence of which is crisis .

		It is patent that there is an infinity of '' representa - tions of imaginary personages which are capable of interesting an average audience assembled in a theatre '' which yet may be lacking in any form of crisis , physical or psychological .

		Nu - merous modern plays do actually interest an average audience in a theatre , and yet , it must be confessed , betray an almost total deficiency in either struggle or , its culminant phase , crisis .

		The genre is found in playwrights so funda - mentally dissimilar , in outlook and method , as
Maeterlinck	PERSON	and
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	.

		To be specific , one might cite Gorky 's '' Nachtasyl , ''
Barker	PERSON	's '' The
Madras House	ORGANIZATION	, ''
Hauptmann	PERSON	's `` Hannele , ''
Shaw	PERSON	's Socratic Dialogue in Hades from '' Man and Superman , '' and
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's `` L'Intruse . ''

		Mr.
Granville Barker	PERSON	has recently said in a public address which was subsequently printed , '' A play is anything that can be made effective upon the stage of a theatre by human agency . ''

		This definition , which parallels Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's in boldness and comprehensiveness of statement , is equally inadequate .

		For it throws into the class of the dramatic such a spectacle as a prize-fight .

		By the same token , Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's definition per - mits the inclusion of so mechanical a perform - ance as a moving-picture show , since the films are made from photographs of the class which Mr.
Archer	PERSON	labels `` imaginary personages , '' namely , people playing parts in a coherent series of concocted events .

		The time is ripe for the critic who will bring clarity and convincing statement of the essen - tial meaning of the terms '' drama '' and '' dra - matic '' out of the present welter of confusion and chaos .

		If `` dramatic '' were accepted as a descriptive term for only a certain class of plays , and it were acknowledged once for all that there are other plays lacking in this specific character - istic which are nevertheless highly successful upon the stage , from both the artistic and box - office standpoints , a much-needed rebuke might thereby be given to the academic dogmatism which so unrelentingly endeavors to force the new art into the mould of antiquated conception .

		The dramatists of the contemporary era have constructively demonstrated one tremendously significant fact : that a play may be eminently successful in stage representation , judged by both artistic and commercial standards , and yet be intrinsically '' undramatic . ''

		THE GREAT HISTORY OF THE PILGRIMS .

		* Governor
William Bradford	PERSON	's `` History of
Plymouth	LOCATION	Plantation '' has been described as '' the chief book in our
New England	LOCATION	Old Tes - tament . ''

		It is the history of
Plymouth Colony	ORGANIZATION	to
1647	DATE	, a noble record of exile , suffering , and triumph .

		These sturdy , God-fearing Pil - grims , after many vicissitudes , crossed the water to lay the sure foundations of state ; and the human interest of their story , told in the living words of a leader , is second only to its historical importance .

		Although the `` History '' remained in manu - script for more than two hundred years , it con - stitutes the principal part of
Nathaniel Morton	PERSON	's ``
New England	LOCATION	's Memorial , '' first published in
1669	DATE	, and was also used by later historians notably Prince and
Hutchinson	PERSON	.

		The precious manuscript was probably taken by an unknown person from the
Old South Church	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	during the Revolution , and was lost sight of for many years .

		It was thought by some to have shared the fate of other documents which were at that time carried away or destroyed .

		But a better destiny was in store for the `` History , '' so carefully prepared by the second Governor of
Plymouth Colony	LOCATION	; for it was finally located , in
1855	DATE	, in the Library of the Bishop of Lon - don at
Fulham	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Charles Deane	PERSON	caused the manuscript to be carefully copied , and under his able editorial direction it was first printed by the
Massachusetts Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	in
1856	DATE	, with an introduction and notes .

		The work , how - ever , was not very freely annotated , through no fault of Dr.
Deane	PERSON	, but rather in deference to the policy of the Society under whose auspices the book was given to the world .

Bradford	ORGANIZATION	's beautiful manuscript in marked contrast to the wellnigh indecipherable chiro - graphy of his contemporary ,

Colony	ORGANIZATION	of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	Bay * HISTORY OF
PLYMOUTH PLANTATION	LOCATION	, 1620-1647 .

		By
William Bradford	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		Illustrated .


Boston	LOCATION	: Published for the
Massachusetts Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	by
Hough ton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL , 95 was published in
1896	DATE	, with an introduction by Mr.
J. A. Doyle	PERSON	, who for many years was an earnest and able student of our beginnings .

		In
1898	DATE	, the year following the restoration of the manuscript by the ecclesiastical authorities of
England	LOCATION	, the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts	ORGANIZATION	issued the `` History '' without notes , but with preliminary matter respecting the return of the document and addresses made upon that happy occasion .

		There was also published , in
1908	DATE	, a reprint edited by the late
William T. Davis	PERSON	of
Plymouth	LOCATION	, in the '' Original Narratives of Early American History '' series ; unfortunately , however , Mr.
Da	PERSON	vis 's notes do not adequately meet all requirements , to say nothing of im - portant omissions from the text .

		It therefore seems both fitting and wise that the present edition , in which the text is printed in full for the first time , should have been under - taken by the learned body that first gave
Brad	PERSON	- ford in printed form to students of history ; and wiser that the editing of these volumes was intrusted to the competent hand of Mr.
Worth	PERSON	- ington
C. Ford	ORGANIZATION	.


Justin Winsor	PERSON	has said that , in later years , Mr.
Deane	PERSON	was urged to recur to his work on
Bradford	PERSON	's `` History , '' and give a new edition `` with all the amplitude of his eru - dition in commentary and note . ''

		While we can not doubt Mr.
Deane	PERSON	's great abilities and ripe knowledge of early
New England	LOCATION	history for much admirable work stands to his credit , he was perhaps , to a degree , disqualified for the undertaking by reason of certain mental char - acteristics which might have prevented him from seeing all things in their true perspective .

		How - ever this may be , one can hardly regret that the difficult task of preparing what possibly may be termed the final edition of
Bradford	PERSON	was reserved for the present editor .

		Mr.
Ford	PERSON	possesses the learning , the open mind , and the poise necessary to accomplish the best results ; and if he did not link his name with any other historical work he would have earned , by his edition of
Bradford	PERSON	alone , a permanent place amongst the foremost editors of American source books .

		An advisory committee of three was appointed by the
Massachusetts Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	to aid Mr.
Ford	PERSON	in his work , consisting of Messrs.
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	,
Arthur Lord	PERSON	, and Gam - aliel
Bradford	PERSON	, Jr. ; and it is safe to assume that these gentlemen lent something more than their names to the undertaking .

		Of the three , Mr.
Adams	PERSON	has had by far the widest experience as historian and editor , having edited with great scholarship two books of the period covered by
Bradford	PERSON	's `` History '' '' Antinomianism in the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	of
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	, 16361638 '' and
Thomas Morton	PERSON	's `` New English Canaan '' in addition to much other solid writing .

		Mr.
Lord	PERSON	is an authority on Pilgrim history ; and Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	-LRB- of the ninth generation from the Gov - ernor -RRB- , best known by his searching studies of Confederate leaders , must have taken keen and intelligent interest in the work .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	, as long ago as
1883	DATE	, expressed himself on the propriety of reproducing in print the pecul - iarities which abound in seventeenth-century manuscripts .

		Even then he had for years wished to see
Bradford	PERSON	's `` History '' in `` real seventeenth-century dress '' ; that is to say , as it would have come from the press of that day .

		This hope , however , has not been fully realized in the present edition , for it appears to have been thought best to follow
Bradford	PERSON	's orthog - raphy , except in a few unimportant particulars .

		This will delight the historical scholar , and at the same time will not prove a hindrance to the general reader who has recourse to the volumes .

		Fortunately ,
Bradford	PERSON	's erratic and sometimes meaningless punctuation has not in all cases been preserved .

		The work is introduced by a brief '' Note , '' signed by the
Committee of Publication	ORGANIZATION	, in which it is truly stated that the story of the
Pilgrim Fathers	ORGANIZATION	has been told in all necessary detail ; nevertheless , some will regret that the editor did not see fit to go over the ground once more and trace in a consecutive manner the Pilgrim movement .

		Certainly this would not have formed a useless complement to the '' History . ''

		It would be difficult to praise too highly Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's rich and copious annotation .

		In this respect he has left nothing to be desired .

		His notes , written with admirable lucidity , have been prepared with thoroughness and much learning .

		He seems to have overlooked nothing of value or interest , and it will perhaps never be neces - sary to add much of importance to his labors .

		The edition contains more than two hundred finely-executed illustrations many of them very rare , consisting of maps , views , fac - similes of manuscripts , etc. .

		The frontispiece of the second volume is a beautiful reproduction of a portrait of
Edward Winslow	PERSON	, attributed to
Robert Walker	PERSON	, from the original in Pilgrim Hall at
Plymouth	LOCATION	, the only authentic likeness extant of any of the Mayflower company .

		In no other book of Pilgrim history can there be found such wealth of illustrative material .

		This feature of the work is attractive and important .

		The index is excellent .

		These handsome quarto volumes will warm the book-lover 's heart .

		They THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, are well made in every particular , and will rank with the best work of a press which has for many years been noted for the superiority of its product .

		This edition of
Bradford	ORGANIZATION	's '' History '' should find its way into every public library of the land , where it will not only be available to the student and scholar , but also to him who in these days of stress and turmoil cares to pause long enough to give thought to the old rock from which we are hewn .

		It will not be out of place here to say that Mr.
Ford	PERSON	is said to have edited , in the manner of the present reprint of
Bradford	ORGANIZATION	, an edition -LRB- soon to appear -RRB- of Governor
John Winthrop	PERSON	's '' Journal . ''

		Winthrop heretofore has had only two editors worthy of the name , Mr.
James Savage	PERSON	, for many years the honored President of the
Massachusetts Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, and Dr.
James K. Hosmer	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Savage	PERSON	, however , though thoroughly steeped in the lore of his subject , was nevertheless far from being an ideal editor ; but withal he was distinctly and racily individ - ual .

		Dr.
Hosmer	PERSON	's work is excellent , but not full enough to make it the final word .

		The
Massachusetts Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	is indeed for - tunate in being able to connect its name with two great books , which will be read for all time , or at least as long as there shall survive an interest in the beginnings of this nation .

		JOHN
THOMAS LEE	PERSON	.

		ANDREW
LANG	PERSON	'S LAYING OF THE BACONIAN BOGIE .

		*
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's book on the Baconian myth is his latest and we fear last service to litera - ture , though so versatile and industrious a writer may well have left other surprises behind him .

		Never , perhaps , in his career has he ex - hibited more engagingly his special qualities , his literary passion , his loyalty , and his light and dexterous handling of really wide scholar - ship .

		His book ought to be the last word on the subject ; but that , alas , is not to be hoped .

		The last word in this matter has been said before , by
Richard Grant White	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
Dowden	PERSON	, and by others .

		This is one of those questions where reason and authority speak in vain ; the realization of which fact leads to exasperation .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, for instance , begins in perfect tem - per , with courtesy and Christian charity ; he ends somewhat in the state depicted by '' Punch '' * SHAKESPEARE ,
BACON	LOCATION	, AND THE GREAT UNKNOWN .

		By
Andrew Lang	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		in its study of '' a gentleman disturbed by a blue bottle fly . ''

		What are you going to do with a theory that evades evidence , defies logic , and re - fuses to accept the credibilities of human nature ?

		Against the Pyrrhonic attitude nothing can be proved .

		Archbishop Whately wrote '' Historic Doubts about
Napoleon Buonaparte	PERSON	. ''

		Suppose a case is tried where a witness for the defense swears that A is A ; and the opposing counsel blandly remarks to the jury : '' Yes , I know he says so , but what he really means is that A is B. '' Another person deposes that he believes white to be white , and the same counsel declares that it is perfectly clear that he harbors a mental reservation that white is black .

		Then a witness is examined who is qualified by long acquaint - ance , comradeship , and rivalry to speak of the defendant , and who does speak of him again and again , sometimes in criticism , sometimes in un - bounded eulogy .

		The lawyer for the plaintiff listens and then smilingly declares that all this is only ''
Fanny	ORGANIZATION	's way , '' that it is quite evident that the gentleman has his tongue in his cheek ; that the very gruffness of his growling at and the ardor of his championship of one man , the per - fect applicability of every fact he adduces to him and to no other , is proof positive that it is another whom he is referring to all the time .

		This is a fair statement of the attitude of the latest anti-Shakespeareans .

		The mind reels at such treatment of the verities .

		Argument is impossible .

		All the external evidence and practically all the internal probability in the case are on one side .

		The Baconian or anti- Shakespearean theory is nothing but a suspicion backed up by a sneer .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	does not trouble to treat of the crop of cryptogrammic phantasies of the past .

		These the neo - Baconians have themselves rele - gated to the limbo of the forgotten .

		Nor does he go into the so-called parallelisms of phrase between
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Bacon	LOCATION	.


Richard Grant White	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Dowden	PERSON	have thoroughly dis - posed of these .

		He dismisses any resemblances of thought as being part of the property of the age ideas in the air .

		It would not be difficult to make out a case for
Charles Darwin	PERSON	's author - ship of '' In Memoriam '' and the early poems of
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		As for basic philosophy , Shake - speare and
Bacon	PERSON	are in antithesis .

		The one was an idealist and pessimist , the other an utili - tarian and optimist .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	declines also to express an opinion as to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's legal learning .

		He delivers him over to the lawyers , who , he says , agree as to the accuracy of Shake - speare 's law allusions .

		Accurate they may be ,
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 97 but they are drawn from a slender stock of knowledge .

		Shakespeare certainly did not know
Littleton	LOCATION	's '' Institutes '' or the earlier treatises of
Bracton	LOCATION	and
Fleta	ORGANIZATION	.

		And these were the English law authorities of his day .

		When in
1616	DATE	, the year of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's death ,
Ben Jonson	PERSON	published his '' Works , '' he was univer - sally laughed at and regarded as an intruder in literature .

		`` The silence about Shakespeare , '' that is one of the pet superstitions of the Baconians .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	has no trouble in showing that we know more about Shakespeare than about the majority of the authors of that age .

		Here and there a man like
Ben Jonson	PERSON	, who had the modern advertising instinct , or one like Mar - lowe , who got himself into picturesque embroil - ments , made his personality felt ; but in the main the Elizabethan literary group is a congregation of shadows .

		This is largely true of the men who were really considered poets in that day ,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Daniel	PERSON	,
Drayton	PERSON	.

		Playwrights were but little regarded .

		But , as Mr.
Lang	PERSON	says , `` Impossible '' is the banner word of the anti-Shakespeareans .

		It is `` impossible '' that one of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's birth and bringing-up should have risen to such heights !

		Why ?

		Probably a good third of the greatest men of all time have come up from beginnings more inauspicious than were those of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		To name only three English writers who have something of parity with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in their genius ,
Burns	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	, and
Dickens	PERSON	came from a lower social strata , and had comparatively less opportunity for edu - cation than
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		When someone asked the elder
Dickens	PERSON	where his son had been edu - cated , he answered , `` Why ah , you may say , sir , that
Charles	PERSON	educated himself . ''

		Latin was the only gate to learning in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's time .

		There was a good Latin school at
Stratford	LOCATION	.

		Up to the time that
Shakespeare	PERSON	was thirteen or fourteen his father was well-to-do one of the leading men of the village .

		If his son did not attend the school , whose sons did ?

		But learning is a good deal like vaccination it may take or it may not .

		Or it is like the Scripture parable of the Sowing of the Seed , some of which fell on good ground and returned a hundred fold , and some of which fell on stony ground and did not come up at all .

		Granting the fertility of the ground , little seed might produce a great harvest .

		If
Shakespeare	PERSON	was
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, it is hard to see what better preparation he could have had for the work he was to do .

		To spend his early years in rural
England	LOCATION	, in daily experience of those country scenes , customs , and characters which crowd his plays , and then at twenty-one or so to go up to the university of
London	LOCATION	life , with just enough schooling to appreciate and profit by the society into which he was thrown and the books by which he was surrounded , does not this seem far more consonant with the throb and vividness of the world which the plays exhibit than an exclusively scholastic training ?

		To seek for accurate and thorough scholarship in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is , in
Tennyson	LOCATION	's phrase , `` to milk a he-goat . ''

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	devotes a chapter to the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are said to be twenty thousand palpable errors in this volume , besides a larger number of mere typographical slips .

		Bacon corrected his own works carefully enough .

		Did he who prized the `` New Atlantis '' and the `` Apothegms '' so highly , think the plays -LRB- assuming them for the moment to be his -RRB- unworthy of the slightest over-seeing ?

		The Baconians assert that he hired
Ben Jonson	PERSON	to attend to this ; but
Jonson	PERSON	was too good a workman to have had a hand in such a mess as the first folio .

		A new theory is that the plays are the work of `` a Great Unknown , '' neither
Shakespeare	PERSON	nor
Bacon	PERSON	, who , indifferent to money or fame , unrevealed to actors or pub - lic , took the trouble to go through all the stages of a playwright 's novitiate and practice , and in the end was so sublimely careless as to let his works be published in such a shocking way .

		Stat magni nominis umbra .

		In his chapter on '' The Preoccupations of
Bacon	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Lang	PERSON	gives a view of the business of this man 's life a life so full and varied that
James Spedding	PERSON	, who knew it best , said : '' I think I am in a position to state that
Lord Bacon	PERSON	did not write the plays . ''

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	refuses , however , to set any limits to the powers of gen - ius , whether in Shakespeare or
Bacon	LOCATION	.

		Genius , indeed , can do much .

		Bolivar in one of his cam - paigns captured a fleet of gunboats in a river by a charge of cavalry .

		If
Bacon	PERSON	had stopped with his philosophical treatises , his essays , even his history , it would have been impossible to say what he might or might not have done in pure literature .

		But he furnished evidence against himself .

		He tried to write poetry , he tried to write a romance , he tried to retell humorous and witty stories .

		He did all these things so badly that to credit him with creative imagination or poetic expression is mere folly .

		In these matters he is like an elephant trying to play the part of an Ariel .

		It is impossible to do justice to all the points at issue which Mr.
Lang	PERSON	meets and discusses .

		98 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, The general aspects of the argument are all that we can attend to , but as far as we can see he weaves his minute web of scholarship without flaw .

		He writes as one of those who know , and , as he says in his opening paragraph , '' the Baconian theory is universally rejected in En - gland by the professors and historians of English literature , and generally by those who have no profession save that of Letters . ''

		The same can probably be said for
America	LOCATION	.

		In other words , it is rejected by all those who are competent to judge .

		The conclusion of the whole matter but we fear there can be no conclusion , no speedy one at least .

		A vagary , a heresy has entered the world .

		It appeals to the iconoclasm innate in many minds , and it appeals somewhat to class prejudice .

		It will have to work itself out , as heresies do .

		We are sometimes told that having the Shakespearean work , it really does not mat - ter to the world who created it .

		Well , it is a poor world which refuses gratitude and honor to its greatest .

		And if robbing a writer of his reputation becomes the fashion it will react on the literary creators to come .

		Foolishly or not , an author is usually buoyed up by the hope of influence and remembrance .

		If he finds that he may be frustrate of the future , may very probably be cheated of his fame , he may turn his energies to other work , or do only what will suffice for his own day .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		THE PHILOSOPHY OF WALKING .

		* The true devotee of walking , if he happens also to possess the knack of writing , will sooner or later betray his own most cherished prin - ciple .

		He knows beyond all other knowledge that walking is a gift of the gods , to be rever - ently enjoyed and not to be chattered about ; he realizes to the full the profanity of staining with inky words those memories of sun-saturated and wind-swept days that have been his upon the open road .

		But the very ardor of his gratitude for that high gift , the very intensity of his enthusiasm inspired by those beatific memories , seem to impel him irresistibly to utterance ; and sooner or later he becomes aware of something before him , the work of his own impious hand , a poem or an essay , perhaps even a book , in celebration of the mystic joys of the road .

		The latest of such apostates is Mr.
Arthur	PERSON	* WALKING ESSAYS .

		By
Arthur Hugh Sedgwick	PERSON	.

		New .

		York : Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


Hugh Sedgwick	PERSON	, the greatest , also , we might say , for his sin extends to an entire volume of duodecimo proportions .

		But Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	is no callous or unconscious offender : he pleads guilty at the very outset , and makes a penitent appeal for absolution , in the form of a neatly - rhymed dedication .

		Here are two of its nine stanzas : '' How vain my effort , how absurd , Considered as a symbol !

		How lame and dull the written word To you the swift and nimble !

		How alien to the walker 's mind , Earth-deep , heaven-high , unfillable , These petty snarls and jests ill-laid And all the profitless parade Of pompous polysyllable ! ''

		But yet , I feel , though weak my phrase My rhetoric though rotten , At least our tale of Walks and Days Should not go unforgotten ; At least some printed word should mark The walker and his wanderings , The strides which lay the miles behind And lap the contemplative mind In calm , unfathomed ponderings . ''

		All this is too deprecatory .

		There is really noth - ing whatever of the petty or the pompous in Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	's pages , and his rhetoric is unim - peachable .

		Indeed , of all the fine fellows , from
Hazlitt	PERSON	to Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	, who have written of walk - ing , few have shown a neater facility of composi - tion , a fuller flavor of wit and high spirits , or a closer philosophic grasp of the subject .

		And it should be remembered that Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	has had to sustain his pitch through eight chapters , whereas the others wrote only a single essay apiece .

		In his first paper , on '' Walking and Conver - sation , '' while reasserting the basic truism that walking and talking are wholly incompatible , Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	refutes for all time the superficial corollary that walkers are therefore by tempera - ment a morose and unsocial tribe . ''

		Nothing can be further from the truth .

		Only by construing sociability in the very narrow sense of com - pliance with current social conventions , can you justify such a position ; and even so , I would ask , are walkers the only men who have ever omitted calls or trifled with dance invitations ?

		But if sociability is taken in its true sense as indicating a friendly attitude of mind , I say there is more of it between two walkers treading the eighteenth mile without a word spoken , than between any two diners-out talking twenty-four to the dozen , as if there were a tax on unaccompanied monologue , and a graduated super-tax on silence .

		When put to the ulti - mate test of fact this becomes clear .

		If you have walked with a man you will lend him tobacco , half-a-crown , nay , you will lend him your map ; if you have only dined with him , I doubt if you would lend him a silk hat . ''

		Closely related in substance to this essay is
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 99 that on `` Walking as a Social Form . ''

		Con - scious of the fact that the walking fraternity pursue their joys under the shadow of a certain stigma , as enemies in a way to the recognized social forms dancing , teas , calls , dinners , and what not , Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	proceeds to a close philosophic analysis of social forms in general .

		The result of his investigation is as revolution - ary and liberating to the walker as are the con - clusions of
M. Bergson	PERSON	to the ordinary mortal .

		Instead of a cringing apologia or a dogmatic defiance , as were hitherto his only resources against the taunts of dancers and diners and tea-bibbers , the walker may now triumphantly refute the validity of that `` futile decalogue of mode '' to which society has so long given its sanction , and point with serenity to the not distant day when walking will be popularly re - garded as the only authentic expression of the social spirit .

		Greatly daring , though not without reluctance -LRB- for '' controversy of any kind is naturally repug - nant to the amiable nature of a walker '' -RRB- , Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	devotes a chapter to '' Walking Equip - ment . ''

		Here are revived some mighty questions which have split the ranks of walkers from time immemorial , questions such as those of high shoes versus low , long trousers versus short , hats versus no hats , or -LRB- turning to the internal needs of man -RRB- of meat versus vegetables , beer versus water , and so on .

		Then there are the finer philosophic distinctions , such as the con - figuration of coats , the functions of waistcoats , the necessity of ties , and the moral value of walking sticks .

		Within this bristling palisade of problems Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	walks with fine tact and conciliatory discretion ; though he does not hesitate upon occasion to record his own convictions , as witness the spirited denuncia - tion of beer .

		-LRB- It must be owned , however , that the force of this diatribe is much weakened by a prefatory note disclaiming any application of the remarks to
Munich	LOCATION	beer . -RRB-

		We wish that space were available for some indication of the wealth of good things in Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	's other chapters , in that on '' Walker Miles , '' the humble cicerone of Surrey highways and field-paths ; on `` Walking and Music , '' in which the iconoclastic digression on dancing is the best part ; on `` Walking in Literature , '' where we rejoice to see justice at last done to that '' living embodiment of all that is best in walking , ''
Vernon Whitford	PERSON	; on '' Walking Alone , '' with particular reference to walking in
London	LOCATION	; and , finally , on '' Walking , Sport and Athletics . ''

		But we can do no more than quote this concluding apostrophe of the essay last - named : '' Poor , ill-used , neglected , misunderstood body !

		Our ancestors soddened you with port : our grandfathers overlooked you while they muddled with the soul and mind which are bound up with you : ascetics starved you and hedonists cultivated you in patches : doctors analysed you till there was nothing left but a catalogue of inanimate fragments : economic forces penned you in dens and prisons : fashion clothed you in impossible gar - ments , and kept you up at hours and in atmospheres which outraged your most sacred instincts .

		And now I make you sit here writing writing !

		For heaven 's sake , come out for a walk . ''

		It would be rather distressing to have to con - template the mental equipment of any true '' companion of the boot '' who did not find infinite relish in Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	's pages .

		Many of the walking tribe will , with the reviewer , lay the book down at last in a mood of exalted satis - faction comparable only to that which comes to one after a long day 's tramp in the open , when , over tea and a pipe in one of those enchanted gardens that hide so unsuspectedly behind the dusty road-fronts of certain well-remembered English inns say the '' Burford Bridge '' at Dorking or the `` Rothay '' at Grasmere one muses in vacuous complacency over the rosy aspect of things in general , and the celestial pleasures of walking in particular .

		100 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, When the financier is on trial for embezzlement , we are given all the steps of the legal procedure , and even the twelve good men and true who act as jurors in the case are individually characterized .

		The fault of over-elaboration is much more grievous than it was in the case of Mr.
White	PERSON	's `` A Certain Rich Man , '' which the present novel resembles in both theme and construction .

		Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	gives us truth , no doubt , and in that fact is the defence of his method , but it is truth in conglomerate chunks such as the literary artist is under bonds to dispense with .

		Cowperwood , the chief figure in this narra - tive , is described as a man who `` never gave a thought to the vast palaver concerning evil which is constantly going on . ''

		He is utterly without moral sense , and devoid of any principle other than expediency .

		Born in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	in the thirties , the son of a bank officer , his attention is early fixed upon the financial game , and he determines as a boy to get into it .

		While still at school , he carries out certain sharp business transactions , and thereby gets his start .

		After various experimental sallies , he gets into the stock exchange , and enters upon his real career .

		Every trick of manipulation seems to come to him intuitively , and he becomes an adept at juggling with values .

		He makes a specialty of trac - tion stocks , and drags the city treasurer a weak creature into his toils , acting as agent for the city loan , and borrowing the city funds to use in his specu - lative enterprises .

		His undoing comes with the Chi - cago fire of
1871	DATE	and the ensuing panic , and with the simultaneous exposure of his liaison with the daughter of an Irish contractor who has befriended him .

		The whole rotten situation is brought to light , and he is pursued both by the public clamor that de - mands a scapegoat and by the private vengeance of the outraged father .

		In spite of every legal subtlety that can be employed in his favor , he becomes a bankrupt and a convict with a prison sentence of several years .

		The actual term is cut short to about a year by means of a pardon , and
Cowperwood	ORGANIZATION	, a free man , finds in the panic of
1873	DATE	and the failure of
Jay Cooke & Co.	ORGANIZATION	the occasion for rehabilitating his fortunes through his knowledge of the stock market .

		Then he starts for the West to build up a new career in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Getting his wife to consent to a divorce , he takes his paramour with him , and there the story ends .

		Those who are familiar with the financial his - tory of recent times know what followed , for , while the study of
Cowperwood	ORGANIZATION	is doubtless not an exact portrait , it presents so many points of similarity to the figure of a notorious buccaneer of recent days that the reader early entertains a suspicion of his identity .

		It becomes more than a suspicion when we read this note of his life in the penitentiary .

		`` Every evening he had studied the sky from his narrow yard , which resulted curiously in the gift in later years of a great reflecting telescope to a famous university . ''

		The word `` reflecting '' may be inten - tional , but we imagine it to be a slip of a sort which the author frequently makes , as when -LRB- about 1840 -RRB-
Cowperwood	LOCATION	is made to learn the difference between a state bank and a national one .

		One of the noticeable characteristics of the novel is a certain slovenliness both in the use of language and in the statement of fact .

		The following instances may be adduced : `` The great
Chicago	LOCATION	fire ,
October 7th , 1871	DATE	, ... began on
Saturday , October 7th	DATE	, and continued apparently unabated until the following
Wednesday	DATE	. ''

		The fire began on
Sunday	DATE
evening	TIME	, the 8th , and had spent its fury early
Tuesday	DATE
morning	TIME	.

		Our other instance is in this description of a waltz : `` He had put his hand to her waist .

		His right arm held her left ex - tended arm to arm , palm to palm .

		Her right hand was on his shoulder , and she was close to him , looking into his eyes . ''

		A waltz according to these specifica - tions would excite much admiration in the onlookers .

		The author of `` The Financier '' is committed to a method of unflinching realism which makes such an absurdity as this unusually conspicuous .

		His realism also leads him , on at least two occasions , to forget all the claims of reticence in dealing with the rela - tions between men and women .

		And we must say that the minute description of the costume worn by
Cowperwood	ORGANIZATION	's paramour , given us whenever she makes an appearance , is calculated to get on the reader 's nerves .

		Mr.
Rex Beach	PERSON	has taken for the subject of his new novel the
New Orleans	LOCATION	riots some twenty years ago , the disturbances which subjected a number of Italians to the summary process of lynch law , and caused international complications , the echoes of which have not yet died away .

		To this theme as a climax he works up , beginning his tale in
Sicily	LOCATION	several years earlier , with the brutal assassination of a young landed proprietor , just about to become a bridegroom , through the agency of the
Mafia	LOCATION	.

		His betrothed , maddened by her bereavement , vows ven - geance , and her cause is also taken up by the Amer - ican friend of the murdered man , who has come to
Sicily	LOCATION	for the wedding .

		Then the scene shifts to
New Orleans	LOCATION	, where the American has his home , and whither the criminals flee for a refuge .

		The girl simply blots herself out of existence , becoming a nurse in a religious house in
New Orleans	LOCATION	, and even her collaborator in the plan of vengeance does not suspect that she is living in his own city .

		Then a series of crimes , presumably attributable to Italians , arouse
New Orleans	LOCATION	to indignation , and
Blake	PERSON	be - comes instrumental in bringing them home .

		Build - ing better than he knows , he discovers that he has unearthed the man who had been guilty of the Sicilian crime of years ago , and reveals a wealthy and respected Italian merchant of the city as the secret head of the Mafiosi .

		Then comes the trial , in which a pusillanimous jury does not dare to con - vict , although the evidence furnishes unquestionable proof of guilt .

		The sequel is what history records , and , although we are no apologists for lynch law , it must be admitted that the author makes a case that works upon our sympathies .

		The whole story is melodrama of the better sort , moving steadily and
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 101 relentlessly to its tragic predetermined close .

		It is admirable in its construction , and every episode fits logically into the plot .

		Not upon a single page does the interest flag , and the situation is kept tense all the time .

		Moreover , the author displays more knowledge of life and more evident powers of char - acterization than we have hitherto found in his romantic inventions .

		In the end ,
Blake	PERSON	marries the girl , which has been a foregone conclusion all the time .

		When
Kirby Trask	PERSON	starts from somewhere in the middle West to conquer the world , he takes with him the memory of a successful college career fol - lowed by a brief reportorial experience , and a letter of introduction to the magnate who controls the steel trust .

		The letter does him no particular good , but he has industry and willingness , and he obtains and holds several unpromising jobs until he feels himself on his feet .

		Eventually , he succeeds to the position of the steel trust magnate by the romantic process of winning the latter 's daughter .

		He does not do anything in particular to deserve such a spectacular success , and when the story ends , he is well on the way to develop into the same sort of cold-blooded and unscrupulous man as the one who has unwill - ingly taken him for a son-in-law .

		The story of his rise to power is unconvincing , because it does not appear to be a triumph of either business genius or moral endowment .

		It is for the most part a '' fluke , '' and there is about it no touch of that idealism which we have a right to expect in stories of the present sort .

		This rather unwholesome story is the work of Mr.
James Oppenheim	PERSON	, and its title is `` The Olympian . ''

		It is realistic and in many ways vital , but is rather common and uninspired in treatment .

		`` A Comedy of assumptions '' is Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	's description of `` Mrs.
Lancelot	PERSON	, '' his latest novel in the Meredithian manner .

		Among the assumptions not specified , which however are borne in upon the reader 's consciousness , are the identities , respectively , of the heroine -LRB- here called
Georgiana	PERSON	-RRB- with
Sanchia	PERSON	, and of her poet-lover with
Senhouse	PERSON	.

		As for the
Duke of Devizes	ORGANIZATION	, we are compelled to think of him as no other than the
Iron Duke	ORGANIZATION	, because the time of the story is that of the Reform Bill agitation , and there is no other possible Duke of that time whom we could invest with the powers and the qualities here attributed to the figure of Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's por - trayal .

		The
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's infatuation for Mrs.
Lancelot	PERSON	fits perfectly with that well-known trait of his character which made him silly in the presence of a petticoat , and there is a certain piquancy in finding him here presented as the poet 's rival for the affections of Sanchia-Georgiana .

		Mr.
Lancelot	PERSON	is a third contest - ant for that prize , but being merely her husband , and a person so mean-spirited as to seek advancement through his wife 's influence with the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	, he gets considerably less than a third share of our sympathies , since we feel that he has brought the pangs of j ealousy upon himself .

		The story is animated by a spirit of delicious comedy , and is notable for its psychological discernment .

		But we must confess that the material is thin , and that the story -LRB- considered merely as such -RRB- drags not a little toward the end .

		Mr.
Warwick Deeping	PERSON	is a novelist whose work is always interesting ; his situations are well con - ceived and firmly handled .

		It is not , then , greatly to his disparagement to say that '' The Strong Hand '' is an inferior example of his work .

		His story is that of an enemy of the people in
Ibsen	LOCATION	's sense the story of a physician in a country town , who sets the respectable villagers by the ears when he pokes into their wells and drains , and discloses the most shocking conditions of sanitation .

		The hero of this crusade is a young surgeon who comes to the village as assistant to the doddering old practi - tioner in whose hands the health of the community has hitherto been trusted .

		The practical investiga - tions and the blunt speech of the new-comer soon get him into opposition with his chief , and into disfavor with the propertied classes .

		It takes the horrors of an epidemic to show that he has been a prophet and to justify his actions .

		Meanwhile , dismissed from his post , he is forced to fight single-handed for decent conditions , and gains his ends only after a hard struggle .

		His triumph is a little qualified , for toward the end he is forced to make the hard choice between the claims of love and of duty , and love gets rather the better of it , thereby weakening his sense of responsibility , and making him a little less than the moral hero he has set out to become . ''

		I had the mind of a monk , and you have put the passion of a man into me . ''

		This may be taken as the text or the programme of '' The Lure of Life , '' the new novel by Mr. and
Mrs. Castle	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the story of a student , unexpectedly come into possession of fortune and ancestral acres , who is turned from the ways of scholarship by the attractions of a house - hold upon a neighboring estate .

		It is a Belgian household , established in
England	LOCATION	for a part of the year , and it consists of the Count and
Countess de Braye	ORGANIZATION	and their niece
Solange de Flodore	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the Countess for whom Sir Ughtred first conceives a passion , although she is many years his senior , but he thinks to discern in her a soul-mate , until he makes the alarming discovery that she is only philan - dering with him , and she is by nature a mangeuse d'dmes , winning men 's devotion for the zest of the sport , with no idea of playing the game to the limit .

		The complication resulting from this sentimental adventure leads him into a mariage de convenance with
Solange	PERSON	, a farouche creature who has flouted him , but with whom he discovers himself on the honeymoon to be as deeply in love as the most sentimentally-minded young reader could wish .

		The story is wholly artificial , and , as knowledge of its authorship would lead one to suspect , positively reek - ing with sentimentality .

		It sets us wishing , as Mrs.
Glyn	PERSON	's '' Halcyone '' did , that lady-novelists would not attempt to rhapsodize about Greek art and the Greek spirit ; they do it so badly .

		102 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, BRIEFS oisr NEW BOOKS .

		TWO French voluraes dealing respectively masters of the with Puvis de Chavannes and
Edou	ORGANIZATION	- present day .

		ar -LRB- j Manet inaugurate a new art series , entitled '' French Artists of To-day '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- , which promises to prove useful to Amer - ican lay readers as an introduction to contemporary French art .


Paris	LOCATION	is at present the eye of humanity , the place where fresh discoveries in vision and ex - periments in expression are most constantly being made , the most highly energized and vitalized centre of artistic production in the modern world .

		It is fit - ting that a set of handbooks interpreting to us a little of this intense creative activity should begin with studies of the two men who perhaps more than any others are responsible for the enthusiasm and the direction of its progress .

		Puvis de Chavannes and
Edouard Manet	PERSON	, different as they were in experience and in method of expression , were alike in courage , in sincerity , and in power of inspiring their disciples .

		Puvis de Chavannes began his work much more imi - tatively than
Manet	PERSON	, his early pictures as repro - duced here show little differentiation from the suave commonplaces of the academicians ; but he outgrew his training , he dared to analyze his own impres - sions at first-hand and to translate into quietly simple and exquisite idyls the results of his steady contem - plation of nature .

		There is something of
Corot	LOCATION	in him and something of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	; not that his con - ceptions are not above all his own -LRB- the great series of frescoes in the
Pantheon	LOCATION	is original in every sense of the word -RRB- , but it is easier in
Puvis de Chavannes	LOCATION	's work to find echoes of artistic influences than it is in such painting as Manet 's . ''

		I am myself alone , '' shrieked Manet in the face of his first mystified and disgusted public , as he presented to them veracious bits drawn from his own immediate surroundings .

		He chose to paint the actualities of city life and character , refusing to sentimentalize them as
Dumas	PERSON	fils was doing in his plays , or , like Chavannes , to withdraw from them into woods and fields peopled by his transforming imagination .

		Look first at '' Olympia , '' wonderful , tarnished , real creature of the cynical
Paris	LOCATION	streets that she is , and then turn to the nymphs of `` The Sacred Wood , '' and you have the difference between the two men , the difference , moreover , between the pragmatist and the idealist in art to-day and every day .

		One kind of vision is as true and as fruitful as the other , certainly in the immediate instance each has proved as stimulating to the sight and imagination of the generation now working as the other , and both have pointed towards equally fresh possibilities in their medium .

		These little books will perform a valuable service if they rouse interest in such creators as
Chavannes	LOCATION	and Manet and their followers .

		Whether the black and white and not always very distinct illustrations , numerous and well-chosen though they are , can sug - gest at all adequately originals so remarkable for color , is more than a question ;
Claude Monet	PERSON	and the later impressionists would surely lose most of their charm in similar reproductions .

		Yet the vol - umes pretend only to be introductory to a large field of study , and for that purpose they furnish necessary machinery ; the introductions and notes , translated from the French of excellent critics like Andre ''
Michel	PERSON	and
Louis Hourticq	PERSON	, are refreshingly enthu - siastic and undidactic , and biographical and biblio - graphical details are sufficiently indicated .

		Whatever may be one 's philosophical cMn e se f wo m en .

		presuppositions as to the relative excellence of Buddhism , Confucian - ism ,
Taoism	LOCATION	, and Christianity , one can scarcely lay down Miss
Margaret E. Burton	PERSON	's little volume , `` Notable Women of Modern China '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- , with any heart left to quarrel with the missions that have produced these particular specimens of modern women .

		The book consists of sketches of the lives and characters of six Chinese women , all of them Christians .

		Three of the women are physicians , one is the widow of a mandarin of high rank , one was a teacher , and one a former Taoist nun .

		The sketches vary somewhat in interest , but no one of them is lacking in value as a document to those who desire to weigh dispassionately the achievement of
Chris	PERSON	- tian missions in
China	LOCATION	.

		Readers who are at all familiar with the Chinese race will not be wholly surprised by the remarkable charm and attractive - ness of nature attributed to all the women depicted , but few will be prepared to discover in a Chinese woman capacity and ability of such extraordinary degree as seem to be possessed by two or more of the subjects of the volume , notably by
Miss Mary Stone	ORGANIZATION	, the
Kiukiang	LOCATION	physician .

		The Chinese are frequently called a passive race , capable of moving only in masses , and wholly deficient in initiative .

		Either the characterization fails to take account of the influence of environment , and of the change in race habits with the change in environment , or else the Christian religion begets traits contradictory of the habits of the race to which the individual belongs .

		Only in one of these two ways can we account for the initiative and individuality which characterize the subjects of Miss
Burton	PERSON	's sketches .

		The men who appear incidentally in the book share these traits with the women .

		The most remarkable person of the six studied is Dr.
Mary Stone	PERSON	.

		The daughter of a Chinese pastor , herself thoroughly prepared by missionary teachers for an American college educa - tion , and graduated with honor from the medical school of the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Stone	PERSON	has demonstrated , according to the testimony of many capable witnesses , extraordinary gifts as a physician , surgeon , administrator , and teacher .

		Beginning with her friend Dr.
Ida Kahn	PERSON	, who later instituted a new work in another city , Dr.
Stone	PERSON	has for years conducted a hospital at
Kiukiang	LOCATION	, securing the funds , designing the buildings , training all the assistants , organizing the staff , and achieving remarkable suc - cess as physician and surgeon .

		But her ability as organizer , her achievement as a teacher of nurses , her sway over the extensive work that she has de -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 103 veloped , are no more impressive than are her per - sonal character and her social attractiveness .

		As the central figure in the book ,
Miss Stone	LOCATION	is surrounded by almost equally pleasing personalities , one of the most winsome being her younger sister , victim a few years ago to tuberculosis , but leaving behind a record of unusual ability and achievement and of great sweetness of nature .

		Miss
Burton	PERSON	's book should have a wide reading , and one may venture to hope that it will dispel at least a small part of the fog of misconception which clouds American thought in regard to the Chinese .

		Shakespeare Professor
George H. Palmer	PERSON	's `` In - n/id timations of Immortality in the Son - immortaiitv .

		netg of Shakspere '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is the thirteenth of the series of lectures on immor - tality delivered at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	under the provisions of the
Ingersoll Lectureship	ORGANIZATION	.

		It differs from most of its predecessors in abandoning the theoretic aspects of the subject in order to scrutinize the testimony of one whose unparalleled insight into mortality at least is universally conceded to examine , in the lecturer 's own words , '' an instance in English liter - ature where the massive truth naively discloses its varied meanings and practical import . ''

		Holding that we treat immortality too much as an abstract matter instead of something to be discovered among the concrete experiences of life , he regards Shake - speare as a peculiarly valuable witness because he is so little concerned with theology and so reticent in regard to his own beliefs .

		Though Professor
Palmer	PERSON	cautiously shields his findings under the title of '' Intimations , '' they are by no means insignificant .

		Accepting the order of the sonnets as substantially correct , he discovers the poet dwelling , in their three groups , upon three successive types of immortality , which may be designated as the
Natural	ORGANIZATION	, the Ideal , and the Spiritual .

		The first two of these are perhaps sufficiently obvious ; it is not so clear that the third is present in the third group as a constituent or per - vading element , though it comes at least once , in sonnet one hundred forty-six , to very definite expres - sion .

		Historical criticism is not likely to abandon its attempts to solve the mystery of these baffling poems ; but so long as the mystery remains unsolved , a consistent reading of them in any aspect , such as is here offered , will be welcome .

		However , Pro- fessor
Palmer	PERSON	set out upon a very different quest , and the particular thing which he has brought back is the fact that Shakespeare '' once at least looked into immortality . ''

		An appeal for Mr ''
Anthony M. Ludovici	PERSON	has com - wistocracy bined two great subjects , ''
Nietzsche	PERSON	mart .

		an ^ Art '' -LRB- Luce -RRB- , and has written a provocative book on this double theme .

		But aside from the leitmotif and a few quotations ,
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	is in no way responsible for this study . ''

		Ludovici and Art '' would have been a more correct but less fetching title .

		Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	thinks as follows : Art is possibly the greatest thing on earth , for artists interpret the world , give values to things , adjust nature , and impose order upon chaos .

		But the art of to-day is in a pitiable plight .

		Confusion and lack of strong ideals prevail not only in politics and re - ligion but also in art .

		Artistically we do not know what we want ; we only know , if we have any artis - tic sense , that what we have is not good .

		Democracy is the ubiquitous demon which is responsible for the hopeless condition of modern art .

		Everybody feels called to paint preferably landscapes and portraits and attributes this calling to his artistic tempera - ment , whereas it is only a betrayal of his weak will .

		Therefore , to point out only a few of the decadents in Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	's estimation ,
Monet	ORGANIZATION	's pointillisme ,
Sargent	PERSON	's nervous strokes ,
Rodin	PERSON	's detailed anatomy , the Impressionists ' atmosphere ,
Peter Graham	PERSON	's gauzes ,
Lavery	PERSON	's pale people , indeed the devotion of all modern artists to truth in the Christian and scientific sense , all these are indications of the general '' funk '' that has overtaken the art world .

		What we need is superman-art , the art that comes from one great commander with a host of merry followers , such art as built the Egyptian Pyramid and wrought the diorite statue of
King Chephren	ORGANIZATION	at
Cairo	LOCATION	.

		We need aristocratic art , with symmetry , sobriety , simplicity , transfiguration , and repetition .

		Now , this book is the outcome of much study ; it scintillates about the Old Masters ; the author 's point is clearly made ; and that there is some ground for grievance in the world of art , all will admit .

		But only a negligible minority will say that the case of art is as bad as it is here painted .

		And practically none will ascribe any imperfect art that is being produced to-day to the Luthers and Humboldts and Bebels of this and other days .

		The situation is not hopeless .

		Where so many paint some will surely draw .

		And since this book is silent on
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's attitude to - ward literature and music , where he was so voluble , and since it is so voluble on painting and sculpture , where
Nietzsche	PERSON	was practically dumb , the title is unfair all around : it flatters the writer , cajoles the reader , and mismates
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	.

Atlantic	LOCATION	, through
America	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	, and home again to
England	LOCATION	, all duly set down in a proper manner . ''

		The narrator 's sweet - heart is supposed to send him out to see the world and make sure of his own heart before the irrevo - cable word shall have been uttered at the altar .

		This playful conceit is happily handled , and the familiar letters written home by the traveller are excellent reading .

		There is more of graceful play of fancy , more of character-study and of quiet and meditative observation , than in Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's far-trumpeted volume .

		What should most interest a European in 104 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	,
America	LOCATION	, is thus stated : '' But if he thinks that man is man 's most interesting study , that possible gleams into the future are as good to get as the lights of long ago , then assuredly he should try
America	LOCATION	.

		It still runs full-speed ahead , and it still has an open mind as to the goal , so here is a crying interest for you , who like to follow human progress even in my poor epistles . ''

		Another passage : '' Never is the Amer - ican more delightful than when he is an author , an artist , a journalist , a composer , a doctor , a lawyer , a professor , in a word when he is the professional man .

		As such he is not burdened with the hoary moss called etiquette , which clings to his calling in an old country . ''

		It is , then , the people and not the sky - scrapers and the Pullman cars and the mammoth hotels that interest Mr.
Milne	PERSON	, and his interest is most agreeably and entertainingly expressed .

		On an early page the critic can not fail to note in pass - ing an instance of that wilfulness of the personal pronoun to which Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	is just now calling attention .

		The author writes of the iceberg that wrecked the Titanic : `` It rips her open , she , the unconquerable , the unsinkable , ... '' The reader 's attention to what Mr.
Milne	PERSON	has to say is undis - tracted by pictures , except that a frontispiece repre - sents '' the spirit of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' in a full-rigged ship drawn by Mr.
Charles Pears	PERSON	.

		The heroic a a e The relations of Greek and Teutonic in Greek and heroic poetry offer a tempting theme Teutonic poetry .

		t o the archaeologist or litterateur ; but the alluring path is bound to be thorny for the adventurer who dreams of definite conclusions .

		However , Mr.
H. Munro Chadwick	PERSON	,
Fellow of Clare College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, has just written a large volume , `` The Heroic Age '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , wherein he strives to bring these relations to light , or , as he mod - estly states , to make a start in that direction .

		He takes the Heroic Age of the Teutonic peoples as covering approximately three hundred years , and closing about the middle of the sixth century ; the Greek Heroic Age he regards as terminating with the series of movements traditionally known as the Return of the
Heracleidai	LOCATION	, and covering three or four generations .

		Mr.
Chadwick	PERSON	believes that the resemblances between the Teutonic group of poems and the Homeric poems `` are due primarily to resemblances in the ages to which they relate and to which they ultimately owe their origin .

		The com - parative study of heroic poetry therefore involves the comparative study of ` Heroic Ages , ' and the problems which it presents are essentially problems of anthropology . ''

		In the earlier chapters the author treats of such subjects as '' The Heroic Age of the Teutonic Peoples , '' `` The Poetry and Minstrelsy of Early Times , '' and `` The Supernatural Elements in the -LSB- Northern -RSB- Heroic Stories . ''

		Then he proceeds to the Greek period , and takes up corresponding topics .

		In the last hundred pages he becomes more definitely comparative under such captions as `` The Common Characteristics of Teutonic and Greek Heroic Poetry , '' `` Religion in the Heroic Age , '' or `` The Causes and Antecedent Conditions of the Heroic Age . ''

		Obviously we can not enter upon a detailed criticism , and it is with extreme reluctance that we record an opinion unsupported by evidence ; but we feel that the results attained in the volume are by no means commensurate either with the reputation of the distinguished author or the amount of toil he has cheerfully lavished upon his project .

		The material book will be a joy to any reader who appreciates good typography and presswork .

		These pieces , presented in an '' authorized translation '' by Mr.
Fred Rothwell	PERSON	, were written twenty or more years ago , and thus their claim to favor must rest on a more substantial basis than mere novelty .

		More than a third of the book is devoted to the author 's reminiscences of the Roumanian queen , whom he waited upon at her castle of

		He calls the women of
Japan	LOCATION	'' affected and finical in mind and body , artificial and prim , '' their very souls `` old and worn out , '' perhaps because , as he surmises , `` their race has for so many centuries been separated from the other varieties of the human species , living on its own stock and never being re - novated .

		It is an excellent book ; it stands the severe test of consecutive reading .

		Sketches of ^ r >
Frederic Taber Cooper	PERSON	, whose the younger book entitled `` Some American Story novelists .

		Tellers '' is remembered as a refresh - ing presentation of information not readily accessi - ble elsewhere , has published a companion volume called `` Some English Story Tellers : A Book of the Younger Novelists '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		In view of the fact that this title was `` deliberately chosen , '' one is somewhat surprised to find that the author has included Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	, who was born before the death of
Frances Burney	PERSON	, and has excluded Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, born over a quarter of a century later .

		Among the novel - ists discussed are Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	, Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	, Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, Mr.
Locke	PERSON	, Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	, and Mr.
Ben	PERSON	- nett ; and to represent the easy-going catholic tem - per of the author we might add Mrs.
Dudeney	PERSON	,
Mr Hichens	PERSON	, and Mr.
Trevena	PERSON	.

		The treatment , in each case , involves a few words regarding the novelist 's position , something of his life , and an expository account of his chief writings , with enough critical appraisement to make the reader glad that there is no more .

		This does not mean that Mr.
Cooper	PERSON	is extraordinarily lacking in the critical faculty : he writes nimbly and sensibly , makes no palpable blun - ders of consequence , and , considering the difficulty of weighing the merits of living writers , rarely for - gets that the critic must have something to say .

		But beyond this faint praise one can hardly go .

		Aside from its critical aspect , the book is admirable enough : it is entertaining , it abounds in facts that are signifi - cant as well as unfamiliar , it contains a forty-page bibliography , and it is illustrated with a number of photographs that many devotees of the modern novel will scrutinize with sentimental satisfaction .

George Moore	PERSON	's autobiographic tril - ls '' Trilogy . ''

		ogy -LRB- Hail and Farewell '' -RRB- is as ram - bling and varied and pleasantly haphazard as was the first part , `` Ave , '' and as , doubtless , will be the third part , `` Vale , '' now in preparation .

		Disap - proving
England	LOCATION	's attitude in the Boer War , our brilliant and impulsive author shakes off the dust of
London	LOCATION	from his feet and betakes himself to
Dublin	LOCATION	to become a `` Gaelic League propagandist . ''

		And there of course he falls in with the celebrated Irish poets of the day , and with other celebrities and non-celebrities , with whom he has high and impassioned discourse on all imaginable topics , and a few others .

		In a passing reference to Mr.
Ches	PERSON	- terton 's classing of
Francis Thompson	PERSON	with
Shelley	PERSON	and
Keats	PERSON	, he remarks , in aptly idiomatic phrase : `` He must have been thinking with the surface of his brain when he compared
Francis Thompson	PERSON	with
Shelley	PERSON	; casual thinking always puts wrong words into our heads . ''

		A list of the great French writers of the nineteenth century which he gives omits Daudet and
Dumas	PERSON	-LRB- both father and son -RRB- , though it includes Zola and Maupassant and
Gautier	PERSON	.

		Re - ligious controversy and all sorts of more or less heated debate are found in abundance in the book , and no reader of any convictions of his own can fail to find some one or other of his pet opinions rather unceremoniously handled which will impart zest to his perusal of the volume .

		The literature of autobiography can show nothing to match this trilogy of Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	's .

		A d vice for the sleepless .

		`` Simple Rules for Overcoming In - somnia '' is the sub-title of Dr.
Joseph Collins	PERSON	's brief discourse upon a vital subject , `` Sleep and the Sleepless '' -LRB-
Sturgis & Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which makes it plain that Morpheus is not to be wooed , but his adversaries overcome .

		It is an eminently rational book , and is addressed to those who are ready and able to direct the regimen of life by reasonable methods .

		It argues in com - monsense fashion , yet with the reinforcement of sci - entific data , for the removal of causes that disturb the recuperative functions and make the ills that mind is heir to .

		It sets forth briefly but emphatically the use of drugs and the larger abuse to which drugs invite , as well as the conditions of their wise appli - cation .

		It offers no secrets , because there are none to offer ; it neither alarms nor seeks refuge in an ignoring bliss that postpones the day of reckoning .

		It advises expertly even to the character of literary companions to be chosen for their soothing effect in putting one to sleep .

		The whole forms so accept - able a guide to the problems of regimen that its perusal may be recommended to those whose sleep is 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, troubled or untroubled , for even the latter have problems of regimen not unrelated to the more seri - ous tribulations of their sleepless kinsmen .

		Whether we bless the inventor of sleep or deplore its necessity , we do well to accept the limitations of our inherit - ance and seek wisdom in adapting desire to capacity .

		Collected verse When

		ao ?

		^ f act wag ; ven on j tne barest mention even in the literary journals of her own country .

		Yet by many discriminating poetry - lovers on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	the loss was felt in a keenly intimate sense .

		A '' humbler poet '' she assuredly was , with limitations which she would have been the first to admit ; but nevertheless , few among her fellow-singers of the past quarter-century have been more adept in reaching and stirring the reflective heart .

		She handled a wide variety of metrical forms with facility and delicate grace .

		Her themes are many and various also ; but in most of her verse , whatever the subject , `` the sense of tears in mortal things '' is uppermost .

		This insistent note of sadness , this wist - ful preoccupation with the idea of death and trans - ition , has indeed greatly limited her appeal in a generation that is determined to be jolly at all odds .

		But she has found , and will continue to find , her fit audience , however few , by whom the five small vol - umes of her published verse will always be cherished .

		The contents of these five volumes have now been brought together in a collected edition -LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with the addition of a selection of new poems which it had been the author 's intention to publish in a separate volume under the title , `` The Lamp and the Lute . ''

		Some of the exquisite garden lyrics from '' The Heart of a Garden '' are also included in this section .

		Mr.
H. B. Marriott Watson	PERSON	, the poet 's hus - band , edits this collected edition .

		The volume is well printed and bound , and contains a photogravure portrait .

		_ All that filial devotion and the love and respect of friends could do to honor the memory of a man eminent in his calling of soldier , educator , and churchman , has been placed at the service of the biographer of `` The Soldier-Bishop ,
Ellison	PERSON	Capers '' -LRB- Neale -RRB- .

		Mr.
Wal	PERSON	- ter
B. Capers	PERSON	, the late bishop 's youngest son and president of
Columbia Institute	ORGANIZATION	, at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, Ten - nessee , has acted as scribe in the compiling of avail - able data concerning his father 's life ; but the other six surviving sons and daughters , and many friends and admirers of the `` soldier-bishop '' have gladly assisted with letters and other contributions , and the journal and letters of the deceased have also been largely drawn upon .


Ellison Capers	PERSON	was born at
Charleston	LOCATION	,
S. C.	PERSON	,
Oct. 14 , 1837	DATE	; finished his school education at
Arsenal Academy	ORGANIZATION	,
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, where he afterward taught until the outbreak of war called him to the service of his state ; distinguished himself notably at the battle of
Jackson	LOCATION	,
Miss.	LOCATION	, was wounded at
Chickamauga	LOCATION	, promoted brigadier-general soon afterward , and was with Hood and
Johnston	PERSON	in the A Southern soldier and churchman .

		arduous campaigns of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the
Tennessee	LOCATION	.

		In the ministry , which he entered not long after laying aside the sword , he became Bishop of
South Carolina	LOCATION	; and in
1904	DATE	he was elected Chancellor of the
University of the South	ORGANIZATION	, at
Sewanee	LOCATION	,
Tenn.	LOCATION	.

		He died in
1908	DATE	.

		Tributes to his memory and selec - tions from his public utterances fill the last part of the volume .

		Portraits and other illustrations enrich the work .

		The
Brothers of the Book	ORGANIZATION	is the name of an organization of literary ama - teurs which publishes quaint and curious little books from time to time for the delight of its members and a few favored outsiders .

		One of its recent issues is a pamphlet whose title runs as follows : ''
Campi Golfarii Romae Antiquae	PERSON	: De
Ludo Antique Regalique Excerptum ex Actis Diurnis C. Cilni Maecenatis	ORGANIZATION	in Versum Modernum Convertit et Annotavit P. Sibleius Ferus '' -LRB- Chicagine : In Linea Sartoris -RRB- .

		Which being interpreted means that certain verses about the game of golf , written by Mr.
Bert Leston Taylor	PERSON	for the column of whimsicalities which he edits in a
Chicago	LOCATION	newspaper , have been put into Latin by Mr.
Payson Sibley Wild	PERSON	, and pro- vided with an imposing array of learned apparatus .

		The Latin text purports to have been discovered by Dr.
von Aberwitz	PERSON	of the
University of Hofbrau	ORGANIZATION	, and to reveal the fact that the ancient game was in favor with the Roman emperors , and was wellnigh the undoing of
Augustus Caesar	PERSON	, driving him to strong language and to drink . ''

		Nos modo
Caudas Gallorum Martini	PERSON	, Modo lagenas arcessimus , vini . ''

		The note which describes the
Martini	ORGANIZATION	runs as fol - lows : '' Permixtio delicatissima mellis , malorum cit - reorum , amarorum , ' aquae igneae ' et olivarum pipere refertarum , '' attributed to Plinius Tertius , which seems to be an accurate and , workable description .

		It is all excellent fooling , and the conceit is worked out with wit and verve .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Rich 's '' Apolonius and Silla , '' edited by Mr.
Morton Luce	PERSON	, and the '' Mensechmi '' of Plautus , with Latin text and Elizabethan translation , edited by Dr.
W. H. D. Rouse	PERSON	, are two additions to `` The Shakespeare Classics , '' published by
Messrs. Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Egbert Ray Nichols	PERSON	has compiled a second volume of '' Intercollegiate Debates , '' covering the year 1910-11 .

		It will , like its predecessor , find an enthu - siastic welcome among college and high school students .

		Messrs.
Hinds	PERSON	,
Noble , & Eldredge	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		In her volume entitled '' Noted Speeches of
Daniel Webster	PERSON	,
Henry Clay	PERSON	,
John C. Calhoun	PERSON	, '' Miss
Lilian Marie Briggs	PERSON	has edited for school use six famous orations which had a marked influence upon American history .

		The book is published by Messrs.
Moffat	PERSON	,
Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		To his series of new translations from
Plutarch	LOCATION	, Pro- fessor
Bernadotte	PERSON	Pen-in now adds the lives of Nicias and
Alcibiades	LOCATION	, and provides them with a very elaborate
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 107 apparatus of annotation .

		With this volume the author completes his design , begun in '' Themistocles and Aristides '' and advanced in ''
Cimon	PERSON	and Pericles , '' of presenting in popular form material for the critical study of `` the greatest century in the history in
Athens	LOCATION	. ''

		The Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	are the publishers .

		Four volumes of the handsome library edition of Will - iam Sharp now being published by
Messrs. Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		are at hand .

		Two of them contain Mrs. Sharp 's memoir of her husband ; the other two are `` Vistas '' and '' Lit - erary Geography and Travel Sketches . ''

		This series is in addition to the ''
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	'' books , which are published in a separate collection .

		The '' Scientific American Reference Book '' for
1913	DATE	, published by
Messrs. Munn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a compen - dium of useful information about such timely subjects as Antarctic discovery , the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal , wireless telegraphy , and hundreds of others .

		Its six hundred pages are crammed with facts , many of which are not accessible in the ordinary works of reference .

		There are also many illustrations .

		This book seems to supply a real want .

		The `` Music Lovers ' Cyclopedia '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- , as now issued , is a revised edition , in a single volume , of the work formerly published in two .

		The editor is Mr.
Rupert Hughes	PERSON	, and he has spared no pains to make the work one which shall meet all the demands the lay lover of music may make upon it .

		There are diction - aries of composers and musical terms , plots of operas , essays on special subjects , and all sorts of other matter conveniently arranged for ready reference .

		It is pub - lished at a modest price , and contains nearly a thousand pages .

		In Dr.
E. W. Scripture	PERSON	's little book entitled ''
Stutter	PERSON	- ing and Lisping '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is set forth the nature of one of the most common and distressing interferences with the normal life .

		The technical equipment of the author is unusual , inasmuch as he combines an early psychological training with many years of special re - search in phonetics , and is now a practitioner in the treatment of nervous disease .

		There is so little avail - able on this subject representative of modern views that the book will at once find its public .

		In a measure it attempts too much , since it aims at once to be a guide for the general practitioner , a record of the methods of investigation , and a manual of practical exercises in the cure of these impediments .

		Apart from the unavoid - able confusion in maintaining a coordination in so many directions , the volume meets its requirements .

		The aim of Dr.
Peloubet	PERSON	's new '' International Bible Dictionary '' -LRB- Winston -RRB- is high , in that it endeavors to bring to the great body of teachers and readers the results of the latest modern biblical scholarship .

		The editor also deserves praise for omitting from its pages such speculative theories and hypotheses as overburden some of the larger dictionaries .

		The proper names of the
Bible	LOCATION	, which are always troublesome to students , are both marked for pronunciation and defined according to their derivation .

		Tables of money , weights , and meas - ures are prepared on the basis of the latest investigations of specialists .

		The chronological scheme adopted -LRB- in an Appendix -RRB- is that of the late Professor
Beecher	PERSON	of
Auburn Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fourteen new col - ored maps of Bible lands are a splendid addition to any student 's equipment .

		It is particularly gratifying to find one editor of a popular dictionary of the Bible who realizes the inherent value of ocular instruction .

		Dr.
Peloubet	PERSON	illumines and decorates his pages by five hun - dred illustrations , nearly all of which appear here for the first time .

		The moderate cost of the book will put it within reach of many readers who could not afford the other more expensive single-volume dictionaries .

		When Mr.
Lewis Melville	PERSON	was collecting material for his recent biography of
William Beckford	PERSON	, he obtained permission of the
Duke of Hamilton	ORGANIZATION	, a collateral de - scendant from
Beckford	PERSON	, to examine the
Beckford	PERSON	papers at
Hamilton Palace	ORGANIZATION	; and there , in two large chests never before explored by a man of letters , he discovered , amid other important documents , some large bundles of manu - script , written in French , which proved to be the unpub - lished '' Episodes '' of the famous oriental tale for which
Beckford	ORGANIZATION	is chiefly remembered .

		These papers had hitherto been supposed to be lost .

		In a portly volume , , entitled '' The Episodes of Vathek '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , they are now given to the world , both in the original French -RRB- of
Beckford	PERSON	, and in a flowing and readable translation - by Sir
Frank T. Marzials	PERSON	.

		The English version is placed 1 first , in large print ; the French original next , in smaller type ; and an introduction of some length , consisting ; chiefly of extracts from the correspondence between
Beckford	PERSON	and his friend
Henley	PERSON	, is supplied by Mr.
Melville	PERSON	.

		A photogravure portrait of the author serves as frontispiece .

		The '' Text-book of Design '' by Messrs.
Charles Fabens Kelley	PERSON	and
William Luther Mowll	PERSON	, is intended primarily for college students and others of equivalent training .

		It presents , in form at once attractive and studied , the concepts of design in fresh contact with nature and imagination as opposed to stylistic retrospec - tion , and of design organically expressive rather than merely '' decorative . ''

		Although the text confessedly restates the theory of pure design now generally ac - cepted , the theory of expressive design is developed with a novelty and insight which makes the book an original contribution .

		The inevitable abstractness of the theoretical presentation is well relieved by constant references to practice , and the rich and judicious illus - tration from objects of the highest beauty supplies the atmosphere and stimulation which have been noticeably lacking in some previous books on design .

		For the - development of taste and imagination , the superiority of the analytic method here used over an organization - on the basis of '' historic ornament '' can scarcely be - overestimated .

		The fifth section of the fifth part of '' Modern Amer - ican Library Economy '' -LRB- Elm Tree Press -RRB- considerably exceeds in size any preceding issue of the series , run - ning to the length of 134 pages and covering the import - ant subject of instruction to children on the selection '' and use of books . ''


Course of Study for Normal School	ORGANIZATION	?

		Pupils on Literature for Children '' is the title of the - work , its authors being Mrs.
Julia S. Harron	PERSON	,
Miss Corinne Bacon	PERSON	, and the general editor of the series , Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	.

		Directions and suggestions , with booklists and prescribed readings , on all departments of literature within the juvenile scope -LRB- and perhaps some - what beyond it -RRB- are set down in methodic order pos - sibly indeed with so much attention to method as tcv cause some danger lest the student end by exalting the letter above the spirit .

		A parting counsel might have been useful , urging the prospective teacher of the book 's , principles to assimilate all the excellent matter within its covers and then to let free initiative have rather un - restricted play .

		The wise person will do this in any event .

		Like its predecessors , the little manual is ad - mirably thorough and systematic .

		Three novels announced for early publication by the
John C. Winston Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the following : `` Written in the Sand , '' by Mr.
G. R. Duval	PERSON	; `` The Reluctant Lover , '' by Mr.
Stephen McKenna	PERSON	; and `` The Mystery of 31 , New Inn , '' by Mr.
R. Austin Freeman	PERSON	.

		An interesting event in connection with the inaugura - tion of President
Wilson	PERSON	will be the publication by
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	of a limited
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	edi - tion in one volume of three of his best-known essays , '' Mere Literature , '' '' The Author Himself , '' and On an Author 's Choice of Company . ''

		Four novels appearing on Messrs.
Thomas Y. Crowell	PERSON	Company 's
spring	DATE	list are the following : '' A Superman in Being , '' by Mr.
Litchfleld Woods	PERSON	; `` The Debt , '' a story of South African life , by Mr.

Princess Athura	PERSON	, '' a romance dealing with events in ancient
Persia	LOCATION	, by Mr.

		The Parasite '' by Mrs.
Helen R. Martin	PERSON	, which
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish at once , is said to be different in both setting and characters from this author 's well-known Mennonite stories .

		Simultaneously with this , Messrs.
Lippincott	PERSON	will publish a novel by Mr.
Crittenden Marriott	PERSON	, entitled ''
Sally Castleton	PERSON	, Southerner . ''

		The eighth edition of the library-cataloguer 's vade mecum , the '' Decimal Classification '' inseparably asso - ciated with Mr.
Melvil Dewey	PERSON	's name and fame , is promised by the publishers for `` early
spring	DATE	. ''

		Some of the chief collaborators in the work of revision have been unavoidably delayed in furnishing their '' copy '' to the printer .

		Hence the retardation .

		A volume of timely interest is Mr.
Ernest Alfred Vizetelly	PERSON	's `` Republican
France	LOCATION	, 1870-1912 : Her Presi - dents , Statesmen , Policy , Vicissitudes and Social Life , '' which
Messrs. Small	ORGANIZATION	,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will have ready shortly .

		Mr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	's long residence in
France	LOCATION	and his relations with many distinguished Frenchmen have enabled him to write largely at first hand . ''

		Neale 's Monthly '' makes its entry into the maga - zine field with a first -LRB-
January	DATE	-RRB- issue containing much interesting matter , presented in well printed and illus - trated form .

		Of chief importance among the contents is the first of a series of five papers embodying the Italian reminiscences of Mrs.
Kinney	PERSON	, the mother of
Edmund Clarence Stedmau	PERSON	, and published under the editorship of Miss
Laura Stedmau	PERSON	and Dr.
George M. Gould	PERSON	.

		Another valuable feature is Dr.
Archibald Henderson	PERSON	's article on Colonel
Richard Henderson	PERSON	the first instalment of a series dealing with ''
Forerun	PERSON	- ners of the Republic . ''

		Several volumes of decided interest to be published at once by
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the following : `` Irish Plays and Playwrights , '' by Mr.
Cornelius Weygandt	PERSON	; '' Field Days in
California	LOCATION	, '' by the late
Bradford Torrey	ORGANIZATION	; `` A Wayfarer in
China	LOCATION	, '' by Miss
Elizabeth Kendall	PERSON	; `` Old Homes of New Americans , '' dealing with one phase of the immigration problem , by Dr.
Francis E. Clark	PERSON	; and '' Psychology and Industrial Efficiency , '' by Dr.
Hugo Miinsterberg	PERSON	.

		Professor
Josiah Royce	PERSON	, of
Harvard	LOCATION	, sailed recently for
England	LOCATION	where at
Oxford University	ORGANIZATION	he will deliver a series of lectures on `` The Real World and the
Chris	PERSON	- tian Ideas . ''

		These lectures will later be gathered together and those which Dr.
Royce	PERSON	delivered before the
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	on '' The Christian Doctrine of Life '' added to them , and the whole published in two volumes under the general title '' The Problem of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity . ''

		The work will probably appear in
April	DATE	.

		The rapidly-diminishing group of older American publishers has suffered another severe loss in the death , on
January 9	DATE	, of
James W. Mclntyre	PERSON	, of Little ,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Mclntyre	PERSON	had been identified with the book - selling and publishing business in
America	LOCATION	for nearly half a century , all but one year of this period being de - voted to the service of the
Boston	LOCATION	firm in which he has been a partner since
1897	DATE	.

		In addition to business ability of a high order , he was a capable literary scholar , and it is largely to his editorial skill and judgment that the various complete editions of standard authors issued by Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	owe their wide success .

		The Library of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	acquired in the year covered by its latest Report 120,664 printed books and pam - phlets , and has now 2,012,393 printed books and pam - phlets .

		The number of `` bound volumes , '' by which the great libraries of the world are commonly ranked in the order of their size , is not given ; but undoubtedly our national library is secure in its claim to stand third on the list , the
Bibliotheque Nationale	ORGANIZATION	and the British Mu - seum Library being its only superiors in point of bigness .

		As an illustration of the astonishing cumulative rate at which a library almost invariably grows , we note that since the opening of the century the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	has more than doubled in the size of its collection , a somewhat alarming rate of progress toward congestion in the stack-room .

		The arrangement between
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	and
the University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	, by which the latter is given the exclusive agency in the British Empire for the former 's publications , is now being supplemented by a reciprocal agreement , the
Chicago	LOCATION	institution taking over the American agency for a number of the Cam - bridge publications .

		An arrangement has already been concluded for the
Cambridge	LOCATION	journals , and the follow - ing periodicals in the future will be issued in
America	LOCATION	under joint imprint : '' Biornetrika , '' '' Parasitology , '' `` Journal of Genetics , '' `` The Journal of Hygiene , '' '' The Modern Language Review , '' '' The British Jour - nal of Psychology , '' and '' The Journal of Agricultural Science . ''

		Several new books from the
Cambridge	LOCATION	list are also to be taken over at once and published in this country under joint auspices .

		The list includes '' The Life and Letters of
Lord Hardwicke	PERSON	, '' by
M. Philip Chesney Yorke	PERSON	; `` The Duab of Turkestan , '' by W.
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 109 Rickmer Rickmers ; '' The History of Romanesque and Byzantine Architecture , '' by
Thomas Graham Jackson	PERSON	; and '' The
Genus Iris	PERSON	, '' by
William Rickatson Dykes	PERSON	.

		This movement toward a closer cooperation between the two universities is a matter that should be of in - terest to all who are concerned with the advancement of scientific and scholarly research and the preservation of its results .

		The difficulties involved in the publica - tion of such material are too obvious to need comment , and it is to be hoped that an arrangement that promises so much aid in this direction may be further extended .

		The Syndics of the
Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	pro- pose to publish a comprehensive History of
India	LOCATION	, from the earliest times to the present day , on the model of the ''
Cambridge Modern History	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The work , as pro- jected , will be completed in six volumes of about six hundred pages , two volumes being devoted to each of the main periods Ancient
India	LOCATION	,
Muhammadan India	LOCATION	, and British
India	LOCATION	, under the editorship , respectively , of Professor
E. J. Rapson	PERSON	, Lieut.-Col .

		T.
Wolseley Haig	ORGANIZATION	, I.S.C. , and Sir
Theodore Morison	PERSON	, K.C.I.E. .

		The vari - ous chapters in these sections will be entrusted to scholars who have made a special study of the period or subject ; and the Syndics hope , in this way , to produce a history of the nations of
India	LOCATION	past and present which shall take its place as the standard work .

		Professor of English Literature ,
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	.

		T -RRB- Y all students and teachers of English the announcement of Professor
Bronson	PERSON	's new work , * - * .

		AMERICAN POEMS , will be received with interest .

		The wide recognition of the merit of his ENGLISH POEMS is of itself a guaranty of the appreciation which this author 's work merits .

		In a volume of 680 pages the author has assembled a representative collection of the best work of American poets covering the period 1625-1892 .

		The selection in each case has been governed by scholarly discrimination , and is designed to show the individual , representative work of each poet .

		The poetry of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and the minor poetry of the nineteenth century are included , although more than half the space is given to the greater poets .

		The broad view thus afforded of the entire field of American poetry will help the student to an understanding of American life from the earliest Colonial times and to a juster appreciation of the greater nineteenth - century poets .

		The characters are intensely human and will live in the pages of this book as people you have known .

		`` The Parasite '' is a powerful revelation of human character and a phase of American social life .

		Of the life of
Sardou	ORGANIZATION	very little has been written in either French or English .

		As Mr.
Hart	PERSON	says , `` Nearly all of our knowledge of
Sardou	ORGANIZATION	's family and childhood , we owe to the veteran dramatist himself he confided to
Adolphe Brisson	PERSON	, of Le Temps some of his earliest recollections . ''

		In this thorough and exhaustive study of
Sardou	ORGANIZATION	's life and works , Mr.
Hart	PERSON	has gathered apparently all of the available data relative to the great dramatist .

		It is replete with anecdotes , and tells of
Sardou	ORGANIZATION	's youth and early struggles , his failures and eventually his great successes .

		The author has divided the book into three parts .

		The first is a biographical sketch ; the second is made up of analyses of some two score of the Sardou plays not critical but narrative analyses ; and the third is devoted to the
Sardou	ORGANIZATION	plays in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		151 A DREAM TO BE REALIZED .

		The action taken a fortnight ago by the direc - tors of the Art Institute of
Chicago	LOCATION	marks an epoch in the history of civic art , and the future will look back to it as one of the significant occurrences of the century .

		This action appro - priated the income of the
Ferguson	PERSON	fund for an indefinite number of years to come , applying it to the materialization of the grandiose sculptural conception which Mr.
Lorado Taf	PERSON	t has developed during many years of brooding upon the possi - bilities of the city beautiful .

		Since this project is of far more than local import , aiming at the creation of an artistic monument which shall be one of the most beautiful in the world , it deserves the widest publicity , and we take pleasure in out - lining the salient features of the undertaking .

		In the first place , the
Ferguson	PERSON	fund is an endowment of approximately
one million dollars	MONEY	, left in trust by the will of the donor , with the direction that the income be applied to the pur - pose of enhancing the attractiveness of
Chicago	LOCATION	to the lover of art and heaven knows that
Chicago	LOCATION	sorely needs this sort of assthetic stimu - lus or encouragement .

		Those who have lived here for twenty years or more cherish the mem - ory of the
White City	ORGANIZATION	which rose as an exhala - tion from the soil in
1893	DATE	, and drew all men 's eyes to its beauty .

		But that beauty was evanes - cent , and only its recollection is left us .

		The creative work now to be undertaken will be of the imperishable sort , relatively speaking , and will stand for the delight and wonder of future generations .

		It is obvious that the income from
a million dollars	MONEY	, applied year after year to the realization of a noble artistic dream , must accom - plish something noteworthy , and we may praise the wisdom of the trustees in thus deciding to concentrate their efforts upon a single great undertaking , instead of providing a picture or a statue here , and a park or a fountain there , in pursuance of the obligation laid upon them by the testator .

		They have clearly chosen the way to give the most impressive effect to the endow - ment under their charge .

		What is known in
Chicago	LOCATION	as the
Midway Plaisance	LOCATION	is a double boulevard , a mile in length , with a sunken lawn between the two drives , con - necting
Washington	LOCATION	and
Jackson Parks	LOCATION	.

		inally a link in the city 's system of inner parks 122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, it was diverted in
1893	DATE	, when
Jackson Park	LOCATION	on the lake shore became the site of the
White City	LOCATION	, to the uses of the sort of annex which every Exposition feels bound to provide for its more frivolously-minded visitors , and became a mile of side-shows , and '' villages , '' and other `` attrac - tions '' of the
Coney Island	LOCATION	type .

		`` Doing the Midway '' was at that time a popular diversion with old and young , and its entertaining devices were sharply contrasted with the educational exhibits and architectural glories of the
White City	LOCATION	proper .

		Afterwards , it was dismantled of its tawdry adornments , and restored to its right - ful uses .

		Meanwhile , the twenty years that have since elapsed have witnessed the growth , close upon its northern side , of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, which has acquired a large part of the frontage , and which has constructed , in a beau - tiful style of Gothic architecture , one of the most impressive groups of academic buildings in
America	LOCATION	.

		The Midway runs east and west , at a distance of about seven miles from the busi - ness heart of the city , and is , in its present un - developed condition , one of the most attractive sections of the
Chicago	LOCATION	parks .

		Of what it will become , when the project now in hand is completed , the following will convey some idea .

		Mr.
Taft	PERSON	's plan for the lasting beautification of this mile of park driveway comprises the following essential features : 1 .

		The sunken lawn between the two boulevards is to be flooded , an improvement of which the beauty is obvious , and of which the practical advantages for sport and recreation are by no means incon - siderable .

		2 .

		Three ornamental bridges are to carry the principal north and south avenues over the lagoon thus artificially created .

		These bridges are to be dedicated , respectively , to Science , Art , and Faith , and what can be done with them needs no explanation to those who know the famous bridges of
Paris	LOCATION	and other European capitals .

		3 .

		Flanking the line of driveway on either side , a series of statues of the great idealists of the world perhaps a hundred of them is planned , to make an Avenue of Fame , or a cosmopolitan
Valhalla	LOCATION	, and suggest to the most casual passer-by the thought of Thucydides : '' For the whole earth is the grave and monument of heroes ; it is not the mere graving upon marble in their native land which sets forth their deeds , but even in lands where they were strangers there lives an un - written record in every heart , felt though never embodied . ''

		4 .

		At the eastern end of this mile of monumental beauty , there is to be a great fountain representing the creation of man as symbolized in the Deukalion myth .

		Here , in his embodiment of '' The unwrought shapes , the unmoulded attitudes , The tongues of earth , the stony craving eyes , '' here , in this casting backward of '' The big seed Deukalion and Pyrrha sowed in hope To reap in terror ; the scarce-featured sons Of stone , and daughters of the sullen glebe , '' Mr.
Taft	PERSON	should have an opportunity worthy of the genius of
Rodin	LOCATION	.

		It was in
Chicago	LOCATION	, a few years ago , that a great poet clothed this myth with the glory of immortal verse , why may it not be given to a
Chicago	LOCATION	sculptor to achieve in his own medium an equal beauty of expres - sion ?

		5 .

		At the western end , matching the
Fountain of Deukalion	ORGANIZATION	, is to be another colossal group a
Fountain of Time	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here ,
Time	ORGANIZATION	, a rugged crag-like figure , will review the proces - sion of humanity , surging past him like the waves of the ocean , '' hurrying and crowding toward a goal they can not see . ''

		The sculptor has thus conceived this group : '' A warrior on horseback , flanked by banners and dancing figures , forms the centre of the composition , which fades off at the ends into creeping infancy or the bent and withered figures of age .

		The procession will seem to rise from a great jet of water on one side and sink from sight at the other ,
Time	ORGANIZATION	meanwhile standing firm and immovable .

		There is a suggestion of joyous onward movement in this procession and of the splendor and pageantry which life has achieved since that first great day of creation which the other fountain cele - brates . ''

		And the spirit of it all is perfectly expressed by this motto from
Austin Dobson	PERSON	: '' Time goes , you say ?

		Ah , no , Alas ,
Time	ORGANIZATION	stays ; we go . ''

		It will be many years before this vast dream can be realized , and possibly it may never be realized in full , but if it is , the eyes of the world will be drawn to the scene of so much beauty , and men will make toilsome journeys for the joy of beholding it .

		At present , the authorities concerned are not committed to the plan in its entirety , and only the
Fountain of Time	ORGANIZATION	is im - mediately projected .

		But we can hardly believe that when that feature of the plan shall have become fact it will be left as a fragment of the larger scheme .

		What is more likely is that it will so impose itself upon the sense of its be - holders as to create an imperative demand for the completion of the whole work .

		That such may be the outcome is the hope of all those whose thought has penetrated the significance of Mr.
Taft	PERSON	's creative conception , and who have confi - dence in his possession of the genius necessary to work it out .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 123 MODERNITY IN LITERATURE AND THE NEXT MO VEMENT .

		The last great world-encircling '' cry '' in litera - ture is stilled .

		The tumult and the shoutings of the captains of '' realism '' have died away .

		Of course there never was any such thing as realism .

		The good books produced by that movement do not differ in essentials from the good books evolved by any other recipe or formula invented by men .

		But some formula seems always to be needed as a rallying cry for authors and artists .

		And readers are thrown into buzzing excitement , as bees are summoned to swarm by the beating of a brazen kettle .

		The world-wide roar of the realistic movement has broken up into a hundred , a thousand , noises and motions .

		We are in the midst of whirlpools and eddies and waters that sway back and forth and seem to have no order or discipline or determined end .

		It is a day of individualism , naturalism , neo - romanticism , symbolism , revolutionary nihilism , sex celebration and sex enmity , social frivolity and nature seriousness , all these doctrines and dogmas and a myriad more are cried up .

		The prophets of unrighteousness have their innings and the defenders of law are dumb .

		The most rapidly disseminated philosophy of recent times , that of
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, is an invocation to chaos .

		`` Is civilization a failure and is the Caucasian played out ? ''

		In default of any better term , these whirlings and blind motions of literature and art in the present may be called modernity .

		Modishness is its note .

		It aspires to be '' brand new , '' up to date , '' right off the bat . ''

		More decisively even than realism it tries to break with the past .

		It has an utter lack of rev - erence for the great work or established reputations of the past .

		It says to Homer and
Dante	PERSON	and Shake - speare : '' Go to !

		We are as good as you . ''

		Its atti - tude might be typified by the story of an old English dauber , an imitator of
Titian	ORGANIZATION	, who , staring in ecstasy at one of his own canvases , exclaimed : `` What would old Tit think of this ? ''

		The most curious feature of our passing madness is that we believe we have recreated a whole world of art and art-forms out of our own heads .

		Yet the fact remains that nothing in our recent output is new .

		In spite of the contortions and struggles of our novelists and playwrights and poets to be strong , to be daring , to be extreme , there is nothing that they utter which will compare in these qualities with much of the literature of the past .

		Take the exploitation of sexual passion and vice by which our contemporaries try to shock us .

		`` Mrs.
Warren	PERSON	's Profession '' is milk and water beside the strong meat of '' Measure for Measure '' or '' Peri - cles . ''

		`` Three Weeks '' has no standing at all as an aphrodisiac compared with
Afra Behn	PERSON	or Ca - sanova .

		The soiled heroes and heroines of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's later novels are mere doves compared with the people in Fielding and
Smollett	PERSON	and the Restor - ation comedy .

		Or take the studies of extreme low life which have been vaunted as a novelty of late .

		The thing has been done far more vividly and ex - plicitly by
Defoe	PERSON	, not to go out of a single age or country .

		It is hard to beat ''
Moll Flanders	PERSON	'' or `` Colonel
Jack	PERSON	. ''

		As for revolutionary literature , literature which proposes to itself to upset old exist - ing laws and conventions , what is the matter with
Schiller	PERSON	's '' Robbers , '' or with a great part of
Burns	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	, and
Shelley	PERSON	?

		Turning to the initiation of new art methods , symbolism is of course as old as the hills .


Europe	LOCATION	was saturated with it in the middle ages , and it created in the `` Divine Comedy , '' the `` Faerie Queene , '' and the '' Roman de la Rose '' works more monumental certainly than anything of recent date .

		Even Novalis 's `` Blue Flower '' of a century ago is less platitudinous than
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's `` Blue Bird . ''

		Our new romanticism , where it is suffered to bloom at all , is rather a frail offshoot of an older stock ; and the return to nature was preached and practiced better in a former age .

		On the whole , modernity does not seem to be either greatly original or overwhelmingly powerful .

		Yet it has been of advantage to the world in breaking up the serried ranks of realism , scattering the varied talents and giving a loose to individuality .

		It might be compared to the `` dynamite plowing '' now com - ing into vogue , which brings up a new surface to our farms .

		But something more than mere dis - turbances of dirt is needed to produce crops .

		Sun - light , air , and rain are the permanent and universal factors in agriculture .

		Is it fanciful to suggest that there are spiritual analogues to these same factors in farming , that ideal elements enter into life and art from above ; that beauty , grace , grandeur , and sublimity are some of these elements ; that they have been allowed little chance to work upon , to aerate and elevate modern literature ; and finally that there is a hope , almost a promise , that this ideal contin - gent is about to swoop down upon our art and carry it to new heights ?

		The present writer has never been able to accept the theory that beauty is the be-all and the end-all of art .

		One of the earliest and best expositions of this theory is to be found in
Schiller	PERSON	's '' ^ Esthetic Letters . ''

		Briefly stated ,
Schiller	PERSON	's idea is that art springs from man 's profound dissatisfaction with ordinary life .

		Because of this dissatisfaction he reverts to the play instinct , the make-believe of child - hood , and fashions for himself a world where every - thing is harmonious , where beauty reigns supreme .

		In the first place , to criticize this , it is remarkable how little the beautiful or the harmonious comes into the play instinct or make-believe of childhood .

		Children are little mirrors , they satirically mock the doings of their elders ; and things of fear and horror have a fascination for them .

		You can not please them better than to frighten them as a bear or wolf .

		Punch and
Judy	PERSON	, with their hideousness and brutality , exercise a perennial charm over them which Greek statues and Shakespearean comedies would fail to rival .

		When they begin to read , the literature they affect is the odd , the quaint , the ex .

		124 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, travagant , and the bizarre , as witness `` Mother Goose , '' ''
Alice	PERSON	in
Wonderland	LOCATION	, '' and
Grimm	PERSON	's Fairy Tales .

		No , the root of beauty is certainly not in the childish mind .

		In the second place , no sooner has
Schiller	PERSON	set forth his position that beauty is the first and final cause of art than he is compelled to divide it into two kinds , a calm and graceful beauty , and a vivid and energetic one .

		A little later on he has to drag in the Sublime ; and in his discussions with Goethe he comes to the conclusion that the characteristic and the significant are factors in art co-equal with beauty itself .

		He ends , therefore , with a complex with which he might as well have begun .

		All art appeals to the feelings , the emotions , and the im - agination .

		We feel , are moved by , and imagine many other things beside beauty .

		The majority of men are more profoundly affected by things of fear and horror than they ever are by those of beauty .

		Nevertheless , ideas of beauty , and the cognate ideas of grandeur and sublimity , are good for us to consider and to live with .

		Else there were no growth , no ascent in life , only a dull plodding on in a level round or a downward slope to the abyss .

		But mod - ern literature has done its best to banish these ideas .

		It has fashioned idols for itself as ugly as the fetiches of
South Sea	LOCATION	islanders .

		It has made a law that one subject is as good as another , and that only execution counts .

		It has gone further , and turned its back on all that mankind had previously judged to be attrac - tive and desirable , and has dived and delved into purlieus and places of no regard .

		It has pushed aside the palaces and gardens and brought forth the alleys and the tenements .

		Swamps , deserts , barren farmsteads , factory-ridden suburbs , are its delighted haunts .

		And the human creations with which it peoples these abodes are suited to their surroundings .

		Now execution , if it is the execution of a genius , can do a great deal , but it is just as well to have material to begin with .

		There are hierarchies and ranks and gradations of interest in both nature and humanity .

		A rich and varied life to deal with is half the battle in art .

		If a great writer can not get anything better than
Walden Pond	LOCATION	to celebrate , he may yet make something of it ; but there are more possibilities in
Lake Como	LOCATION	.

		But the trend of modern literature towards not only the second best , but towards the worst in life , is all but universal .

		A few poets and mystics have stood out for beauty , nobility , and charm , but the greater part of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	has been submerged by the ugly , the abnormal , the unclean , and the merely dull .

		Dickens was the last absolutely great creative artist of
England	LOCATION	.

		But for beauty he substituted picturesqueness , for charm the unflagging vivacity of animal spirits .

		His defi - ciency in the higher qualities makes him lag second in the race with
Scott	PERSON	for the primacy of the English novel , though probably dowered with greater crea - tive genius .

		In the modern world there have been two great epochs when the
Spirit of Beauty	ORGANIZATION	waved its wand before the eyes of man and made him see visions and wonders .

		The first of these was the
Renais	PERSON	- sance , beginning with
Dante	PERSON	and
Petrarch	PERSON	and cul - minating in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	, with its bead-roll of mighty painters , architects , and artists of all kinds .

		In this epoch what man woke to realize was his own beauty and splendor and magnificence .

		He peered deep enough into the glooms and shadows of his life , but he was chiefly interested in its glories .

		The second awakening began with
Rousseau	PERSON	and was continued by
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	, and a great line of landscape painters .

		It revealed the outward world of nature , and for a while humanity was intoxicated with the glories of its temporal home .

		Literature to-day has about exhausted the common and the chaotic .

		Pretty nearly all the dull and dis - agreeable places of the world have been discovered and exploited ; pretty nearly all the diseases and disgraces and brutalities and banalities of human nature have been tabulated and typified .

		It is time that the Spirit of Beauty should again put forth her power and impel art to a new advance .

		Ideals of harmony and happiness should be reinstated in the human mind as possibilities , at least , of possession .

		Design , order , distinction , should set their seals again on literary work .

		Will the Spirit of Democracy oppose the
Spirit of Beauty	ORGANIZATION	?

		I do not think so .

		It was the mob of a democratic city which carried
Cimabue	ORGANIZATION	's picture in triumph through the streets .

		It was the workers , craftsmen , masons , laborers , who gave the work of their hands and their means to the building of the cathedrals of
Europe	LOCATION	, and who felt repaid by the glory of the growing fanes .

		Democ - racy may have a passion for art ; and even if this were not so , we are not all going to be democratized into pigs .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		PLEASIXG THE PLAY-GOER is commonly the first object of the theatre-manager ; and the average play - goer 's taste in drama is not accounted very refined .

		Yet there are not wanting signs that good , wholesome plays , plays even that are ranked as classic , are what the people really desire , if they are given a fair chance to indicate their preference .

		One recent noteworthy sign of this encouraging sort is found in the increasing success of the municipally owned and conducted theatre at
Northampton	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, where the works of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, and other masters , are received with genuine enjoyment by the inhabitants of that
New England	LOCATION	manufacturing and trading town , which at the same time , it will not be forgotten , is something of an educational centre , with its
Smith College	ORGANIZATION	, its
Forbes Library	ORGANIZATION	, and other institutions of literature and learning .

		It is but four months ago that this first and only municipal play - house in
America	LOCATION	entered upon its present policy of appealing to the people for its support in maintain - ing a good stock company with a repertory of only
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 125 the best that dramatic literature has to offer ; and already the
Northampton	LOCATION	public has been educated up to the high purpose of this praiseworthy venture , and now the pecuniary receipts are exceeding the expenses of the undertaking , even with a very low scale of prices for seats .

		The play-goers themselves are consulted as to what plays shall be presented , and they are even invited to attend rehearsals and to go behind the scenes and make any useful sug - gestions .

		It is related , indeed , that when a fear was expressed lest too much expense was being lavished on scenery , the scene-painter transferred his canvas and colors to the open street and there demonstrated how quickly and cheaply a ball-room interior could be converted into a mountain landscape .

		The first families , we are told , vie with one another in offering the use of such properties and costumes as their an - cestral homes and well-filled wardrobes may contain .

		Really the whole thing is almost too good to be true , but our personal acquaintance with
Northampton	LOCATION	inclines us to believe it is true .

		Though not all towns can boast a population of so high average intelligence as is there to be found , yet it may be not too wild a dream to picture the municipal theatre as some day no rarer a sight , in cities of some size , than the public library , the art gallery , the museum , and the zo5logical garden .

		PROFESSOR EITCKEN ON GOETHE , as briefly re - ported by Mr.
Frank B. Sanborn	PERSON	for the
Springfield	LOCATION	'' Republican , '' will interest those who were unable to attend the eminent German scholar 's
Lowell Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tute lectures , just concluded .

		Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	writes : `` Dr.
Rudolph Eucken	PERSON	closed
this evening	TIME	his course of seven discourses on philosophic idealism and realism , in which two were especially noteworthy on
Kant	PERSON	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, the latter considered as a philosopher , in which character he rather declined to appear .

		Goethe was fundamentally a poet , and only a philos - opher by his second intention , so to speak ; and nat - urally his philosophy was often poetically expressed .

		There was a broad field , however , outside of both poetry and philosophy technically considered , in which
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	was both a ` Spazierganger , ' or tourist , and a ` Lustwandler , ' or park-prom enader ; in this field many sciences and arts were included .

		In some of these he was a student , even a discoverer ; in others merely on parade .

		Under all these , as under his verse and his dramatic and novel composition , lay his ground conception of the universe , of Nature , and of life ; and to these Professor
Eucken	PERSON	gave his chief attention .

		Consequently the great variety and versatility of the poet were but glanced at ; his love of pleasure and of pleasure-giving , through art , were touched upon as parts of the apparatus for self-culture , to which he recalled the vaguely wandering enthu - siasm of
Germany	LOCATION	, while he delighted his country - men by songs and epigrams .

		Several of these the lecturer quoted in German , though the body of the lectures was in English , with which , as a language for reading , he is very familiar .

		He is not much accustomed to English elocution , however , and could not easily be followed , from his inflections and em - phasis , which were German rather than American .

		His voice is good , his presence attractive , with ruddy face , white hair and beard , and a quick , spirited manner of attacking his sentences . ''

		NOVELS READ BY NOVELISTS in their moments of leisure ought to bear some relation , if one knew what it was , to the novels written by them .

		Does the rule of the attraction of opposites hold here , or the law that `` like will to like , '' or both , or neither ?

		The
London	LOCATION	`` Book Monthly '' recently printed a collection of solicited communications on the subject of women novelists ' favorite reading .

		Some of these letters , whose writers are themselves novelists of the fair sex , remind one of the self-sufficient young au - thor 's declaration , '' I do n't read books , I write 'em . ''

		But in general the correspondents show themselves to be great readers .

		Miss
Elinor Glyn	PERSON	writes , `` in great haste , '' that she hardly ever reads a novel from one year 's end to another , and gives no indication that she is attracted to other forms of literature .

		Miss
Beatrice Harraden	PERSON	reads `` chiefly biography now - adays '' ; another professes herself `` an incurable novel-reader , '' never tiring of
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	and
Jane Austen	PERSON	, and able to read `` Kim '' over and over again with enjoyment ; still another puts Fielding first among her fiction favorites , with
Richardson	PERSON	a `` far-away second , '' and
Wilkie Collins	PERSON	's `` Moon - stone '' in the front rank as a `` thriller . ''

		`` But far above all novels , '' she concludes , `` for pure interest and living excitement I put mental science in any shape or form , from Professor
James	PERSON	's ` Varieties of Religious Experience ' down to the proceedings of the
Psychical Research Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		Particularly fasci - nating to me are all works dealing with the most uncanny subject in the world , multiple personality .

		For a sedative there is nothing better than a memoir ; .

		and for a tonic , Professor
Bergson	PERSON	, or such a modern poet as Mr.
James Mackereth	PERSON	.

		And when English sentiment is too luscious I turn to
Anatole France	LOCATION	and his ` Gospel of Irony , ' but for a sense of space and peace to the Greek plays . ''

		Thus declares
Miss M. P. Willcocks	PERSON	.

		USE AND ABUSE OF PRIVATE PAPERS deposited in public libraries are considerations governing the freedom of access allowed to such papers .

		In con - nection with the recent acquisition of important col - lections of this sort by the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- we note especially the
Louise Chandler Moulton	PERSON	papers , comprising letters from many famous authors , living and dead -RRB- , a few timely words find place in the cur - rent annual report of the librarian .

		Good faith and seriousness of purpose must be evident in the appli - cant for permission to consult manuscripts . ''

		Papers of recent date are naturally kept from general inspec - tion more rigidly than collections of very old manu - scripts .

		Letters of or concerning people still living are guarded with the greatest care , lest they be mis - used ... This policy is required , not only in the 126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, interest of sound historical science , as opposed to sen - sationalism , but also in the interest of the
Library	ORGANIZATION	's efforts to obtain collections of historical papers .

		Owners of collections of family papers naturally feel a reluctance to part with them , if they believe that when deposited with the Library , they must become accessible to every enquirer .

		The reluctance disap - pears , however , when it is known that judgment is exercised in permitting entrance to the collections . ''

		It is to be noted that the custodian of these manu - script treasures at
Washington	LOCATION	is troubled with few applications from those whose discretion can not be relied upon , and few complaints are made of undue severity in the restrictions none at all by scholars familiar with the rules governing the use of manu - scripts in other institutions .

		THE EDUCATIONAL USE OF CURRENT NEWS AND REVIEWS , as such news and reviews are to be found in some of the best of our periodicals , is gaining recognition in public schools of the higher grades , in schools of journalism , and elsewhere .

		One well - known weekly publication of this character takes justifiable pride in the fact that it has been selected as a means of instruction in current history and liter - ature by a number of teachers and school superin - tendents in various cities , and it issues an interesting account of the methods adopted in using this some - what novel form of textbook , with testimonials from a number of teachers .

		The superintendent of the
New York City	LOCATION	schools said lately in a circular letter to teachers : `` It will be well for the teacher to make use of recent or contemporary literature .

		Many pupils have a not unnatural suspicion of * classics . '

		They have a natural interest in what other people are reading and talking about .

		They should be induced to read the better magazines . '' ''

		A high - school teacher , after naming other good re - sults following upon the use of current periodical literature in the classroom , adds : '' The dictionary and encyclopaedia are becoming live books because they help to throw light upon live questions .

		The real importance and meaning of culture is being appreciated because of the discovery of the bearing which the world 's accumulation of knowledge has upon the everyday events of our own time . ''

		Incident - ally , action and reaction being equal and opposite , this educational use of periodical literature ought to lift the periodical press to a somewhat higher level and keep it there .

		THE TREND OF THE BRITISH BOOK-TRADE is Still upward , in respect to quantity , whatever its quality may be .

		Statistics for the past year show an increase of more than a thousand titles over the year before in the number of books published , or a sum total of nearly thirteen thousand for
1912	DATE	.

		That the novel has not yet entered upon the decline lately predicted for it by certain would-be prophets , seems to be indi - cated by the presence on the list of nearly twenty - three hundred fiction-titles , an increase of about three hundred over the preceding year .

		Next to the novel the favorite with the British reader is the religious book , and he has had a choice of 934 such works among the year 's new books , so that if he felt him - self undergoing moral deterioration from too much novel-reading he had at hand a ready antidote to the pleasant poison ; and , conversely , the sermon-reader , nodding at length over the '' sixthlies '' and '' seventh - lies '' of his favorite divine , had always within easy reach an abundance of lighter and livelier literature .

		The sciences , the arts , and the industries were all well represented in the twelve months ' book-product .

		How long it will be before the tide turns and the pres - ent too-rapid rate of increase in book-manufacture gives place to a more wholesome retrenchment , re - mains to be seen .

		One good book issued in an edi - tion of ten thousand copies is , as a rule , of greater benefit to all concerned than ten books of lesser worth published in editions of a thousand copies each .

		But this curtailment of output may be a thing now past hoping for .

		... ONE LIBRARY 'S NEEDS , that library being the
Enoch Pratt	PERSON	Free Library of
Baltimore	LOCATION	, are stated plainly and in some detail by Dr.
Bernard C. Steiner	PERSON	, the librarian , in his annual report to the trustees lately assembled in yearly conclave .

		As in the case of some other public institutions , it might be shorter and simpler to state what the
Baltimore	LOCATION	library does not need than to enumerate its defi - ciencies of equipment .

		A new central building , or a very considerable addition to the present structure , will occur to everyone who has visited the library as its most urgent want .

		`` The last year , '' says Dr.
Steiner	PERSON	, `` has brought nearer the time when it will be impossible to have any more books in the
Central Library	ORGANIZATION	, which is greatly over-crowded .

		We do not see any possibility of placing a sufficient additional number of shelves anywhere in the building to accommodate any considerable number of books . ''

		New branch buildings are also wanted , and more money for books , and an increased appropriation for maintenance , and an extension of the open-shelf system , which will of course be another item of expense , and , in fact , quantities of things that every modern library needs and that every municipal appropriations-committee grudgingly grants .

		Will the progressive public library ever cease to remind us of the horseleech 's insatiate daughters ?

		Let us hope not .

		... A YOUNG ENGLISH POET 'S VISIT TO
AMERICA	LOCATION	is an occasion of interest to all concerned , especially when the poet is of the standing of the gifted Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	, whose welcome to
Boston	LOCATION	is just now being planned by the
Authors ' Club	ORGANIZATION	and other soci - eties and individuals of that seat of culture and learn - ing .

		The
Wellesley College	ORGANIZATION	students and faculty are to have the pleasure of hearing him read from his own poems on the twenty-seventh of this month , and other readings elsewhere are in prospect .

		Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	's early attainment of recognition for his work is noteworthy .

		The magazines and reviews were hospitable to him from the first , and his initial vol -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 127 ume of verse , `` The Loom of Years , '' appeared when he was but twenty-two years old , soon to be followed by his ``
Robin Hood	PERSON	, '' `` Flowers of Old
Japan	LOCATION	, '' and other works .

		The writing of the life of
William Morris	PERSON	for the '' English Men of Letters '' series was assigned to him .

		... COOPERATION BETWEEN SCHOOL BOARD AND LIBRARY BOARD is becoming more and more the order of the day .

		An interesting account of what is effected in that particular at
Grand Rapids	LOCATION	is published by the public library of that city .

		In addition to the school collections of books for the use of the school children , there are now in operation six regular branch libraries in as many school build - ings , established by joint agreement of the two boards concerned , the one supplying the necessary quarters with heat , light , and janitor service , the other fur - nishing books , periodicals , card-catalogue , attendants , free lectures , and weekly story hour .

		Some of these branch libraries have as many as three thousand books on their shelves , with current periodicals to the number of twenty-five or thirty , and the com - bined circulation of all the school branches was last year nearly a third of a million .

		MR.
HAROLD MONRO	PERSON	AND HIS POETRY SHOP are objects of interest in the
London	LOCATION	book world just now , and it is to be hoped by poetry-lovers that the interest will continue .

		Mr.
Monro	PERSON	offers something novel in the bookselling business in the form of a bookshop devoted wholly to poetry a poetry shop , as he calls it off
Theobald	PERSON	's Road ,
Bloomsbury	LOCATION	; and one of his brother poets , Mr.
Henry Newbolt	PERSON	, has wished the daring enterprise prosperity in a speech .

		In this interesting shop are to be found shelves devoted each to a particular poet of some prominence , while the lesser bards , the poets of a single slender volume , are , we assume , assembled in pleasant company .

		But no friend to the poets can wish these volumes a peaceful repose ; rather , may they speedily give place to others , with an accom - panying transfer of the currency of the realm to Mr.
Monro	PERSON	's cash-drawer .

		... THE
HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS	ORGANIZATION	has been established by vote of the President and
Fellows of Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, and will devote itself to the publication of works of a high scholarly character , especially the products of the pens of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	men .

		For some time the
University	ORGANIZATION	printing office has issued the annual catalogue and certain department pamphlets , with a number of learned periodicals .

		COMMUNICATION .

		THE REFERENDUM IN ART .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I should like to say a word on one point in Professor
Cockerell	PERSON	's letter in your last number .

		I must confess that I have not much claim to be heard , for I do not think the matter as important as he does .

		The picture made very little impression upon me when I first saw it , but it impressed him so that he was quite upset for at least three hours .

		I can not claim his earnestness .

		Still , as he is going to make a mistake , I want to act the part of
Cassandra	LOCATION	.

		It will be for others to defend the picture if they see fit .

		Professor
Cockerell	PERSON	thinks it immoral because bad , and bad because immoral -LRB- '' essentially bad , and there - fore immoral '' ; `` good taste based on fundamental morality '' -RRB- .

		This may be so , but the view expressed in Professor
Cockerell	PERSON	's letter is not convincing on first thoughts .

		He thinks the features of the lady awry and the colors lurid and unnatural .

		But the features of almost everybody are a little awry , I am told , and the colors in many not immoral homes are a little lurid and unnatural . ''

		The White Rose '' may be exaggerated , but the old story in the
Fourth Reader	ORGANIZATION	teaches us that exaggeration , even coarseness in execution , may be one of the necessities of art .

		The really important thing , however , is the summary of postcards .

		The result of this inquirendo will be as follows : There will be a number of persons with views like Professor
Cockerell	PERSON	's who will write to him at once .

		There will be a slightly smaller number who are opposed to him who will write , on the whole , a little later .

		These two classes will be controversialists , and their opinions will not be of value , except for students of that branch of un-Systematic Zoology known as
Human Nature	ORGANIZATION	.

		There will also be a number of genuine impressions from people interested in the question itself .

		There will not be enough of these to `` be more than a contri - bution to aesthetic material , but the proportion will be somewhat in favor of those who do not like the picture .

		If one could get a really representative opinion , the inquiry would be of value .

		If Professor
Cockerell	PERSON	desires a representative opinion , that is , if he thinks the question of importance , if he will be a scientist out of his chair as well as in it , if he is doing more than starting a magazine discussion , he should , I believe , go about it in another way .

		He ought to cut the picture out of the '' Century '' and stick it on a piece of paste board , with a pencil attached to it by a string , and then go about
Boulder	LOCATION	, and make a nuisance of himself by asking everybody to say how the picture affected them when first seen .

		Or he might show them the picture , and himself note their behavior .

		When he had five hundred or a thousand impressions he would have something unique in aesthetic , and of great value to anyone who knew how to use it .

		May I add that I approve highly of the general prin - ciple of the Referendum in Art , as well as in Politics .

		The true aesthetic value of anything must be measured by the permanent impression made upon the greatest number .

		-LRB- This , I believe , is the view of
Marshall	PERSON	: `` Pain , Pleasure , and Esthetics '' ; and
Santayana	PERSON	: `` The Sense of Beauty '' ; and also , with pragmatic attachment , of
Walter Pater	PERSON	, at the end of his essay on Style . -RRB-

		128 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, THE KINGDOM OF RIGHTEOUSNESS IN AMERICAN LIFE .

		* Dr.
Rauschenbusch	PERSON	's `` Christianity and the Social Crisis , '' published some five years ago , met a need among thinking people so adequately that one was inclined to agree with the author that he had '' said all that God had given him to say on our social problems . ''

		Yet his new book , `` Christianizing the Social Order , '' proves a work of hardly less importance .

		The first book was an historic survey ; it re - viewed the roots in Judaism of a socialized democracy , the blossoming of the ideal in the Teachings of Jesus , the hampered development in Christian history ; and it led to a discussion of the modern duty to realize Christianity on the social side .

		Almost at that point the present book takes up the theme , expanding and sup - plementing the treatment of the ideas of Jesus , but carrying the fundamental theme of the Kingdom of Righteousness out into the very midst of our complexities and bewilderments .

		In some ways it is a better book than the other .

		The writing is more brilliant .

		The animus against a sacramental and sacerdotal form of Christianity which seemed to some readers to mar the impartiality of `` Christianity and the Social Crisis '' is less in evidence .

		There is persuasive sanity , force in concrete application , and uncompromising courage .

		Of the earlier work it has been said that it is a book without any hate in it .

		`` So far as I know my own soul that is true of this book also , '' says the author .

		The claim is just .

		Yet many a page is aglow with the '' wrath of the Lamb . ''

		Dr.
Rauschenbusch	PERSON	has an exceptional command of sardonic speech .

		Perhaps it is a power given by fearless honesty .

		At all events , the trenchant phrases dissipate self-deception and dislodge conscience from many an easy refuge .

		The driving directness renders thought of literary qualities insignifi - cant ; yet the author is master of an individual style , admirable in cogency and actuality , rich in metaphor `` pris sur le vif . ''

		In spite of an occasional lapse from dignity , the colloquialisms used are usually effective .

		Perhaps the book deals too much with transitory and technical matters to be literature in the highest sense ; but many of the best qualities that create liter - ature are found in it .

		The recent awakening of nation and Church * CHRISTIANIZING THE SOCIAL OBDBR .

		By
Walter Rauschenbusch	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		is first presented in a way that will bring home to many in and out of the churches how far organized religion has deliberately travelled in a radical direction ; how far it stands committed both to responsibility for social leadership and to a definite economic programme of an advanced type .

		`` The social interest in the
Church	ORGANIZATION	has now run beyond the stage of the solitary pioneer ; it has been admitted within the organ - izations . ''

		An inspiriting review , communion by communion , suggests both how general is the awakening and how great the waiting task .

		A note of suspense is struck with characteristic candor in the following : '' I confess that my faith falters in the very act of professing it .

		The possibilities are so vast , so splendid , so far-reaching , so contradictory of all historic prece - dent , that my hope may be doomed to failure .

		The American Churches may write one more chapter in the long biography of the disappointed Christ , which our sons will read with shame and our enemies with scorn .

		But for the present the East is aflame with the day of
Jehovah	ORGANIZATION	, and a thousand voices are calling .

		If failure comes , may it find our sword broken at the hilt . ''

		In Part II. , `` The Revolutionary Destiny of Christianity , '' we return to the firm foundation of the social teachings of Jesus .

		The facile platitudes to which these teachings are reduced by the sentimentalist meet with summary dis - posal : `` Love , '' left in helpless liquidity , `` It is indeed love that we want , but it is socialized love '' ; `` Stewardship , '' calling for no change in economic distribution , but simply for faithful disbursement of funds ; '' The Golden Rule , '' a span measure `` hardly long enough to survey and lay out the building site of the
New Jeru	LOCATION	- salem '' ; the impossible call to literal imitation of the life of Jesus .

		The inadequacy of all these `` truly religious ideas '' leaves the demand for a religious basis to our task still unanswered .

		Such basis Dr.
Rauschenbusch	PERSON	finds in the con - ception of the Kingdom of God .

		With fresh force , albeit traversing ground familiar in his first book , he points out the essentially social and practical nature of this ideal as it lay in the Mind of Jesus .

		Is it possible that he belittles unduly the Apocalyptic element in the
Master	ORGANIZATION	's thought ?

		Must we dismiss this element , so prominent in the Gospels , as a misreading of His mind or an unfortunate survival ?

		Or may we see here , under local limitations , a strangely wise perception that social development depends not only on quiet growth but on visible catas - trophe , and that as
Kropotkin	PERSON	claims , revolu - tionary crises are a necessary part of evolution ?

		Viewed in this light , the most perplexing factor in the faith of the early Church gains permanent
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 129 meaning and value .

		At all events , the idea of the Reign of Righteousness on earth shines out concrete and majestic from these pages .

		The eclipse of this idea , and the necessity that it be restored to the personal religion of the future , is then briefly sketched .

		How sharp the contrast between that social vision and the reality !

		In Part III. , '' Our Semi - Christian Social Order , '' honesty as well as optimism have full sweep .

		It dwells first on the social domains which have slowly and painfully come under the sway of
Christ	LOCATION	's Law : the family , the
Church	ORGANIZATION	itself , education , and save the mark !

		politics .

		`` I confess to some mis - givings in moving that this brother be received among the regenerate , but I plead on his behalf that he is a newly-saved sinner . ''

		A good case is made out , by an interesting argument ; yet the reader feels that the author has been hard put to it if he must adduce `` this brother '' as a witness .

		He is obliged to confess that '' in prac - tice we are a nation of backsliders '' ; yet `` these things are in the nature of a derailment of justice , the road bed and the trackage are still there even when the train is ditched . ''

		Fortified , we turn to the '' unregenerate sections '' of our common life .

		This book is con - structive , yet more than 160 pages go to pure indictment ; and even when we turn from '' The Invasion of God 's Country '' to `` The Direction of Progress , '' indignation calls us back .

		In the attempt to write most positively , the pen lingers , tipped with acid or fire , over all that hampers our Christian will .

		The discussion covers sadly familiar ground , but in a manner so fresh and pungent that the most jaded mind finds its reaction from our modern sins sharp - ened and focussed .

		The point of view is
Chris	PERSON	- tian , not economic : `` Does our business system create sound and noble manhood ?

		Does it make it fairly easy to do right and hard to do wrong ?

		Does it call men upward or tempt them down - ward ? ''

		Answers are obvious ; the treatment is ironic ^ unsparing , fully cognizant of individual helplessness , yet none the less never blinking the moral responsibility of each of us to help the collective action which shall release us from our collective chains .

		`` Such power on the one hand and such weakness on the other constitute a solicitation to sin to which human nature ought never to be subjected . '' ''

		A reign of competi - tion is a reign of fear .

		... A reign of fear is never a reign of God . ''

		Such are some among the terse summaries of the outcome of capitalism .

		One , is tempted to cull quotations , to dwell on the caustic presentation of facts .

		Facts about adulteration : `` A new process makes an emul - sion of skim milk for ice-cream that looks like the richest kind of cream .

		That ought to be a great saving to the country .

		But this is a hymn of many verses .

		We must chant the rest on the Day of Judgment . ''

		Facts about the muzzling of the press .

		And facts about education : '' The great givers are acting like a soft pedal on the piano .

		There is probably not a teacher with a real message to our age who has not felt com - pelled by consideration for himself and his insti - tution to soften and dull down the very things that most demand utterance . ''

		These be plain words , my brethren : they afford pleasant read - ing , heart-breaking thinking .

		All is free from hysteria or over-statement .

		When Dr.
Rauschenbusch	PERSON	has finished marshalling his evidence , `` The Case of Christianity against Capitalism '' is complete .

		It has been complete this many a year ; and one turns eagerly to the later constructive dis - cussion , as to how a Christian economic order should be constituted .

		Perhaps slight disap - pointment awaits one .

		There is a drop , as the author is aware , from the high levels of religious thought to schemes for protecting the laborer , socializing land , guaranteeing employment .

		These ideas , the usual programme of economic advance , are unluckily losing their freshness almost before they get out into life .

		But as the sure fight gathers round them they will regain it .

		Meantime , the descent from religious passion to a precise programme of reform is one phase of that voluntary self-humiliation of the divine which is the world 's salvation .

		At least , the dis - cussion does not satisfy itself with easy truisms .

		The elasticity and modesty of mind are refresh - ing .

		`` There is only one thing which I am pre - pared to assert with absolute confidence about coming events : that they will not happen in the way I expect them to happen . ''

		Yet the pro- posals are cheerily concrete , a true help to the necessary task of '' translating the fundamental utterances of the Mind of Christ '' into `` terms large enough to make them fully applicable to modern social life . ''

		Like all of us , Dr.
Rauschenbusch	PERSON	stands for the abolition of spe - cial privilege ; like all good socialists , he vindi - cates the sacred rights of property , pointing out that `` a condition in which millions of people have no share at all in the productive capital of the nation ... debases humanity , under - mines the Republic , and desiccates religion . ''

		There is a picturesque apologue on page 338 ; a delectable rewriting of the principles of that choice organization , the `` Liberty and Property 130 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	r
Defense League	ORGANIZATION	, '' on page 351 .

		There is plea for the indefinite enlargement of the collective form of property . ''

		Economic Democracy '' and `` The Economic Basis of Fraternity '' are two good formulae under which the discussion pro- ceeds .

		The last formula leads beyond detail into the demand for '' the evolution of a coopera - tive economic organization as wide as society , '' which is obviously `` the largest constructive moral task ever undertaken . ''

		Yet the next chapter shows the task to be no novelty , point - ing out in cogent fashion the transmission of this highest instinct for social organization down the ages , from the days of tribal communism through monasticism , to the expression of fra - ternal ideals in the collegiate communities of our own day .

		Having then reached `` The Powers of the Coming Age '' we review modern tendencies in the same direction .

		The coopera - tive movement , organized labor , and single tax agitation prepare us for a fairly full consideration of socialism .

		The author 's brotherly yet severe treatment of the false emphasis and the innate dangers of political and party socialism , renders all the more effective his grave and distinct align - ment of himself with the socialist movement in its broader but no less definite sense .

		We have been studying '' The Direction of Progress '' ; we turn in conclusion to '' The Methods of Advance . ''

		The finely democratic treatment recognizes the full value of that working-class movement on which philanthropy and reform too often look askance .

		Clever application of the Scriptures is a specialty of Dr.
Rauschenbusch	PERSON	.

		He tells us that education has performed for the torpid classes of society the miracle Elisha performed on the
Shunammite	PERSON	's son , when he warmed the dead body till the child sneezed seven times and opened his eyes . ''

		The working class has sneezed seventy times seven .

		It looks like convulsions , but it means the awak - ening of life . ''

		And again in more sober vein : '' If the banner of the
Kingdom of God	ORGANIZATION	is to enter through the gates of the future , it will have to be carried by the tramping hosts of labor . ''

		Yet the book ends on the note of stirring appeal to the privileged and the religious in the name of the faith they profess .

		At the outset this note had been struck : '' It rests largely with the Churches whether the emancipation of the working classes will come by a gradual and peaceful evolution of society or whether we are to have the folly and woe of the civil war over again . ''

		Now the note is repeated .

		The Marxian may be right in his cynicism .

		Perhaps no class will ever as a whole vote away its own privileges .

		Nevertheless '' men and women of the wealthy class who have been converted to the people as well as to God can perform a service of the highest value by weakening the resistance which their classes will inevitably offer to the equalization of property . '' ''

		In - dividuals will respond : more of them , I believe , than in any similar situation in history before . '' ''

		Even a few renegades from the rich are inval - uable .

		It takes a sharp blow from the outside to crack an eggshell : the soft bill of a chick can break it from within . ''

		And the conclusion of the whole matter is that the Church '' must send out men and women to finish up the work which Christ began .

		Is the
Church	ORGANIZATION	supplying society with the necessary equipment of such personalities ?

		Let us grant that it can never reach all : but is it making Christian revolutionists of those whom it does teach and control ? ''

		Such a Christian revolutionist at all events is Dr.
Rauschenbusch	PERSON	himself . ''

		Those men who have kept their mental balance against the dogmatism of the cruder types of socialism , who have guarded the purity of their life against the looseness of modern morals , who have cherished the devoutness of intimate religion in the drought of scepticism , but who have also ab - sorbed the socialist analysis of our collective sins and the socialist hope of a fraternal democ - racy , stand as a class marked by God as his own . ''

		The writer of such a book as this is one of those heralds on whom he calls : '' Trumpeter , rally us , rally us , rally us On to the City of God . ''

		MODERN HTJMAXISM .

		* It was only a short time ago that
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	, in his `` Essays , Specula - tive and Suggestive , '' summed up with sanity and sweep the solemn function of the critic . ''

		In order to profit by the vast extension of artistic knowledge in this generation and to avoid the narrow - ness of sects and cliques , the main thing for us is to form a clear conception of the mental atmosphere in which sound criticism has to live and move and have its being .

		` The form of this world passes ; and I would fain occupy myself with that only which constitutes abiding relations . '

		So said Goethe ; and these words have much the same effect as that admonition of his , to live with steady purpose in the Whole , the Good , the Beautiful . '

		The true critic must divest his mind from what is transient and ephemeral , must fasten upon abiding relations , bleibende Verhaltnisse . ''

		* THE MASTERS OF MODERN FRENCH CRITICISM .

		By
Irving Babbitt	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 131 If the critic is to accept such an exalted creed he can no longer live , as so many are doing , in dalliance with his own lawless moods .

		To be sure ,
Symonds	PERSON	's younger contemporary ,
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	, would have taken another path , and with clash of cymbal and riotous song would have led us along the path of `` the great confusion '' which Sainte-Beuve foresaw .

		But despite the fact that
Wilde	PERSON	promised with his luxurious impressionism somehow to regenerate the world , despite the fact that the influence of '' The Critic as Artist '' tinges some of the soberest utterances of many later critics -LRB- such a penetrating essay , for instance , as Mr.
Lewis Gates	PERSON	's `` Impressionism and Appreciation '' -RRB- , Anglo-Saxondom has re - coiled from the gospel which would lead us to the flickering irony of
Kenan	PERSON	's later years or compel us with
Anatole France	PERSON	to `` despise men ten - derly . ''

		With all his specious exaltation ,
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	could not in good faith have subscribed to the lofty yet tempered dictum of William Sharp : `` When I speak of Criticism I have in mind not merely the more or less deft use of commentary or indication but one of the several ways of literature and in itself a rare and fine art : the marriage of science that knows and of spirit that discerns .

		The basis of Criticism is imagination , its spiritual quality is simpli - city , its intellectual distinction is balance . ''

		Here , without surrendering the new honors that the impressionist has claimed for criticism , is a sober ideal instead of smart paradox .

		Where , however , shall we seek for this balance ?

		Just how may we occupy ourselves with the abiding relations of things ?

		The historian of criticism will find several brilliant answers among latter-day American critics .

		He will find something of the wisdom of poetry in the essay of Mr.
Gates	PERSON	, though he will note that `` ap - preciation , '' however tempered by richness of historical equipment and sensitive knowledge of one 's own age , loses sureness in its abnegation of the critic 's memorial right to judge , and loses sweep and inspiration in consenting to be for its own age alone .

		The historian will be stimulated by Professor
Trent	PERSON	's essay on '' The Authority of Criticism , '' in which , with his characteristic keen sense of both sides of a question , the author maps out domains in which the criticism of tradition and the criticism of impressions may do their best work .

		But the historian may well wish that the two criticisms could have been more closely fused .

		The historian will enjoy the drastic iconoclasm of Professor
Spingarn	PERSON	's `` The New Criticism . ''

		But after the shouting and the tumult dies and he finds himself with only the talisman , '' What has the poet tried to express and how has he expressed it ? ''

		which Professor
Spingarn	PERSON	takes from the Germans and
Carlyle	PERSON	as the sole vital and unifying concern of criticism , the historian will be fain to ask himself how such a slender relic will save him from `` the great confusion . ''

		A few of Professor
Spingarn	PERSON	's applications will make this danger clear .

		His assault on the criticism by genres is wantonly destructive of a method that has brought us views penetrating as often as pedantic .

		* In his repudiation of all moral judgment in literature he falls into the modern heresy of talking about things , including art , for their own sake , as if life were as staccato as an index .

		In his con - temptuous dismissal of all efforts at a theory of style he but sends us back to a rereading of a long line of great essays that make us , despite their inconsistencies , nod our heads and smile at the image-breaker and wonder whether such profound speculations are indeed never to be increased in the land .

		No , this talisman is too slight and too explosive .

		With less reservation we read Mr.
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	's oracular utter - ances in the seventh series of the `` Shelburne Essays . ''

		We find much to ponder in his tracing of a spiritual family , after the manner of a
Sainte	ORGANIZATION	- Beuve , which includes
Cicero	PERSON	and
Erasmus	PERSON	,
Boileau	PERSON	and
Arnold	LOCATION	, and which quietly sets the influence of these men above the fulminations of a Saint
Paul	PERSON	, a Luther , a
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		We ap - prehend the fine subtlety with which he seizes upon that theory of concentrated race-experience which set
Walter Pater	PERSON	to dreaming morbidly if enchantingly over
La Gioconda	LOCATION	and with which Oscar Wilde would have freed his cult of sultry egoists from moral and social responsibility ; and we follow the noble enthusiasm with which the American critic rescues this conception of an inheritance of `` the unconquerable hopes and defeated fears of an immeasurable past , the trag - edies and the comedies of love , the ardent aspi - rations of faith , the baffled questionings of evil , the huge laughter at facts , the deep-welling pas - sion of peace '' for a discipline making up its loss of original intensity with a significance and de - sign , a new unity in which ephemeral life is win - nowed and '' fitted into that great ring of eternity which
Henry Vaughan	PERSON	saw as in a dream . ''

		And having reached an apex in this hymnlike human - istic solution , we are prepared to consider Profes - sor
Babbitt	PERSON	's '' The Masters of Modern French Criticism , '' not as a climax after Mr.
More	PERSON	's golden words , but as an elaborate and memorable case for humanism and the dignity of criticism .

		* See Professor
Nielsen	PERSON	's introduction to Professor Gum - mere 's `` The Popular Ballad '' for some keen suggestions for fresh use of the examination of genre * .

		132 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, It is refreshing by contrast with the narrow view of criticism which stifles us for all Profes - sor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's learning , taste , and exuberance in his massive History , to open a book which , from a most comprehensive survey of the bril - liant men who have done more than any other nation or age for criticism , ramifies in a set of doctrines which shape for us , at least in outline , a theory of conduct , a theory of education , a philosophy , along with a theory of criticism .

		Many of our readers are already familiar with Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	's formula .

		In his '' Liter - ature and the American College '' and in '' The New Laokoon '' he assumed a role more dicta - torial than any English critic since
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, with the possible exception of Mr.
More	PERSON	, and legislated with rich scholarship and an insight that has made his assurance at once impressive and natural .

		He would have us mediate between the romantic emotionalism that still flows strong from
Rousseau	PERSON	, and the scientific naturalism that has swept over and dazzled all modern beliefs and aspirations , with a humanistic discipline that at present finds little voice , but which has claimed , since the days of Plato at least , an imposing minority of seers who have championed it more or less completely .

		To many of us so long attuned to the nineteenth - century philosophy of change this formula has an air of simplicity with sweep that has made its promise seem all too magical , all too facile , for a disease so deep-seated and fascinating as is our modern skeptical neurasthenia ; while Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	himself has been tempted by its sov - ereign virtues into certain procrustean or at least over-hasty applications , as in his dubious comments on programme music in '' The New Laokoon . ''

		But all friends and all foes worthy of the name will be delighted with the restraint and the sureness with which he uses his bright weapon in his latest volume .

		Let us approach him once more through an examination of kindred spirits .

		Symonds notes three types of critic : the judge , the showman -LRB- i.e. the impressionist -RRB- , and the scientific analyst . ''

		The true critic , '' he holds , '' must combine all three types in himself , and hold the balance by his sense of their reciprocal relations . ''

		In a notable passage he applies this critical spirit to humanistic education . ''

		Heraclitus has a weighty saying , which those who aim at sound criticism should bear in mind . '

		It behoves us , ' he remarks , to follow the common reason of the world ; yet though there is a common reason in the world , the majority live as though they possessed a wisdom peculiar each unto himself alone . ' ''

		The object of education is to provide us in youth with a sense of this common reason a just if general view of what mankind as a whole is a notion of what has been thought and wrought by our race in its totality of what humanity at its best and strongest has achieved by interrupted yet continuous efforts of how we come to be what we are and to think and feel as we do .

		Humanism , the study of history and literature and art and law , suffices better than any other training ... because its matter is of greater moral and mental im - portance to humanity .

		Such education prepares the specialist to judge with width and sympathy and due regard for relations , to overcome personal caprice and predilection and to survey the particular plot he selects for exploration as part of the great whole . ''

		Mr.
More	PERSON	seems to have much in common with this , yet he touches upon the danger of using the past '' too much as a dead storehouse of precepts for schoolmastering the present , '' and would be careful to ally judgment '' to the indwelling and ever-acting memory of things '' which consciously creates `` the field of the present out of the past . ''

		The critical spirit becomes thus akin to '' the guiding principle , itself unchanged , at work within the evolu - tionary changes of nature . '' ''

		Might we not even say , '' continues Mr.
More	PERSON	, '' that at a cer - tain point criticism becomes almost identical with education , and that by this standard we may judge the value of any study as an instru - ment of education and may estimate the merit of any special presentation of that study ? ''

		Thus Mr.
More	PERSON	makes
Symonds	PERSON	's standards more flexible without losing his large control .

		With such men as these Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	is , if I read him aright , in close accord .

		I am not attempting an Alexandrian study of his sources ; rather , I am attempting first to introduce him more powerfully with his shield locked with those of a noble phalanx , and then to show with a bare summary of his '' Conclusion '' how con - spicuously his own crest waves in the bright array .

		All our examination of other writers will but more sharply define his distinguished con - tribution to that synthetic thought that many youths -LRB- of various degrees of age -RRB- are dreaming of as the distinctive work with which the twen - tieth century will supplement the nineteenth century of analysis and expansion so courageous and so distressing .

		Here , then , follows Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	's con - clusion in his own words , as far as I can manage it in a difficult precis of such condensed and close reasoning : '' From the tyranny of the old neo-classical rules came the revolt of the romanticists in favor of wider knowl - edge and wider sympathy .

		But the romanticists forget that these are only the feminine virtues of a critic It is interesting to observe how Sainte-Beuve , as a ' doctor of relativity , ' was partly responsible for this resultant
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 133 anarchy from which , indeed , in his full maturity , he himself recoiled and enlisted himself with the great judicial conservatives .

		But in this doctrine of relativity both impressionist and scientific critic have united , the one prating eternally of books ' suggestive , ' the other of books ' significant ' ; the one denying any impersonal standard , the other entrenched in his theory of the un - knowable .

		Neither method can lead to any sure dis - tinction between third rate work and a play of Sophocles .

		Many books once infinitely suggestive and still of the highest historical significance are now seen to be of very inferior value .

		From
Rousseau	PERSON	to the impressionist has echoed < Man is the measure of all things . '

		But is one to interpret this in the spirit of the Greek sophists , like M.
France	LOCATION	who finds us but ' the sport and playthings of mobile circumstances , ' or in the spirit of
Socrates	LOCATION	, like
Emerson	PERSON	who so asserts the maxim as to attain to a new sense of the unity of human nature , a unity founded not on tradition but on insight ?

		To Emerson the best books in the world seem to be the work of ' one all-seeing , all-hearing gentleman . '

		The individual man is the measure of all things only in so far as he has realized in himself this essential human nature .

		If we learn to separate this from
Emerson	LOCATION	's conflicting ten - dency to encourage unduly the man who - is undisciplined , unselective , and untraditional we have the corrective to temper that immense relativism which almost paralyzed Sainte-Beuve himself .

		While the perfect taste thus formed may be a gift divine , inborn , or impossible , it is at least an ideal for humanistic self-discipline that should encourage any sincere and intelligent aspirant to raise himself above that acceptance of anarchy which the impressionist considers inevitable .

		It is well for us to awaken our senses with the impressionist , but only that we may the better judge .

		The problem is to avoid the extreme of the pseudo-classical critic who set up a standard entirely outside the individual and the extreme of the impressionist entirely within .

		We should seek a standard that is in the individual and yet is felt by him to transcend his personal self and lay hold of that part of his nature which he possesses in common with other men .

		To complete this standard , this judgment of the keen-sighted few in the present needs to be rati - fied by the verdict of posterity .

		Yet in our day the Rousseauist or pseudo-democrat would value a book not by its appeal to the keen-sighted few , but by its immediate effect on the average man , a humanitarian fallacy which fits in alike with impressionism and com - mercialism .

		Modern criticism , in getting rid of for - malism and in becoming sympathetic and comprehen - sive , has performed only half its task .

		The other half is to find some new principle of judgment and selection .

		We need a critic who rests his discipline and selection upon the past , but who by a constant process of hard and clear thinking is constantly adjusting the experience of the past to the changing needs of the present .

		Sainte - Beuve can give us a miraculous vision of the past but he is one of the victims of naturalistic fatalism .

		Goethe , in his humanistic period , is nearer to the ideal than any other modern .

		But
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	has a weakness .

		Although he refused to enter into the deterministic maze that struck proud gloom into both the dogmatic superna - turalists , like
Pascal	PERSON	, and our dogmatic naturalists , although he would have us turn from those ultimate problems which may drive us mad to man 's works , he conceives of this work too much in terms of the outer world , too little in terms of the individual 's inner life .

		For the man whose attention is exclusively on works is in danger of losing that humility which comes only from a sense of man 's helplessness before the infinite .

		More - over
Goethe	LOCATION	, even in full maturity , was too full of admiration for unregulated sympathy .

		Thus his view tends to fly apart into the two extremes which baffle control the idea of work conceived , primarily in a utilitarian spirit , and diffusive unselective sympathy .

		As
Emerson	PERSON	charges him , he fails to worship the high - est unity .

		We need a second
Boileau	PERSON	, not with the old formalism but with the main results of the great ex - pansion of the last century , who would be further able to make keen discriminations between different degrees of merit and demerit .

		But we must select without sourness or asceticism .

		We must avoid the danger of the French reactionary who fajls , for instance , in a reaction against naturalism , to take up all that is legitimate in naturalism .

		We must not dream of an impossible re - turn to the past .

		Its forms of authority have become impossible for many moderns .

		We must substitute an intuition of something which imposes on man 's whole being a controlling purpose .

		To the influence of
Sainte	ORGANIZATION	-
Beuve	LOCATION	, then , the great doctor of relativity , we must bring the controlling influence of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	in so far as he ia the philosopher of the oversoul .

		The ideal critic would need to combine the breadth and versatility and sense of difference of a Sainte-Beuve with the elevation and insight and sense of unity of an Emerson . ''

		Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	's formula is not without its dangers for its creator .

		It lends justification for that judicial faculty which Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	would seem to be inclined temperamentally to over-emphasize himself in spite of his admirable analysis of its excesses in
Brunetiere	LOCATION	.

		It is in - teresting to see the working out of this influence on his style .

		He has an unusual command of irony .

		In his earlier volumes this is almost omnipresent .

		He seems to lunge with a rapier at once trenchant and unnecessarily envenomed .

		The wound festers .

		It is possible , we protest , to be a devil of a fighter without being so per - sistently belligerent .

		We recall
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's irony -LRB- which he was wont to use even in the face of charges of foppish strutting and triviality -RRB- .

		But Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	has not the gallantry of
Arnold	LOCATION	, who , with something of the versatility of
Cyrano de Bergerac	ORGANIZATION	, bows and smiles as he runs you through .

		Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	frowns a good deal and thrusts viciously .

		We must hasten to add that there is much more restraint in '' The Masters of Modern French Criticism '' than in the earlier volumes .

		But there is still , with an irony more restrained , a feverish quickstep that arises from almost an excess of earnestness .

		Besides the irritation caused by the cut and thrust manner there comes an allied annoyance : our stinging ears await the grateful cadence of a solemn and exultant period .

		But Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	's own petulance , his own fine zeal , will not let him gratify us .

		This stylistic defect is likely to be the failing of the critic who remains 134 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, essentially judicial , not with the ponderosity of
Johnson	PERSON	but with the crisp proverb-manner of
Boileau	PERSON	; and who does not quite gain , much as he may desire it , the full elevation of the more irresponsible emotionalist .

		It is this excess of the long neglected judicial temper , too , that makes him distrustful , as
Arnold	LOCATION	was before him , of the identification of critic and artist so frequently urged by the im - pressionists .

		It is to be regretted that Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	accepts the outworn antithesis , `` criti - cal '' and `` creative . ''

		Surely the critic may be creative without admiring , as Victor
Hugo	PERSON	would have it , `` like a brute , '' without seeking to herald his new office with the insincere fanfare of a
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is interesting here to compare Mr.
More	PERSON	, who brings critics at least very close to the creative manner but who would admit that '' they are by intellect hesitators , '' a concession surely not wholly true of the greatest of them .

		Mr.
John McKinnon Robertson	PERSON	-LRB- `` Science in Criticism , '' pp. 144 seq. '' -RRB- , points out '' the nullity of the proposition '' that `` criticism is a lower form of intellectual effort than those called ` crea - tive , ' '' and doubtless Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	would find sufficient solace in such a contention to urge that my present jangling is to no purpose .

		There is no space for extended argument .

		But I would contend that there is something far more important than the gratification of individual vanity in the new conception of the critic as creator ; and that since criticism shows signs of marked new developments , since the number of sane critics who insist upon its creative character increases daily , I would repeat that an excess of the judicial temper may tend to deprive criti - cism of this last honor and range that is now its inspiring heritage .

		But we have quarreled overmuch .

		It is rather early to forecast a return to the judicial ex - treme .

		Surely Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	's mastery of the sadly neglected judicial faculty has brought him striking results .

		In a style richly jewelled with choice quotations , a style which absorbs quotations with the art of
Hazlitt	PERSON	, of Byron in ``
Don Juan	PERSON	, '' or of
Thackeray	PERSON	, Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	follows a method that has been called `` collective criticism , '' a criticism which is too objective to have intolerable acidity , which re - quires toil too epical to appeal to one so-called critic out of a thousand , but which -LRB- as Profes - sor
Brewster	PERSON	has well pointed out -RRB- is a rich field as yet but little trodden .

		* Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	's * '' Modern English Literary Criticism . ''

		Professor Brew - ster cites perhaps the best example : Mr.
J. M. Robertson	PERSON	's essay on
Poe	PERSON	, '' largely an analysis of the collective estimate of
Poe	PERSON	, with comments of his own . ''

		chapters on Sainte-Beuve , in particular , are an - alytic and synthetic work of a very high order .

		Other writers have had at best but partial suc - cess in constructing the necromantic method which Sainte-Beuve himself revealed so way - wardly .

		But Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	has , with great knowledge , patience , and delicate acumen , found all the bright evanescent disclosures in the mas - ter himself and in his most cunning critics , and has woven them into a coat of mail .

		He has captured Proteus and compelled him to assume permanently his proper form .

		Such '' collective criticism '' as this is certainly an admirable ap - plication of Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	's own large vision of a method that draws the best from impression - ist , scientific historian , and humanist , that goes to Sainte-Beuve , to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and to
Emerson	LOCATION	for a new eclectic philosophy .

		And we may add that such `` collective criticism '' as this is , in Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	's despite , creative .

		From his pages those noble warriors of
France	LOCATION	,
Sainte	ORGANIZATION	-
Beuve	LOCATION	,
Taine	PERSON	,
Joubert	PERSON	,
Scherer	PERSON	, Renan ,
Bru	PERSON	- netiere , stand forth vivid , scarred .

		This is dramatic criticism in a new and in a very severe use of a much abused word .

		THE BEFOGGED ELIZABETHAN STAGE .

		* From being the most neglected field of
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan research , the subject of the conditions of stage presentation in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's
London	LOCATION	has become in a single decade one of the most vio - lently debated qucestiones vexatce of recent scholarship .

		Mr.
W. J. Lawrence	PERSON	lays claim , not without reason , to the distinction of having inaugurated this fresh trend of critical specula - tion ; and his handsome volume of eleven essays , originally composed at different times between
1902	DATE	and the present year , offers an easy mea - sure of the progress which has been attained .

		During the period spanned by these papers , several thousands of pages , literally , have been published by some twenty writers , in
England	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	, in the effort to eluci - date Elizabethan stage conditions ; and the end is assuredly not yet .

		The pelter of dissertations continues , but the first stage in the investiga - tion is giving place to a second .

		Instead of far - ranging inquiries , seeking to settle the entire question on independent and rather empirical lines , one finds to-day a close-locked battle waged about half a dozen shibboleths thrown up by the * THE ELIZABETHAN PLAYHOUSE , and Other Essays .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 135 conflict of opinion .

		It is less the Shakespearean or the Elizabethan stage as a whole which at present engages the attention of the students than such by-products of discussion as the '' alter - nation '' and the '' plastic '' theories , the prin - ciple of `` multiple setting , '' and the `` platform '' or `` picture , '' `` corridor '' or `` alcove '' stage .

		The change is , of course , in many ways a mark of healthy progress an index of the closer range within which the investigations of some of the most acute modern scholars have brought the subject .

		The absolute results have been well set forth by one of the pioneers in the work , Professor
G. F. Reynolds	PERSON	, in a paper in last year 's `` Modern Philology , '' '' What We Know of the Elizabethan Stage . ''

		The advance is somewhat painfully brought home to the gen - eral public by the fact that the commentaries in even the most scholarly editions of the
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan dramatists have in ten years grown quite superannuated in all that regards details of staging .

		It is no dispraise of Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	and such of his compeers as
Archer	PERSON	,
Albright	PERSON	,
Wegener	PERSON	, and
Reynolds	PERSON	, however , to say that the dispassionate scholar who gives up his days and nights for no small space of time to the careful reading of their treatises is likely to emerge with a sense of the vast preponderance of speculation and inference over established fact .

		The field whence evidence is to be culled is so broad , and the meagre individual hints so dishearteningly contradictory , that it is not surprising to find vague deduction running riot or chasing itself about in circles of vicious logic .

		On the principle which now obtains , it would seem essential that the theorist seeking to con - struct a mental concept of the Globe or Fortune stage be able to hold suspended in his mind a clear idea of the actual requirements of every scene of at least a hundred plays .

		But this is practically impossible .

		The most assiduous in - vestigators seem hardly to have done more than consider a single striking scene or two from each of thirty or forty plays .

		Hence , as each student inevitably remembers and stresses , out of the ungovernable multitude , the particular scenes which lean most toward his personal interpreta - tion , it is very natural that discordant views have been able to establish and maintain themselves .

		Thus the alternation theory , which postulates very precise care in the avoidance of incongru - ous effects , and the so-called `` plastic '' theory , which believes in the indifference of the
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan public to what would be to-day unen - durable clashes of scenic atmosphere , have both been ably expounded on the evidence of the plays themselves .

		The first indispensable step in the investiga - tion of Elizabethan stage practice has consisted in the general survey of the entire field .

		Now that this difficult labor is accomplished and a number of general principles set beyond doubt , it should be possible to bring out the details more clearly by concentrating attention upon particular subdivisions of the province .

		To treat separately the productions of the different thea - tres , especially in the earlier period , is hardly possible on the basis of present knowledge .

		To begin with the consideration of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's works , as
Brodmeier	PERSON	did , is to court disaster , for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's stage practice was doubtless as genially erratic and as arbitrary as his use of language .

		Shakespeare wrote with a superla - tive knowledge of the peculiar needs , and even , doubtless , of the undreamed potentialities , of a special company and theatre .

		To attempt to deduce from his practice alone an idea of the normal usage would be like inferring the char - acteristics of everyday Elizabethan conversation from the soliloquies of Hamlet .

		The besb means of bringing into clear outline the ground principles of Elizabethan staging will probably be to proceed , from the basis of the broad truths established by the researches of the last ten years , to a more minute study than has yet been attempted of the practice of the earlier playwrights , especially
Greene	PERSON	and
Marlowe	PERSON	.

		These poets seem to have had no intimate or exclusive association with any one play-house .

		They wrote normally , it is certain , for the public stage , but not with their eye upon the peculiar individual requirements of a single company or theatre .

		That is , they saw the stage , presumably , as the man in the street saw it in their day and as we should first try to see it in broad outline with a few salient universal features subject to infinite modification in spe - cial cases .

		When these simple fundamental characteristics have been elicited by microscopic study of the not overwhelmingly numerous dra - mas of the earliest writers for the public stage , we may hope to discover more easily the develop - ments and personal innovations which it seems certain that more advanced and technical artists like
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Ben Jonson	PERSON	must have made .

		From these we may then probably trace the course of evolution through the work of the succeeding seventeenth-century playwrights .

		Assuredly , if there is any parallel between the progress of the early English stage and that of the dramatic literature with which it was so very 136 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, intimately associated , we must expect to find enormous differences of detail between the stage practice of
Marlowe	ORGANIZATION	's plays , of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's , and of
Ford 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		No wonder that the arguments which give identical value to evidence from `` Alphonsus of Aragon , '' from `` Hamlet , '' and from '' The Broken Heart '' leave us no means of distinguishing between the normal and essential and the purely exceptional .

		The various essays in Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's book differ greatly in their importance to the student of stage conditions .

		`` The Story of a Peculiar Stage Curtain '' and `` Proscenium Doors '' are written in popular rather than scientific vein ; and the same can be said of '' The Mounting of the Carolan Masques , '' which contains , however , some valuable new matter .

		The treatment of `` Early French Players in
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB- mainly during the Stuart era -RRB- , of
Shadwell	PERSON	's putative `` Tempest '' opera , and of the authorship of the `` Macbeth `` music touches interesting side-issues ; but Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's claim to serious recognition as a purveyor of new light will depend mainly upon his introductory paper on '' The Evolution of the Elizabethan Playhouse , '' with its supple - ment at the end of the volume , and upon the three careful inquiries regarding the situation of the `` lords ' room , '' the use of title and locality boards , and the place of music and song in the Elizabethan theatre .

		These essays , like the others , are written with verve and bear the mark of diligent preparation .

		That they lead to rather few definite conclusions is perhaps due more to the broad field they seek to cover than to any lack of critical acumen in the author .

		Very often one finds Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	slipping over the real difficulties of the problem before him with such lighthearted remarks as `` There seems to be no valid reason for doubt - ing '' -LRB- p. 23 -RRB- and '' Some slight evidence exists to show '' -LRB- ibid -RRB- .

		Near the beginning of his first paper -LRB- p. 5 -RRB- , Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	remarks that `` Au - thentic details of the prime characteristics of the
Shoreditch	LOCATION	theatres -LRB- i.e. , the ` Theater ' and ` Curtain ' -RRB- are almost wholly lacking . ''

		Yet in the same connection he states , on evidence which I am wholly unable to trace , that the '' Theater '' and '' Curtain '' were used for bull and bear bait - ings as well as dramatic performances .

		From this he infers that the theatres in question must have had removable stages ; and later -LRB- p. 23 -RRB- he suggests that '' one invariable concomitant of the permanent -LRB- as opposed to the removable -RRB- stage was the oblique entering doors . ''

		Here a very interesting theory is built up almost without a prop .

		The difference in dramatic effectiveness between a stage on which actors may enter through doors set opposite each other toward the front of the platform and a stage where all entrances must be made through openings in the rear wall is of the utmost consequence .

		If Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	is right , then
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's com - pany must not only have made a very great ad - vance in the efficiency of their acting when they removed from the `` Theater '' to the `` Globe , '' but they must also have relapsed periodically into cruder methods whenever they returned , during the years before
1600	DATE	, from the `` Rose '' or `` Globe '' to the `` Curtain . ''

		If true , this is highly interesting , but proof is lacking both for the conclusion and for the premises .

		Did the '' Theater '' and '' Curtain '' have movable stages ?

		Did movability of stage necessarily involve dif - ference in the shape of the tiring-house facade and consequently in the position of the stage entrances ?

		Another striking statement , for which one would like to have Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	quote satis - factory evidence , is his remark concerning the `` remoteness and obscurity '' of the inner stage , `` which almost invariably demanded the bring - ing in of lights at the commencement of all inner scenes '' -LRB- pp. 6 , 7 -RRB- .

		The four cases cited in the footnote , where lights are called for by the nature of the scene , certainly prove no such prac - tice .

		Moreover , would not the contrast between illuminated back scenes and unlighted front scenes , if any authority for the practice could be found , rather serve to emphasize the separate identity of front-stage and rear-stage , which Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	, as a hard and fast opponent of `` alternation , '' rigidly denies ?

		Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's discussion of title and local - ity boards is , on the whole , excellent ; but his solemn treatment of the alternative play titles at the beginning of '' Wily Beguiled '' and '' The Knight of the Burning Pestle '' -LRB- pp. 51 , 52 -RRB- seems much ado about nothing .

		Surely , nobody in the audience can have seriously expected to Spectrum '' or '' The
London	LOCATION	Merchant . '

		see The false titles were brought in with the privity of the audience , in the one instance as a humor - ous gibe at the much-acted '' Spectrum , '' in the other for the purpose of motivating the outburst of the Grocer and his wife .

		In the paper just alluded to , and in the final section of the book , the author treats very well the essential principles of multiple setting , but grows vague in his deductions as to the extent to which multiple setting obtained on the public stage . ''

		One has only to make minute examin - ation of the constructive system of Lyly , '' he
1913	DATE	-RSB- 137 says -LRB- p. 59 -RRB- , `` to become convinced that the multiple setting held sway at court for more than a score of years after the erection of the Theater and the Curtain -LRB- i.e. , till after
1596	DATE	-RRB- . ''

		Later on , Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	contends very plausibly that Lyly 's early court plays -LRB- produced circa 1580-86 -RRB- were acted according to the multiple setting principle -LRB- p. 237/f . -RRB-

		.

		But does he really mean that this principle held sway '' more than a score of years after the erection of the first theatres '' ; that is , till after
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's com - pany had begun to carry their plays regularly from the '' Theater '' and the '' Globe '' to the court ?

		If Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	means this , proof would be most desirable .

		Similar vagueness appears in the discussion of the first Blackf riars stage , where it should be remembered in fairness that Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	is writing in haste and without the benefit of Pro- fessor
Wallace	PERSON	's very informative recent book The Evolution of the English Drama up on to Shakespeare . ''

		Starting with the bold as - sumption that `` all the court plays of the period , excepting pastorals , were provided with scenery of the multiple order '' -LRB- p. 235 -RRB- , Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	infers that plays must necessarily have been similarly rehearsed at the Blackf riars .

		Yet , as the multiple scenery was court property , return - able after the royal performance , he suggests that all subsequent representations at Black - friars would follow the practice of the public stage .

		Surely , it is unlikely that a particular play would be acted in the same theatre by the same company before the same type of audience in one manner previous to a specific date and in an utterly different manner after .

		It is not with the idea of convicting Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	of ignorance or carelessness that these few instances out of a large number have been brought up .

		The rest of the learned world shares Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's uncertainties , and all writers on the subject have not been as frank as he in avowing the weak places in their reason - ing .

		The fact is that what we know at present of the early court , private , and public stages immediately prior to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is quite in - sufficient to support the amount of pure conjec - ture involved in any of the prevailing theories .

		To concentrate upon the real fundamentals of Elizabethan staging , as manifested in the earli - est and simplest theatres , the attention now roaming rather aimlessly over the entire pre - Restoration epoch might set investigation firmly on its feet .

		A few careless expressions and misprints mar the neatness of Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's volume .

		Atten - tion is likely to be drawn particularly to the amusing misuse of italic type by which the
Boswell-Malone Variorum Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is reg - ularly alluded to as
Malone	ORGANIZATION	's Shakespeare by Bo swell .

		Of '' Shakespeare by Bacon '' we have all heard more than enough , but '' Shakespeare by
Boswell	PERSON	'' strikes one as a delicious innova - tion .

		CHINA AFTER THE REVOLUTION .

		* Not even the new era dawning for the
Balkan States	LOCATION	is of so great moment to the human race as is the emergence of
China	LOCATION	from mediaeval backwardness into modern aspirations , and her institution of a republican government .

		Friends of liberty and progress everywhere will share , indeed , in the triumphs of liberty and pro- gress in southeastern
Europe	LOCATION	, and will spare but little sympathy to the losing Turk , yet the rise of the
Balkan States	LOCATION	adds no distinctly new ele - ment to world civilization .


Japan	LOCATION	, on the other hand , brought into later nineteenth-century world culture an individual contribution , not only Japanese , but
Asiatic	LOCATION	; and the great empire now following the lead of
Japan	LOCATION	will , presumably , offer to the family of nations per - plexities and gifts , not simply characteristic and unique , but also Asiatic .

		Since it is to be hoped that the world culture of the later twentieth century will be enriched by the equal blend - ing of elements from the two hemispheres , the revolution in
China	LOCATION	is therefore of the utmost significance .


China	LOCATION	's first steps along her present untried path are being watched by all the world , but not by all with like interest .

		Not even yet is the possibility of the partition of the old empire banished from the thought of certain European chancelleries , and it is scarcely cynical to believe that some of the Great Powers secretly rejoice at every sign of weakness , and regret every omen of success in her present endeavor .

New York	LOCATION	: Student Volunteer Movement .

		138 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, mentum in the reform movement is the result of American education imparted to her youth both here and in
China	LOCATION	.

		Indeed , in spite of the uncertainties that yet strew her path , many Americans marvel that our government still delays to recognize the Republic .

		These uncertainties are varied and serious .


China	LOCATION	consists not only of the eighteen prov - inces , but also of four great dependencies , loosely knit at best to the
Middle Kingdom	LOCATION	a total area one-third larger than all
Europe	LOCATION	.

		To in - stitute a novel form of government for the hun - dreds of millions of her people and yet hold these vast dependencies to their allegiance is a task of the greatest magnitude .

		Even without foreign foes , it would be almost impossible ex - cept by means of a great army , and that
China	LOCATION	does not possess .

		Nor is she without foes .


Japan	LOCATION	covets
South Manchuria	LOCATION	;
Russia	LOCATION	is greedy for
North Manchuria	LOCATION	,
Mongolia	LOCATION	, and
Turkestan ; England	ORGANIZATION	will not stand by and see Thibet fall into Russian hands .

		Moreover ,
China	LOCATION	is internally weak .

		She lacks railroads , revenue , and an army .

		Her administration has not yet proved its capacity for handling the vast sums needed for internal development , and she can not , therefore , borrow money for the development of her wonderfully rich resources without submitting to foreign supervision .

		Such supervision may lead to riots and even the secession of provinces .

		At this critical juncture , when the old sanctions of Confucianism and the monarchy are destroyed , no new sanctions have been created upon which she may implicitly rely to hold her populace loyal , through severe tests , to the new govern - ment .

		Her internal problems accentuate the seriousness of the dangers which threaten from without .

		Friends of
China	LOCATION	who watch eagerly for every sign of hope will find much to encourage them and much to discourage in three recent books .

		The favorable view of
China	LOCATION	's prospects is pre - sented in Messrs.
Cantlie	PERSON	and
Jones	PERSON	's '' Sun Yat Sen and the Awakening of
China	LOCATION	, '' and in Dr.
Brown	PERSON	's `` The Chinese Revolution '' ; the un - favorable in Mr.
Eland	PERSON	's '' Recent Events and Present Policies in
China	LOCATION	. ''

		The first of these books comprises a rather heterogeneous list of topics .

		A sketch of the character and career of Dr. Sun , together with certain other chapters , was written by Dr. Can - lie , former teacher of Dr. Sun at the
Hongkong Medical School	ORGANIZATION	and his intimate friend for the past twenty years ; the rest of the book was written by Mr.
Sheridan Jones	PERSON	.

		The latter writer gives an altogether encouraging account of the great moral crusade in
China	LOCATION	, the fight against opium .

		The statistics advanced to prove that
China	LOCATION	has combatted the gigantic opium evil with vigor and at great sacrifice to the gov - ernment in revenue , and that
British India	LOCATION	has actually drawn a larger revenue , because of the rise in prices , from her greatly reduced export of opium , are indeed impressive .

		Likewise impressive is the forecast of
China	LOCATION	's future as a military power .

		The writer believes in the strength and efficiency of the new army of
China	LOCATION	, and maintains that the Republic will differ from the monarchy in nothing more strikingly than in the changed attitude toward the soldier , a change destined to mean eventually an enormous standing army .

		Will
China	LOCATION	in the near future require
Japan	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	to evacuate Man - churia ?

		Mr.
Jones	PERSON	believes she may .

		The value of Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's prophecies depends largely upon the quality of
China	LOCATION	's present lead - ership , and as to this both Mr.
Jones	PERSON	and Dr.
Cautlie	PERSON	are agreed .

		The former speaks with assurance of the reformed bench of
China	LOCATION	, as consisting of an `` unexceptionable personnel , '' and Dr.
Cantlie	PERSON	holds Sun Yat Sen up to the world as a man of unique gifts and powers .

		According to Dr.
Cantlie	PERSON	's first-hand sketch , Sun possesses remarkable magnetism , both with individuals and with audiences .

		His temper is pacific , his disposition remarkably unselfish , his interests very diverse , and his devotion to
China	LOCATION	absolute .

		Interesting incidents from his pic - turesque career serve to vivify the sketch and leave a very favorable impression of Sun as a man of ability and courage and a peculiarly sin - cere patriot .

		His power over men , the result of an open and generous nature , appears quite extra - ordinary .

		As to his statesmanship , Dr.
Cantlie	PERSON	furnishes little evidence , since in this Sun is as yet untried .

		One is compelled to remark , more - over , that Dr.
Cantlie	PERSON	largely defeats his own end by a certain lack of restraint and an undue laudation of his hero .

		Dr. Sun as the saviour of the Republic would be more reassuring if he were depicted as not quite so angelic .

		This lack of restraint contrasts unfavorably with the exceptional scholarship and thorough - ness of Mr.
Bland	PERSON	's discussion of
China	LOCATION	's prob - lems , a discussion giving an altogether adverse view of her prospects .

		Joint author with Mr.
Backhouse	PERSON	of ''
China	LOCATION	under the Empress Dow - ager , '' Mr.
Bland	PERSON	is eminently qualified to dis - cuss the political , economic , and social conditions in the Empire , and his entire treatment is gratify - ing in its thoroughness and acumen .

		His analysis of the unrest goes back to the fundamental cause , the pressure of population on the means of sub - sistence , the philoprogenitiveness of the Chinese race ; and yet , though convincing as an explana - tion of one phase of the uprising , this analysis leaves out of account secondary causes too im - portant to be omitted .

		He feels this to be a blind movement of the hungry masses , and in his eyes those who have taken the lead in this movement are only a new type of the ancient Chinese revolutionist , and they are already dis - playing the worst traits of the greedy mandarin .

		The people are in the hands of ambitious and place-seeking leaders , devoid of sobriety , and wholly wanting in moral and religious depth and restraint .

		He foresees a brief life for the Republic , though he thinks the restored mon - archy or the despotism sure to follow will be modified for the better through the aspirations voiced in the temporary Republic .

		One questions whether Mr.
Bland	PERSON	has not been too long in close and unfortunate contact with the old Chinese officialdom to view with open mind the present seemingly novel phe - nomena in Chinese politics .

		No one who has any acquaintance with the younger generation of Chinese will fail to recall men whose ability and patriotism inspire great confidence .

		It is wholly possible that the effervescence of youth - ful enthusiasms , which to Mr.
Bland	PERSON	.

		indicate a heady , volatile , and unstable leadership , will leave behind the substantial Chinese virtues of common sense and reverence for law , to guide the nation through its crisis .

		Though possess - ing unusual value as a scholarly study , the discussion is too deeply tinged with pessimism to be convincing .

		Such an impression of Mr.
Bland	PERSON	's unfavor - able prepossession is strengthened by the peru - sal of Dr.
Brown	PERSON	's '' The Chinese Revolution . ''

		After describing briefly the outbreak and back - ground of the revolution , Dr.
Brown	PERSON	discusses - concisely the various influences that have pre - pared the way for this outbreak , steam and commerce , diplomatic and warlike relations , the gradual intellectual awakening resulting from these stimuli and from Christianity and foreign education .

		He concludes his study with a sketch of the two foremost leaders of
China	LOCATION	, Sun and Yuan , and a forecast of the future of the Republic .

		Dr.
Brown	PERSON	's tone , though sane and not lacking reserve , is strongly optimistic .

		He believes that moral and spiritual elements have entered largely into the making of the present situation in
China	LOCATION	, and urges the necessity of strengthening as rapidly as possible these con - servative influences at this time of swift tran - sition from the old to the new .

		A LIBRARY OF GREEK AND CLASSICS .

		*
Xenophon	PERSON	in his Memorabilia of Socrates reports the sage as saying that friendship is sustained and promoted by reading the master - pieces of old : `` We turn over the recorded thoughts which the wise men of antiquity have left to us ; and if we find any noble sentiment , we cull it out and rejoice to think that our friend - ship is strengthened thereby . ''

		Towards the close of the fifth century B. c. , when
Socrates	PERSON	may be supposed to have made this remark , the available stores of Greek literature were already sufficiently imposing .

		Homer and
Hesiod	ORGANIZATION	, Archilochus and the lyric poets , the great trio of tragic dramatists ,
Aristophanes	LOCATION	, the historians
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	and Thucydides , with others of minor note , were all in hand , and affecting the thought and life of Hellas .

		It was quality rather than quantity that told : little need for winnowing those treasures ; and there was added the su - preme advantage of not having to translate , as nothing worth translating existed outside of
Greece	LOCATION	.

		For Americans and Britons of this speeding century , the treasures of Greek and Roman lit - erature , like some other fine old things , have largely become shelved and labelled .

		Emerson in one place con - tends for the use of translations ; in another , he says : '' When a thought of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	becomes a thought to me , time is no more . ''

		To be con - sistent , he must have taken his Plato via
Jowett	PERSON	; but as the same
Emerson	PERSON	elsewhere pleads for inconsistency as the real jewel , we may fall back on the assurance that he got as much training in the Greek language as the early nineteenth century afforded .

		However this may be , it must be with some sense of interest , pleasure , and gratitude that thoughtful men up and down the land have heard of the purpose of Mr.
James Loeb	PERSON	, the well-known banker , to stay the slow progress of oblivion that seemed waiting on the classic literatures by subsidizing the publication of translations of the great and less great Greek and Roman writers , from Homer down to the fall of
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		To the undertaking of his praiseworthy enterprise Mr.
Loeb	PERSON	was impelled by his own enthusiasm for classical subjects and the encouragement of
M. Salomon Reinach	ORGANIZATION	; and for its supervision he has called in the aid of an advisory board , including such names as
Edward M. Capps	PERSON	of

T. E. Page	PERSON	, for - merly of the Charterhouse school in
London	LOCATION	, and Dr.
W. H. D. Rouse	PERSON	, Litt.D. , of
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		For the actual work of translation , the editors have enlisted the services of recognized schol - ars in
England	LOCATION	, the Continent , and
America	LOCATION	.


Jowett	PERSON	and

W. C. Wright	PERSON	of
Bryn Mawr	LOCATION	,
A. M. Harmon	PERSON	of
Princeton	LOCATION	, and
Horace White	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, something more than respectable translations may be expected .

		It would seem , indeed , as if the work had been triply guarded , by translators , editors , and advisory board .

		The series is to consist of about two hundred volumes , somewhat more than a five-foot shelf , though not exhaustive of the available riches .

		In the selection of authors no chronological order will be followed , but the choice will be made so as to include considerable variety each year .

		Major and minor authors are brought out am - icably together , and it is left to our latter-day acumen to determine their respective merits : Sophocles is elbowed by
Philostratus	LOCATION	,
Terence	PERSON	and the
Apostolic Fathers	ORGANIZATION	have agreed together .

		Questions of Hellenism and Latinity are not discussed ; yet , as the Greek or Latin text is placed on the opposite page from the translation , the scholar 's eye will not fail of its critical office .

		The chief appeal is made , of course , not to scholars , but to the college graduate who wishes to keep up his reading , and who has forgotten much of the little Latin and more of the less Greek he once was taught ; and also to the intel - ligent layman , well-intentioned but innocent of either language .

		This appeal is helped out by the clear printing and neat form of the small octavos .

		The Latin volumes are bound in red cloth and the Greek in dark green .

		For the size , the price seems a little high .

		Philostratus of Leinnos -LRB- circa 175-200 A.D. -RRB- gained the favor of the learned empress
Julia Domna	PERSON	, consort of
Septimius Severus	PERSON	, and was persuaded by her to write the life of the sage and wonder-worker Apollonius of
Tyana	LOCATION	.

		As Apollonius had been dead about a century , there had been time for a fine haze of legend and tradition to gather round his name .

		During a long life largely peripatetic spent in visit - ing
Persia	LOCATION	,
Babylon	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	, and the Hel - lenic world generally , he wandered and preached and wrought miracles , spoke boldly before kings and emperors , narrowly escaped death from Nero and later from
Domitian	PERSON	, and finally died peace - fully under
Nerva	PERSON	.

		Philostratus is thought to have exploited the career of Apollonius as a kind of counter-blast to that of Jesus ; but there seems little reason to believe this .

		The narrative , in eight books and broken into small chapters , is most entertaining ; and suggests an Herodotus of the third Christian century , though of course lacking the historic substance .

		The translation , by Mr.
F. C. Conybeare	PERSON	, is generally spirited and good ; although there are occasional infelici - ties and a few '' Briticisms . ''

		For Euripides , the editors have wisely chosen to reproduce the fine verse - translation of Dr.
Arthur S. Way	PERSON	, which has been admired by scholars and used by literary clubs for the past eighteen years .

		Dr. Way has thoroughly revised his former translation of the nineteen plays -LRB- he takes the `` Rhesus '' as genuine -RRB- with the `` two especial aims of closer fidelity to the original and greater lucidity in expression . ''

		The Greek text of this edition is eclectic , being based on the soundest conclusions of previous editors and critics .

		The fresh virginal page is retained , with almost no footnotes on readings .

		In the excel - lent short introduction on
Euripides	LOCATION	, Dr.
Way 1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 141 gives us the following bit of comparative char - acterization : '' ^ Eschylus sets forth the operation of great princi - ples , especially of the certainty of divine retribution and of the persistence of sin as an ineradicable plague-spot .

		He believes and trembles .

		Sophocles depicts great characters ; he ignores the malevolence of destiny and the persistent power of evil ; to him ` man is man and master of his fate . '

		He believes with unquestioning faith .

		Euripides propounds great moral problems ; he analyzes human nature , its instincts , its passions , its motives ; he voices the cry of the human soul against the tyranny of the supernatural , the selfishness and cruelty of man , the crushing weight of environment .

		He questions : ' he will not make his judgment blind . ' ''

		Among the Latin authors thus far selected for translation , one volume is devoted to the elegies of Propertius , whose four books have been done into English prose by Mr.
H. E. Butler	PERSON	, of
the University of London	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work has been carefully executed , his close adhesion to the Latin text being chosen by the translator even where , in his own words , `` a free paraphrase would have been in many ways preferable . ''

		A single volume , also , garners the riches of Catullus , whose 116 poems and fragments are translated by Mr.
F. W. Cornish	PERSON	, the Vice - provost of
Eton	LOCATION	; of Tibullus , whose three books of elegiacs have found a scholarly interpreter in Professor
J. P. Postgate	PERSON	; and of the little poem which has come down to us under the name of the
Pervigilium Veneris	PERSON	.

		The two Latin poets are well known to all scholars and lovers of the genus lyricum ; and it is safe to say that these two translations will widely and permanently extend the circle of their admirers .

		The Pervigilium , however , is a less familiar name even to the classically disposed reader .

		Its twenty-two quatrains , with their haunting refrain , exist in two MSS. , one of the seventh , the other of the ninth century ; but its original date , authorship , and provenance are alike un - known .

		Professor
J. W. Mackail	PERSON	, the transla - tor , has given to the title the felicitous English equivalent `` The Eve of
St. Venus	LOCATION	'' ; and has done for the unknown poet of the fourth century a service worthy of being compared with that of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	for Omar .

		Though nominally composed as an official piece for the trinoclium or popular festival of Venus , Professor
Mackail	PERSON	finds fantasy its prevailing motive , `` a summons which evokes imaginative associations , and sets the rhythm of poetry in movement round nature and history , love and life . ''

		He regards the poem as the beginning of the romantic move - ment .

		`` All the motives of the old classical poetry survive , yet all have undergone a new birth .

		... Poetry has gone back to childhood ; and has recovered , as though for one fleeting mo - ment and by the spell of a capricious enchanter , the key of
spring	DATE	, the freshness of morning , the innocence of youth . ''

		The opening line is used both as introduction and as refrain for the has - tening trochaic stanzas that follow ; one of which , with Professor
Mackail	PERSON	's prose-poetic version , may serve as an alluring specimen of the whole : `` Cras amet qui nunquam amavit quique amavit eras amet : ver novum , ver jam canorum , ver renatus orbis est ; vere concordant amores , vere nubunt alites , et nemus comam resolvit de maritis imbribus .

		Cras amet qui nunquam amavit quique amavit eras amet .

		* `` Tomorrow shall be love for the loveless , and for the lover tomorrow shall be love .

		Spring is young ,
spring	DATE	now is singing ,
spring	DATE	is the world reborn .

		In
spring	DATE	the loves make accord , in
spring	DATE	the birds mate , and the woodland looses her tresses under nuptial showers .

		Tomorrow shall be love for the loveless , and for the lover tomorrow shall be love . ''

		Four of the six ` extant plays of
Terence	PERSON	, pro- duced in the middle of the
second century B.C.	DATE	, were frank adaptations of the comedies of the Greek poet Menander , chief representative of the third period of Attic comedy the `` comedy of manners , '' which has remained to the present time the `` jus et norma loquendi '' of this form of drama .

		The translator , Mr.
J. Sargeaunt	PERSON	, in his introduction , defends
Terence	PERSON	from the charge of sameness in plot and characters by the natural observation that nothing else could be expected from plays dealing with `` a single epoch in a city -LRB-
Athens	LOCATION	-RRB- where life went easily and great events had ceased to occur . ''

		This recalls
Mommsen	PERSON	's words in speaking of the
New Attic	LOCATION	comedy : '' The pieces are of tiresome monotony .

		Almost without exception the plot turns on helping a young man , at the expense either of his father or some leno to obtain possession of a sweetheart of undoubted charms and of very doubtful morals .

		Love or amorous intrigue was the very life-breath of the Menandrian poetry ... Persons and situations recur down to the very details like patterns on a carpet ; we never get rid of the asides of unseen listeners , of knocking at the house-doors , and of slaves scouring the streets on some errand or other . ''

		The charge against
Terence	PERSON	that he is not Plautus is also perhaps unnecessarily re - futed by Mr.
Sargeaunt	PERSON	by pointing to the obvious fact that the Terentian comedy is in - tentionally sentimental , and that boisterous Plautine humor would be misplaced .

		He for - tifies this position by an apt reference to modern literature : '' There is a likeness between Miss
Bates	PERSON	and Mrs.
Nickleby	PERSON	.

		We laugh louder at 142 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, Mrs.
Nickleby	PERSON	, but
Miss Bates	LOCATION	is more true to life . ''

		The stage directions , which of course are wanting in the Latin original , are supplied from the copy made for the Westminster boys ' plays in
London	LOCATION	, and add much to the interest and usefulness of the translation .

		The version does not lack sprightliness ; by-words and colloquial - isms are supplied from copious modern British stores : e.g. , '' By Jove '' for ercle , '' Lor me '' for ecastor , '' Simple Simon '' for miser , '' Lord , Lord '' for ei mihi , and so on .

RENICK SMITH	PERSON	.

		RECENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE LITER - ATURE OF EDUCATION .

		* It is worthy of remark that many persons with fine literary feeling and skill seem to approach the discussion of educational problems in a pessimistic mood .

		Usually they appear to be entirely out of sympathy with contemporary educational theory and practice .

		They praise the ideals of bygone ages ; they deplore the degeneracy of the present ; they prophesy disaster for the future .

		And still some of these writers present sane views of the educational process .

		All this is true of the volume entitled `` A Valiant Woman . ''

		As one reads it , one is apt to feel despondent at times when the author points out what is regarded as the pathetic condition into which modern education has fallen .

		But at other times one feels hopeful and enthusi - astic , when the author depicts high ideals , and indi - cates what could be accomplished if we were rational and sincere in our treatment of the problems of studies , methods , and discipline .

		The anonymous author is apparently very well versed in educational classics , but seems to be entirely unfamiliar with present-day scientific writing on educational themes .

		He -LRB- or she -RRB- speaks in utter contempt of all '' peda - gogy , '' and then goes on to quote a large part of the classic writings upon which modern '' pedagogy '' is founded .

		He condemns the study of the child mind * A VALIANT WOMAN .

		and of educational methods , but devotes most of the book to depicting child nature and methods of teach - ing in a keen , sane , and delightful manner .

		The '' valiant woman '' was a teacher , who early came into the life of the author .

		In the first chapter are depicted her characteristics and her methods in man - aging an ungraded school in a
Middle Western	LOCATION	com - munity .

		The author first shows that everything that had been done before her time was wrong , the teaching was crude , formal , mechanical , verbal .

		But this woman introduced fresh methods .

		She made her work concrete and vital , so that it was attractive to the pupils .

		She was plain of dress and of features , but noble in intellect and magnanimous in spirit .

		The chief virtue of the book is that it presents sound educational principles in an unusually virile and at - tractive style .

		If the author had not permitted his sensibilities to be irritated by imperfections -LRB- many of them imaginary -RRB- in the world around him , and if he had been more largely constructive without decrying the tendencies of the times , his work would be signally distinguished among modern educational books .

		But even with its imperfections , it is a con - tribution of merit , not because it offers anything new , but because it presents in a captivating way many of the views and principles which all present - day leaders are striving to get adopted in our educational system .

		Professor
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	, of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, is thor - oughly optimistic about the whole business of edu - cation .

		He is himself very fond of teaching .

		He says he would rather teach than do anything else he can think of .

		He derives inspiration from give - and-take experiences with his students in the class - room .

		Unquestionably he knows how to awaken interest in the subject he teaches English literature and he is never bored by the duties of the class - room .

		According to him , there is no dull routine in teaching when one is en rapport with subject and students .

		Indeed , to him there is `` no profession more exciting , more stirring , more thrilling than teaching . ''

		Professor
Phelps	PERSON	's book is considerably more intimate than the majority of works upon this subject .

		It is concrete , specific , and practical throughout .

		Many faults in teaching are indicated , but never in a mood of despair .

		Professor
Phelps	PERSON	thinks that teaching to-day , in colleges especially , is very much better than it was formerly , with which opinion the reviewer heartily agrees .

		Persons who have not had technical training in educational sciences can read Professor
Phelps	PERSON	's book with pleas - ure .

		Not having studied educational theory , the author is not tempted to use specific terms , which , while more precise than the terms of every-day speech , are nevertheless not attractive to some read - ers .

		There is good cause for rejoicing when a man who is master of clear and graceful English , who is genuinely honest and sincere , and who is a `` born teacher , '' writes on the problems of the classroom ; for he can appeal to the novice and to the man of the world as a student of the sciences underlying education usually can not , because the latter con -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 143 stantly feels the necessity of using terms which have come to have specific meanings for those who are specialists in the fields in which he works .

		Mr. and Mrs.
Gesell	PERSON	have written an interesting volume on the training of young children .

		The authors are scientists in the best sense of the term .

		They have studied biology , evolution , and modern physiological and experimental psychology .

		They have also dealt directly with children , and have made numerous experiments in order to throw light upon some of the complex and peculiar traits of the char - acter and abilities of children .

		Unlike much of the study of children of recent times , the authors have confined their attention to the normal child .

		This does not mean that they think it possible exactly to define a `` normal '' child .

		They do not attempt to mark off precisely the normal from other kinds of children , and it is well that they do not worry over this problem .

		They say that of the -LRB- approximately -RRB- 17,000,000 children in the public schools of this country , only a small percentage are in special classes for the backward and the defective , and that the rest may be considered as '' normal . ''

		While this lacks precision , it is nevertheless the proper point of view to take in discussing the traits , abilities , and needs of the normal child .

		The book summarizes in an attractive way a considerable amount of modern science relating to child nature and child develop - ment .

		It is not an easy task , as anyone knows who has ever tried it , to present biological , evolutionary , and psychological sciences in dynamic and at the same time attractive English ; but the authors have succeeded in this in a large measure .

		Teachers of young children , even those who have not had much training in the biological sciences , might read this book with genuine pleasure and certainly with profit .

		There are some persons who claim that they can - not easily read President
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	's books , because of the bigness of his words and the complex character of his sentences .

		For this reason , doubt - less , Mr.
G. E. Partridge	PERSON	has thought it advisable to present his writings in a denatured form for the `` average reader . ''

		President
Hall	PERSON	has himself endorsed this enterprise , and has said that Mr.
Partridge	PERSON	has done his work well .

		The latter has certainly simplified the English of the original , and has undoubtedly managed in a skilful way to give his chief 's views on a great number of psychological and educational problems of present-day interest .

		President
Hall	PERSON	has been a leader among educators for twenty years at least .

		He has discussed practi - cally every question of general educational interest during this period .

		He has played a very important part in initiating reforms in teaching based upon biological and psychological principles .

		His views have been presented in several books and in a great number of magazine articles and addresses ; and it has been Mr.
Partridge	PERSON	's work to digest all these , to get at the substance of each , and to present this sub - stance in as simple terms as he could .

		The book is designed for the layman , and for the novice in teach - ing who would not venture to read Hall in the orig - inal .

		The only fault the present reviewer can find with the book is that it seems a little monotonous ; but probably this defect could not be avoided , the author was compelled to confine himself to sum - maries and condensations .

		Many writers seem to find it impossible to treat the subject of education logically and comprehen - sively without being rather formal and schematic .

		But Professor
Paul Klapper	PERSON	has achieved a large measure of success in avoiding this danger .

		He has discussed the meaning and function of education , and the physiological , sociological , intellectual , emo - tional , and volitional aspects of education as a pro- cess of perfecting adjustment to one 's environment .

		He has produced a substantial volume , and a useful one .

		Its purpose is not to present new data for a science of education , but rather to organize existing data derived from the various sciences , and to show how they relate to problems of educational values and methods .

		This is now a favorite task of educa - tional writers ; they approach their subject from the standpoint of biological , evolutionary , sociological , and psychological science .

		Professor
Klapper	PERSON	re - veals a familiarity with as much of these sciences as seems to bear upon the problems of making a cur - riculum , presenting studies effectively , and organiz - ing and disciplining a school properly .

		In an older day , educational writers assumed that the aim of education was to impart culture to the individual , or to discipline his mental faculties , or to develop his character , or to prepare him for earning his daily bread , or otherwise .

		But more recently students of education have been taking the view that the chief concern of a human being is to adjust himself har - moniously to his social and physical environment , and the whole business of education is to assist him in accomplishing this in the most complete and effec - tive way possible .

		Professor
Klapper	PERSON	takes this view of the educational process .

		But adjustment means to him not so much that the individual should adapt himself to the world as he finds it at any time or place , as that he should transform it to minister to his needs .

		While the book deals with rather heavy subjects , and its logical completeness may cause the novice to suspect that it is not adapted to his needs , nevertheless the principles are presented in a simple and direct way , with only slight use of technical terms .

		The author has a happy manner of illustrat - ing his discussions with concrete examples , which will help the general reader and the novitiate to com - prehend what is being discussed , and also to enjoy it .

		At the same time , the book is designed primarily for the student , the one who has leisure to study the whole subject of education , and who can do consider - able parallel reading on the side .

		It is essentially a text-book .

		References are given at the end of each chapter to the most approved literature relating to the topics considered , and there is a good index at the close .

		Professor
John Adams	PERSON	has set himself a difficult task in tracing the evolution of educational theory .

		The purpose of Professor
Klapper	PERSON	's book , mentioned 144 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, above , is to present current theory and the scientific principles upon which it is based ; but Professor
Adams	PERSON	takes us back into the ancient world , and even into pre-historic times , and shows us what the people of that remote era thought about education .

		His book is philosophical , not practical .

		He ranks education as one branch of philosophy , and he treats it as such .

		He has read widely in philosophical lit - erature , and he has quoted from it freely .

		While it is not his aim to introduce the reader to modern views in any detail , nevertheless he shows that he is in sympathy with many fundamental tendencies in con - temporary education .

		The various theories of educa - tion are grouped into the naturalistic , the idealistic , and the mechanistic types .

		While this grouping is open to criticism , it is nevertheless of service in classi - fying the great variety of theories that have been proposed by educational writers .

		Professor
Adams	PERSON	endorses the naturalistic revolt against the conven - tionality and formalism which once dominated the educational world , and which still linger in some places .

		At the same time , he does not go to such lengths as does
Rousseau	PERSON	in exalting Nature , mak - ing her the sole arbiter of educational curricula and methods .

		His book does not aim to be critical so much as descriptive , so that a great deal of material is presented without much comment .

		Professor
Adams	PERSON	can , when he wishes to do so , make use of a spirited and brilliant style , as he has shown in some of his previous books .

		In the work before us , how - ever , he has chosen to employ a somewhat heavy style , in which technical terms are used frequently , - and in which no liberties are taken with direct pre - sentation of data .

		It is a book for the serious-minded student of educational philosophy .

		The general reader and the novice will probably not bring enough to the reading of the book to find it absorbing .

		It will make a useful text , to be worked through rather leisurely and in a thoroughgoing manner .

		There are certain fundamental principles of educational aims , values , and methods which are accepted to-day by all serious students of education in
America	LOCATION	.

		For the most part these principles have been worked out from the standpoints of modern psy - chology , biology , and sociology .

		Professor
Edward L. Thorndike	PERSON	has played an important role in the development of these elementary principles .

		His approach to education has been from the standpoint of what one might call a psychological naturalist .

		His latest book is written from this point of view .

		His purpose is to discuss in the simplest way possible many of the problems in which educational people are interested to-day .

		He writes as one who is mas - ter of his subject , and who does not need to exhibit his learning in the use of technical terms or in a grand and formal style .

		The book reminds one of
William James	PERSON	's '' Talks to Teachers '' ; Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	talks on education in much the same in - formal but helpful manner , so that even the novice may comprehend and enjoy what he writes .

		The volume is characterized not alone by simplicity , but also by a lack of positive dogmatic statements .

		There are two sides to every question in modern education .

		As a rule , Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	presents in brief the arguments on both sides , and then suggests what is probably the right attitude for the teacher to take .

		The teacher who appropriates the contents of this book will understand modern tendencies in educa - tional theory and practice , but he will not be too dogmatic in his beliefs .

		Recently Mr.
William H. Maxwell	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of his work as a superintendent .

		In commemoration of this event , a committee collected and edited a large num - ber of his reports and addresses , and these are now published in book form .

		They indicate the prom - inent part Mr.
Maxwell	PERSON	has played in the improve - ments which have been introduced into the public school system of
America	LOCATION	during the
last quarter	DATE	of a century .

		They deal with a great variety of inter - esting and important topics .

		The hand of the practi - cal superintendent is apparent in them all .

		He has been charged with tremendous responsibilities in ad - ministering great systems of schools , first in
Brooklyn	LOCATION	and afterward in
Greater New York	LOCATION	.

		But while primarily an administrator , he has also been a stu - dent of educational principles and educational pro- gress . ''

		A
Quarter Century of Public School Devel	ORGANIZATION	- opment '' is practically a r6sum6 of what has been accomplished in the schools of
America	LOCATION	during the past twenty-five years .

		Mr.
Maxwell	PERSON	has been on the firing line all the time .

		He is a progressive who has been compelled to lead a great community to see the necessity for educational reform , and to make such reform feasible in an exceedingly complicated system of schools .

		This book will be illuminating to the layman who has not kept in touch with edu - cational development during the
past quarter	DATE	of a century , and it will also be of interest to teachers who are not familiar with the reforms wrought in school work during the past twenty-five years .

		Like the preceding book , Mr.
B. C. Gregory	PERSON	's '' Better Schools '' is written from the point of view of the superintendent who is charged with adminis - tering a system of schools , and who is concerned solely with securing definite results from the teach - ing .

		The seventeen chapters in this book originally appeared in whole or in part as letters written for a newspaper in the city in which Mr.
Gregory	PERSON	was chief educational officer .

		The purpose of these letters is to interpret the aims and methods of the public schools for the people of the community , and so the volume is unusually direct , concrete , and prac - tical .

		Mr.
Gregory	PERSON	attempts to justify the up-to - date curriculum of the elementary schools , and the means and methods of presenting studies to children of different ages .

		The principles underlying his curriculum and his methods are not essentially differ - ent from those presented in the books by Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	, Professor
Partridge	PERSON	, Professor
Klapper	PERSON	, Professor
Adams	PERSON	, and Professor and Mrs.
Gesell	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Gregory	PERSON	presents his views for the most part in clear , intelligible , and attractive English .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 145 BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Chapters from A warm appreciation of the noble the romance work done by our great inventors , of invention .

		an -LRB- j an unusually clear understanding of the technical details of that work , are shown by Mr.
George	PERSON	lies in his excellent book on '' Leading American Inventors '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , which appears in the series of '' Biographies of Leading Americans , '' edited by Professor
W. P. Trent	PERSON	.

		The thirteen illustrious names in the book 's table of contents are the following :
John	PERSON	and
Robert L. Stevens	PERSON	,
Fulton	LOCATION	,
Whitney	LOCATION	,
Thomas Blanchard	PERSON	,
Morse	PERSON	,
Goodyear	ORGANIZATION	,
Ericsson	ORGANIZATION	,
McCormick	PERSON	,
Christopher L. Sholes	PERSON	,
Elias Howe	PERSON	,
Benjamin C. Tilghman	PERSON	, and
Ottmar Mergen	PERSON	- thaler .

		It will be seen that no living inventor is included in the list .

		The amount of new informa - tion collected by the author gives his book special value and interest ; and the manner in which each life-drama is presented arrests and holds the reader 's attention .

		Most moving of all the biographies is that of
Goodyear	ORGANIZATION	, of India-rubber renown .

		Long years of persistent experiment and diminishing health and resources preceded the final discovery of vulcanization , without which rubber gum is about as useless for manufacturing purposes as so much tar .

		Goodyear at the lowest ebb of his fortunes is thus pictured for us : '' Here , indeed , stood a hero , un - sustained by the excitement and pomp of a battle - field , continuing a fight as faithfully as ever did an enlisted champion .

		Day after day , cold and hungry in a dingy room , he kept up his tests of new com - pounds , sustained as firmly as if he distinctly beheld what the next few months would unfold to his view . ''

		As an instance of original research on the author 's part , we may cite his unearthing of what appears to be the earliest record of the action of sand discharged in a jet of steam .

		It was
Tilghman	PERSON	's chance wit - nessing of this accidental sand-blast that led him to perfect the process now so important in many in - dustries .

		Illustrations and diagrams elucidate the technical parts of the book , and portraits and other pictorial accompaniments add to its interest .

		FannvBurnev li j s less than a year ago that we a * a royal reviewed Professor Tinker 's inter - maid of honor .

		es ting compilation of those passages in the diary and letters of
Fanny Burney	ORGANIZATION	which relate to the association and intimate friendship of that vivacious and fascinating young lady and the always formidable , but in this instance the capti - vated and docile , Doctor
Johnson	PERSON	.

		The next episode in this sprightly creature 's rather notable career is now attractively set forth in a new work by Miss
Constance Hill	PERSON	, entitled ``
Fanny Burney	PERSON	at the Court of Queen Charlotte '' -LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This book constitutes a link between two other volumes by the same author : `` The House in
St. Martin	LOCATION	Street '' and `` Juniper Hall . ''

		All of these books draw their material mainly from the famous diary and letters of Madame D'Arblay a work so volu - minous that the modern reader , even if not repelled by the old-fashioned formality of the title itself , is hardly likely to seek an introduction to `` little
Burney	PERSON	, '' charming though she is , through such a bulky medium .

		Miss Hill gives a complete and fairly definite narrative of
Fanny	ORGANIZATION	's experience at court .

		Her picture of the royal household is a pleasing one .

		The gracious qualities of good Queen
Charlotte	LOCATION	are intimately described , the little prin - cesses appear most winsome , and
George III	PERSON	.

		is presented in a very amiable light .

		The horrid Mrs.
Schwellenberg	PERSON	, first lady of the wardrobe , `` Cerbera , '' as Fanny nicknamed her , appears in colors appropriate to her reputation .

		If it had not been for her vixenish temper ,
Miss Burney	PERSON	's expe - riences as maid of honor might have been happy enough in spite of the strenuous programme and the tedious hours of her official position .

		It is impossible to read any of
Fanny Burney	ORGANIZATION	's letters without being impressed by her dramatic skill in narrative : she vivifies every scene .

		Fanny herself , of course , is the interesting figure always , and she easily holds the centre of the stage .

		She is engag - ingly na'ive , though we wonder sometimes if her uncontrollable diffidence is not more or less a pose ; and we are justified , no doubt , in attributing the '' sensibility '' which she displays and laughs at so heartily in others to the sentimentalism of that period .

		Miss Hill gives some prominence to the incident of
Warren Hastings	PERSON	's impeachment , and presents us with a dramatic picture of that famous trial in one of the most vivid chapters in the book .

		The illustrations are numerous and effective .

		In - cidentally we note an odd mistake in the mention of ``
John Adam	PERSON	-LSB- _ sic -RSB- , one of the founders of the Republic -LSB- the
United States	LOCATION	-RSB- , and its first Envoy to the British Court . ''

		That wilderness sport may be gen - u j ne w ithout being bloodthirsty , is evidenced in Mr.
A. R. Dugmore	PERSON	's '' Wild Life and the Camera '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , which recounts the successes -LRB- not without difficulties sur - mounted -RRB- which have rewarded the author 's per - sistent efforts to record on photographic plates the forms and actions of beast and bird of our forests and streams .

		The book is a collection of essays portraying in so entertaining a manner the charms of this humane form of hunting that it is to be hoped it may be effective in turning many devotees of the rifle and shot-gun from these weapons of destruction to the camera .

		From his long and varied experience the author tells us of his success in taming and photographing bluebirds , chicadees , warblers , vireos , woodcock , mallards , geese , and the whistling swan , and of his efforts to photograph the porcupine and opossum .

		Other chapters recount his fishing ad - ventures with the sea-trout in
New Brunswick	LOCATION	, the salmon in
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, the yellowtail off
Catalina Island	LOCATION	, and the golden trout in the
High Sierras	LOCATION	.

		All lovers of the gentle art of angling will rejoice in Mr.
Dugmore	PERSON	's too brief account of the superb attractions of the
Kern River	LOCATION	region , and the glori - 146 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, ous sport to be had there with the golden trout , which in point of beauty easily holds the palm against all competitors among the fresh water fish of
America	LOCATION	.

		Some minor statements in the text of this chapter challenge the attention of those familiar with the Sierras : for example , that no horse of the plains could do the work of the '' mountain ponies , '' when as a matter of fact these latter are drafted every
summer	DATE	from the valley .

		Again , the author states that the golden trout is found in but one stream , and that it seldom weighs over half a pound ; whereas it has for years been distributed among a number of streams and lakes in the Mt.
Whitney	PERSON	region , and records of not less than four pounds are known .

		The use of the term `` median '' for `` lateral '' line will trouble ichythyologists , and `` lupin '' for `` lupine '' will distress all lovers of these beautiful treasures of blue . ''


San Louis Bay	LOCATION	'' for '' San Luis Rey '' and Salmo iridens for Salmo irideus are doubtless typo - graphical oversights ; but '' St.
Joachim	PERSON	'' for ''
San Joaquin	LOCATION	'' violates geographical , historical , and local canons of taste , and has neither custom nor euphony to defend it .

		The author 's fine series of photographs of the migrating caribou of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, secured on his sixth trip for the purpose , are unique and unusually interesting .

		Misdirections for bird photog - raphy , and for camping in
summer	DATE	and
winter	DATE	, will appeal to a wide range of enthusiasts ; and his revelations of snow-tracks should revive pleasant memories in the hearts of all lovers of winter woods .

		The illustrations , consisting of fifty full-page plates , are unusually fine .

		Ante leiium Since the appearance of
George W.	PERSON	days in Cable 's '' Old Creole Days , '' in
1879	DATE	,
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		there has been a persistent interest in
New Orleans	LOCATION	, and a continued demand for stories , reminiscences , and serious history dealing with the life that was lived there .

		In many ways this interest has been met , though a second Cable has not arisen to re - work the old vein or discover a new one ; and the life of the most European of American cities , at least as it was in its most romantic epoch , still appears to the world just as
Cable	ORGANIZATION	represented it .

		Mrs.
Eliza Ripley	PERSON	, in her book entitled '' Social Life in Old New Orleans '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , limits herself to a description of
New Orleans	LOCATION	society in the narrower sense , and thus her work can not compare with that of her dis - tinguished predecessor , though it is both interesting and important , even to the serious student of history .

		There is a certain flavor and directness about the style that is most entertaining , reminding one of the writings of Mrs.
Roger Pry	PERSON	or .

		Mrs.
Ripley	PERSON	was a part of the life she deals with , and she loves the people , the ideals , and the antiquities of ante-bellum
New Orleans	LOCATION	quite as much as the charming Vir - ginian writer loved her `` ancient Dominion . ''

		Both of these women are pleaders of causes , but those causes were so interesting and the manners of the long-since vanquished '' lords and ladies '' of the old South so attractive that one never wearies of reading and re-reading their story .

		Still Mrs.
Ripley	PERSON	does not descend to mere eulogy and panegyric , though her love for the queer streets and strange ways of the '' French quarter , '' for the unique markets , and the ever-present negro slave , often tempt her near to the border line .

		She delights to linger at old - fashioned places to reproduce for the reader con - versations with long-forgotten people , people '' of quality '' whose praises she never tires of singing .

		Most of the old families of
New Orleans	LOCATION	, at the time when negro slaves were many and negro manners were obsequious , appear in these chapters the
Beauregards	LOCATION	,
Kennedys	LOCATION	,
Slidells	PERSON	, and many others .

		And the great balls , the elaborate wedding festivals , the whole procession of a luxurious -LRB- for that time -RRB- and thoroughly self-conscious life , are brought be - fore the reader .

		Children and their ways , boarding schools , mural decorations for the great houses , steamboats and hotels , plantation life , and the sad tale of war and exile , all have their place .

		There are many wood-cuts , engravings , and daguerreotypes to vivify the unconventional narrative .

		Though the value of the book as `` source material '' for the his - torian is somewhat weakened by the absence of actual and authenticated facts of social and political importance , there is much that will enable the dis - criminating student to obtain a fairly correct view of old
New Orleans	LOCATION	life in the days '' before the deluge '' as many Southerners still term the war between the states .

		Thefaiiacu entitled `` The Dem - of short ocratic Mistake '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , Mr. political tenures .


Arthur George Sedgwick	PERSON	,
Godkin	PERSON	Lecturer at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1909	DATE	, attacks-the old Demo - cratic fallacy of
Jefferson	PERSON	and his followers , that the best means of securing responsibility in govern - ment is through frequent elections and short terms .

		On the contrary , says Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	, such a system in practice produces the machine and leads to irresponsibility and inefficiency .

		You can not get a responsible man for a post involving the exercise of authority , he says , by telling him that he will be displaced by a new appointee at the end of two years .

		This is not the method of successful private business , and it will not work in public business .

		The professions of the politicians that the need of the hour is more democratization he pronounces as pure demagogy .

		If frequency of elections and short terms were a safeguard against misgovern - ment , the people of
New York	LOCATION	would be better pro- tected than any other people in the world , for they have annual legislative sessions , frequent elections , and there is probably no other place in the world where the people vote for so many candidates in the course of a year .

		But , in fact , the government of the state is , says Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	, parcelled out by a close corporation , or rather two close corporations , neither of which is , in any real sense , responsible .

		The true theory , according to Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	, is that real respon - sibility , the responsibility that secures efficiency , can be obtained only through security of tenure , as is the case in private business , where this practice is
1913	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 147 of universal application .

		The fact is , short tenures and frequent elections have led to a breaking down of responsibility , and the way to restore it is through their opposites .

		Fortunately , says Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	, the organization of the Federal government , in which the elective principle plays little part , rests on the true theory , and much of the success that has attended its administration is due to this .

		Unquestionably , the author has pointed out one of the most fallacious political ideas that has ever gained a foothold in our democracy , and his argu - ment in favor of the principle followed in private business is logical and convincing .

		Thinking men everywhere will agree that the remedy he proposes is sound , and at the same time not necessarily incon - sistent with the principles of true democracy .

		More of ^ ^ e already considerable number Mrs.
Eraser	PERSON	's of volumes of reminiscences written reminiscences .

		^ diplomats ' wives there is now added the third work of the kind from the fertile pen of Mrs.
Hugh Fraser	PERSON	. ''

		Reminiscences of a
Diplomatist	ORGANIZATION	's Wife '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- fills in some of the gaps left open in '' A
Diplomatist	ORGANIZATION	's Wife in
Japan	LOCATION	'' and '' A
Diplomatist	ORGANIZATION	's Wife in Many Lands . ''

		The late
Hugh Eraser	PERSON	's duties to his government called him , first and last , to many parts of the world to
China	LOCATION	and
South America	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, as well as to various courts of
Europe	LOCATION	and Mrs.
Fraser	PERSON	enjoyed with him the advantages of this method of introduction to many social circles in many capitals .

		Personages of note in public life pass across her pages , and now and then a man or woman of lesser note with whom one likes to come into familiar contact gives interest to the narrative .

		In her latest volume Mrs.
Fraser	PERSON	lays her scene chiefly in
Italy	LOCATION	, with the figure of her brother ,
Marion Crawford	PERSON	, much in the foreground , at his spacious seaside villa at
Sorrento	LOCATION	.

		England ,
Polish Prussia	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	, and
Chile	LOCATION	serve also as the setting of sundry interesting pictures of the past .

		A sketch of
Crawford	ORGANIZATION	's study , '' that great upper room , with its many windows and its wide door leading to the terrace , which was in reality the roof of the house , '' is drawn in a few lines ; and repeatedly the occupant of that study is exhibited in some character - istic act or utterance by the admiring sister .

		Por - traits of Mrs.
Fraser	PERSON	, of her husband , and of her brother are to be found in the book .

		The favor with which its predecessors in the series were received , and the demand for another volume , led the writer , as she tells us in her preface , to give forth this agree - able continuation of her random retrospections .

		In a new book of essays , entitled Some towering , , .

		, , .

		y - , , , , - f , .

		i \ personalities .

		AU Manner of Folk -LRB- Kennerley -RRB- , Mr.
Holbrook Jackson	PERSON	interprets the messages of a dozen or more modern artists and thinkers , prefacing these studies with a few essays more general in theme : '' Concerning Personalities , '' `` Lords of Whim , '' `` Masters of Nonsense , '' `` Of the Self-Sufficient , '' and `` Vagabonds . ''

		These opening essays , and particularly the first two of them , serve to suggest the dominating note of the whole book .

		It is personality that interests Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	; though his subjects range from the airily brilliant
Max Beerbohm	PERSON	and the self-sufficient
Whistler	LOCATION	, to the `` suggestive heterodoxy '' of
Edward Carpenter	PERSON	, the `` Americanism '' of Whitman , and the Social Democ - racy of
Henry M. Hyndman	PERSON	, all are united by their possession of dominating , towering personalities , and by their belief -LRB- sometimes , perhaps , unconscious -RRB- in the modern gospel of individualism .

		Of the `` in - comparable ''
Max Beerbohm	PERSON	Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	writes : '' Cleverness and brilliance are the tricks of the lit - erary huckster , and to see only these characteristics in
Max	ORGANIZATION	is not to see him at all .


Max Beerbohm	PERSON	is first and foremost a personality ; a point of view . ''

		Again , he says of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	: `` Whitman is more than a mere literary phenomenon : he is a symbol and a prophecy .

		His personality combines all that is momentous and enduring in a complex and cosmopolitan community .

		By his life no less than by his work , he is the interpreter and expositor of his land and race . ''

		And the essay on
William Morris	PERSON	opens with this spirited challenge : `` There are those who would separate the ideas of
William Morris	PERSON	from his art ... They are not entitled to do so on the authority of
William Morris	PERSON	.

		No artist appreciated better than he the interdependence of art , ideas , and affairs . ''

		It is this virile note , this insistence upon the ideas back of the art , the man behind the poems or pictures or social philosophy , that gives Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's criticism something of the personality and power that he looks for in the life and art he interprets , and that is winning for him friends and admirers with each new volume that he gives us .

		Drawings by Messrs.
Joseph Simpson	PERSON	,
Gordon Craig	PERSON	,
Jo Davidson	PERSON	,
J. B. Yeats	PERSON	, and
Lovat Fraser	PERSON	furnish illustrations of unique interest .

		The name of
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	in the title of a book on the Civil War is sure to awaken interest and breed a desire to make the book 's nearer acquaintance .

		`` One of
Jackson	PERSON	's Foot Cavalry '' -LRB- Neale -RRB- , by Mr.
John H. Worsham	PERSON	, makes a double claim on the reader 's curiosity .

		Why `` foot '' cavalry , and what new stories of the redoubtable Confederate general may the book contain ?

		It was the twenty-first regiment ,
Virginia	LOCATION	infantry , that by its steady , com - pact , and rapid marching won the name of
Jackson 's Foot Cavalry	ORGANIZATION	.

		It formed a part of the famous
Second Brigade	ORGANIZATION	, which saw some of the hardest service of the entire war , in the brilliant Valley Campaign , the memorable and sanguinary Seven Days ' Campaign , and the
Maryland	LOCATION	Campaign .

		Mr.
Worsham	PERSON	enlisted in Company F of this gallant regiment at the beginning of the war , rose by suc - cessive promotions to the adjutancy of the regiment in
1864	DATE	, but was wounded and permanently dis - abled a week later at
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	.

		His narrative is that of one viewing no extended field of military operations , but unassumingly doing the nearest duty and acquitting himself well in his allotted place .

		Campaigning with
Jackson	PERSON	, 148 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	r Here is his picture of
Jackson	PERSON	at
Fredericksburg	LOCATION	: `` Gen.
Jackson	PERSON	soon made his appearance along the line with a cavalcade of officers following him .

		He was dressed in a brand-new uniform , with the usual gold lace trimmings for a lieutenant general .

		He even had exchanged the old gray cap for a new bespangled one , and looked so unlike our ' Old
Jack	PERSON	' that very few noticed him , and none recognized him until he had passed .

		Then the old accustomed cheer to him went up with unusual vigor ! ''

		The whole story of this campaigning with
Jackson	PERSON	is well told .

		One would have liked to find a portrait of the author among those given , but his modesty has deprived the reader of that satisfaction .

		Songs with music Delicious nonsense verses , set to for children charmingly original melodies , both and others .

		text an ^ mus i c the work of Mrs.
Louise Ayres Garnett	PERSON	, are given us in a volume of `` Creature Songs , '' published by the
Oliver Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		As if this were not enough , we are given for good measure a series of illustrative drawings , sym - pathetic in their humorous interpretation , by Mr.
Peter Newell	PERSON	.

		One of the three aspects of this de - lightful book may be exhibited here : '' The Quadruped is just a beast , With legs at north , west , south , and east .

		Perhaps he longs to have some more , And yet he seems content with four . ''

		The Biped has a sorry lot , For only two legs has he got .

		He feels ashamed and hangs his head Whene'er he meets the Quadruped . ''

		Here is another merry little quip : '' To wear a pair of Garter Snakes Would make me ill at ease ; Perhaps they were created for The Aborigiknees . ''

		A nicer book for children is not often to be found .

		The same publishers send us , in their `` Musicians ' Library , '' a collection of `` Forty Songs by
Peter Ilyitch Tschaikowsky	PERSON	, '' for high voice , edited by Mr.
James Huneker	PERSON	, who prefaces them by a bio - graphical and critical introduction , done in a some - what less staccato style than is usual with this writer . ''

		Reticent in life , in his art he overflows .

		No com - poser except
Schumann	PERSON	tells us so much of himself .

		Every piece of his work is signed , and he does not hesitate to make the most astounding confessions . ''

		Of the songs , Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	says : '' He has left over a hundred lyrics , a dozen of which place him in the angelic choir led by
Franz Schubert	PERSON	, and composed of
Schumann	LOCATION	,
Robert Franz	PERSON	,
Brahms	PERSON	, and
Richard Strauss	PERSON	, '' which is probably not an over-statement .

		The memoirs The once popular French actress of a famous familiar to her host of admirers as French actress .

		Ma -LRB- j ame
Judith	PERSON	, but known to her smaller circle of friends as
Julie Bernat	PERSON	and , after her marriage , as
Madame Bernard-Derosne	ORGANIZATION	, leaves us her anecdotal and at times amusingly frank reminis - cences in an entertaining volume entitled `` My Auto - biography '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Contemporary with
Rachel	PERSON	, with whom she was intimate from childhood ,
Julie Bernat	PERSON	took to the stage as a duck to water , and in
1833	DATE	, at the age of six , she performed a juvenile part at the Panthe'on , to the vociferous delight of the students in attendance .

		Her formal debut as an actress took place at
Les Folies	ORGANIZATION	nine years later , and in
1846	DATE	she joined the Theatre francais .

		Some still living will recall her effective rendering of the parts of P ^ ne ` lope ,
Alcmene	PERSON	,
Rosine	PERSON	,
Charlotte Corday	LOCATION	, and Mile .

		Aiss ^ .

		She mastered the English language sufficiently to appear on the Manchester stage with credit to herself and acceptably to her audience .

		The little vanities and jealousies of her profession are not unapparent in her narrative , which for that reason is probably all the more entertaining .

		Inci - dentally she makes it very plain that the great
Rachel	PERSON	r the tragedienne whose word and gesture could thrill a houseful of entranced play-goers , was a very human and sufficiently spiteful and vindictive woman ; and it is not unlikely that
Rachel	PERSON	would have felt herself equal to the task of returning the compliment .

		Many famous characters of an eventful period in French history appear in
Madame Judith	ORGANIZATION	's pages .

		The book is well translated by Mrs.
Arthur Bell	PERSON	, edited by Mr.
Paul G'Sell	PERSON	, and adorned with a frontispiece portrait of its captivating heroine .

		Memories The Scottish novelist , Mrs.
L. B. of Victorian Walford	PERSON	, whose '' Recollections '' ap - ceiebrities .

		peared some years ago , has now published a by-product of that book , '' Memories of Victorian London '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		In an excessively loose and gossipy manner , she relates the social life in which , as a guest of her friend `` Mary , '' she took part in the
London	LOCATION	that is no more ; emphasizing , with good judgment , her acquaintance with men and women who are , in another way , acquaintances of the reader .

		Carlyle , Mrs.

		Of course we attend one of the inevitable
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	breakfast - parties , this time the host is glum .

		We also meet ''
George Eliot	PERSON	, with her large head , and rather horse - like face . ''

		Mrs.
Darwin	PERSON	hears , from her cook , that her worthy husband is an idle man , '' I see him in the garden yesterday sitting staring at a leaf over two hours ! ''

		Carlyle lifts his shaggy head from the pillow and thunders `` Doctor ?

		I 'm for none of your doctors .

		Of all the sons of
Adam	PERSON	, men of medicine are the most unprofitable '' ; and the terrified phy - sician retreats , and
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	is so roused by the visit that `` it put fresh spirit into him , and he began at once to get better . ''

		Ah , those were days !

		Small wonder that the novel , for instance , is not what it was : `` when great , strong notes were struck , though it might be harshly and crudely , they vibrated

		They do not smite , and we do not kiss , now . ''

		That well-known bird-lover and writer about birds ,
Bradford Torrey	PERSON	, who died rather suddenly and at much too early an age , last
October	DATE	, at
Santa Barbara	LOCATION	, had sent the material for his last book to the publishers a few weeks before his death . ''

		Field - Days in
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- collects in attractive and well - illustrated book form a number of sketches already published in periodicals , with some new ones .

		They tell us about the author 's first condor and first water - ouzels , his '' exciting forenoon '' with a yellow-legged plover , the happy issue of an unsuccessful hunt , a walking tour in the
Yosemite	LOCATION	, the attractions of a
California	LOCATION	beach , a visit to the redwood grove near
Santa Cruz	LOCATION	, and other things well worth reading about in Mr.
Torrey	PERSON	's genial , fresh-air-and-sunshine style .

		One of his chapters , of a bookish sort , for a change , enlarges on the pleasures of reading a check - list , and will appeal to the man of books .

		The au - thor was not quite sixty-nine when his field-days were cut short an age that now represents the prime of a man 's life .

		To give his final volume something of a memorial character , the publishers have provided it with a good portrait of the author and illustrations of some of his
California	LOCATION	haunts that are treated in the book , and that , in two instances , show an open-air view of Mr.
Torrey	PERSON	.

		His friends and admirers will prize the little volume .

China	LOCATION	's Revolution '' -LRB- McBride -RRB- , by Mr.
Edwin J. Dingle	PERSON	, can scarcely be said to fulfill the expectations aroused by its subtitle , '' a historical and political rec - ord of the civil war . ''

		The best chapters in the book are those narrating events and describing scenes of the war at
Hankow	LOCATION	, from which city Mr.
Dingle	PERSON	was reporting .

		These chapters are interesting and valuable .

		The rest of the book indicates insufficient breadth of knowledge and only moderate grasp of the problems of the present in
China	LOCATION	.

		The style is decidedly journalistic . ''

		Fundamentals of French Grammar '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , by Mr.
William B. Snow	PERSON	, is a practical text-book b ` ased upon the inductive method , which has many points of excel - lence , and which does not overburden the student with grammatical material . ''

		What might reasonably be omitted '' has been the author 's chief concern . ''

		Essen - tials of French '' by Dr.
Victor E. Francois	PERSON	is a '' slowly progressive grammar '' published by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	'' Moliere en Re ` cits '' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is a title that ex - plains itself .

		It is the joint work of Messrs.
M. L. Chapuzet	PERSON	and
W. M. Daniels	PERSON	, two English teachers .

		A few '' scenes for acting '' are appended .

		Moliere 's '' Les Prdcieuses Ridicules '' and `` Les Femmes Savantes '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- are edited for school use by Mrs.
John R. Effinger	PERSON	.

		A welcome addition to the series of '' Little Books on Art '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- is Miss
Muriel Ciolkowska	PERSON	's volume on
Rodin	LOCATION	.

		It gives one an interesting glimpse of the life and work of the greatest of living sculptors .

		Rodin 's relations to his predecessors , his obscure and difficult beginnings , his long struggle for recognition , his chief works and their occasions , his drawings and etchings and ceramic designs , are some of the topics taken up in this convenient little volume .

		The author gives a selection of the master 's opinions on art , and supports her esti - mate of his place among artists by abundant and inter - esting quotations from contemporary criticism .

		A list of
Rodin	ORGANIZATION	's exhibited works , a bibliography , and twenty - five illustrations complete a book which seems to be fairly accurate , despite the persistent neglect of Villon as the creator of that tragic figure of poesy embodied in '' La Vieille Hdaulmiere . ''

		For more than a decade the '' Oxford Book of En - glish Verse '' has held its own as the most widely popular of all anthologies with the possible exception of Palgrave 's '' Golden Treasury . ''

		The compiler , Sir
Arthur Quiller-Couch	PERSON	, now offers a companion volume , the '' Oxford Book of Victorian Verse , '' which covers the field from Landor to Mr.
Lascelles Abercrombie	PERSON	certainly an elastic interpretation of the Victorian boundaries .

		But elasticity of plan is a good principle for any anthologist , and probably most readers of this collection will be chiefly grateful for the generous space given to writers who have come to the front during the past quarter-century .

		Eighteen American poets are represented , usually with a poem or two apiece .

		This does not seem to us well-advised ; our writers should have been dealt with more adequately or else omitted altogether .

		However , after the shabby treatment ac - corded Whitman in Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's ''
Yale Book of American Verse	ORGANIZATION	'' a great deal can be forgiven an English editor who devotes eleven pages to '' the good gray poet . ''

		As must be inevitable with any anthology , the individual poetry-lover will grumble a little over what will seem to him errors of ` proportion or omission ; but his abiding feeling will be one of gratitude for such a wealth of treasure in so compact and beautiful a form .

		The volume is gracefully dedicated `` To my future friends and pupils at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, this propitiatory wreath . ''

		The delightful
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	reprints continue to multiply .

		Chief among the newest batch of volumes is a collected edition of
Robert Bridges	ORGANIZATION	's poetical works -LRB- exclusive of the dramas -RRB- .

		It is something of an honor to be the only living poet thus far included in the Oxford series ; but Mr.
Bridges	PERSON	is deserving of such distinction , and we hope this volume may widely extend his reputation .

		Next in interest is '' The Pageant of English Prose , '' made up of seven hundred pages of choice passages selected with rare good judgment by Mr.
R. M. Leonard	PERSON	.

		A third volume gives us the entire contents of the recent two - volume definitive edition of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's complete poems , edited by Mr.
Ernest Hartley Coleridge	PERSON	; a fourth contains
Browning	PERSON	's '' The Ring and the Book , '' with an introduction by Professor
Dowden	PERSON	; while the poems of
Adam Lindsay Gordon	PERSON	, the Australian writer , make up a fifth .

		The ordinary editions of these books are models of inexpensive bookmaking ; but those who care for luxurious perfection may obtain , for a little more than the price of the average novel , the same books printed on
India	LOCATION	paper , with limp covers and photogravure portraits .

		By means of these
Oxford India	ORGANIZATION	paper editions , authoritative texts of all that is of first importance in English literature may now be brought together almost on a single shelf of an ordinary bookcase , in a form that could not be excelled for beauty and dignity of workmanship , and at a price well within the means of any but the most impecunious of book - lovers .

MILLER	PERSON	.

		A year ago , the
National Institute of Arts and Letters	ORGANIZATION	bestowed its gold medal for poetry upon Mr.
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	, thereby ex - pressing the opinion that he was the most dis - tinguished of American poets then living .

		We might comment upon this grotesque award in considerable detail , instituting '' odorous '' com - parisons with quite a number of men who have better realized the high seriousness of the poet 's calling , and have avowed themselves servants of the muse to such effect that they have made no bid for vulgar applause , and have been content with the small but fit audience of '' them that know . ''

		But at present we will do no more than call attention to the fact that the award in question overlooked the fairly obvious title of another son of
Indiana	LOCATION	, whose place in the poeti - cal firmament was fixed long before Hoosier dialect '' had the cry '' in our literature , and whose light reached to the far places of the earth at a time when the number of American poets whose names had ever been heard of abroad might be counted on the fingers of one hand .

		The famous American poet who died on the seventeenth of this month was born in
Wabash District	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	, on the tenth of
November , 1841	DATE	.

		It is with something of a surprise that we realize that his years were no more than seventy-one , so long has he figured in our imag - ination as a venerable and almost legendary figure , and so far back seems the time when his `` Songs of the Sierras '' took the English - speaking world by storm .

		We have somehow acquired the habit of associating him with the other '' good gray poet '' whom he resembled in his amazing intellectual energy and his defiance of conventionality , and who was really more than a score of years his senior .

		He lived a hermit for so many years of his later life that his figure gradually assumed heroic proportions , and men - tion of his name recalled the distant past rather than the pulsating present of the world of men .

		Cincinnatus
Hiner	PERSON	-LRB- sometimes spelled
Heine	PERSON	-RRB-
Miller	PERSON	was the name with which his misguided parents did their best to handicap his career , and for which he substituted the more melodi - ous and fitting '' Joaquin '' when he commenced poet in the sense of publication .

		When a boy of tender years , he was taken by his family to 166 THE DIAL , -LSB-
March 3	DATE	,
Oregon	LOCATION	, which was his home until
1870	DATE	, except for the periods during which he became a wan - derer and an adventurer .

		The settled years of his
Oregon	ORGANIZATION	sojourn found him a student of
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	,
Portland	LOCATION	, from which he was graduated in
1858	DATE	as valedictorian , then a stu - dent and practitioner of law , then the editor of - a Democratic paper suppressed for sedition dur - ing the Civil War , then a county judge for four years .

		His vagrant years found him playing many parts
California	LOCATION	gold-miner , Indian sachem , and Spanish vaquero .

		It is reported , although we believe upon uncertain authority , that he was with
Walker	PERSON	on his filibustering expedition into
Nicaragua	LOCATION	.

		At all events , he made Walker the subject of one of his most striking poems .

		It was in 1870-71 that ``
Joaquin Miller	PERSON	'' became a name to conjure with wherever the English tongue was spoken .

		That was the year of his apotheosis , when he visited
England	LOCATION	, was welcomed by
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Swinburne	PERSON	, and
Rossetti	PERSON	as one of their company , and pub - lished in
London	LOCATION	his `` Songs of the Sierras . ''

		No American poet -LRB- except possibly
Longfellow	LOCATION	-RRB- had ever enjoyed such a vogue in
England	LOCATION	, or received such tributes of admiration from those most competent to appraise a poet .

		The day of Whitman was to come later , and
Poe	PERSON	had long been in his grave before his extraordinary
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean fame had come to fruition .

		But the recognition accorded
Miller	PERSON	was immediate and unstinted , and no American has better savoured the sweets of appreciation in a foreign land , or been made more fully conscious of the verdict of his '' contemporaneous posterity . ' '

		When his vol - ume was soon thereafter republished in
America	LOCATION	, his name was on every lip from
Cape Cod	LOCATION	to the Golden Gate , and his country rejoiced in the possession of a new and what seemed to be an authentic poet .


Miller	PERSON	was thus fairly plunged into the liter - ary career and , making his home in
Washington	LOCATION	after his return to the
United States	LOCATION	, became a prolific writer .

		Some of the works of the fol - lowing years were `` Songs of the Sunlands '' -LRB- 1873 -RRB- , '' Songs of the Desert '' -LRB- 1875 -RRB- , `` Songs of
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB- 1878 -RRB- , and `` Songs of the Mexican Seas '' -LRB-
1887	DATE	-RRB- .

		Besides these poems , there were two novels , `` The Baroness of
New York	LOCATION	'' -LRB- 1 87 7 -RRB- , and `` The Danites in the Sierras '' -LRB- 1881 -RRB- .

		In its dramatized form , this novel became '' The Danites , '' a very successful stage play .

		Thus for nearly a score of years ,
Miller	PERSON	was constantly before the public , was widely read , and known to all his countrymen .

		His translation to
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia in
1887	DATE	marked the decline of his vogue , a decline that left him in the closing years of his life little more than a legendary figure belonging to the tradition of the past .

		For this there are two chief reasons .

		The first is that his work deteriorated in quality , owing to the journalistic facility with which most of it was produced .

		The proportion of dross to pure metal grew steadily larger , and his verse tended to become more and more diffuse and unrestrained .

		The other reason is that his burst into fame resulted largely from the English recognition accorded him in 1870-71 .

		This was in part fictitious , resulting not so much from the feeling that he was a great poet on the absolute terms of poetry as from the fact that he lived up to the precon - ceived idea of what an American poet ought to be .

		As '' The Nation '' says : '' It is the volcanic or eccentric elements in our literature that
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope prefers to accept as typically
American Poe	ORGANIZATION	and Whitman in the spirit of their works ,
Bret Harte	PERSON	in his picturesque material , and
Joaquin Miller	PERSON	in his own picturesque person - ality of flowing mane , flannel shirt , and boots . ''

		In this country , we know enough to take such things at their worth , and to understand that they are anything but essential to the embodi - ment of the American spirit in literature .

		Raci - ness is a literary quality not to be undervalued , but it is not enough alone to save a man 's work from oblivion .

		When
Miller	PERSON	went to
California	LOCATION	in
1887	DATE	to establish his permanent home , he built a sort of communal dwelling on the heights above Oak - land , near
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		There were several small houses erected on the hillside for himself , the members of his family , and the guests who sought out his retreat for his hospitality was as generous and inclusive as that of Bjornson at Aulestad .

		Here he made a garden spot on the ungrateful soil , and lived out his last years in patriarchal retirement .

		Such a home had been the dream of his earlier years , and he had fore - shadowed it in these verses : '' I know a grassy slope above the sea , The utmost limit of the Western land .

		Here I shall sit in sunlit life 's decline Beneath my vine and sombre verdant tree .

		Some tawny maids in other tongues than mine Shall minister .

		Some memories shall be Before me .

		I shall sit and I shall see That last , vast day that dawn shall re-inspire , The sun fall down upon the farther sea , Fall wearied down to rest , and so retire , A splendid sinking isle of far-off fading fire . ''

		Mr.
F. W. Halsey	PERSON	, who visited him shortly after the poet had retreated from his visit to
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 167 the Klondike in the year of the great stampede , thus describes the poet as he then appeared : `` Imagine a man of tall , athletic build , with fine , dome-shaped brow ; long , tawny hair streaked with gray ; a tangle of yellow moustache and beard ; a strong , large , nose , sunburned like his cheeks , and clear , flashing gray-blue eyes that look out from under heavy , bushy eyebrows with the quickness and the eagerness of a boy 's .

		He looked as one fancies Kit
Carson	PERSON	looked when he guided Fre `` mont the Pathfinder through the hostile Indian country out to the Western sea .


Miller	PERSON	was dressed in a corduroy coat , trousers in boots , pongee shirt , with loose Japanese neck-scarf , and broad sombrero .

		The whole appearance of the man suggested his revolt against any restraint of costume , just as his talk suggests his warfare on conventionality and his delight in what is free and spontaneous in nature and life . ''

		Miller was by no means idle during the quarter-century of his hermit life in
California	LOCATION	, and , although the poetic fire was somewhat slackened , the output of verse did not cease .

		Some of his noblest poems , such as the
Tenny	PERSON	- son tribute and the
Columbus	LOCATION	song , date from this period of his life .

		Several years ago , he built for himself a funeral cairn of black flint , with hollowed top filled with logs , to serve as his funeral pyre , and there it was that the other day his ashes were returned to the elements .

		His third wife and their daughter
Juanita	PERSON	were with him to the end .

		Nothing in his life became him better than the leaving of it thus .

		Of his poetical gospel , the following quotations may give illustrative evidence : '' Exalt your theme rather than ask your theme to exalt you .

		Braver and better to celebrate the lowly and forgiving grasses under foot than the stately cedars and sequoias overhead .

		They can speak for them - selves .

		Be loyal to your craft , to your fellow scribes .

		I plead for something more than the individual hero .

		I plead for the entire republic .

		Not to have a glorious literature of our own is to be another
Nineveh	LOCATION	,
Babylon	LOCATION	,
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		Nothing ever has paid , nothing ever will pay a nation like poetry . ''

		Of
Miller	PERSON	's outlook upon life , and his appraisal of its values , the following exquisite poem gives an idea : '' Ah , there be souls none understand , Like clouds , they can not touch the land , Drive as they may by field or town , Then we look wise at this , and frown , And we cry < Fool ! '

		and cry < Take hold Of earth , and fashion gods of gold ! ' ''

		Unanchored ships , that blow and blow , Sail to and fro , and then go down In unknown seas that none shall know , Without one ripple of renown ; Poor drifting dreamers , sailing by , That seem to only live to die . ''

		Call these not fools , the test of worth Is not the hold you have of earth ; Lo , there be gentlest souls , sea blown , That know not any harbor known ; And it may be the reason is They touch on fairer shores than this . ''

		A GREAT LADY AND A GREAT TRADITION .


Alice Spencer	PERSON	was the sixth daughter of Sir
John Spencer	PERSON	, of
Althorp Manor	LOCATION	,
Northamptonshire	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1579	DATE	she married
Ferdinando Stanley	PERSON	-LRB- 1559 -LSB- ? -RSB-

		-
1594	DATE	-RRB- ,
Baron Strange	PERSON	and fifth
Earl of Derby	ORGANIZATION	.

		From
1589	DATE	to
1594	DATE
Baron Strange	ORGANIZATION	was patron of a company of actors known as `` Lord Strange 's com - pany , '' and directed for a time by
Edward Alleyn	PERSON	, son-in-law of
Philip Henslowe	PERSON	, business manager .

		Shakespeare was probably a member of this com - pany for some years before
1592	DATE	.

		In 1589
Robert Greene	PERSON	dedicated his `` Ciceronis Amor '' to
Baron Strange	ORGANIZATION	.


Thomas Nash	PERSON	has a panegyric on him in `` Piers Pennilesse , ''
1592	DATE	.


George Chapman	PERSON	, in the dedication , of his `` Shadow of the
Night	TIME	, ''
1594	DATE	, speaks of Stanley as `` that most ingenious Darbie . ''

		In
1595	DATE	the
Earl of Derby	ORGANIZATION	is the
Shepherd Amyntas	ORGANIZATION	in
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's `` Colin Clouts Come Home Againe , '' who ,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	writes , could `` pipe with passing skill . ''

		The only known poem by
Ferdinando Stanley	PERSON	is a pastoral of no great merit contributed by Sir
John Hawkins	PERSON	to
Grose	PERSON	's '' Antiquarian Repertory '' and reprinted in
Horace Walpole	PERSON	's `` Royal and Noble Authors . ''

		Six years after the death of the
Earl of Derby	ORGANIZATION	, in
1600	DATE	, his widow became the third wife of Sir
Thomas Egerton	PERSON	-LRB- 1540 -LSB- ? -RSB-

		-1617 -RRB- ,
Baron Ellesmere	PERSON	and
Viscount Brackley	PERSON	,
Lord Keeper of the Great Seal	ORGANIZATION	.

		But Lady
Egerton	PERSON	retained her title , and was known as the
Countess of Derby	ORGANIZATION	, until her death at
Harefield Manor	ORGANIZATION	,
January 26 , 1636	DATE	.

		Sir
Thomas Egerton	PERSON	was
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	's immediate pre - decessor as Lord Keeper of the Great Seal .


Ben Jonson	PERSON	wrote three epigrams in his honor ; and `` the silver-tongued ''
Joshua Sylvester	PERSON	, a sonnet .

		In
1603	DATE	,
Samuel Daniel	PERSON	, then tutor to Lady
Anne Clifford	PERSON	, wrote a poetical epistle to the Lord Chan - cellor , bewailing his `` misery , that whilst I should have written the actions of men , I have been con - strained to live with children . ''

		Beside
Daniel	PERSON	's com - plaint should stand Lady
Anne	PERSON	's appreciation of her tutor .

		A large family picture of the
Cliffords	PERSON	pre - serves
Daniel	PERSON	's portrait beside Lady
Anne Clifford	PERSON	's , while a detail of the painting shows a shelf on which
Daniel	PERSON	's poetical works stand next to
Spenser 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1596	DATE	Sir
John Davies	PERSON	-LRB- 1569-1626 -RRB- dedicated to Sir
Thomas Egerton	PERSON	his '' Orchestra , or a Poeme of Dancing . ''

		A copy of the first edition of '' Orchestra , '' with
Davies	PERSON	's dedicatory sonnet to
Lord Ellesmere	LOCATION	, in manuscript , beautifully written , is preserved at
Bridgewater House	ORGANIZATION	.

		The foundations of the great library at Bridge - 168 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, water
House	ORGANIZATION	were laid by
Lord Chancellor Elles	ORGANIZATION	- mere .

		Some of the books belonged to his third wife , the
Countess of Derby	ORGANIZATION	, who as
Alice Spencer	PERSON	and Lady Strange was a popular patron of literature .


John Egerton	PERSON	-LRB- 1579-1649 -RRB- , son of
Baron Elles	PERSON	- mere , became the first Earl of
Bridgewater	LOCATION	.

		Before him , as President of
Wales	LOCATION	, was presented Mil - ton 's '' Comus , '' at
Ludlow Castle	ORGANIZATION	,
Shropshire	PERSON	, on Michaelmas-Night ,
1634	DATE	.

		Bridgewater improved the great library left him by his father .

		His son ,
John Egerton	PERSON	-LRB- 1622-1683 -RRB- , second Earl of Bridge - water , is described by Sir
Henry Chauncy	PERSON	, historian of
Hertfordshire	LOCATION	, as '' a learned man '' who '' de - lighted much in his library . ''

		By her first husband , the
Countess of Derby	ORGANIZATION	had three daughters .

		Lady
Elizabeth Stanley	PERSON	married , in
June , 1603	DATE	,
Henry Lord Hastings	PERSON	, who succeeded his grandfather as
Earl of Huntingdon	ORGANIZATION	, in
1605	DATE	.

		Lady
Frances Stanley	PERSON	, about the time her mother married Sir
Thomas Egerton	PERSON	, married his son ,
John Egerton	PERSON	, created
Earl of Bridgewater	LOCATION	, 27
May , 1617	DATE	.

		Lady
Anne Stanley	PERSON	married
Grey Brydges	PERSON	, fifth Lord Chandos -LRB- 1579JTJ-1621 -RRB- .

		It is
Alice Spencer	PERSON	,
Countess of Derby	ORGANIZATION	, of whom
Thomas Warton	PERSON	wrote , `` The peerage-book of this countess is the poetry of her time . ''


Warton	PERSON	was thinking of the unique distinction of a lady to whom Spenser dedicated in her youth his `` Teares of the Muses , '' before whom and her guest , the Queen of
England	LOCATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's `` Othello '' was first pre - sented , and who lived to have
Milton	PERSON	write `` Ar - cades '' for an Entertainment to her at her house at
Harefield	LOCATION	.

		Warton might well have written , `` The peerage-book of this countess is the literature of her time , '' for Elizabethan literature is studded all over with dedications , epistles , and poetical laudations , which the Countess of Derby shared with her two husbands , with her three daughters , and with her grandchildren .

		A series of most interesting dedications and lit - erary memorabilia attest the interest in literature of the
Countess of Derby	ORGANIZATION	and her daughters and grandchildren .

		In
1591	DATE	Spenser dedicated to the
Countess of Derby	ORGANIZATION	, then Lady Strange , the poem of his '' Com - plaints , '' entitled `` The Teares of the Muses . ''

		As is known ,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	claimed kinship with the noble house of Spencer of
Althorp	LOCATION	.

		Whatever the relation - ship was , the dedication of this poem shows that it was acknowledged by the
Althorp Spencers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Spenser writes to Lady Strange : `` The causes for which ye have thus deserved of me to be honoured -LRB- if honour it be at all -RRB- are , both your particular bounties , and also some private bands of affinitie , which it hath pleased your Ladiship to acknowl - edge . ''

		In
1595	DATE	the
Countess of Derby	ORGANIZATION	, newly widowed , is Amaryllis mourning for her mate , the shepherd Amyntas , in
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's `` Colin Clouts Come Home Againe . ''

		Spenser 's tribute to the
Countess of Derby	ORGANIZATION	, as Amaryllis , is : ''
Shepheard	PERSON	, what ever them hast heard to be In this or that praysd diversly apart , In her thou maist them all assembled see , And seald up in the threasure of her hart . ''

		-LRB- lines 56S-571 . -RRB-

		Amyntas , the
Earl of Derby	ORGANIZATION	, is finely lamented : '' He , whilest he lived , was the noblest swaine , That ever piped in an oaten quill : Both did he other which could pipe maintaine , And eke could pipe himselfe with passing skill . ''

		-LRB- lines 440-443 . -RRB-

		In
1602	DATE	Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	paid a visit of four days ,
July 31	DATE	-
August 3	DATE	, to the
Lord Keeper	ORGANIZATION	, Sir
Thomas Egerton	PERSON	, and the
Countess of Derby	ORGANIZATION	, at their house ,
Harefield	LOCATION	, in
Middlesex	LOCATION	, about four miles north of
Uxbridge	LOCATION	, on the border of Bucks .

		The cost of the visit was not far short of
2000	DATE	i.e. , about 16,000 , present value .

		Part of this money was paid to `` Burbidges players for Othello , '' the first recorded performance of the tragedy .

		Whether Shakespeare accompanied `` Burbidges players '' to
Harefield	LOCATION	, or was one of them , is unknown ; but it is certainly likely that he was present at the first pre - sentation of his great play before the Queen .

		The Entertainment at
Harefield	LOCATION	on this occasion was written by
John Lyly	PERSON	.

		A contemporary manuscript of this Entertainment was owned , by Sir
Roger Newdigate	PERSON	, in
1803	DATE	, and was printed in
Nichols	PERSON	's `` Progresses of Queen Elizabeth '' from a copy made by the Rev.
Ralph Churton	PERSON	.

		In
1603	DATE	a set of verses on the death of Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	, entitled '' The Death of
Delia	LOCATION	, with Teares of her Funeral , '' was inscribed to the
Countess of Derby	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1605	DATE	a `` Countess of Derby '' was one of the noble ladies who assisted Queen
Anne	PERSON	in
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's masque of '' Blackness , '' `` personated at the Court of
Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	on
Twelfth Night	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It is not certain whether this was the Countess Dowager of Derby , or the wife of her late husband 's brother and successor ,
William Stanley	PERSON	, sixth
Earl of Derby	ORGANIZATION	.

		In 1607
John Marston	PERSON	wrote '' The Lord and
Lady Huntingdon	PERSON	's Entertainment of their Noble Mother ,
Alice Countess Dowager of Darby	ORGANIZATION	, the night of her honor 's arrival at the
House of Ashby	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This masque was prepared by
Marston	PERSON	in honor of a visit which the
Dowager Countess of Derby	ORGANIZATION	paid to her son-in-law and daughter
Elizabeth	PERSON	, the
Earl	PERSON	and
Countess of Huntingdon	ORGANIZATION	, at their seat at Ashby-de - la-Zouch , in
August , 1607	DATE	.

		In
1608	DATE	a
Countess of Derby	ORGANIZATION	, the Countess Dow - ager , or her sister-in-law , assisted in
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's masque of `` Beauty , '' performed by Queen
Anne	PERSON	and her ladies on the
Sunday	DATE	after
Twelfth Night	ORGANIZATION	,
January 10	DATE	.

		On
February 2 , 1609	DATE	, Queen
Anne	PERSON	presented her third masque at
Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	,
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's `` Queens celebrated from the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Fame . ''

		Among the noble ladies who assisted the Queen on this occasion were the
Countess Dowager of Derby	ORGANIZATION	, and her daughter
Elizabeth	PERSON	, Countess of Huntingdon .

		In
1609	DATE	,
John Davies	PERSON	, of
Hereford	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1565 -LSB- ? -RSB-

		-
1618	DATE	-RRB- , dedicated his `` Holy
Roode	PERSON	, or Christ 's
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 169 Crosse , '' to the
Countess of Derby	ORGANIZATION	and her three daughters , in this strain : '' To the Right Honorable well-accomplished Lady
Alice	PERSON	,
Countess of Derby	ORGANIZATION	, my good lady and mistress , and to her three right noble daughters by birth , nature , and education , the Lady
Elizabeth Countess of Huntingdon	ORGANIZATION	, the Lady
Frances Egerton	PERSON	, and the Lady
Ann	PERSON	, wife to the truly noble Lord Gray Chandois that now is , be all comfort whensoever crost . ''


Davies	PERSON	's `` The Scourge of Folly , '' about 1610 or 1611 , also celebrates the Countess of Derby as his `` good lady and mistress '' in a series of verses in her honor .

		In 1616
Thomas Gainsford	PERSON	published a work called `` The Historic of Trebizond . ''

		It is a collection of romantic stories divided into four books , which are separately dedicated to the
Countess Dowager of Derby	ORGANIZATION	, the
Countess of Huntingdon	ORGANIZATION	, Lady
Frances Egerton	PERSON	, and Lady
Anne Chandos	PERSON	.

		One of the most famous portraits of Shakespeare * is the Chandos portrait , now in the
National Por	ORGANIZATION	- trait Gallery of
London	LOCATION	.

		The artist is unknown ; but the portrait has been attributed to
Cornelius Janssen	PERSON	and to
Paul Van Somer	PERSON	.

		The history of this celebrated portrait shows that it was preserved for posterity , partly at least , by the descendants of the
Countess of Derby	ORGANIZATION	.

		The '' Dictionary of National Biography '' says of this portrait : `` At length it reached the hands of
James Brydges	PERSON	, third
Duke of Chandos	ORGANIZATION	, through his father-in-law ,
John Nichols	PERSON	, and it subsequently passed through
Chandos	PERSON	's daughter , to her husband , the
Duke of Buckingham	ORGANIZATION	, at the sale of whose effects at
Stowe	LOCATION	, in
1848	DATE	, it was purchased by the
Earl of Ellesmere	ORGANIZATION	.

		The latter presented it to the nation . ''

		On
Shrove-Tuesday	DATE
night	TIME	,
February 18 , 1634	DATE	,
Thomas Carew	PERSON	,
Henry Lawes	PERSON	, and
Inigo Jones	PERSON	presented their masque , ''
Ccelum Britannicum	PERSON	, '' in the
Banqueting House	ORGANIZATION	at
Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	, and
King Charles I.	PERSON	was one of the actors .

		Among the '' Young Lords and Noblemen 's Sons '' who took part were
John Egerton	PERSON	,
Viscount Brackley	PERSON	, his brother Mr.
Thomas Egerton	PERSON	, and his cousin Lord Chandos .

		The
Earl of Bridgewater	ORGANIZATION	went into residence as President of
Wales	LOCATION	in
1633	DATE	.

		The social functions attendant upon his inauguration extended to Sep - tember ,
1634	DATE	, when on Michaelmas night
Milton	PERSON	's masque of `` Comus , '' which was written for this occa - sion , was presented before him .

		The masque was given in the great justice-chamber of
Ludlow Castle	ORGANIZATION	,
Shropshire	PERSON	, whose ruins still bear the name of
Comus Hall	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the presentation , the part of the Lady was played by Lady
Alice Egerton	PERSON	; the
First Brother	ORGANIZATION	was
John Egerton	PERSON	,
Viscount Brackley	PERSON	; and the
Second Brother	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Thomas Egerton	PERSON	. ''

		Comus '' was written while
Milton	PERSON	was living with his parents at
Horton	LOCATION	, Bucks , and
Viscount Brackley	PERSON	was his father 's landlord .

		In the dedication of '' Comus '' to
Viscount Brackley	PERSON	,
Henry Lawes	PERSON	says that it is '' not openly acknowledged by the Author , yet it is a legitimate offspring , so lovely and so much desired , that the often copying of it hath tired my pen to give my several friends satisfaction . ''

		Milton 's short masque , '' Arcades , '' is described by him as '' Part of an Entertainment presented to the Countess Dowager of Derby at
Harefield	LOCATION	, by some noble persons of her family , who appear on the scene in pastoral habit , moving toward the seat of state , with this Song , '' -LRB- the opening song -RRB- .


Fleay	PERSON	, in his `` Chronicle of the English Drama , '' says that '' Arcades '' was acted not long after `` Comus . ''

		The `` noble persons of her family '' were probably young
Lord Chandos	PERSON	and his brother , then living with their grandmother at
Harefield	LOCATION	, and some of the Egertons ,
Viscount Brackley	PERSON	, Mr.
Thomas Egerton	PERSON	, and the Ladies
Alice	PERSON	and
Mary Egerton	PERSON	.

		In passing , it is interesting to note that
Viscount Brackley	PERSON	, the '' learned ''
Earl	PERSON	of
Bridgewater	LOCATION	, who '' delighted much in his library , '' was so scandalized by
Milton	PERSON	's '' Defensio Pro Populo '' that he wrote in his copy , `` Liber igne , auctorfurcd , dignissimi '' Of the two young
Egerton	PERSON	ladies who probably sang the songs of `` Arcades , '' Lady
Alice Egerton	PERSON	became the second wife of
Richard Vaughan	PERSON	,
Earl of Carberry	ORGANIZATION	.

		To her
Jeremy Taylor	PERSON	dedicated part of his '' Life of Christ . ''

		Her husband , the
Earl of Carberry	ORGANIZATION	, appointed
Samuel Butler	PERSON	, author of `` Hudibras , '' to the stewardship of
Ludlow Castle	ORGANIZATION	.


Richard Baxter	PERSON	, author of `` The Saints ' Ever - lasting Rest , '' was a native of
Shropshire	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1631	DATE	, when
Baxter	PERSON	was a lad of sixteen , he became attendant to Mr.
Thomas Wickstead	PERSON	, Chaplain to the
Council of Wales	ORGANIZATION	, and lived for a year and a half in
Ludlow Castle	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lady
Mary Egerton	PERSON	married
Richard Herbert	PERSON	, second
Lord Herbert of Cherbury	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1600 -LSB- ? -RSB-

		-1655 -RRB- , who was the son of
Edward Her	ORGANIZATION	- bert , first Lord Herbert of Cherbury -LRB- 1583-1648 -RRB- , poet and philosopher .

		In
1653	DATE
Henry Lawes	ORGANIZATION	dedicated to these two granddaughters of the Countess of Derby his ''
Ayres	PERSON	and Dialogues for One , Two , or Three Voyces , '' saying they `` excelled most ladies , especially in vocal music . ''

		Curiously enough , the
Countess of Derby	ORGANIZATION	's estate of
Harefield Manor	ORGANIZATION	is indissolubly connected with English literature through the Newdigate Prize for poetry at
Oxford University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Harefield had been in possession of the
Newdigate	PERSON	family or their forebears from time immemorial , when , in
1585	DATE	,
John Newdigate	PERSON	exchanged the manor for that of
Arbury	LOCATION	,
Warwick	PERSON	, with Sir
Edmund Anderson	PERSON	,
Lord Chief Justice	ORGANIZATION	of the Common Pleas .

		In 1 601 Sir
Edmund Anderson	PERSON	conveyed
Harefield Manor	LOCATION	to Sir
Thomas Egerton	PERSON	, to his wife
Alice	PERSON	,
Countess of Derby	ORGANIZATION	, and to her daughters after her .

		On the death of
Lord Keeper Egerton	ORGANIZATION	's widow , the
Countess of Derby	ORGANIZATION	, in
1636	DATE	, the manor was inherited by Lady
Anne Chandos	PERSON	, then her only surviving daughter ; after her death , in
1647	DATE	, it descended to her son ,
Lord Chandos	PERSON	.

		At his death , in
1655	DATE	, he left it to his wife ,
Jane	PERSON	,
Lady Chandos	PERSON	, who married as her second husband Sir
William Sedley	PERSON	,
Bart	LOCATION	.

		; and again , after his death ,
George Pitt	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	, of
Strath	LOCATION	- fieldsaye , in
Hampshire	LOCATION	.

		About 1660 the mansion 170 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, was burned down , by the carelessness , it is said , of Sir
Charles Sedley	PERSON	, wit and dramatist , who was on a visit to
Harefield	LOCATION	at the time , and who was indulg - ing in the dangerous pastime of reading in bed .

		By a deed dated
1673	DATE	, Lady
Jane Chandos	PERSON	vested all her estates in Mr.
Pitt	PERSON	and his heirs ; and in
1675	DATE	, she being still alive , Mr.
Pitt	PERSON	sold
Harefield Manor	ORGANIZATION	to Sir
Richard Newdigate	PERSON	, Baronet , of
Arbury	LOCATION	,
Warwick	PERSON	.

		This sale conveyed the manor back to its original owners .

		The Newdigates still own both
Harefield	LOCATION	and
Arbury	LOCATION	.

		Sir
Roger Newdigate	PERSON	-LRB- 1719-1806 -RRB- , was fifth Baronet of
Harefield	LOCATION	,
Middlesex	LOCATION	, and
Arbury	LOCATION	, War - wick .

		He was a member of
University College	ORGANIZATION	, and
M.P. for Oxford	ORGANIZATION	from
1750	DATE	to
1780	DATE	, when he re - tired from public life .

		He never lost his interest in classical art , and in the last year of his life he gave Oxford two thousand pounds to remove the Arundel Collection into the
Radcliffe Library	ORGANIZATION	, a plan which was carried out by
Flaxman	PERSON	.

		Archdeacon Churton described Sir
Roger Newdigate	PERSON	as '' an intel - ligent and polished gentleman of the old school . ''

		He married twice : first ,
Sophia Conyers	PERSON	, and second ,
Hester Mundy	PERSON	; but had no children .

		A housekeeper in his family at
Arbury Manor	ORGANIZATION	was related to
Mary Ann Evans	PERSON	, who , as
George Eliot	PERSON	, located `` Mr.
Gilfil	PERSON	's Love Story '' at
Arbury Manor	ORGANIZATION	and made Sir
Roger	PERSON	and Lady Newdigate the originals of Sir
Christopher	PERSON	and
Lady Cheverel	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1805	DATE	Sir
Roger Newdigate	PERSON	left a thousand pounds by will to
Oxford University	ORGANIZATION	to establish an annual prize for poetry , the poem to be `` of fifty lines and no more , in recommendation of the study of the ancient Greek and Roman remains of archi - tecture , sculpture , and painting . ''

		The restriction of the subject to classical art , and of the length to fifty lines , did not last many years .

		The prize poems are now about three hundred lines long , and the subjects show a wide range of interest .

		The
Newdigate Prize	ORGANIZATION	has been awarded more than a hundred times , and many of the prizemen have achieved distinction in English letters .

		The first prize , in
1806	DATE	, was won by
John Wilson	PERSON	, ``
Christopher North	PERSON	, '' for a poem on `` The Study of Greek and Roman Architecture . ''

		Another early
Newdigate	ORGANIZATION	was
Henry Hart Milman	PERSON	, Dean of St.
Paul	PERSON	's , the historian of Latin Christianity , whose subject , in
1812	DATE	, was the '' Apollo Belvidere . ''


Thomas Legh Cloughton	PERSON	, long Bishop of
St. Albans	LOCATION	, read his poem , '' Voyages of Discovery to the Polar Regions , '' before Sir
John Franklin	PERSON	, when the nav - igator received the degree of D.C.L. from
Oxford	LOCATION	, in
1829	DATE	.

		In
1834	DATE	the prizeman was
Joseph Arnould	PERSON	, later Judge of
Bombay	LOCATION	, who recited '' The Hospice of St.
Bernard	PERSON	'' in the presence of the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	, then being installed as Chancellor of
the University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Four lines of this poem are : '' When on that field where last the eagle soar 'd , War 's mightier master wielded
Britain	LOCATION	's sword , And the dark soul , a world could scarce subdue , Bent to thy genius Chief of
Waterloo	LOCATION	. ''


John Richard Croker	PERSON	says these verses alluding to the Chief of
Waterloo	LOCATION	`` made the whole assembly start up , '' `` and some people appeared to me to go out of their senses literally to go mad . ''

		Dean
Stanley	PERSON	was the
Newdigate	ORGANIZATION	in
1837	DATE	, and offered a poem entitled `` The Gypsies . ''

		In 1839
John Ruskin	PERSON	, prizeman , read `` Salsette and Ele - phanta '' before
William Wordsworth	PERSON	, who was made an
Oxford D.C.L.	ORGANIZATION	at that time .

		The prizeman of
1842	DATE	, with a poem on ``
Charles XII.	PERSON	, '' was
John Campbell Shairp	PERSON	, whose haunting lyric `` The Bush aboon Traquair '' carries on the great tradition of Scottish ballad and song .

		Principal Shairp was born to poetry , poeta nascitur ; for , with
Walter Scott	PERSON	, he was a lineal descendant of
Mary Scott	PERSON	, `` the Flower of Yarrow , '' whose romantic wooing he mentions in the poem `` Three Friends in
Yarrow	LOCATION	. ''


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	took the
Newdigate	ORGANIZATION	in
1843	DATE	, for his `` Cromwell , '' and just ten years later -LRB- 1853 -RRB- Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	's `` Feasc of Belshazzar '' won the prize .


John Addington Symonds	PERSON	's `` Escorial '' was the Newdigate of
1860	DATE	.

		Nor have all the Newdigates been men .

		Rev.
W. Tuckwell	PERSON	, in his '' Reminiscences of Oxford , '' relates how the Newdigate was once car - ried off by a woman .

		She was Miss
Rachel Burton	PERSON	, nicknamed ``
Jack	PERSON	, '' daughter of a
Canon of Christ	ORGANIZATION	- church .

		Although she lived long before the foundation of women 's colleges at
Oxford	LOCATION	, ``
Jack	PERSON	's '' poem , sent in just for fun , to see what would happen , was awarded the prize , until the judges discovered her sex !

		Two of the
Newdigates	PERSON	have filled the chair of poetry at
Oxford Matthew Arnold	ORGANIZATION	and
John Campbell Shairp	ORGANIZATION	.

		What Sir
Roger Newdigate	PERSON	's prize for poetry has accomplished was summed up several years ago by
Ogier Rysden	PERSON	in '' A Century of Newdigates . ''

		Of ninety-nine prizemen , twenty-seven had won a place in the '' Dictionary of National Biography '' ; among them there had been one ambassador , one Lord Chancellor -LRB-
Roundell Palmer	PERSON	,
Earl	PERSON	of
Selborne	LOCATION	-RRB- , three bishops , three deans , one judge , one physician -LRB-
Francis Hawkins	PERSON	, who wrote a poem on the '' Pan - theon '' and a well-known treatise on rheumatism -RRB- , one artist , and one editor of '' The Times . ''

		The Newdigates have naturally made their best success in literature , and have produced no less than 918 volumes : 163 volumes of poetry , excluding the prize poems ; 158 collections of sermons ; 98 volumes of essays ; 74 works on divinity ; 48 volumes of lec - tures ; 28 biographies ; 55 editions of standard authors ; 28 works on political economy , 33 on law , 21 novels , and 12 plays .

		This is a large and notable output , and makes it of peculiar interest to educa - tion in the
United States	LOCATION	that through the
Rhodes Foundation	ORGANIZATION	the Newdigate Prize last year crossed the
Atlantic Ocean	LOCATION	.

		The prize of
1912	DATE	was won by
William Chase Greene	PERSON	, of
Balliol College	ORGANIZATION	,
Rhodes	PERSON	scholar from
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, for a poem on ''
King Richard	PERSON	the First before
Jerusalem	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Greene	PERSON	was salutatorian and class odist at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1911	DATE	.

		He is a son of Professor
Herbert E. Greene	PERSON	, of
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	.

AUGUSTA SCOTT	ORGANIZATION	.

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 171 CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE PRESENT POPULARITY OF THE CLASSICS has lately been made the subject of some careful investi - gation .

		Certain public libraries have placed the great works of ancient and modern literature in a particularly exposed situation and watched the result .

		At
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, this plan produced a marked increase in an already considerable circulation of the classic authors .

		The monthly '' Bulletin '' of the library records in its
February	DATE	issue that '' from the first the collection was a pronounced success .

		It seemed to attract all classes of readers .

		Young and old , rich and poor , men and women , could be seen standing in front of the case and examining the vol - umes .

		In a month so many of the books were in circulation that it was found necessary to replenish the supply . ''

		This experiment was made in the
summer	DATE	, the library 's dull season , but when autumn came and the books were returned to their places , only two ,
Trevelyan	PERSON	's '' Macaulay '' and
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	's '' Essays '' had found no readers .

		Of those drawn , the '' Odyssey '' went out eight times , the '' Divine Comedy '' seven ,
Epictetus	ORGANIZATION	six ,
Rousseau	PERSON	's ''
Emile	PERSON	'' six , the '' Rubaiyat '' six ,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's plays six ,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's `` Republic '' four , Goethe 's '' Faust '' four ,
Malory	PERSON	's `` Morte d'Arthur '' four , More 's `` Utopia '' six ,
Pliny	ORGANIZATION	's letters three , `` Sartor Resartus '' eight ,
Amiel	PERSON	's '' Journal '' six , and the leading English essayists , excepting
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, were in frequent demand .

		Moreover , it was found by a study of charging slips that a very creditable all-the-year - round circulation was enjoyed by the principal classics , '' Faust '' being drawn twenty-six times in the twelve months from
May , 1911	DATE	, to
May , 1912	DATE	, the '' Odyssey '' twenty-two times ,
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	's '' Lives '' twenty-one , the '' Divine Comedy '' twenty , and other works in a diminishing scale , down to Aristotle 's '' Ethics , '' which went out twice .

		Furthermore , it should be remembered that many well-regulated families have their own sets of the great authors and resort to the library only for current fiction or other books of the day ; so that probably not even the foregoing very encouraging record is at all ade - quate as an indication of the extent to which the
Springfield	LOCATION	people read the classics .

		In general , it seems to be found that wherever the public is given a fair chance to choose its reading , the best books of all time are the ones to be most constantly drawn , year in and year out .

		It is safe to say that even in
Newark	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, this will be found to be the case , in spite of the
Newark	LOCATION	librarian 's recent intimation of a doubt in the matter .

		A QUESTION OF USAGE , long open to debate , and destined no doubt long to continue so , is again in - viting discussion .

		In a recent newspaper commu - nication Mr.
John D. Long	PERSON	ventured to say a good word for the split infinitive as an old and legitimate locution , thereby showing an attitude toward it quite different from that of the woman who , on being asked whether her husband ever did any work about the house , replied with a significant shrug of the shoulders : '' Oh , yes , he splits a few infinitives every day . ''

		In that entertaining manual entitled `` The King 's English '' occurs the following : '' The ' split ' infinitive has taken such hold upon the consciences of journalists that , instead of warning the novice against splitting his infinitives , we must warn him against the curious superstition that the splitting or not splitting makes the difference between a good and a bad writer ... Even that mysterious quality , ` distinction ' of style , may in modest measure be attained by a splitter of infinitives . ''

		The same au - thority calls the split infinitive '' one among several hundred ugly things , '' and cautions the novice against allowing it to occupy his mind exclusively .

		In our language , which is in the main an uninflected language , the sign of the infinitive is a separate word , just as the sign of the future indicative is a separate word ; but why it should be necessary to keep the two parts in close contact in one case , and permissible to sunder them in the other , has never been satisfactorily explained .

		Ordinarily the modi - fying adverb seems to fall naturally and gracefully into place either before or after the full infinitive form ; but occasionally , especially in poetry , good reasons for splitting present themselves .

		A sup - posed instance of a permissible split is sometimes cited in such sentences as , '' He wished to more than square the account , '' which , however , contains an ellipsis rather than a split infinitive .

		In full the sentence would be , `` He wished to do more than square the account , '' the second , infinitive having its `` to '' understood .

		To split or not to split , that is the question frequently confronting a writer , and ordinarily to be answered in the negative if only to avoid needless offense to a critical reader 's taste .

		It would be interesting to know how the
Bible	LOCATION	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	stand in this matter .

		Have they any split infinitives ?

		If the research necessary for an authoritative answer has never been made , here is a tidy bit of work cut out for someone in quest of a subject for a Ph.D. thesis .

		THE SANITY OF GENIUS is vigorously asserted by Dr.
Arthur C. Jacobson	PERSON	in '' The Medical Record . ''

		He admits the liability to disorder which goes with the delicate organization and high-strung nervous system of the man of genius .

		In his own words , '' genius makes for insanity , but neither insanity nor the insane temperament makes for genius .

		The genius is usually , if not always , of insane tempera - ment , but his best creative work reflects the man at his best , that is to say , sanest .

		To the degree that clinical insanity enters in , to that degree is his work vitiated .

		Insanity is the Nemesis of the delicately balanced genius , never his good angel .

		He does his work not because of , but in spite of , the Damoclean sword . ''

		Dr.
Jacobson	PERSON	asks why '' a great literature is not emanating from the asylums of the land if it be true that the relation of genius and insanity is so THE DIAL close '' ; and the question is pertinent , despite the logical fallacy it implies .

		Not '' all insane men are men of genius , '' but `` all men of genius are insane '' is the assertion he is refuting .

		However , let us hear his answer to his own question . ''

		The answer is that the great genius must be eminently sane .

		He must possess in the highest possible degree the crit - ical faculty directed toward his own literary pro- ductions .

		No great literary work can possibly be produced if this endowment be lacking . ''

		But it is exactly this perfect marriage of the creative and the critical faculties that is seldom found in literature ; the one tends to stifle the other , though , as the single instance of Goethe would sufficiently prove , it does not always succeed .

		Dr.
Jacobson	PERSON	scores a point when he declares that `` the mind that produced Hamlet was super-sane . ''

		Great poets and painters and musicians , and other men of genius , are such , according to this student of the problem , not because of but in spite of their liability to psychopathological states unknown to common mortals .

		... \ OUK DAILY DEBT TO SHAKESPEAKE , as shown by the large number of colloquial phrases with which he has supplied us , is one that we bear lightly enough because we seldom pause to consider its magnitude .

		Mr.
Frank J. Wilstach	PERSON	, in the interest of Mr.
Sothern	PERSON	and
Miss Marlowe	PERSON	in their Shake - speare repertory , calls attention to a considerable number of these everyday Shakespearean words and phrases which are commonly used without a thought of their origin .

		His list , which we have not veri - fied , includes the following : Bag and baggage , dead as a door nail , proud of one 's humility , hit or miss , love is blind , selling for a song , wide world , cut capers , fast and loose , unconsidered trifles , westward ho , familiarity breeds contempt , patching up excuses , misery makes strange bedfellows , to boot , short and long of it , dancing attendance , getting even -LRB- in re - venge -RRB- , birds of a feather , that 's flat , rag - tag , Greek to me , send one packing , as the day is long , packing a jury , mother wit , kill with kindness , rnum , ill wind that blows no good , wild-goose chase , scarecrow , luggage , row of pins , give and take , sold , your cake is dough .

		To almost any reader of this list there will at once occur numerous expressions that claim a place beside those enumerated , as , for instance , '' to the manner born , '' '' more honored in the breach than the observance , '' `` a sea of troubles , '' `` that way madness lies , '' '' the hazard of the die , '' and so on without end .

		Perhaps it would be shorter to tell what our daily speech does not owe to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	than what it does .

		A LITERARY DUMPING-GROUND is made of many a long-suffering library by some of its would-be benefactors who use it as a convenient depository for such printed rubbish as they know not how otherwise to dispose of .

		A well-intentioned lady of our acquaintance long had the habit of visiting the local library about once a month with a bulky parcel of odds and ends in pamphlet or leaflet form , rarely or never in book form , which she deposited on the delivery desk with the air of a munificent benefac - tor , and then departed .

		Luckily she never made inquiry as to the ultimate destination of her gifts , never ransacked the card-catalogue to make sure that every item had been properly entered and classified , and never seemed to expect a formal expression of thanks for her heterogeneous contributions .

		Un - doubtedly she assumed that in an institution dedi - cated to the preservation and circulation of literature her offerings had been welcomed with joy by the head librarian , the cataloguer , the classifier , the ref - erence librarian , the children 's librarian , the direc - tor of the circulating department , and all others whose chief delight it must be to watch the growth of the collection in their joint charge .

		At any rate it costs nothing , she may have thought , for a library to ex - tend its hospitality , and its shelf-room , to any waifs and strays of print that chance to knock at its doors .

		But it does cost something , as Miss
Corinne Bacon	PERSON	took occasion to point out
last summer	DATE	at
Asbury Park	LOCATION	, in an address now printed in `` Public Libra - ries . ''

		Cataloguing costs , she continued , and dusting costs , and shelf-room costs .

		In a word , as she aptly expressed it , a live library is not a storage reservoir .

		Beware , then , of indiscriminate gifts !

		Be on guard against the person who seems disposed to make of your public library a public dumping-ground .

		... A LACK IN ENGLISH LITERARY CRITICISM is de - tected by Mr.
J. E. C. Bodley	PERSON	, a well-known writer on
France	LOCATION	and things French , in its reticence con - cerning the identity of the critic .

		They order this matter better in
France	LOCATION	, he thinks , where the signed review is the rule , as contrasted with the unsigned review common in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		Feeling no personal responsibility and pride , the English and the American reviewer , if Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	is in the right , do not put forth their best efforts , and we have not , as they have in
France	LOCATION	, a '' school of criticism '' or any literary critic comparable with the famous author of those '' Causeries '' which once made the second day of the week eventful to the reading world across the Channel .

		To himself , then , according to Mr.
Bodley	PERSON	, the critic owes it to let his light shine undimmed by any modest anonymity .

		Still more , however , does he owe it to the author whom he criti - cizes , and to the interests of careful scholarship , to come out from behind the shelter of anonymity .

		In creations of the imagination and in the play of fancy let the writer keep his authorship as secret as he chooses ; but not to put one 's name to a '' hurticle , '' as
Thackeray	PERSON	called it , may often savor of unfair - ness or cowardly spite or other unlovely quality .

		LITERATURE AS A LIVING ART formed a part of the subject chosen by Sir
Arthur Quiller-Couch	PERSON	for his opening lecture as
King Edward VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor of English Literature at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		He uttered a caution '' against despising any form of art which is alive and pliant in the hands of man .

		As for my part , '' he continued , `` I believe , bearing in mind Mr.
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 173 Barrie 's '
Peter Pan	PERSON	' and the old bottles he renovated to hold that joyous wine , that even musical comedy , in the hands of a master , might become a thing of beauty .

		Of the novel , at any rate , whether we like it or not , we have to admit that it does hold a com - manding position in the literature of our times , and to consider how far Mr.
Lascelles Abercrombie	PERSON	was right the other day when he claimed on the first page of his brilliant study of
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	that the right to such a position is not to be disputed ; for here , as elsewhere , the right to such a position is no more than the power to maintain it .

		You may agree with this or you may not , you may or may not deplore the forms that literature is choosing ; but there is no gainsaying that it is still very much alive .

		And I would say to you , ' Believe and be glad that literature is an art , and English a living tongue . ' ''

		LIBERAL LIBRARY RULES are better than harshly restrictive ones , and once in a while no rules at all seem better than even the most liberal ones .

		The
Trinity Parish Library	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	is an instance of a library that does good work with an irreducible minimum of red tape .

		It is in the parish house in Clarendon Street , and numbers about five thousand volumes , the nucleus of the collection being the generous gift of books bestowed by
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	from his own fine library when he was rector of
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	thirty years ago .

		These well-selected vol - umes and others added later comprise one of the best collections of books in the departments of relig - ion , biography , travel , essays , and social problems .

		Any person of respectable appearance may enter the library and borrow for home use any book desired , with no questions asked as to the borrower 's ante - cedents , with no requirement of references or of guaranty for the return of the book .

		Last year the circulation numbered about three thousand volumes , and the borrowers included the policeman of the neighborhood and learned doctors of divinity from far and near .

		Miss
Snelling	PERSON	, the librarian , says that she has never known the privileges of the library to be abused , though hundreds of those who enjoy those privileges are utter strangers to her .

		LINCOLN 'S LIKING FOR APT QUOTATIONS , especially from the poets , was such as might have been ex - pected in one who displayed no mean ability in the framing of phrases and sentences so aptly expressive as to become themselves household words after his death .

		Mr.
John Langdon Kaine	PERSON	's Lincoln reminis - cences in the
February	DATE	`` Century '' contain mention of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's appreciation of that true wit which , according to Pope , '' is Nature to advantage dressed , what oft was thought , but ne'er so well expressed . ''

		`` He insisted , '' writes Mr.
Kaine	PERSON	in recalling a boy - hood interview with the President when the latter chanced to be in an especially talkative mood , `` on the importance of learning , in early life , sentiments expressed in verse .

		In effect he said that as a man grows older , lines which he learned because of their pleasant sound come to have a meaning ; just as old saws show their truth in later life . '

		It is a pleasure / he said , ' to be able to quote lines to fit any occasion / and he noted that the
Bible	LOCATION	is the richest source of pertinent quotations . ''

		This recalls the remark made by
George Eliot	PERSON	in one of her published letters and quoted the other day by Sir
Arthur Quiller	PERSON	- Couch in his inaugural lecture as
King Edward VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor of English Literature at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Speaking of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's poetry the author of '' Theophrastu * Such '' said : `` I never before met with so many of my own feelings expressed just as I should like them . ''

		... THE GROWTH OF THE PERIODICAL PRESS seems ta keep pace with the growth of the world 's population .

		In the
United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	, for example , there was in
1912	DATE	a birth-rate of newspapers and periodi - cals amounting to more than five each week day ; that is ,
1686	DATE	new publications started into being .

		But the death-rate was so nearly equal to the birth - rate that the net increase for the year was only thirty-six , about equally divided between this coun - try and our northern neighbor , and chiefly confined to the field of daily journalism .

		So largely are we Americans a nation of readers that the printing and publishing industry is exceeded , in number of employees and value of product , by only four other industries or so the statisticians assure us .

		In the last ten years the value of the annual output of printed matter in
America	LOCATION	has increased by more than eighty - six per cent .

		Nearly every trade and industry has its one or more periodicals , and the whole mass of periodical publications is divided into 208 classes , with the weekly issues of all sorts in a large majority * A study of the `` American Newspaper Annual and Directory '' impresses one with the magnitude of the industry that supplies to thousands of energetie Americans practically all the reading matter they ever avail themselves of .

		THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW LIBRARY BUILDING AT HARVARD was made
February 12	DATE	, when a spade - ful of earth was turned up by each member of a selected company assembled within the enclosure now erected around the site of the prospective struct - ure .

		In the absence of Mrs.
George D. Widener	PERSON	r giver of the
two million dollars	MONEY	that the
Widener Memorial Library	ORGANIZATION	is expected to cost , her son , Mr.
George D. Widener , Jr.	PERSON	, was the first to handle the spade , which then passed successively to President
Lowell	PERSON	,
Dean Briggs	PERSON	, Professor Kittredge , Librarian - Lane , Assistant Librarian
Potter	PERSON	, Mr.
Horace Trum	PERSON	- bauer , architect .

		174 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, WISDOM AND UNWISDOM ABOUT WOMAN .

		* The world we live in is made up of men , women , and children .

		This fact , which works out for most of us into an infinite enrichment of actual life in interests , duties , and emotions , seems a source of wrath and stumbling to many of those who sit in their studies writing about the past and future of the race with especial reference to the part woman plays in the evolu - tionary process .

		It is curious to note how often the very writers who protest against sex-bias in the one direction will , themselves , display it conspicuously in the other .

		Obviously , if we are to treat at all of the sex-interest in the plot of the race drama , it should be done with all the temperance , detachment , dignity , and ability at our command ; obviously , also , few of these books will be epoch-making , since the influence of such intellectual performances upon evolution is slight .

		At their best these will interpret to some struggling human beings the tangles in which they find themselves , and furnish a clue by which they may follow to the real freedom found only in self-mastery ; at their worst they will increase sex-antagonism and concentrate the attention of the individual upon personal grievances an attitude which promptly par - alyzes will and achievement and dries up the springs of character .

		The season 's books on the woman-question offer very perfect examples of wise and foolish literature in their field . ''

		The Advance of Woman '' by Mrs.
Jane Johnston Christie	PERSON	is almost a museum-specimen of partisanship .

		The author seems to believe with an absolute fury of conviction that Woman is innately , divinely , and unalterably a superior being who has been maliciously clubbed into silence , if not insensi - bility , by Man .

		Man is accordingly belabored with sweeping ferocity .

		The author argues from such facts of animal life as the female crusta - cean who '' carries a little husband in each pocket , '' and such pre-historic and chiefly infer - ential conditions as the matriarchate , that the female is biologically the superior of the male ; * THE ADVANCE OF WOMAN .

		THE BUSINESS OF BEING A WOMAN .

		By
Ida M. Tarbell	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		that she was originally endowed with the right of selection , indefatigable industry , and a paci - fic temperament ; that these endowments were enough to lead the race to its highest possible evolution , had the female continuously domi - nated it ; that , as domination was forcibly taken from her when , by the result of her own choice in selection , the male became the more power - ful physically , so the race has been evolving in the wrong direction ever since a mistake only to be rectified when Man gives over '' the futile efforts he has made for thousands of years to fill a place he was not equipped for , '' and
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's Elect , the Woman , is absolute ruler of the earth .

		It must be very comforting to hold with such fervor these gratifying convic - tions about one 's sex , but surely the human predicament is not so simple as this .

		Man may not have done his utmost in climbing up the ages , but a programme which involves his prac - tical enslavement at the moment when woman is rejoicing in great new freedoms seems subtly lacking in logic as well as in humanity , and hardly commends itself to sane judgment .

		On the other side , '' Woman Adrift : A State - ment of the Case against Suffragism , '' by Mr.
Harold Owen	PERSON	, is admirably adapted to promote the movement it is designed to discourage .

		The present reviewer confesses to grave doubts about the immediate expediency of votes for women , at least in this country , where , though cer - tain industrial injustices remain , nevertheless women 's grievances as a sex have been replaced by privileges which leave the American woman the freest creature on the earth to-day .

		If it takes three generations to make a gentleman , that complicated product a conscientious voter can hardly be created in less ; and while un - limited woman-suffrage is almost certainly at hand in the
United States	LOCATION	, it is almost equally certain that only a hundred years hence shall we know if it is for our real betterment .

		But Mr.
Owen	PERSON	's arguments against an extension of the suffrage are so minute , masculine , uninspired , and British , that they are calculated to create a violent reaction in any mind , even that of a con - vinced , anti-suffragist !

		Excellent as are many of his beliefs , it must be said that Mr.
Owen	PERSON	nags .

		He is also entirely incapable of refrain - ing from small flings and cheap gibes at feminine foibles which have nothing to do with the issue .

		He weakens his argument , where candor would have strengthened it , by refusing to admit frankly that women in
Great Britain	LOCATION	still have actual wrongs and disabilities which make their case quite different from that of women in
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAJL 175
America	LOCATION	.

		The book attempts to settle by the logic of the debating society a question which ought to be discussed in a more generous spirit .

		Mr.
Owen	PERSON	does not ignore the fact that duality of function and race-betterment are the grounds upon which the matter should be decided , but he is too much preoccupied with more trivial arguments to give these their appropriate posi - tion .

		Now and again he has a flicker of insight , as where he intimates that if the female sex is to be born again , it must , nevertheless , '' be re-born in its own image , '' or where he points out that political freedom is likely to be purchased by industrial servitude .

		But as a whole the book is too self-satisfied , not to say beefy , and its logic too mechanical , to produce an effect .

		The final argument in matters political , as in matters religious , is emotion , but this fundamental truth of human nature is seldom recognized by those who debate according to the rules .

		Whether you always agree with
Ellen Key	PERSON	or not , her books are examples of close thinking and clear expression .

		As intellectual perform - ances , they have dignity and texture .

		`` The Woman Movement , '' her latest work , is an acute study of the effect of the general emancipation of woman , so far as it has now progressed , upon the outer world ; upon feminine psychology ; upon the status of daughters , spinsters , and men and women at large ; and , finally , upon mar - riage and motherhood .

		Ardent believer in the woman-movement as she is , she realizes that it has reached the stage where intelligent criticism should replace blind enthusiasm .

		She sees how many women have lost their heads and misplaced their hearts ; and , without abating a jot of her faith in the virtue and necessity of freedom , she points out , with a penetration never equalled by any opponent of feminine emancipation , the hundred pitfalls lying in wait for the modern woman .

		Perhaps the most startling of her ad - missions is that regarding the effect - of public life on the woman .

		The woman-movement of fifty years ago was based upon belief in the eternal stability of womanliness .

		It was pre - cisely that quality which was to benefit the world when it was given freedom of operation outside the home .

		Already it has been demonstrated ,
Ellen Key	PERSON	admits , that womanliness is subject to change by changed vocations and surroundings .

		She goes so far as to state explicitly that if women are to improve political conditions at all , it would be well to give them full civic rights quickly , before they have lost their intuitive and instinctive power through '' masculiniza - tion . ''

		This is an admission that almost goes beyond the obstreperous Mr.
Harold Owen	PERSON	, yet it comes from the lips of a friend .

		Equally acute is her analysis and denunciation of what she terms '' the amaternal idea , '' as it is advanced by Mrs.
Gilman	PERSON	and
Rosa Mayreder	ORGANIZATION	.

		Regard - ing motherliness as the distinguishing character - istic of womanliness , and recognizing that from the point of view of the race the division of labor between the sexes must on the whole remain the same as that which has hitherto existed `` if the higher development of mankind is to continue in uninterrupted advance to more perfect forms , '' she gives short shrift to those who maintain that equal rights for the sexes mean equal func - tions or who insist that woman can do her own work in the world and man 's as well .

		Granting to these theorists all freedom to live their own lives according to their bent , she denounces the attempt `` so to falsify life - values in their own favor '' as to set the cerebral type above the maternal , or the office above the home , as offer - ing a more `` human '' variety of work .

		It is greatly to be desired that all ultra-feminist thinkers and speakers -LRB- the terms are not syn - onymous -RRB- should spend a few quiet hours over these significant pages .

		Carefully digested , they offer an antidote to the `` unleavened bread '' of much of the crude and superficial thought so undeservedly popular to-day .

		Most young women depend upon instinct for the solution of their problems , and in the main find it a safer guide than any printed word .

		But those who really desire , first , to think their way through the abstract problem of feminine destiny , and , second , to supplement that think - ing with the best practical advice about what to do under the circumstances , should read '' The Woman Movement , '' and follow it up with '' The Business of Being a Woman . ''

		Miss
Tarbefl	ORGANIZATION	's little volume contains more available wisdom to the page than anything yet written on the subject in this country .

		Few latter-day authors recognize that , within the limits of decent existence , the breadth or narrowness of a life depend far more on the personal outlook than upon the external circumstances .

		Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	recalls this forgotten truth , and lays needed emphasis upon the fact that '' the highest civilization is that in which the largest number sense and are so placed as to realize the dignity and beauty of the common experiences and obligations . ''

		Her book is rational , broad - minded , and helpful ; it diffuses common-sense , but common - sense irradiated with the ideal .

		What happier combination can there be ?


CORNELIA A. P. COMER	PERSON	.

		176 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, GREEK LITERATURE AND THE DOOR OF TO-MORROW .

		* To-day there is a constant cry for the man , the thought , the word , that shall help us open the door of to-morrow .

		A few happy spirits , it is true , are content to feast their visions on the occasional glorious halting places in man 's march across the plains and up the slopes of the ages , and , in their love for what has been , to be care - less of what is to be .

		For them , Greek litera - ture and sculpture and architecture will always offer deep joys complete within themselves , even as the canvases of Andrea del Sarto or the cathe - drals of nameless Gothic builders will abide as pleasures that scorn the test of practical service .

		But , on the whole , the literature and art of the past , not less than the science of the present , will survive and flourish only as they have a meaning before the problems of the future .

		Moreover , I believe that the deeper one has delved into the past , and particularly the past as represented by
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, the keener will be his interest in the coming lot of his fellow-men : '' Guests of the ages , at To-morrow 's door Why shrink we ?

		The long track behind us lies , The lamps gleam and the music throbs before , Bidding us enter : and I count him wise , Who loves so well Man 's noble memories He needs must love Man 's nobler hopes yet more . ''

		In any event , the ultimate unescapable trial must come before this tribunal , and to its bar Mr.
Livingstone	PERSON	is willing to bring the Greek genius . ''

		There are few more important problems than this is humanism right ?

		Is it right to take a purely human attitude towards life , to assume that man is the measure of all things , and to believe that , even though the unseen may be there , still we can know our duty and live our life without reference to it ?

		That is perhaps the biggest question of the present day , the one most worth settling , the one which every one has to settle for himself . ''

		If our minds are made up and we are humanists , then we are not likely to find better models than the Greeks .

		Of unaided human nature it is not too much to say that they made the best that can be made ; in regard to the chief things of life , modern humanists are not likely to come to conclusions different from or better than those of a people whose acuteness of insight amounts almost to inspiration ; and they can hardly find better or wiser teachers than its great men . ''

		But if we approach the subjects as inquirers , anxious to learn to what humanism leads and whether it will work , still we must turn to
Athens	LOCATION	.

		There alone the experiment of humanism has been tried ; the only evi - dence about it we can get is the evidence from Greek society .

		There we can see how it succeeds ; whether it tends to strength , to racial survival ; whether it leads to justice , righteousness , mercy , true happiness ; or whether the sins , whose long catalogue closes the first chapter of * THE GREEK GENIUS AND ITS MEANING TO Us .

		By
R. W. Livingstone	PERSON	.

		Oxford :
The Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		St.
Paul	PERSON	's Epistle to the Romans , are the logical and finally inevitable issue of life for those peoples who wor - ship and serve the creature more than the Creator . ''

		This is the central and significant feature of our
Oxford Hellenist	ORGANIZATION	's contribution ; and he discusses only the essential elements of the Greek genius that he believes to have a mean - ing for us to-day .

		There are scores of able books and suggestive papers on the value of things Greek in the world of thought : the general theme , like some great jewel , has so many angles that it is impossible for any one worker to gather up all the various rays that emanate therefrom .

		The late Professor
Adam	PERSON	, for instance , wrote enthusiastically and convincingly on '' The Vi - tality of Platonism '' ; Mr.
Livingstone	PERSON	practi - cally sweeps Plato aside , on the ground that he is exceptional rather than characteristic .

		Pro- fessor
Mahaffy	PERSON	in his felicitous
Lowell	LOCATION	lectures , , published under the title , `` What Have the Greeks Done for Modern Civilization ? ''

		devotes several chapters to science , mathematics , poli - tics , medicine , and so forth ; Mr.
Livingstone	PERSON	deliberately discards them all .

		There are hun - dreds of laudatory volumes on Greek sculpture and architecture ; Mr.
Livingstone	PERSON	treats only of literature .

		A few years ago Professor Kelsey of
Michigan	LOCATION	collected a rather remarkable series of papers on the value of Latin and Greek in formal education , including Professor
Shorey	PERSON	's comprehensive brief , '' The Case for the Clas - sics '' ; Mr.
Livingstone	PERSON	avoids even touching upon the question of Greek in the schools .

		These few examples , chosen from so many that present themselves , may emphasize not only our author 's particular service , but also the diver - sity and inexhaustibility of this Grecian treas - ure .

		Naturally , Mr.
Livingstone	PERSON	can not exclude the rays from other angles ; but he does adhere admirably to his plan of presenting what he considers the fundamental contributions of Hellenism : the Greeks ' sense of beauty , their Freedom , their Directness , their Humanism ^ their Manysidedness , and their Sanity .

		But even after the angles are chosen , there is need for much defining and limiting , both geographical and chronological .

		What about
Sparta	LOCATION	, with its extreme example of rugged and ascetic militarism ?

		What about
Lucian	PERSON	, who reads like a nineteenth century essayist ?

		Or Theocritus , the fountain head of idyllic poetry ?

		However , these difficulties do not escape Mr.
Livingstone	PERSON	, and he comes out with a trenchant decision : '' Firstly : by the Greek genius we shall mean a spirit which manifested itself in certain peoples inhabiting lands washed by the .

		Egean sea : it appears to have
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 177 been only partly determined by race :
Athens	LOCATION	was its heart , and little or nothing of it is to be seen at
Sparta	LOCATION	: but
Pindar	ORGANIZATION	possessed it though he was a Theban , Aris - totle though he came from
Stagira	LOCATION	,
Thales	ORGANIZATION	though he was born and lived in
Asia	LOCATION	, and Homer though his birth - place is not known .

		Perhaps this definition evades the difficulty : but it seems to suit the facts . ''

		Secondly : in defining this spirit we shall keep our eyes fixed on what is admitted to have been its most brilliant season of flower , the years between 600 and 400 B. c. ; without forgetting that a hundred years passed before the most influential philosophies of
Greece	LOCATION	came to birth and its far-reaching permeation of the world began . ''

		Keeping our author 's plan in mind , we may turn to the interesting chapter on '' The Note of Directness . ''

		After recalling
Ruskin	PERSON	's in - cisive treatment of '' The Pathetic Fallacy '' and '' Classical Landscape , '' Mr.
Livingstone	PERSON	compares Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's sentimental and moving lines on the fate of a sea-gull carried into inland captivity with
Alcman	PERSON	's brief lim - ning of the bird '' that flies over the blossom of the swell with the halcyons , careless of heart , the sea-purple bird of
spring	DATE	. ''

		He concedes the grace and daintiness of his countrywoman 's poem , but declares that Alcman gives the more accurate picture , as well as a more sympathetic rendering of the bird 's charm .

		Passing from this directness in the Greek 's view of nature , he voices his conviction that it was simply one aspect of a general trend of thought and man - ner of looking at life . ''

		It guided the eyes of the Greeks and drew their attention to certain aspects of things .

		It afforded a focus , within which they saw everything in strong relief , out - side which they saw only darkness and confu - sion .

		It determined their whole idea of the world .

		For everywhere they took things at their obvious value , and saw them , so to speak , naked . ''

		Then he turns to their attitude toward such fundamental questions as love , friendship , and death .

		Proceeding always by illustration and comparison , he emphasizes his point , find - ing throughout his search a simplicity and a directness that are at times almost naive , but are none the less unflinching and heart-searching in their straightforwardness .

		The Greeks never substituted color for light . ''

		They were content , in the presence of life , if they could use and enjoy it rightly , and in the presence of death , if they could know it for what it was . ''

		The foregoing must serve as an example of our author 's treatment of his `` Notes of
Hellen	PERSON	- ism '' ; but one chapter on exceptions is quite as interesting as those that represent the rule .

		Believing with
Rohde	PERSON	that Platonic thought and philosophy were an alien phenomenon in
Greece	LOCATION	, he treats the gfeat master as an example of the unhellehic spirit .

		To be sure , he admits that in a thousand ways
Plato	PERSON	was a Greek of the Greeks , nor has he missed the charm and tremendous importance of the master ; but he feels that the great idealist belongs essentially to those who `` taught us to look past the ` unim - aginary and actual ' qualities of things to sec - ondary meanings and an inner symbolism .

		In opposition to liberty and humanism they taught us to mistrust our nature , to see in it weakness , helplessness , an incurable taint , to pass beyond humanity to communion with God , to live less for this world than for one to come . ''

		In this connection he deals very briefly with
Orphism	PERSON	and `` similar gospels of other worldliness '' in
Greece	LOCATION	, and iterates his conclusion that the ex - ceptions to rationalistic humanism are but few .

		Now from Mr.
Livingstone	PERSON	's deliberately limited point of view , I think he is right ; but we must emphasize two points .

		Firstly : Orphism had an influence on Christianity that even yet is very hard to estimate .

		In the paintings of the Cata - combs , for instance , it is clear that the Thracian singer , whether he ever existed or not , was re - garded as prefiguring the Christ , while the echoes from Orphism in the New Testament are fre - quent and important .

		Secondly : many great thinkers in every century since the birth of Christianity , and in every occidental country , have seen in Plato an undying light upon the eternal hills ; and tributes to his abiding great - ness have been poured forth in abundance by the apologists of Christianity from
Clement	PERSON	, who declared that
Plato	ORGANIZATION	wrote by the inspiration of God , to Bishop
Westcott	PERSON	, who states admiringly that he points to St.
John	PERSON	.

		Greek philosophy and Greek religion between them managed to influence the thought and morals of the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	and of all succeeding generations .

		In fact , many scholars are declaring to-day that Greek teaching about immortality and ethics and kindred themes will constitute their most valuable and abiding contribution to civilization .

		At any rate , Mr.
Livingtone	PERSON	's attitude and his confidence in the inherent strength of his case are indicated by his willingness to throw away the powerful arguments for a knowledge of Greek life and literature that can be based on the greatness of Plato and the significance of the Grecian religions of mysticism .

		But then our author is not trying to convert anybody .

		And here lies much of his charm .

		He admits frankly that he is interested in Greek strength and beauty , not in Greek ugliness and weakness ; yet he does not deny that the ugliness 178 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, and weakness were real and ominous .

		He is always willing to concede everything to the other side , sometimes more than is necessary .

		Such a spirit is not less confidence-inspiring than de - lightful ; and to the profane who are not of the grosser sort the volume will offer a much more winning argument for Greek studies than would a more definitely propagandist effort .

		To stu - dents and teachers of the Classics , as also `` to the considerable public who take a humane in - terest in what
Greece	LOCATION	has done for the world , '' it will be a source of genuine pleasure .

		The present reviewer read it the first time with enjoy - ment , a second time with unfeigned delight .

		The book has its defects .

		It skips from ''
Shelley	PERSON	's passionate idealism '' to Bruneti & re 's Sur les
Chemins de la Croyance	ORGANIZATION	with a glad - some agility that recalls the famous measurings in the '' Thinkshop '' of '' The Clouds . ''

		It writes about
Winckelmann	PERSON	in words that will not be clear to readers unfamiliar with his life , and may be misleading .

		It picks examples that are open to controversy .

		To me , at least ,
Pindar	ORGANIZATION	seems a most unfortunate choice as a type of Greek humanism .

		It is extravagantly severe on poor
Helen	PERSON	.

		It is unnecessarily uppish about such amiable souls as Theocritus and
Stevenson	PERSON	and Lamb .

		It jars with a phrase like this : `` A world where the state was first and the individ - ual nowhere , '' which is an obvious adaptation of the famous words of Captain
O'Kelley	PERSON	about the performance of `` Eclipse '' at
Epsom	LOCATION	.

		It even includes the following beautiful sentence in a chapter that is lauding Greek truthfulness and freedom from artificiality : '' We seem in their literature to watch the immediate image of life , unrefracted by any disturbing medium , just as to-day , off their coasts , the traveller some - times sails over a sunken sarcophagus , and far below him can see the carven figures on it , clear and undistorted through the pellucid waters . ''

		It does a hundred things , and remains intel - lectually profitable and stimulating , delightfully written , and generously rich throughout .

		Furthermore , I think , it does render fine and genuine service in the connection I have tried to suggest by the title and the opening para - graph of this review .

		The day of supernatural - ism may never pass for all mankind ; but the number of men and women who can no longer see by its light and live by its breath is increas - ing with startling rapidity .

		They seek their revelation in human nature , their guidance in reason and the experience of the race .

		And Mr.
Livingstone	PERSON	points out that the Greeks are the only people who have conceived the problem similarly , that their answer is the only one which has yet been made .

		So we are turning back to
Greece	LOCATION	, and beginning to understand what the Greeks said and meant .

		We are ascertaining their views , and in some cases accepting them .

		Our author does not explicitly advocate any form of what writers have been calling neo - paganism ; yet his work may easily incur such a charge .

		Now , on the general question many readers will agree with Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's pithy conclusion : '' But if we do revive and pursue the pagan ideal of a simple and rational self - completion we shall end where Paganism ended .

		I do not mean that we shall end in de - struction .

		I mean that we shall end in
Christian	LOCATION	- ity . ''

		But writers like Mr.
Livingstone	PERSON	and Mr.
G. Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	-LRB- in `` The Greek View of Life '' -RRB- are not attempting to revive Paganism , or Hellenism , or anything else .

		They are only insisting , and insisting rightly , that the Greeks faced many of our problems and have much to tell our own generation as it stands before the door of to-morrow .

		THE COMEDY AND TRAGEDY OF AN ACTOR 'S LIFE .

		* The intimate and sometimes amusingly frank self-revelations of
Macready	PERSON	's private diaries , now for the first time publicly printed with scarcely any reservations or omissions , give them that character of warm human interest and un - mistakable naturalness that can not but go far toward reconciling the reader to the somewhat formidable size of the two volumes in which these diaries , between the years
1833	DATE	and
1851	DATE	, are presented by their editor , Mr.
William Toynbee	PERSON	.

		It is thirty-eight years since Sir
Frederick Pollock	PERSON	, one of
Macready	PERSON	's executors , gave to the world the actor 's `` Reminiscences and Se - lections from his Diaries and Letters , '' and the reasons that then made advisable a careful cen - sorship of the wealth of material at the editor 's disposal have now lost their force .

		The eighteen years covered by the present work are the most interesting and eventful of
Macready	PERSON	's life , the period of his highest success in his calling ; and they are also interesting and eventful years in the political , social , and literary history of
England	LOCATION	.

		Earlier and later passages from the actor 's diaries are found in
Pollock	LOCATION	's book ; but before
1833	DATE	the entries are brief and compara - tively unimportant , and after
1851	DATE	they exhibit * THE DIARIES OF
WILLIAM CHARLES MACREADY	PERSON	, 1833-1851 .

		Edited by
William Toynbee	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		With forty-nine portraits .


New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 179
Macready	PERSON	in his retirement and busied chiefly with family affairs .

		The `` Reminiscences , '' covering the period from infancy to the age of thirty-three , and the later letters that are pub - lished with them , will serve as supplement to Mr.
Toynbee	PERSON	's work , and the two books together present in sufficient completeness the famous actor 's four-score years -LRB- 1793-1873 -RRB- .

		With the addition of Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	's succinct and scholarly account of the man and his work , in the '' Eminent Actors '' series , the whole story of
William Charles Macready	PERSON	's public and pri - vate life would seem to have been told for all time .

		A few passages from his full and intimate daily notes will depict the Irish actor 's char - acter better than any description from another person .

		Piety and passion , outbursts of anger and seasons of repentance , pride and humility , the fine enthusiasm of one devoted wholly to his art , and presently the dull prosiness of the introspective moralist these and other contra - dictory qualities are to be found in the gifted actor 's portrait of himself .

		Though his grand - father was a
Dublin	LOCATION	upholsterer and his father an actor and afterward an unsuccessful theatre - manager , young
Macready	PERSON	was sent to Rugby and was expecting to study for the bar when his father 's misfortunes compelled him to take the shortest road to the succor of the distressed family .

		Thus it came about that , as Mr.
Toynbee	PERSON	tells us , '' With the
University	ORGANIZATION	and a learned profession in pros - pect , he was suddenly transported into the squalid atmosphere of a bankrupt provincial theatre which his father , hitherto prosperous , was precariously directing , shadowed by the sheriff 's officer .

		To an aspiring and highly sensitive public-school boy such a transition must have been little less than torture .

		Worse , however , was to follow , for after a few months ' hopeless struggle , the unfortunate manager disappeared behind the walls of Lancaster gaol , leaving his son to face the situation alone , a truly appalling plight for a lad of sixteen , with practically no experience and not a shilling in the treasury . ''

		But he grappled with the difficulty in manly fashion , took command of the stranded com - pany , and contrived to hold it together until his father regained his freedom and was able to re - sume control .

		On the seventh of
June , 1810	DATE	, the son made his first appearance on the stage , in the part of Romeo , in which he '' cut a gal - lant and picturesque figure , '' and found himself fairly launched on his course of forty years ' uninterrupted success as a favorite entertainer of the theatre-going public .

		But it was a well - earned success .

		On the very first page of the present edition of the diaries we find an indica - tion of the unremitting care he bestowed on the study of his parts .

		Under date of
January 2 , 1833	DATE	, he writes : '' My performance this evening of Macbeth afforded me a striking evidence of the necessity there is for thinking over my characters previous to playing , and establishing , by practice if necessary , the particular modes of each scene and important passage .

		1 acted with much energy , but could not -LRB- as I sometimes can , when holding the audience in wrapt attention -RRB- listen to my own voice , and feel the truth of its tones .

		It was crude , and uncertain , though spirited and earnest ; but much thought is yet required to give an even energy and finished style to all the great scenes of the play , except perhaps the last , which is among the best things I am capable of .

		Knowles is ravished with his own acting , and the support it has met with .

		I wish I was with mine . ''

		A little later occurs one of the diarist 's not infrequent outbursts of disgust with his calling , together with a scathing invective against critics in general and the '' Quarterly Review '' editor in particular .

		In his closing sentence
Harriet Martineau	PERSON	would have found joy , as would also many others whom the mordant pen of
Walter Scott	PERSON	's son-in-law had stung to madness .

		`` I wish I were anything rather than an actor except a critic ; let me be unhappy rather than vile !

		If I meant by this that men who usually criticize are vile I should convict myself of equal folly and injustice .

		It is the assumption of the high duties of criticism -LRB- de - manding genius and enthusiasm tempered by the most exact judgment and refined taste -RRB- by mere dealers in words , with no pretentions to integrity of purpose or the advancement of literature , that disgusts and depresses me .

		The sight of the Quarterly Review the arena of
Croker	LOCATION	,
Lockhart	LOCATION	,
Harness	LOCATION	,
Hall	PERSON	, etc. which
H. Smith	PERSON	has sent me , induced a train of thought upon the -LRB- so - called -RRB- criticism of the country .

		Generally speaking it takes its tone from faction .

		The most profound ignor - ance is no obstruction to the most dogmatic assertions these are made , of course , on points that few persons are interested in contradicting , or in seeing contradicted , therefore they remain as texts for the declaimers from the particular Review to preach from .

		It is really my opinion that in the classification of minds such a one as
Lockhart	PERSON	's hireling , defamer , corrupt -LRB- not by direct means of pecuniary bribe , but by party and power -RRB- , malignant trader in sentences pointed to stab , and draw by slow droppings the life-blood of a man 's heart is of the base the basest . ''

		Macready lived to see the mercilessly slash - ing style of criticism go out of fashion , but it is probable that he retained to the last a tongue that could , on occasion , slash with the best of the reviewers and critics .

		Again and again he upbraids himself for giving vent to his anger .

		`` Oh passion !

		passion ! ''

		he exclaims , `` what a wretched , senseless , ruinous guide thou art ! ''

		And in the same vein he descants more at length : '' How strange it is that our experience of the pain as well as unprofitableness of passion should not teach us the lesson of subduing it !

		How many times this morn - 180 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, ing had I to accuse myself and reason myself out of my wrath and impatience , as I drove along , because
Healey	PERSON	had brought me a slow coach instead of a fast cab !

		If there be one folly more injurious to man than another it is the senseless fury of anger . ''

		This same senseless fury was responsible for the hostile relations that grew up , or sprang up , between
Macready	PERSON	and so many of his friends and associates , as
Kean	PERSON	and Forrest ,
Charles Kemble	PERSON	and
Alfred Bunn	PERSON	, and numerous others .

		Among the amiable diarist 's minor foibles we find that of late rising repeatedly censured by him , though an actor might surely be pardoned for hugging his pillow a little longer in the morn - ing than other people .

		Rather amusing are such entries as the following : '' Compunction is injurious if unproductive of improve - ment ; let my revision of this day enable me to be more resolute in my resistance of future temptations , and teach me for my own and my children 's good the necessity of blending activity with enjoyment .

		.

		- .

		. ''

		I am again called upon to note down an instance of my indolence and weakness ; the reflections of yesterday only expose me to further self-reproach to-day .

		I lay in bed until a very late hour .

		As some atonement I walked to town , redeeming part of the day from general censure by using it in the wholesome exercise of the body , which is the best use of time after employing it in strengthening and invigorating our minds ... '' Could not get up when called
this morning	TIME	, so over - come did I feel from want of sleep ; all the coaches had passed , and left me to make a virtue of necessity , which I did by sending my cloak , etc. , to town , and setting off in the sharp air of the morning upon a most delightful walk . ''

		He continues , in quite Pepysian vein , to describe the exhilarating effects of his walk , his gratifica - tion at being invited to take a seat in a very neat gig by a gentleman who was driving to town an invitation that he thankfully declined , as he was walking for exercise and his pleas - ure at the sight of several villagers wheeling home the coal he had given them .

		From that part of the record which describes his American tour in
1843-4	DATE	, a few passages must be quoted .

		In
New York	LOCATION	, soon after landing , he writes : '' Forrest called and took me out to see the reservoir of the aqueduct ; afterwards to see Mrs.
Forrest	PERSON	.

		Dined with
Pierce Butler	PERSON	,
Bryant	PERSON	, Mr. and Mrs.
Longfellow	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
Butler	PERSON	's -LSB-
Fanny Kemble	PERSON	's -RSB- conversation was such that , had I been her husband I should observe that Mrs.
Butler	PERSON	spoke admirably well , but quite like a man .

		She is a woman of a most extraordinary mind ; what she said on most subjects was true the stern truth , but what in the true spirit of charity should not have been said in the presence of one who was obliged to listen to it .

		Alas ! ''

		At
New Orleans	LOCATION
five months later	DATE	he writes : `` Last day of my engagement here !

		The thought brings new animation to my spirits and comparative quiet to my nerves .

		My labour is incessant , monoton - ous , and with nothing in the character of my criticism to stimulate me ; the money and the thought of home are the comforting reflections . ''

		Again , in
New York	LOCATION	, on the eve of leaving our shores , he writes , with a mingling of piety and thrift : `` The anniversary of my opening the Park theatre ,
New York	LOCATION	, since when I find myself , with all expenses paid , about 2,500 bettered in pecuniary circumstances , for which I gratefully , devoutly and earnestly thank God . ''

		Ten portraits of
Macready	ORGANIZATION	, including six in stage costume , and thirty-nine portraits of friends and fellow-actors contribute the pic - torial element of the volumes , and their thou - sand or more pages of excellent reading matter are fully indexed as well as sufficiently provided with footnotes .

		MR. ZANGWILI/S NEW PLAY .

		* The appearance of `` The Next Religion '' has been eagerly awaited by the devoted company of those who hold that no writer since
Browning	PERSON	has taken unto himself the entire wealth of human culture with finer sensitiveness of re - sponse than
Israel Zangwill	LOCATION	.

		His work is not always of even texture ; when the Almighty planned Zangwill , He wrote upon the prescrip - tion , '' ' -
Fiat	ORGANIZATION	mixtura '' yet there be those who believe that in '' The
Mantle	PERSON	of
Elijah	LOCATION	'' the author has given to the world the most elevated novel of a generation ; in '' The Melt - ing Pot '' he has handled a world-problem with masterful security ; his brilliant modern play '' The War-God '' sounds the clearest note of ... `` duty God 's trumpet-answer to life 's dreary riddle . ''

		His internationalism qualifies him for his mis - sion as a cosmopolitan mediator -LRB- it is perhaps not generally known that the composer of the unusu - ally successful American song , '' I 'm Awfully Glad I 'm Irish '' bears the name of Piantadosi -RRB- .

		Open to every stimulus throughout the whole range of elaborated values , Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	has sensed most delicately the richest dignities and beauties of human life .

		He knows his classics and his
Church Fathers	ORGANIZATION	, he has compassed music , history , painting , and the infinite messages of nature : '' the universe has passed through that brain , '' even as in the case of his own
Raphael Dominick	PERSON	.

		In the midst of an appalling super - ficiality among writers , he feels the life-and - death earnestness of the struggle for spiritual existence ; his severe puritanism means more because it is a part of the web of the most * THE NEXT RELIGION .

		A Play in Three Acts .

		By
Israel Zangwill	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


1913	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 181 sumptuous civilization ; he has given body to the visions of those who yearn for a kingdom of God on earth ; he is a true poet and seer of the twentieth century .

		Each of the three acts of '' The Next Re - ligion '' is played against a most effective back - ground : in the first , the scene is laid in a cosy English country parsonage , in which the crisis of the insurgent clergyman is developed with telling strokes ; in the second act we look into the shabby quarters in the
Whitechapel Road	LOCATION	where
Stephen	PERSON	and his family are tasting all the bitterness of poverty and failure ; the last scene shows the splendors of
St. Thomas 's Temple	ORGANIZATION	, the cathedral of
Stephen	PERSON	's `` new religion , '' of which he is the high-priest and prophet .

		But all these scenic and dramatic features are but merest incidents when it comes to confront - ing the critical problem of our earth , '' This labouring , vast , Tellurian galleon , '' floundering in the welter of Islam , and Judaism , and Christianity , the insistent question as to whether Christianity is still able to meet its obligations : whether it should be wound up , or should continue to do business in the hands of receivers ; it is to this ominous taking account of the world 's stock that Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	summons us , and his '' New Religion '' comes as an answer to a waiting which has not been short of pain - ful : we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed
Israel	LOCATION	; if he were not to prove the Moses to lead into a larger land , we had , at least , every right to expect an open-eyed facing of the whole matter .

		Alas and alack !

		this cosmic drama must be added to the large list of Jungle-Books which lead nowhere .

		We had awaited a convincing , universal synthesis , and at the beginning such hopes are encouraged : '' Yes , but the devil 's truth comes by denying God 's truth by affirm - ing .

		From more faith , not from less !

		The next religion will be larger than Christianity , not smaller ; harder , not easier . ''

		We have intima - tions of deep spirituality , of triumphant faith : '' No lip-religion this , but life 's central reality , as clear as the sky , as real as the earth . ''

		It promises to attack the `` world 's dirty work , '' but fails altogether to connect with the fierce dis - persive ethics of to-day 's labor-philosophy .

		It certainly fails to show a religion which attests or even hints at a significant , harmonized uni - verse .

		Through twelve years the action con - tinues , until
Stephen	PERSON	, thanks to the money of a clumsy British Philistine , is `` Master , '' and `` the world at his feet '' one wonders why .

		As to motives and action , we have an almost sardonic blend of light and shade , of hope and despair .

		The real `` push '' to the New Religion comes from
Mary	PERSON	, a pure-minded Christian reaction - ary , a heroine who hangs like a millstone about her husband 's neck , and who by an opportune miraculous prayer becomes a startling dea ex machina at the moment of supreme tragic diffi - culty , the whole situation seeming about as incongruous here as the big engraving of a side - wheeled ocean steamship which marks the close of the third volume of St.
Ambrose	PERSON	's writings in the ''
Patrologia Latina	LOCATION	. ''

		The representa - tives of the protest against the
Christian Church	ORGANIZATION	and its teaching are sorry figures -LRB- even the good
Stephen	PERSON	-RRB- when not vulgar , selfish , or dissipated .

		As to the fire-new Temple-cult , with
Swinburne	PERSON	as a stained-glass Saint -LRB- ein wunderlicher Heiliger ! -RRB-

		, its wax candles and golden candle - sticks , its ever-burning taper before the portrait of Sir
Thomas McFadden	PERSON	, inventor of guns , to say nothing of the sacristan in his `` blue gown with silver spots , '' these things may be con - vincing and heartening to some souls `` credat ludaeus Apella ; nonego '' Even the incidental cleverness is annoying in its futility , and the dramatic tensity at the close is painfully cheap .

		The play sedulously extrudes all undigested objections to superseding
Chris	PERSON	- tianity , and from a sunny outlook leads to the gloomiest fog .

		Mary 's last outcry is against
Stephen	PERSON	's '' miserable religion , '' and the oracular
Hal McFadden	PERSON	,
M.D.	LOCATION	, M.R.C.S. , etc. , trans - formed from a chaser of housemaids into a rep - resentative of
England	LOCATION	's mature wisdom , delivers the final counsel of despair : '' Christianity ca n't be improved on the lesson was cheap at the price .

		Good-bye . ''

		We fail to see that twelve years of dramatic business have advanced the matter one inch .

		Possibly our American perspective is at fault , and it may be impossible to overcome the diffi - culties in estimating the relative values of these things on British soil .

		It is sufficiently axio - matic that a mortal insult in
Illinois	LOCATION	may be a flattering compliment in
Michigan	LOCATION	, or the reverse .

		But however baffled we may be in getting light from Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	's message , our chief marvel lies in the easy gullibility of
England	LOCATION	's
Lord Chamberlain	PERSON	: the Free Thinkers of our allied Empire must surely have bribed him to forbid the performance of `` The Next Religion '' in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, for no conceivable document could be better contrived for driving a whole people , like a flock , into the untroubled fold of the
Holy Apostolic Christian Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		182 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, A CONCORDANCE TO DANTE 'S LATIN WORKS .

		* Concordances are growing in number and favor .

		There is now a flourishing
Concordance Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		Everybody is familiar with one or more biblical concordances .

		The earliest of these were made to show that there is no incon - sistency between one part of the
Bible	LOCATION	and another .

		St.
Anthony	PERSON	of
Padua	LOCATION	should be regarded as the patron saint of concordance makers , as tradition says that he made the first biblical concordance .

		When Dr.
E. A. Fay	PERSON	published his Concordance of the Divina Corn - media , twenty-five years ago , the hope was expressed that the venture might prove suffi - ciently successful to encourage further efforts in the same direction .

		Mr.
Paget Toynbee	PERSON	gave it as his opinion that a concordance to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's minor works , Latin as well as Italian , would undoubtedly do more for the elucidation of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	than half a dozen isolated commentaries , there being no method more profitable than making
Dante	PERSON	his own interpreter .

		A concor - dance of the minor Italian works , compiled by Messrs.
E. S. Sheldon	PERSON	and
A. C. White	PERSON	, was published in
1905	DATE	.

		To complete the series ,
Messrs. E. K. Rand	PERSON	and
E. H. Wilkins	PERSON	, assisted by Mr.
A. C. White	PERSON	, have recently published a concordance of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's Latin works .

		In this are included all the Latin works found in the third edition of the Oxford text ,
1904	DATE	, namely , the `` Eclogae , '' `` De monarchia , '' '' De vulgari eloquentia , '' `` Epistolae , '' and `` Quaestio de aqua et terra . ''

		A concordance is strictly a ready reference book .

		The aim is always a practical one .

		It has no interest for the mere amateur .

		It is to aid the serious student in word study , the loca - tion of a particular passage , or the comparison of the different uses to which an author puts a particular word .

		Its value is chiefly as a help in the critical study of a text or an author .

		Only the authors of highest rank can expect to have the honor of a concordance awarded them .

		Among English authors so honored are
Burns	PERSON	, Gray ,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Pope	LOCATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		Comprehensive indexes and dictionaries of various writers are appearing from year to year , like the recent
Dickens	PERSON	,
Kipling	LOCATION	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, and Zola diction - aries ; but these are mostly concerned with the proper names occurring in the works of the * DANTIS ALAGHERII OPBRUM LATINORUM CONCORDAN - TIAE .

E. H. Wilkins	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		authors mentioned .

		One could not get much assistance if he went to these guides for help on the use of a special word , nor could he determine the frequency of use of a particular expression by consulting their pages .

		Thanks to the work of Messrs.
Fay	PERSON	,
Sheldon	PERSON	and White ,
Rand	LOCATION	and
Wilkins	PERSON	, we now have three valuable aids to the study of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's vocabulary , helps to the study of mediaeval Latin and early Italian as used by the same master hand .

		The maker of a concordance must have pa - tience , industry , accuracy , leisure , and a sense of orderly arrangement .

		Care is more essential than originality , and there is a constant call for the play of judgment in deciding what common - place words not to index , or what to omit when making a concordance to prose works , so that a one-line extract can give a sense of the context and usage of a particular word .

		A higher grade of judgment is required to plan the arrangement of all the material when collected .

		On the part of the compiler , the work must be one of love for the author , lest it turn to drudgery of the most oppressive sort .

		All these qualifications are amply possessed by the compilers of the new Dante concordance .

		To them , as well as to the
Dante Society of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	, to which is due the first impulse , we extend congratulations on the completion of a useful and laborious task exceedingly well done .

		PERSONALITY IN CRITICISM .

		* The four volumes here grouped for review are confessedly miscellanies , and it would be idle to profess to find unity in any one of them , much less in the group , unless it be in the circumstance that they exemplify the power of personality in criticism .

		None of them , that is to say , would have been published without the author 's name ; each of them finds its right to exist in the fact that a considerable number of persons will care to know what its writer has had to say about books .

		Two are posthumous ; and a third , that of Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	, has also a suggestion of posthumous quality , being primarily made up of the reminiscences of an old though , happily , still thoroughly live man .

		GATEWAYS TO LITERATURE , and Other Essays .

		By
Brander Matthews	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 183 tion of the volume called `` Books and Bookmen . ''

		The essay which supplies the title is indeed well worth preserving , with its witty and undoubtedly personal account of the temptations and falls of the bibliolater .

		The other three were written as popular lectures , and show something of the thinness , the want of stuff , which is to be expected of such performances if they appear unchanged in print , an impression strengthened by the fact that the whole book is an example of the all too common contemporary prac - tice of making , by judicious choice of type and paper , a volume which should normally consist of a hun - dred pages look like one of three hundred , and sell for a corresponding price .

		The real worth of the book , as has already appeared , is in its appeal to those who have known the genial
Ian Maclaren	PERSON	or heard him , and who will be glad of any memorial of his personality .

		Such persons will perhaps turn first to the lecture on Humour , which was repeatedly delivered in this country .

		To the reader of this it is even plainer than it must have been to the hearer that Dr.
Watson	PERSON	had nothing of independent value to say about humour except where it touched his own country and countrymen ; but his account of Scottish humour remains delightful , and furnishes a valuable commentary on many of the ''
Brier Bush	PERSON	'' tales .

		It is characterized , we are told , by '' a sense of the underlying tragedy of things , of the contra - dictions and mysteries of life , which have in them a sad absurdity . ''

		And the admirable corollary is this : '' No man comes off so well at a wedding as an Englishman , but none is so ill at ease at a funeral ; while a Scotsman has no freedom at a marriage , since he does not know how the matter may end , but he carries himself as to the manner born at a funeral . ''

		Friends of the late Mr.
Churton Collins	PERSON	, whose criticism was not always distinguished for its gen - iality , may also think it a doubtful tribute to collect the manuscripts which make up the volume of his '' Posthumous Essays . ''

		These essays exhibit , to be sure , the breadth of his interests and the fine back - ground of literary experience which he justly com - plained was so generally wanting in contemporary criticism ; but they show little of the trenchant vigor of the '' Ephemera Critica , '' and on the other hand preserve many imperfections of form which their author would never have permitted to find way into print .

		The greater number were written for delivery as popular lectures , and must be judged from the standpoint of this purpose .

		Of this sort perhaps the most satisfactory is the account of
Emerson	LOCATION	, whose character is portrayed with finely discriminating appreciation .

		The keynote of the interpretation might be found in Mr.
Collins	PERSON	's interesting state - ment that
Emerson	PERSON	combined some of the striking qualities of
Berkeley	LOCATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	.

		It was always Mr.
Collins	PERSON	's distinction to stress more firmly the actual content of literature than is the habit of those who have devoted themselves to literature as a profession .

		Of this practice signifi - cant examples are found in the essays on Words - A / worth and
Browning	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Collins	PERSON	reacts strongly against
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's contempt for the Words - worthian philosophy , and holds that , the better we know
Wordsworth	PERSON	's poetry , the more shall we value its actual contribution to the thought of the age .

		Of
Browning	PERSON	's religious philosophy his account is the most substantial portion of the volume , being presented in three essays with the alluringly myste - rious titles , ''
Browning	PERSON	and
Butler	PERSON	, '' ''
Browning	PERSON	and Montaigne , '' and ''
Browning	PERSON	and
Lessing	PERSON	. ''

		To have found close kinship between the theological speculations of the authors of the `` Analogy , '' the '' Essays , '' and the '' LaocoOn , '' Anglican divine , Renaissance Catholic-skeptic , and eighteenth-century German theorist , must have been a rewarding in - tellectual experience .

		Mr.
Collins	PERSON	's further discern - ing of parallels between all these and the vaguely Christian idealism of
Browning	PERSON	's poetry has already been ridiculed as an example of his well-known taste for literary resemblances , viewed , as others have believed , under a very strong microscope .

		In the present instance , however , he was not so much con - cerned with source-hunting or questions of influence as with the kinship between superficially different processes of justifying religious faith ; and the paral - lels he draws must be interesting to every student of
Browning	PERSON	.

		Whether Mr.
Collins	PERSON	implicitly exagger - ates the value of the several processes is a question for theologian or philosopher .

		Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's volume is even more a miscellany than these others , containing , for example , two exceedingly learned essays on Byzantine history -LRB- one of them the Rede Lecture at
Cambridge	LOCATION	Uni - versity ,
1900	DATE	-RRB- , fortified with many footnotes , side by side with comments of the most chatty character on `` Poets that I Love '' and editions which are pleasant to put in one 's bag for a journey .

		It might appear that Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	, having undergone some severe discipline in the field of history , values scholarly method in connection with that subject ; whereas in the field of literature , having been always an amateur , he is disposed to scorn other methods than those of the amateur .

		At any rate he holds that the '' word of ill-omen known as Research hangs upon literature like the microbe of Sleeping Sick - ness , '' leading men to make books `` by laborious poking into charnel houses and dustbins of the past , instead of by intelligent understanding of men and things . ''

		Again , in matters of literary judgment he warns us not to trust to experts , since a specialist is necessarily limited in his outlook .

		Wherever art is concerned , Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	aspires to the same catholicity which his Positivism has taught him in matters of religion , such an unprejudiced temper as won for him the approval of
Cardinal Newman	PERSON	, he tells with gusto , as translator of the '' Imitation of Christ . '' ''

		What I contend for , '' he says in the essay on tragedy , '' is respect for all great types of art , and freedom from national , personal , or sectional bias . '

		Art is long , ' but inexhaustible . ''

		In one direction , however , he refuses to extend the scope of his appreciation .

		In a brief essay on
Rodin	ORGANIZATION	he 184 -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, takes the great sculptor as typical of indefensible tendencies in contemporary art , whose single aim , apparently , `` is to shock one 's grandmother . ''

		After the Victorian period , when '' things were decorous , refined , and conventional , because it was an age of serious , decent , unimaginative men and women with a turn for science , social reform , and making things comfortable , '' came an incursion of morbid degen - eracy characteristic of '' the Scandinavian and Mon - gol imagination , '' with a new cult , which might be dubbed '' A ischrolatreia worship of the Ugly , the Nasty , the Brutal . ''

		After indulging himself in this healthy outburst , Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	proceeds to discuss more philosophically why sculpture is of all arts the least fitted to the peculiar mannerisms of the age of
Rodin	LOCATION	.

		The real .

		worth of these essays -LRB- barring those based on historical learning -RRB- is again in the essay - ist 's personality : in the personality of that type of amateur of literature which it is the special glory of the English universities to produce .

		The six essays which give the volume its title are frankly confined to the rehearsal of the personal tastes of the writer , as he goes about his library in old age and takes account of what it contains that is still vital , still beloved , after all the years .

		And is this , indeed , not as valid a laboratory test as one is likely often to have the chance of observing ?

		On occasion we may feel certain that some error of the personal equation is implied , as when Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	exclaims of
Byron	PERSON	's Letters , `` This is the finest prose in our language '' ; or when he observes , `` I care for
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's metaphysics as little as for the rhapsodical gammon of Professor
Bergson	PERSON	or Miss
Marie Corelli	PERSON	'' -LRB- which does not keep him from reading his Plato `` with ever new delight '' -RRB- .

		But in general he is close enough in touch with the judgment of the ages , of the orbis terrarum , to make one certain that his guidance among his books will be not only agreeable but sound .

		In turning to
Professor Brand er Matthews	ORGANIZATION	's essays we leave reminiscence and retrospection for alert contemporary criticism , more worldly than acad - emic , even if it be from the professorial chair .

		Two matters of external detail will attract the attention of one who picks up this volume .

		On the title-page is a continental sort of appendage to the author 's name , '' Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters , '' reminding us of that to which we have at length attained in the way of an hierarchy of which earlier generations of Anglo-Saxon men of letters idly dreamed .

		The other matter is reformed spelling in the text , calling to mind Professor Mat - thews 's eloquent service on behalf of the
Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	, at whose pertinacity many of his friends have scoft in vain .

		Letting pass these frivolities , one finds a dozen essays on literature as various as the works of
Fenimore Cooper	ORGANIZATION	and of
Anatole France	LOCATION	, all in the urbane and liberal tone which the accus - tomed reader knows so well .

		To anyone interested in the art of the essayist perhaps the outstanding element in this collection is the theory and the prac - tice of the French idea of critical style .

		In more than one passage Professor
Matthews	PERSON	refers to the `` Parisian tradition '' of writing always for the gen - eral reader , of renouncing `` overt individuality , '' and eschewing self-expression of a kind likely to shock any person addressed ; and nothing could be plainer than that this is always the goal which he sets before himself .

		The virtues of the method are doubtless suitable for imitation on the part of any young critic , but it has `` the defects of its qualities . ''

		When one has been led easily and gracefully through fifty pages of the essayist 's urbanities , he finds him - self beginning to wish to be shocked in some fashion , either by a really salient idea or a mannerism of expression , even if it be some extraordinary thrust of personality in the manner of a
Saintsbury	LOCATION	.

		He begins to weary , too , of the elegantly amateurish way in which the abundant quotations from other critics are introduced , `` It was a Frenchman who de - clared '' ; `` As Whitney once phrased it '' ; `` It was the wise
Mommsen	PERSON	who called '' etc. ; `` It was the shrewd
Bagehot	PERSON	who asserted '' ; `` As
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	declared poetically . ''

		These instances are from a half dozen pages , pages guiltless , incidentally , of any too scholastic footnote which might aid a thor - ough reader to seek out a citation in its context .

		It must have required much self-restraint on the part of a scholar to so purge his method and style of the dreadful German habit called griindlichkeit .

		But while we may be genuinely grateful to him for doing so , we must regretfully admit that some of the merits of griindlichkeit such as the sense that we have really come to grips with the heart of the subject , as distinguished from circumnavigating it appreci - atively have been lost at the same time with the clumsiness of the German style .

		Of the subjects discussed in this volume , perhaps those to which the author makes the happiest con - tributions are
Familiar Verse	ORGANIZATION	, the Duty of Imitation ` on the part of young writers , and
Anatole France	LOCATION	.

		Another topic from which one hopes not a little is the elusive question as to the indifference of English readers to French poetry ; but it is disappointing to learn nothing of this beyond the familiar facts that the French language lacks accent , lacks semi-tones , and lacks Germanic root-words , though these are restated with persuasiveness and charm .

		-LRB- On this subject there is now available the recent and valuable discussion of M. Legouis . -RRB-

		Perhaps least appealing , to many readers , is a curious little essay called '' The Devil 's Advocate , '' in which are brought together '' historic doubts '' concerning the right of
Johnson	PERSON	,
Ruskin	PERSON	, and
Carlyle	PERSON	to a lasting place among great writers .

		It will be seen that the real source of unity in this grouping is in the common element of alleged bad manners , together with the element of exaggerated personality in style .

		But the devil 's advocate -LRB- quite properly , of course -RRB- is allowed to forget such facts as that , while Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	wrote a very bad style , he also wrote a very fine one .

		Who can read the closing words of the Preface to the Dictionary , or many a passage in the Preface to
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 185 Shakespeare , and believe that his influence as a stylist was altogether `` artificial and demoralizing '' ?

		And as to lacking readers , there are signs of a new growth in this direction , of a new appreciation of
Johnson	ORGANIZATION	's sturdy sagacity and truthfulness , witness the recent lectures of Professor
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	.

		Here Mr.
Churton Collins	PERSON	, in some pages that exhibit sound appreciation not only of
Johnson	PERSON	's personality but of the substantial value of what he wrote , probably comes much nearer than the devil 's advocate to representing the final judgment of the court .

M. Legouis	PERSON	's valuable biography of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, which appeared in Les grands ecrivains Strangers -LRB-

1910	DATE	-RRB- .

		We do not hesitate to pronounce it the most stimu - lating and suggestive book on
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, of its kind , that has appeared in many years .

		M. Legouis brings to his task exceptional qualifications : wide familiar - ity with the literatures of both

		As a Frenchman , too , he naturally pays much attention to the style of the poet .

		He emphasizes the value of the training Chaucer received from his close imita - tion of the intricate verse forms of
Machaut	ORGANIZATION	and his contemporaries .

		The Roman de la Rose , `` the great poetical well '' of the fourteenth century , was to Chaucer even more than a school for style ; it sup - plied him with many thoughts , images , turns of ex - pression .

		Indeed , recording as
M. Legouis	PERSON	's book does the results of the latest scholarship , it differs from earlier works in representing Chaucer as far more of a borrower than was formerly supposed to be the case .

		It is not merely that he borrows plots and motifs , as did everybody in those days and for a long time afterward ; it is not that he echoes many a line , and phrase , and bon mot , stored up by a re - tentive memory through years of absorbed reading ; it is indeed the very essence of French poetry that he reproduces the pure , even tone of the trouveres , the simplicity , the restraint , the sober sense , betoken - ing the firm control of mind over feeling , which were distinguishing traits of the old French poets and which , in
M. Legouis	PERSON	's opinion , serve to set off Chaucer 's poetry in such sharp contrast with that of his English predecessors that to pass from one to the other seems like going into a different world .

		It is natural that a Frenchman should be the first to appreciate this fully and set it forth in telling fashion .

		Yet the author by no means belittles the genius of the English poet ; nor is there any undue display of patriotism in his description of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's French debt .

		He represents Chaucer indeed as a very human poet , who never poses as a mentor , but would always be looked upon as `` a good-natured companion always ready to make place for some - body else , '' and who very quickly makes himself our friend .

		Yet he contends that
Chaucer marks	MONEY	a dis - tinct advance , which may be characterized as a progress of the intelligence : a weakening of passion based on self-confidence , a keen pleasure in observ - ing men as they are , a willingness to portray average humanity .

		`` He leads the group of amused and good-natured observers who will accept as a fact the motley fabric of society , without wishing to dye to a uniform colour the many strands that compose it . ''

		Thus he becomes the first , as he is not the least , of the realists .

		M. Lailavoix as a translator has ac - quitted himself well .

		Occasionally he has made a foreigner 's slip in idiom , as e.g. , when he says that the Wife of Bath `` must be put on the same rank with Panurge and Falstaff '' -LRB- p. 175 -RRB- ; but such in - stances are rare .

		Some will regret that he has not thought it necessary to translate
M. Legouis	PERSON	's care - ful analysis -LRB- sixty-four pages -RRB- of `` The Canterbury Tales '' ; but as partial compensation for this omis - sion we have a well-written preface of thirty pages in which the translator himself sums up French knowledge and opinions of Chaucer , deriving his facts chiefly from
Miss Spurgeon	LOCATION	's work .

		We have noted one or two misprints : p. 5 , in the quotation read floytinge ; p. 118 , 1 .

		6 f.b. , read
Robert K. Root	PERSON	; p. 119 , read De Casibus Virorum , etc. .

		The frontispiece portrait of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, reproduced from the
Occleve MS.	ORGANIZATION	now owned by Mr.
Munro	PERSON	, comes out much better than it does in the French edition .


Bergson	PERSON	's own Two translations of
Henri Bergson	PERSON	's * oM?n n `` Introduction a la M & aphysique '' philosophy .

		are published almost simultaneously under the respective titles of `` An Introduction to Metaphysics '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- in a rendering made by Mr.
T. E. Hulme	PERSON	, and `` The Introduction to a New Philosophy '' -LRB- Luce -RRB- translated by Mr.
Sidney Litt	PERSON	- man .

		Mr.
Hulme	PERSON	's translation has the very decisive advantage of having been revised in proof by
M. Bergson	PERSON	, and further advantage was taken of that fact to make several changes in the presentation of the subject .

		And apart from this , Mr.
Hulme	PERSON	's trans - lation is the more exact of the two .

		On the other hand Mr.
Littman	PERSON	's volume includes a portrait of
Bergson	LOCATION	, which may be a consideration with some admirers of the French philosopher .

		The reader should not surmise from the original title that the author has written a general textbook .

		He simply gives us in these pages the basis upon which his own philosophy is built .

		Briefly , his argument is that the intellect , working as it does for practical ends , in the interests of the control of matter , tends to dia - gram everything , to specialize on the fixed and the expected features of reality ; and then , when it be - gins to speculate , it takes the diagrams of reality for reality itself .

		From this tendency come the errors of the conflicting schools of philosophy , which have 186 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, all failed to see that the reality of life is a continual becoming , a flow which will not stop and mould itself on the categories of the understanding .

		This flow , says
Bergson	PERSON	, can not be described in the static terms of the intellect any more than grey can be described to a man who has never seen it in terms of black and white , although after it is once seen it can be analyzed into those terms .

		To comprehend reality then , we must use a faculty of direct perception , an intuition which is behind , and more fundamental than , intellectual understanding .

		There is nothing mysterious about that faculty , says
Bergson	PERSON	.

		`` Every one of us has had occasion to exercise it to a cer - tain extent .

		Any one of us , for instance , who has attempted literary composition , knows that when the subject has been studied at length , the materials all collected , and the notes all made , something more is needed in order to set about the work of composi - tion itself , and that is an often very painful effort to place ourselves directly at the heart of the subject , and to seek as deeply as possible an impulse , after which we need only let ourselves go ... Meta - physical intuition seems to be something of the same kind .

		What corresponds here to the documents and notes of literary composition is the sum of the observations and experiences gathered together by positive science .

		For we do not obtain an intuition from reality that is , an intellectual sympathy with the most intimate part of it unless we have won its confidence by a long fellowship with its superficial manifestations . ''

		This last sentence should be an answer to those who have ridiculed the Bergsonian method on the ground that it exalted an alleged mystical faculty above positive science .

		The crowded life The record .

		of J hn
Wesley	LOCATION	's strenu - of a great ous life , with its thousands of miles religious leader .

		of yearly travel and its incessant preaching to audiences of humble hearers , is fairly equalled by the crowded chronicle of General Will - iam Booth 's gospel labors from the sixteenth year of a life that exceeded the Psalmist 's limit by thirteen years .

		`` The Authoritative Life of General
William Booth	PERSON	, Founder of the
Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
G. S. Railton	PERSON	, the
General	ORGANIZATION	's
First Commissioner	ORGANIZATION	, comes seasonably from the press within six months of the famous religious leader 's death .

		Like
Wesley	PERSON	and like
Fox	ORGANIZATION	,
William Booth	PERSON	had to maintain his cause against great public opposition , and like them he knew no such word as defeat .

		The fruit of his cour - age and enthusiasm was a religious organization ex - tending to every part of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and to half a hundred other countries as well .

		That so frail a form , sustained by a diet incredibly meagre in its proportions , could have borne the burden of work and travel put upon it , especially in later years , ex - cites wonder and admiration .

		It was the sustaining power of a high and unselfish purpose that carried him through .

		In his biographer he is fortunate to have a man more intimately familiar with the details of his life and work than anyone outside his immediate family .

		Mr.
Railton	PERSON	freely supplements his narra - tive with extracts from
Booth	ORGANIZATION	's journals and letters and published writings .

		Characteristic of Mr.
Booth	PERSON	and in harmony with the plan of the biography is the omission of those details which , while of less moment than the successive steps in the evangelist 's rise to world-wide recognition and in the recruiting of his great army of religious workers , would have pictured the man to us more vividly as a human being and would have imparted variety to the narra - tive .

		For instance , while the
General	ORGANIZATION	tells us much about his six weary years of apprenticeship at Not - tingham and his subsequent period of irksome toil in
London	LOCATION	, he seems not to think it worth while , or of any interest to the reader , to explain in what his labors consisted .

		We fail to find any mention of the trade to which he was apprenticed , the fact of his conversion in the course of that apprenticeship overshadowing in its importance all less spiritual concerns .

		As a record of evangelistic toil and achievement , and as a history of the
Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	, the book is all that could be desired .

		It is well illustrated , and a useful chronological table is added .

George H. Doran Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Essavsbvthe `` Anecdotes and entertainment , wife of a rather than severe speculations , his - famous essayist , torical and social , are the farrago libelli the burden of the book , '' writes
Andrew Lang	PERSON	in a prefatory note to his wife 's volume of collected papers , `` Men , Women , and Minxes '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		Eighteen diverting studies in biog - raphy and literature and the philosophy of life , some of them dating back a quarter of a century , were chosen in Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's lifetime by himself and Mrs.
Lang	PERSON	from her contributions to various periodicals , and were in press for book publication at the time of his death .

		It is a severe test for a woman writer to be compared with so brilliant a literary crafts - man as was
Andrew Lang	PERSON	; but the comparison is inevitable , and in truth implies a compliment , for dissimilars are never compared , but rather con - trasted .

		Something of her husband 's lightness of touch , something of his command of a wide range of curious reading , and something of his fondness for the frequent unexpected or humorous turn of thought , are perceptible in Mrs.
Lang	PERSON	's pages .

		She treats , with equal facility , '' A Poseuse of the Eighteenth Century '' namely ,
Madame de Genlis	PERSON	, `` The Social Records of a Scotch Family , '' `` Pit - falls for Collectors , '' ``
Rousseau	PERSON	's Ideal Household , '' `` Morals and Manners in
Richardson	LOCATION	, '' `` Two Cen - turies of American Women , '' '' Other People 's Friends , '' and various other topics .

		But in her '' Trials of the Wife of a Literary Man , '' in which she ought to speak with authority , she pictures that woman 's lot as too unendurable to be true ; she makes the literary husband talk '' shop '' and ride his hobby to the point of utter weariness , whereas the surpris - ing and refreshing thing about the best of literary men about
Browning	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Scott	PERSON	and
William Black	PERSON	, and dozens more is their unaffected delight in escaping from the subjects associated with
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 187 their bread-winning pursuits .

		Can it be that the late
A. L.	PERSON	was such a prig and pedant as these '' trials '' would have us believe the average literary man to be ?

		Impossible !

		studies in ma * n authorities depended primitive upon by the German critic ,
Arthur Christianity	PERSON	.

		Drews , in his attack upon the doctrine of an historical Jesus , was Dr.
William Benjamin Smith	PERSON	of
Tulane University	ORGANIZATION	, a mathematician by vocation but a theologian by avocation , who had independently reached the same conclusion as the German scholar , that
Jesus	PERSON	was not an historical personage .

		The book in which Professor
Smith	PERSON	's conclusions were set forth in detail , '' Ecce Deus : Studies in Primitive Christianity '' -LRB-
Open Court Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , was originally written in German and published in
Germany	LOCATION	probably owing to the fact that a work of such character is not only more sure of general welcome there , but because the judgment of the author 's peers on his work must be a German judg - ment .

		Now the book comes , in enlarged form , to the English reader , after its ground has been pre - pared by the wide discussion of the recent English translation of
Drews	ORGANIZATION	's book .

		While the general consensus of opinion is against both scholars in their contention , the fact must be apparent even to their opponents that they have done good service in clearing away from the figure of Christ much that is undoubtedly unhistorical and misleading .

		Pro- fessor
Smith	PERSON	's discussion of such points as the in - terpolated references to Jesus in the writings of
Josephus	PERSON	, for instance , is a matter of general interest to believers and non-believers alike .

		Stated posi - tively , Professor
Smith	PERSON	's thesis is that primitive Christianity was the evangel of a Saviour-God , con - ceived monotheistically , and described in symbolic terms which afterward came to be interpreted as referring to the man Jesus .

		His work , therefore , is not to be regarded as an attack on Christianity , but simply as an alternative explanation of its origin and growth .

		_ Later memories Mr Henl 7 Ma y ers
Hyndman	PERSON	's of an Enaiish '' Further Reminiscences '' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- pubhcist .

		j an ^ f orms a sequel to his `` Record of an Adventurous Life , '' which came out two years ago and attracted attention by its variety of interest and liveliness of style .

		That book brought the writer 's life down to
1889	DATE	; the present volume con - tinues the discursive narrative to the year just ended .

		Social and economic questions naturally claim the lion 's share of space in the pages of this energetic social-democrat , but literary topics also find a place , and among literary celebrities Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, with whom Mr.
Hyndman	PERSON	is evidently on intimate terms , receives most frequent mention .

		As a sample of the book 's engaging manner , and in illustration of its author 's out-spoken partisanship on any ques - tion , small or great , that presents itself for discus - sion , the following passage is worth quoting .

		`` But h propos of that albuminous repast of his , what a pity it is that
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	should have stunted the natural growth of his mind and racked his intellect to fiddle - strings by his confoundedly inappropriate diet .

		Why has
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	no pathos ?

		How is it he is destitute of poesy ?

		What makes his humour comparatively thin ?

		Why do his dramas tend to peter out at their latter end ?

		I say it with all confidence and certi - tude : because his food is not suited to our damnable climate , and his drink does him no good .

		In
Sicily	LOCATION	, or
Tasmania	LOCATION	, at
Santa Barbara	LOCATION	,
Cape Town	LOCATION	or Copiapd these vegetarian vagaries may be pardon - able , though I should be sorry to try them on myself even there .

		But in
England	LOCATION	and in
London	LOCATION	, to say nothing of
Ireland	LOCATION	and
Dublin	LOCATION	, they are a sheer tempting of
Providence	LOCATION	to reduce a man to his lowest possible common denominator . ''

		Here , then , at last we have pathos and poesy traced to their source in beef and ale .

		The book is full of good things , almost as good as beef and ale , but it does not abound in pathos and poesy which , however , the reader will not look for .

		Mr.
Hugh Child	PERSON	ers , who died last
summer	DATE	> completed shortly before his death the manuscript of a collection of historical studies entitled '' Romantic Trials of Three Centuries , '' now published by
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The twelve cases selected for discussion were tried between the years
1650	DATE	and
1850	DATE	.

		They are very unequal in interest and importance .

		Disraeli 's early libel suit has relatively no significance , except such as attaches to the smallest of a great man 's doings and sufferings ; and the
Lyons	PERSON	Mail mystery , although the case is worked out by the author with enthusiastic thoroughness , falls somewhat out of the cadre , being as it is the only matter treated which has nothing to do with
England	LOCATION	or English proced - ure .

		Each one of the others touches on some inter - esting phase in the development of English criminal law .

		The trial of
Elizabeth Canning	ORGANIZATION	for perjury , to instance one of them , was the first `` of those elaborately conducted criminal trials in which no time or expense is spared on either side , and in which all the characteristics of English criminal law are seen at their best . ''

		That of
William Penn	LOCATION	for street preaching , to name another , first established defini - tively the right of juries to acquit , without reference to the attitude of the judge .

		Mr.
Childers	PERSON	was so thoroughly interested in his cases that the reader 's interest is not likely to flag , even when , as in the matter of the
Lyons Mail	ORGANIZATION	, he presents the slightly varying evidence of witness after witness with a per - sistency that grows fatiguing and confusing .

		In such easily followed and thrillingly interesting trials as that of the unfortunate '' macaroni parson ''
Dodd	PERSON	, his narrative makes a powerful appeal even to the reader who has little interest in legal minutiae .

		That Mr.
Kendall	PERSON	Banning is a ver - a. satile young writer is evidenced by the simultaneous publication , under the auspices of the
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	of the Book ,
Chicago	LOCATION	, of two booklets as widely different in contents as '' The
Squire	PERSON	's Recipes '' and '' The Love Unend - 188 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, ing . ''

		The former , irreverently known as '' the booze book , '' pretends to be a collection of recipes for the concoction of a dozen alluring and insidious drinks , as originated by one
Calvin Banning	PERSON	, the author 's putative ancestor .

		It masquerades as a reprint of a pamphlet dated
Sudbury	LOCATION	,
1784	DATE	, and the mystification is effectively carried out by the employment of old - fashioned typographical devices .

		As for the recipes , they sound good , and will probably be found good by those who venture to follow them .

		Mr.
Banning	PERSON	's other booklet is a collection of four sonnets , dedi - cated to the memory of '' the wife of my youth . ''

		We quote the one called '' Communion . '' ''

		No circumstance of death shall part us twain : My love for thee is not but for a day ; But sometime , somehow , ever and for aye , Mine arms shall hold thee to mine own again .

		Time shall not enter unto love 's domain ; Men , creeds and worlds and gods , in grim array , Like chaff before the storm , shall sweep away , And death shall die .

		But love , our king , shall reign .

		Somewhere , between the black , abysmal night That broods in silence , endless and profound Below the thunders of the seventh hell , And heaven 's utmost high celestial height , Where perfect love by perfect peace is crowned My soul shall find thee .

		And the rest is well . ''

		The undeniable beauty of this sonnet is matched in the other three .

		And a photogravure of Watts 's '' Love and Death '' provides a frontispiece in exqui - site keeping with the emotion of the poems .

		New light on the In rescuing from oblivion the names exploration of of four Virginian explorers -LRB- Wood , the
Ohio Valley	LOCATION	.

		Batt8 > Fallam , and
Needham	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and establishing by their narratives the fact that the actual discovery of the Trans - Allegheny region was made by the English and not by the French , a notable addition to the history of North American exploration has been made by Messrs.
Clarence Wadsworth Alvord	PERSON	and
Lee Widgood	PERSON	, whose vol - ume embodying this result is published by the
Arthur H. Clark Co.	PERSON	under the title , `` The First Explorations of the Trans -
Allegheny Region	ORGANIZATION	by the Virginians , 1650-1674 . ''

		It is singular enough that two such painstaking historians as
Francis Parkman	PERSON	and
Justin Winsor	PERSON	should have denied the authenticity of these discoveries ; but as the most essential link in the chain of evidence Abraham Wood 's letter describing the journeys of
Needham	ORGANIZATION	and
Arthur	PERSON	was buried in the
Public Record Office	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	, there is perhaps some excuse for their mistake .

		To complete the story , the editors have brought together in this volume not only several documents that had never before seen the light , but also some that had already been published .

		None of these latter , however , were readily accessible .

		Not the least valuable part of the work is the full and scholarly introduction , in which the editors succeed in throwing a very clear light not only upon the lives and achievements of the discoverers , but also upon the circumstances and conditions that impelled them to cross the mountains the first pathfinders in the restless and resistless movement toward the west .

		A bibliography and an analytical index , two features often enough missing in works of this character , add materially to the value of the book from the student 's point of view .

England	LOCATION	, the obituary notice , are some of the forty subjects dealt with . ''

		If Mr.
James	PERSON	has ever written any little masterpiece better than this , which is doubtful , he has certainly never written any more sympathetic , more attractive , and , finally , more entertaining .

		Intensely modern in their spirit , and treating of the social and even commercial problems of to-day in their ethical aspects , they are restrained and almost classical in form .

		`` The Gauntlet '' deals with the question of a similar moral standard for both sexes , '' The New System '' with the distinction _ between personal and business morals , `` Beyond Human Power '' with the ^ T-V-T ^ power of one man 's will over another .

Seventh Edition	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- f nr Olrl By
WILLIAM CARLETON lOl V/IU Author	PERSON	of `` One Way Out ''
William Carleton	PERSON	, in `` One Way Out , '' told only half his story .

		As his business pros - pered , he bought a farm , and in the country village ran up against another set of conditions which surprised him , but which he proceeded to tackle in the same spirit which won success for him as an emigrant to the slums .

		He found the town asleep and began , as he expressed it , `` to blow the resurrection trumpet . ''

		He made a live town of it and incidentally made it a big paying proposition .

		Perhaps few books have appeared at what is so clearly the opportune time .

		Community cooperation , rural and urban , is the method by which the movement for efficiency in country life is expected to realize itself .

		`` New Lives for Old '' is the expression of the spirit and the practice of co-operation .

		The director of the school of agriculture in an important American university calls the book `` the most helpful contribution yet made to the revival of agricultural interest . ''

		A man about to take up a homestead in the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	writes : `` It is impossible for me to tell you of the great inspiration and good I have gained from reading ' New Lives for Old . '

		When up in that new country I know it will help me make the success that I 'm going to make . ''

		`` Mr.
Carleton	PERSON	bought a tumbled-down old house with fifty acres of land attached and undertook its regeneration .

		He did more than this he got at the root of the reason why ` farming does n't pay ' and he is n't afraid to say why .

		Read and you will get a new view of farm conditions . ''

		One can not criticise these poems .

		It is brimming over with words of truth for the thirsty and of guidance for those astray ; a helping hand to the weak and weary is extended therein ; and wise counsel is given to the misinformed .

		It is practical as well as idealistic .

		The final word is a beautiful poem entitled , ''

		AN EXECUTIVE OF LETTERS .

		Commenting upon the election of
M. Poincare	PERSON	to the Presidency of the French Republic , the
London	LOCATION	`` Nation '' wrote the other day as fol - lows : `` Thus the
Republic	ORGANIZATION	makes choice of a citizen eminently in accord with its ideals , and singularly fitted to represent and adorn its standard of manners .

		It will now be the legi - timate boast of the intellectual Frenchman that the titular head of his
State	ORGANIZATION	is also a member of the Academy . ''

		How many Americans , we wonder , are acquainted with the fact that these words are literally applicable to the man who for some ten days past has filled the exalted office of President of the
United States	LOCATION	?

		And of those who are somehow dimly aware that there is such a body as the
American Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Letters , and that Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	is a member thereof by virtue of his distinction in letters , how many realize the significance of the latter fact for our culture as a nation , and for our standing in the eyes of that section of man - kind which appreciates intellectual distinction and has a just sense of human values ?

		It is now the legitimate boast of the intellectual American , as of the Frenchman , '' that the titular head of his
State	ORGANIZATION	is also a member of the Academy . ''

		We have long been assured by pessimists that there was no use in hoping for certain desirable things under our system of government that the Constitution , for example , was practically unamendable , that the machinery for removing from the bench a corrupt judge was practically unworkable , and that the highest office in our gift could not possibly be bestowed upon the sort of American who stood in the opinion of the elect as the finest embodiment of our national idealism .

		Thirty years ago , it was frequently remarked by those who believed
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	to be the first of Amer - icans then living that under no conceivable cir - cumstances could he , or any man of his type , become the chief magistrate of the nation .

		Well , the kaleidoscope of politics has made realities of all three of those impossibilities during the space of a year , and in the choice of a President the most seemingly impossible of them all .

		Let it not be said lightly after this that the American people is so hampered by the machinery of its own creating as to be unable to put into effect its own deeper purposes .

		224 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, The writings of the Presidents of the
United States	LOCATION	have been collected by the industry of historians into imposing sets of volumes that fill many feet of shelving in all our large libra - ries .

		No `` five-foot shelf '' of culture could ac - commodate more than a small fraction of these books .

		Most of their contents , to be sure , are innocent of the tincture of letters , and we know how
Charles Lamb	PERSON	would have classified them .

		The `` works '' of Madison and of Polk and of
Buchanan	PERSON	and of
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	may not even re - motely be associated with literature , and are valuable only for their biographers and the his - torians of their periods .

		But in the
Sahara	LOCATION	of the mass of Presidential writings there are scat - tered oases for the reader 's refreshment .

		In the recorded words of
Washington	LOCATION	and
Jefferson	PERSON	there is something more than material for history .

		There are passages which strike the hu man note , and have the validity of literature because they transcend the conditions under which they were produced .

		The writings of Lincoln contain purple patches of wisdom adorned with style for which nothing less than the inspiration of genius can account .

		The epic of the Civil War , as unfolded in
Grant	LOCATION	's memoirs , was awarded very high praise for its purely literary value by no less a critic than
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		The volume of Mr.
Roose	PERSON	- velt 's writings is so great , and so respectable , if not distinguished , in quality , as to give their author a recognized place in American litera - ture , and win for him an election to the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	, thus making him a sharer in the distinction of our present Executive .

		Never - theless , Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	is a man of letters in a more absolute sense than any of his predeces - sors .

		He won his spurs as a modest scholar and teacher , before political preferment appeared on his horizon , and no accident of adventitious rank , but his own intrinsic abilities , made pub - lishers and editors seek out and solicit his work .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	once wrote an essay on
Bagehot	PERSON	, whom he called `` A Literary
Politi	PERSON	- cian , '' defining the term as `` the man who has the genius to see deep into affairs , and the dis - cretion to keep out of them . ''

		He has not been discreet enough to live up to this definition , but the indiscretion may be imputed to him for right - eousness , and the hobgoblin of inconsistency in this matter is not likely to cause him sleepless nights .

		Elsewhere in the same context , he enlarges upon his definition .

		`` The literary politician , let it be distinctly said , is a very fine , a very superior species of the man thoughtful .

		He reads books as he would listen to men talk .

		He stands apart , and looks on , with humorous , sympathetic smile , at the play of policies .

		He will tell you for the asking what the players are thinking about .

		He divines at once how the parts are cast .

		He knows beforehand what each act is to discover .

		He might readily guess what the dialogue is to contain .

		Were you short of scene-shifters , he could serve you admirably in an emergency .

		And he is a better critic of the play than the players . ''

		In this genial description , Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	has given us his own characterization , although he would be the last person in the world to style himself `` a very superior species of the man thoughtful . ''

		But his friends will insist that this is no less true of him than all the rest .

		And he can do nothing else that will so dignify and exalt his office as the bringing into the discharge of its duties the objectivity and the fine detachment that are the attributes of his ideal literary politician .

		An emergency has pressed him into the service of scene-shifting , and we expect him to prove equal to the occasion .

		`` New occasions bring new duties , '' says the poet , but we can not conceive that in the present instance the duties will be really new .

		Rather will they be the practical expression of old duties long held theoretically sacred , and now to be performed for the service of his fellow-countrymen in the spirit in which he has been urging them all his life .

		In the man of letters as executive we have the fullest confidence .

		Examples may be mul - tiplied , all the way back to Tyrtaeus .

		Fire - stricken
San Francisco	LOCATION	and the new-born Portuguese republic have alike , in our own time , entrusted the chief executive function to a poet , and had no occasion to regret their action .

		Lord
Morley	PERSON	and
Lord Haldane	PERSON	are shining present-day examples of the man of letters in high executive office .

		And not the least of the satisfactions with which we acclaim a member of the
American Academy	ORGANIZATION	as President is that of feeling assured that he will be able to give impressive literary expression to his purposes and policies , that we may expect from him for the next four years a series of state papers of whose felicitous quality the Inaugural of last week gives us a pleasant foretaste .

		That first address of the new President to the American people offers indeed a striking illustration of the sort of distinction that we have a right to expect from an executive of literary instincts and training .

		For the simple sincerity and the restrained passion with which it pleads for social justice it will be remembered and cher - ished long after its author has passed away .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 225 ALL-AMERICA VS. ALL-ENGLAND IN MODERN LITERATURE .

		Literature , in many respects , is a game of skill ; and all games have to be decided by the prowess of opposed champions .

		The rivals must be brought together ; the runners must stretch away to the goal , the cricketers play their match , the chess players bend over the board .

		It is of course difficult to make such individual or concerted tests among the champions of literature ; but a system of parallels may do something to enable us to award the wreath .

		Such parallels , in the briefest form , between the contending powers of English and American litera - ture during the middle half of the nineteenth cen - tury , is what I venture to propose .

		Precedence for the prophets !

		Due libation and invocation to
Carlyle	LOCATION	and
Emerson !	ORGANIZATION

		I suppose the final estimate of the value of these two writers must be subjective .

		It must depend on whether the reader is attuned to pessimism or optimism , whether he prefers humanity bodied forth in the awful struggle of life , or the dim-haunting presences and thin oracular voices of the gods .

		Carlyle always knew what he meant and wanted .

		His energy con - centrated in the intense , jagged lightning flash , which eats up the impurities of the air , but perhaps prostrates some giant tree or kills some master of the herd .

		Emerson is so eclectic in his likings that when you balance all his contradictions there is left a tabula rasa .

		He is like the
summer	DATE	lightning , which flares and fades and does no harm .

		Em - erson , however , has that perfection of phrase which carries so far .

		If his philosophy is uncertain , his expression is clear .

		Nietzsche , for example , may possibly have taken his idea of the Superman from
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's hero worship and adoration of brute force , but he gives no sign of the indebtedness ; whereas it is recorded that he usually had a volume of
Emerson	LOCATION	at hand .

		On the whole , I think that this first con - test for place between
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	must be accounted a draw .

		Not so the struggle between the two foremost dis - ciples of these men between
Ruskin	PERSON	and
Thoreau	LOCATION	.

		Both of these last were apostles of nature rather than of humanity .

		They perhaps knew nature equally well .

		But
Thoreau	PERSON	knew her as an Indian does , inti - mately and of necessity ;
Ruskin	PERSON	like a college pro- fessor with encyclopdias and sciences and arts at the back of his head .

		Both were ascetics , men of the hermit type ; but
Thoreau	PERSON	yielded to the cenobitic discipline , while
Ruskin	PERSON	fought against it and tried to make himself useful to his fellows .

		Their basic philosophy , contempt for the things of this world , was the same .

		But the wild tang and original flavor of
Thoreau	LOCATION	is nothing compared with the richness , the variety , the ever changing wealth of earthly wine and viands and heavenly nectar which is in
Ruskin	LOCATION	.

		England scores heavily in this comparison .

		Turn now to the two poetic puzzles of the last century
Browning	PERSON	and Whitman .

		Of
Browning	PERSON	's intellectual force there can be no question .

		He had enough wit , wisdom , subtlety , resources of knowledge , to have made him a leader in almost any field of active life .

		And
Whitman	PERSON	's emotional gift , his oratorical exuberance , above all his profound belief in himself , might have made him a great religious power , the founder of a faith .

		But both elected to write poetry , and tried by the canons of that art it seems to me that they only slenderly succeeded .

		However , they have the right of sanctuary in the hearts of their admirers , who account them the greatest poets of their age , and I leave to such admir - ers the decision as to which is the best .

		From that
Perkin Warbeck	PERSON	and this
Jack Cade	PERSON	of literature I turn to the true Princes of the Purple Line .

		First on the roll come
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Poe	PERSON	.

		They rose together , in poetry at least they wrought on similar lines , they admired each other 's art .


Poe	PERSON	said that
Tennyson	PERSON	was the most perfect poet who had ever lived ; and
Tennyson	PERSON	called
Poe	PERSON	the prince of American poets .

		In mere verse , indeed ,
Poe	PERSON	would be overwhelmed by the immense mass of his rival 's work , even though his own slender product may have a more rare and original strain .

		But
Poe	PERSON	's prose is equivalent to poetry , and it is by his prose that he has conquered the world ; whereas
Tennyson	PERSON	's verse seems to be utterly ineffective outside the limits of the English-speaking race .

		He has had no apparent influence on the Continent , has bred no imitators there .

		He is so entirely English , so peculiarly the product of his Victorian environment , that he carries no appeal to the revolutionary-minded European .

		Perhaps he may have his revenge some day when his sweetness and charm , his ideals of decency and law , his Virgilian reverence for the deities of the hearth and field , may again attract the world .

		At present , however ,
Poe	PERSON	seems the greater man .

		Arnold and
Lowell	PERSON	are like the greater and the lesser Ajax fighting behind one shield .

		Which is which , however , it would be pretty hard to say .

		Lowell is the richer and more radiant , Arnold the deeper and more poignant .

		In criticism
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	is the law-giver and
Lowell	PERSON	the appreciator .

		Coleridge and
Hazlitt	PERSON	are their analogues .

		In poetry the sing - ing god only entered into
Lowell	LOCATION	occasionally .

		This god was always with Arnold ; but was so checked , driven , beaten back by
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's circumstances and character of mind that he had scant chance to do himself justice .

		I think , on the whole , that the balance of greatness inclines towards
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's side .

		Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	and
Longfellow	PERSON	were popular poets , but they lifted popular poetry to a level of distinction if not of supremacy .

		I should , I think , cast my vote for the lady ; but in popular poetry the opinion of the people counts , and the author of '' Voices of the Night '' and '' Evangeline '' must be at the head of the poll .

		It is difficult to find a parallel for Rossetti in our literature .

		Perhaps we must hark back to
Bryant	PERSON	to find a writer with an equal conciseness of phrase and stateliness of air ; though
Bryant	PERSON	's austerity set 226 THE DIAL , -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, against
Rossetti	PERSON	's luxuriance makes the comparison a little ridiculous .

		The American poet seems to me the more permanent power of the two .


Christina Rossetti	PERSON	and
Aldrich	PERSON	are rivals and fair equals in the short lyric .

		Aldrich has more of airy grace ;
Miss Rossetti	PERSON	more of profound emotion .

		Swinburne must range unchecked across the field .

		Our technicians ,
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	and
Stedman	PERSON	and
Lanier	PERSON	, would be no match for him were they multiplied a dozen-fold .

		Turning now to the novel ,
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	lifts himself so above the age in mass and power that it is im - possible to find any American to oppose him .

		Per - haps with
Irving	PERSON	and
Bret Harte	PERSON	together an attempt might be made to do so .

		Irving is anterior , and
Bret Harte	PERSON	is in some respects a pupil of
Dickens	LOCATION	.

		The former can not compete in variety or creative force , but a few of his masterpieces have a classic per - fection which
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	hardly reached .

		And
Dickens	PERSON	learned a great many of his secrets from the older man .

		Irving revealed
England	LOCATION	to
Dickens	PERSON	before the latter revealed it to us .

		As for
Bret Harte	PERSON	,
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	thought him superior to
Dickens	PERSON	in their kind of work .

		This is hardly so ; but if the Amer - ican gained much from his master , he repaid the debt by creating a school to which a good many of the best recent English writers of fiction belong .

		If we assort
Hawthorne	PERSON	with
Thackeray	PERSON	we shall have a pair of opposites .

		On one side there is the tragedian , Puritan , man of solitude ; on the other , the comedian , churchman , and man of the clubs .

		The only thing in which they are alike is a pure and easy style , in each case impregnated with person - ality .

		To say which is the greater might be vain , but few will dispute that they are equal .

		The
Bronte	PERSON	sisters rule a realm apart in romance .

		The light in their books seems to come up from the ground , as though the hills of the fairies had opened and those uncanny creatures had come forth to make their luminous rings on the grass .

		They have no real analogues in
America	LOCATION	, where passion has been so severely let alone .

		Perhaps the world of
Herman Melville	PERSON	is as remote and enchanted in its own way .

		His credit is but slight compared with their fame , but '' Typee '' and '' Moby Dick '' will endure .

		Cooper is the largest , the most wide-ranging American novelist .

		I have reserved him to oppose to
Trollope	LOCATION	because of a certain practical and prosaic turn of mind in each .

		They both produce strong effects with apparently little artistic instinct or in - clination .

		The American is , however , immeasur - ably the greater , both as a creator of character and as the painter of scenic wonders .

		Trollope received both his art and his subject matter by inheritance from
Jane Austen	PERSON	.

		If he is sturdier than she is , he is also less fine .

		But
Cooper	PERSON	only took his methods from
Scott	LOCATION	.

		His matter is novel ; it is larger and intrinsically more fascinating than that of his master .

		So much for the imaginative writers .

		Coming to the historians , the balance is against
America	LOCATION	, mainly because of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's prepotent cleverness of phrase .

		Prescott ,
Parkman	LOCATION	, and
Motley	ORGANIZATION	could outwrite
Froude	PERSON	and
Freeman	PERSON	, but
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	is too vivid for them .

		Here again in subject matter the Americans have all the advantage .

		Macaulay 's history hardly unfolds one of the great stories of the world .

		It is conceivable that it may cease to interest , however illuminated by his festal fireworks .

		But the conquests of
Cortez	ORGANIZATION	and
Pizarro	PERSON	, the deeds of the North American explorers and adventurers , the struggle of the
Netherlands	LOCATION	with
Spain	LOCATION	, have a stamp of wonder and splendor on them which must always attract , though they are only adequately and not brilliantly set forth by our historians .

		There are many other writers who range by the side or in the rear of those I have named .

		But these are enough for a comparative judgment .

		It seems to me that the American product about equals the English .

		This is not the general view , even in our country .

		In our clear air the reverberation of English fame has been overwhelming .

		In fact , it is a fault with us that we open our ears to foreign voices and shut them to domestic accents .

		The echo of American reputations , on the contrary , has always had a difficulty in making way against the density of English fog and insular self-assertion .

		The power of a literary past is also with the modern English writers .

		Each one of them , as it were , has Shakespeare and
Milton	PERSON	,
Burns	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	, at his back .

		So it is hard to compete with them on their own ground .

		On the continent , however , at least three of our men ,
Poe	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	, and
Cooper	PERSON	, are more widely read and appreciated than any of their English rivals .

		It is certainly our business in
America	LOCATION	to stand up for our own if we can do this without gross folly or favoritism .

		There is one fact that makes American literary success stand out fiery bright and that is the scant measure of material reward it has achieved .

		For all the higher sort of abilities , whether in war , states - manship , or letters , we in
America	LOCATION	have always been bargain-hunters , we have got our great men as cheap as possible .

		The reverse has been the case in
England	LOCATION	.

		Exact figures are of course lacking , but it is probable that
Dickens	PERSON	,
Bulwer Lytton	PERSON	,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, and
Tennyson	PERSON	each received close on to a
million dollars	MONEY	for his work in life .

		With the single exception of
Mark Twain	PERSON	, it is doubtful if any American author of high rank ever made a tithe of this amonnt .

		Even the less popular English authors have been exceedingly well paid .

		Thack - eray accumulated a comfortable fortune .

		Ruskin could have got and probably did get large sums for his writings .

		Trollope and
George Eliot	PERSON	received immense material rewards .

		In this view , and con - sidering also the incredible and preposterous rewards of business men and inventors flaunted in their faces , American writers have done extremely well and have exhibited a self-devotion and self-sacrifice almost unparalleled in literature .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 227 CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE EPISTOLARY ART is now not uncommonly numbered among the lost arts .

		The reason of its decline , if there has really been such decline , may perhaps be partly found in what Mr.
Leonard Porter Ayres	PERSON	, a statistician of the
Russell Sage Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, has to say concerning the vocabulary of present-day letter-writing .

		It appears that this vocabulary is surprisingly meagre .

		Tabulations covering about twenty-four thousand words show an employment of only two thousand and one different words , of which forty-three are used so often as to constitute a full half of all the words tabulated .

		The pronoun of the first person achieves a record of nearly eleven hun - dred , and , contrary to all expectations , the word '' soap '' far outstrips the word `` love '' in frequency .

		Surely we must be a hard and prosaic generation , to judge from the statistician 's findings .

		But let us console ourselves with the belief that the batch of letters examined by him was not up to our average in richness of thought and felicity of expression .

		There is no good reason why we should not write as delightful letters as were ever penned ; in fact , it would not be difficult to find reasons why our letter - writing ought to excel that of former generations .

		Just wherein we fail has been pointed out , or the attempt has been made to point it out , often enough ; but after all is said and done , the letter-writer , like the poet , is born , not made ; and his letters can flout all the rules laid down for epistolary composition , and yet be works of art .

		Is it alleged that our pres - ent style lacks dignity , shows too much indulgence in trivialities ?

		Turn , then , to
Sydney Smith	PERSON	and see how amusingly he can handle trivialities .

		In a letter to
Lady Holland	LOCATION	he begins thus : '' I am sorry to hear
Allen	PERSON	is not well ; but the reduction of his legs is a pure and unmixed good ; they are enormous , they are clerical !

		He has the creed of a philoso - pher and the legs of a clergyman ; I never saw such legs , at least , belonging to a layman . ''

		Or is the objection raised that our epistolary style tends to formality and stiffness ?

		Consider for a moment the style of
Anna Seward	PERSON	, the `` Swan of Lichfield '' her correspondence in six volumes is easily accessible .

		Here are two sentences from a letter of hers to Dr.
Parr	PERSON	: `` Disease gloomed , and made long my wintry and vernal hours , since I had the honour and delight of conversing with you in
Warwickshire	LOCATION	... Often in the absence from our little city , do I look back with home-sickness to my umbrageous retreat beneath its spires , especially when the swart star glares . ''

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's high opinion of this gifted lady is well known .

		If , again , it be urged that letters now are too curt and businesslike and matter-of-fact , what , we ask , could be more curt and businesslike than
David	PERSON	's letter to
Joab	ORGANIZATION	concerning
Uriah	PERSON	the
Hittite	ORGANIZATION	, sent by the hand of Uriah himself ?

		This early and famous example of the epistolary art runs as follows : `` Set ye
Uriah	PERSON	in the forefront of the hottest battle , and retire ye from him , that he may be smitten , and die . ''

		The fault of the feeble or futile or otherwise wretched specimen of letter-writing lies in the letter - writer himself ; but plenty of good , incisive , humor - ous , fanciful letters are written in these days , only they very seldom get into print .

		The more pointed and personal and therefore spicy and enjoyable they are , the less adapted are they to publication .

		FREAKS OF LANGUAGE furnish matter for endless debate and comment of a more or less learned philo - logical sort , and as all are users of language the dis - cussion of these linguistic vagaries is of universal interest .

		Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's remarks on Ameri - canisms -LRB- `` What Americanisms Are Not '' -RRB- in the current ``
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine '' will please all good Americans who like to believe that they speak En - glish , and very good English , whatever our cousins across the water may say to the contrary .

		In the English mind there seems to be a tendency to brand contemptuously as an Americanism any term or phrase that for the moment strikes the ear with an unwelcome unfamiliarity , or appears otherwise objectionable ; and the makers of dictionaries of so-called Americanisms too often encourage this tendency .

		The
Yale	ORGANIZATION	professor gives some glaring instances of the way these innocent offenders `` have been shoveled into vocabularies of terms assumed to be peculiar to this country . ''

		His first example is `` female , '' which as a matter of fact many American readers must have noted as occurring with rather tiresome frequency in Victorian fiction of even the most distinguished English authorship .

		Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	might have included in his list the word `` commence , '' which Americans have been accused of using in foolish preference to `` begin . ''

		If we sin in this , we sin in good English company .

		There are other somewhat objectionable usages now pre - valent with certain English authors , which perhaps a little later , as soon as their irregularity is discov - ered , will be fathered upon us .

		For instance , in that excellent novel , '' Marriage '' -LRB- not Miss
Ferrier	PERSON	's romance -RRB- , the phrase `` are n't I ? ''

		is put into the mouth of the hero , a man of education and the holder of a professorship ; and it is to be found in other English authors of the present time .

		In the books of the popular writer who has immortalized the Five Towns in fiction , the preposition `` off '' for the more usual `` of '' or `` from '' is to be found more than once , as in the expression , to buy something `` off '' a person .

		Some morning we shall wake up to find ourselves accused of distorting `` am not '' into `` are n't '' and of invariably substituting `` off '' for `` of . ''

		WHAT THEY READ IN
OREGON	LOCATION	ought not to be very different from what they read in
Maine	LOCATION	.

		The two Portlands are good representative American cities , and the three thousand miles separating them do not mean a like sundering of interests .

		Never - theless , eastern readers and others may like to hear from the officials of the
Library Association of Port	ORGANIZATION	- land ,
Oregon	LOCATION	, something about the reading habits 228 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, of the people of
Multnomah County	LOCATION	, over which that growing institution now extends its activities .

		In light reading , the most popular author appears to be
Dickens	LOCATION	, with
Victor Hugo	PERSON	,
Dumas	PERSON	,
Mark Twain	PERSON	, and
Bulwer Lytton	ORGANIZATION	following on his heels .

		Of almost equal popularity , reports the librarian , are
Jane Austen	PERSON	-LRB- who would have thought it ? -RRB-

		, Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	, Dr.
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	, and
Charles Reade	PERSON	.

		Also it is to be noted that the vaca - tion privilege of drawing an extra number of books for a prolonged period is extended to travelling men throughout the year , but '' no fiction is included , as trains and hotels supply novels generously '' which can not be said of eastern trains and hotels , as a rule .

		In selecting books for purchase , the library pursues no narrow policy . ''

		Nothing human is foreign to us , '' declares the president of its board of directors ; and '' whatever has taken literary form , with sin - cerity of purpose , may be needed on the shelves of a public library .

		... A great deal of criticism arises , however , when purchases are made of books of fact and fiction which can be described as containing insurgent thought or audacious inquiry and criticism of things as they are .

		It should be needless to say that the library staff has instructions as to the class of readers from whose hands certain books should be withheld , especially in the case of young or im - mature minds , and a careful supervision is kept at all times in order to minimize possible harmful results . ''

		The practical difficulties and inevitable embarrassments of such a supervision in a public library are at once apparent .

		The
Portland	LOCATION	library attendants must have unusual tact and wisdom to meet these perplexities with credit to themselves and to the satisfaction of all concerned .

		THE UNTRANSLATABILITY OF THE BEST LITER - ATURE has long been admitted ; but the fact that much of the study of foreign masterpieces , with dictionary and grammar and commentary in hand , results in little more real appreciation of their peculiar excellences than could be got from transla - tions , is less often recognized .

		While such study is necessary and helpful in acquiring full mastery of an alien tongue , the learner at first does little more than painfully and imperfectly translate the strange words into terms , sometimes far from synonymous , that he can understand .

		Of course the real under - standing of the text comes only when one is so far advanced as unconsciously to think , and perhaps even to dream , in the foreign language .

		Mr.
Price Collier	PERSON	, in his work on ''
Germany	LOCATION	and the Germans '' now appearing in '' Scribner 's , '' well says of the dif - ferent nations of the earth : '' Each builds its life in words , and the words are as little alike as in the days of
Babel	LOCATION	; and thus it comes about that we misunderstand one another .

		We translate one another only into our own language and understand one another as little as before , because we only know one another in translations , and the best of the life of each nation remains and always will remain un - translatable .

		No one has ever really translated the Greek lyrics of the choruses of JEschylus , or the incomparable songs of
Heine	LOCATION	.

		Who could dream of putting the best of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	into Ger - man , or
Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's rollicking ballads of soldier life into Spanish , or
Walter Pater	PERSON	into Dutch , or
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	into Russian ! ''

		Pater , by the way , came of Dutch stock on his father 's side , and his books would more easily admit of translation into the lan - guage of
Holland	LOCATION	than into some other tongues that might be named ; but that does not invalidate the argument , which might have been turned to account in explaining why - so many of the masterpieces of so-called translation such as
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's '' Ru - bdiy ^ t '' and Pope 's Homer are far from being translations at all ... A LIBRARY `` WAITING LIST '' may not have one established meaning throughout the library world , but its meaning at the
Grand Rapids Public Library	ORGANIZATION	is interestingly explained by Mr.
Ranck	PERSON	, the libra - rian , in his current Report .

		When requests for books not in the library are received , he tells us , the books are first of all looked up in the `` waiting list , '' which is a card-catalogue of works desirable , but not immediately purchasable for lack of funds .

		`` There are now , '' we read , `` more than 10,000 volumes on this ` waiting list , ' nearly all of them desirable for our shelves according to our best infor - mation , provided we had the money to pay for them .

		This list is referred to and used constantly in order - ing books from publishers ' remainder catalogues , books for which there is a sudden special demand , etc. .

		Those purchased in this way from remainder catalogues we usually get at half or less than half the original price .

		The money thus saved more than pays for the work of maintaining this list , which at the same time is used in so many other ways .

		For many of the requests , no information regarding the publisher or price can be found , and on calling up the requester it is frequently learned that there is no certainty as to the author and title , and therefore the
Department	ORGANIZATION	is wholly in the dark .

		For all books requested , the Library endeav - ors to find reviews in standard periodicals or get information from other reliable sources , where it is learned that many of these books are trivial , inac - curate as to facts , or vicious .

		Cards noting these facts are held at the library for our information and the information of those making the inquiry . ''

		This waiting-list system of book-purchase might be commended not only to all libraries , but also to all individual buyers ; for book-buying , like marriage , is often effected in haste , to be repented at leisure .

		PRESIDENT
WILSON	PERSON	'S LITERARY STYLE is made the subject of interesting comment from the pen of Professor Bliss
Perry	PERSON	in the
March	DATE	`` Century . ''

		That one who expresses himself in language abound - ing in delicate bookish overtones should be quick to detect the same subtle harmonies in another , is not at all surprising ; and Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	, as a man of
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 229 letters , could hardly have found a more sympathetic and appreciative critic than in the present instance .

		Mr.
Perry	PERSON	recognizes the coarsening influences to which a public man is subjected , and the effect they may have even on our new President 's graceful and felicitous and refined manner of spoken and written utterance .

		Nevertheless he believes that Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's best writing is yet to come , while as ad - mirable examples of his next best he points to such earlier and later essays as '' The Truth of the Matter , '' `` On Being Human , '' `` Mere Literature , '' '' The Author Himself , '' the papers on
Burke	PERSON	,
Bagehot	PERSON	, and
Cleveland	LOCATION	, and other scholarly articles .

		As a marked example of one whom the wear and tear of high public office refined rather than coars - ened , Lincoln is instanced , and the writer continues : ``
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	is the first professional man of letters to become President of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		No man who has entered the
White House	ORGANIZATION	since Lincoln has been better equipped by character and training to ennoble and refine the tone of public utterance '' which without a doubt now stands in crying need of being refined and ennobled .

		Signi - ficant at this time become the words long ago writ - ten by Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	and now recalled by Mr.
Perry	PERSON	: '' It behooves all minor authors to realize the possi - bility of their being discovered some day and exposed to the general scrutiny . ''

		A BUREAU OF GENERAL INFORMATION is what the modern public library strives to be , as well as a storehouse and distributer of good literature .

		In this attempt the library at
Newark	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, appears to have succeeded more than passably well .

		Its busi - ness branch , already noticed in these columns , has within the few years of its existence achieved a fame that has gone abroad in the land .

		After hearing of the many and varied demands to which it promptly responds in the ordinary course of its day 's work , one is almost ready to believe that here at last can be found , in the person of the alert and resourceful attendant in charge , somebody who really knows your own business better than you do yourself .

		Stories are told of the most curious and perplexing questions asked and answered at this dispensary of general and particular information .

		For example , a street in
Ohio	LOCATION	, city or village unknown , was inquired about ; a man in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, residence and occu - pation lost in nebulosity , so far as the inquirer was concerned , was earnestly sought ; particulars con - cerning trolley routes to
Boston	LOCATION	were desired ; and all these , with nobody knows how many other conun - drums , were answered with accuracy and despatch .

		Necessarily the store of reference material maps , directories , railway time-tables , hotel guides , and so on maintained at a library business branch like that at
Newark	LOCATION	is rather different from that to be found in the ordinary reference room , and it is per - haps a debatable question whether the services ren - dered are such as properly may be expected of a public library .

		At all events , the business branch , as conducted at
Newark	LOCATION	, is an extremely useful public institution ; and until some other provision is made for its maintenance , those who resort to it will doubtless be glad to have it continued as an offshoot of '' the people 's university . ''

		REMEMBERING WHAT ONE READS is rapidly be - coming an obsolete accomplishment , so multitudinous and heterogeneous are the books that we rush through in these latter days .

		Not to remember the matter itself , but to remember where it may be found in case of need , is getting to be the limit of the burden imposed on the memory ; and it is this ability to direct others to the desired source of information that the librarian and the reference-room attendant more and more diligently cultivate .

		The schoolboy who , on being asked how many ribs there are in the human skeleton , stumbled at the exact number , but referred his teacher to the second page in the third chapter of the textbook , had already begun to develop this useful but not altogether most desirable form of memory .

		At
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	it has recently been urged that the English system of examination at the hands of a board of examiners ought to be adopted .

		At
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	the professor giving the course neither sets the examination questions nor corrects the papers , so that a larger and more inde - pendent command of the subject is encouraged in the student than in our own colleges , where not the subject itself so much as the instructor 's presentation of it is regarded as the all-important thing by the crammer for examination .

		But , after all , the slight - ness of the connection between mere memory of facts , of whatever sort , and real culture , becomes apparent to anyone in reviewing his own educational experience ... SERIOUS STUDENTS AND THEIR `` SOURCES , '' that is , the printed and manuscript material needed by them in their researches , are in this country of magnificent distances often widely sundered ; and any system of inter-library loans that shall practically diminish these distances is to be welcomed .

		The Librarian of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	contributes some words of weight on the subject of `` Libraries and the Investigator '' to the
March	DATE	`` North American Review , '' calling attention to the comparative fewness of valuable special col - lections accessible to the public in the
United States	LOCATION	, their unsystematic development , and their very irreg - ular geographic distribution .

		While more than two - thirds of the population lie west of the Alleghenies , only about one-eighth of the important working libra - ries are situated within this vast region .

		There is , naturally enough , a huddling of these institutions on the
Atlantic	LOCATION	seaboard .

		But a perfect inter-library loan system would do much to equalize disparities ; and the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, since its removal into its present quarters , and especially since its present librarian 's assumption of its superintendence , has led the way in the practice of a liberal and widely beneficent policy in this respect .

		It now hopefully awaits a more general following of its example , and the inauguration of a more thorough-going parcel - post system to diminish the expense of a nation-wide 230 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, exchange of library books in the interest of serious students and specialists .

		Significant and reassuring is the fact , noted by Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	, that not one book has been lost of the many that have been sent out from the library under his charge to distant appli - cants .

		The risk , then , and even the present expense involved in the inter-library loan system are negli - gible as compared with the accruing benefits .

		A GIGANTIC LEXICOGRAPHICAL UNDERTAKING 1 * 8 proposed by a number of English scholars of emi - nence .

		At the great congress of historians to be held next month in
London	LOCATION	, it is expected that co - operation will be solicited for the preparation of a dictionary of mediaeval Latin .

		Dr.
Murray	PERSON	, of the great
Oxford Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, and his colleagues and others are bestirring themselves in the matter , and an invitation will probably be extended to history workers in all countries to lend their aid in the great enterprise , whose magnitude becomes apparent when one considers the mass of mediaeval literature written in a decidedly corrupt Latin between the fall of
Rome	LOCATION	and the Renaissance .

		A lifetime devoted to the reading of this mountain of books on theology , law , medicine , philosophy , science , history , and other subjects , would make but slight impression on it .

		Hence the need of extensive collaboration and of rather minute subdivision of the labor .

		The standard work in this field of lexicography has hitherto been that of DuCange -LRB- 1678 -RRB- , of which the latest edition appeared in
1883-7	DATE	, a monumental work and a credit to its compiler 's industry and scholarship .

		But modern standards call for a more rigorous and thorough treatment of the whole sub - ject .

		If the project is carried through , there will be added one more to the already considerable list of scholarly and useful reference works undertaken from the pure love of the task itself and in the sustaining hope of producing something that shall be of benefit to others , in soscula sceculorum .

		THE INDISPENSABILITY OF THE PRINTED WORD , and of that store-house and disseminator of the printed word , the public library , is emphasized by Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	in his ever fresh and stim - ulating monthly publication , `` The Newarker . ''

		Forecasting the `` Educational System of
Newark	LOCATION	in
1924	DATE	, '' he predicts for the library `` a very large influence as a universal , ever-present educational in - centive and aid , '' and continues : `` Teaching always falls back at last upon the page of print .

		Most people to-day say they care little for books and ask to be shown , and at the same time to be told .

		So soldiers are taught ; so were taught the slaves who toiled by thousands at the building of the pyramids .

		So to-day are taught the men with the shovel and the hoe .

		The green hand in the factory must see and touch his lathe and chuck and pulley , and be told by spoken words their uses before he can be trusted to mind the machine before him .

		But this is a busy world ; most men must be always doing , and few can be spared in office or store or shop or factory to point out the obvious and to repeat the ancient rules in the ears of listening dullards .

		And so he who in the pernicious pride of his own dullness is waiting to be shown , is outstripped by him who not only looks and listens , but also reads . ''

		Ampli - fying the familiar railway-crossing inscription , the above writer 's wholesome advice to the present gen - eration might be thus worded : Stop , Look , Listen , but , above all else , Read !

		THE REFERENCE LIBRARY 'S DEBT TO
BENJAMIN ELI SMITH	PERSON	, who died on the
24th of February	DATE	after a long illness , is so great as almost to eclipse the other services he rendered to literature .

		As a young man of twenty-six he undertook the managing editorship of `` The Century Dictionary , '' and was afterward editor-in-chief of `` The Century Atlas , '' `` The Cen - tury Cyclopedia of Names , '' and the revision of the `` Dictionary . ''

		In other fields of literary activity , he translated , with the encouragement and aid of the late President Seelye of
Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	,
Schwegler	PERSON	's `` History of Philosophy , '' and later pro- duced English versions of
Cicero	PERSON	's `` De Amicitia , '' and edited selections from
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	, Epic - tetus , and
Pascal	PERSON	.

		In poetry also he early displayed talent , and he painted with skill , besides being some - thing of an athlete , as his college mates can testify .

		Born in
1857	DATE	, of
New England	LOCATION	parentage , at
Beirut	LOCATION	his father was for twenty-five years connected with the American mission in
Syria	LOCATION	,
Benjamin	PERSON	was sent to this country to be educated , and was graduated from
Amherst	LOCATION	in
1877	DATE	.

		Further study in
Germany	LOCATION	followed , after which he taught philosophy at
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	; but what was to be his chief work began in
1883	DATE	with his connection with
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		He died at his home at
Rochelle Park	LOCATION	,
N.Y.	LOCATION	... THE STEALING OF LITERARY THUNDER without due , acknowledgment of the source of the theft is not exactly a praiseworthy practice .

		That sprightly and oft-quoted writer on the less serious aspects of library life , Mr.
Edmund Lester Pearson	PERSON	, in his department known as `` The Librarian '' of the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript , '' relates amusingly his not altogether amusing experiences in encountering the frisky offspring of his own fecund fancy in publica - tions to which they have strayed by a more or less roundabout route , losing in their wanderings the tag designating the place of their nativity .

		Incidentally he pays graceful acknowledgment to THE DIAL for `` occasional inspiration '' in his own writing , and adds , truly enough , that he believes the benefit has not been wholly one-sided .

		To `` The Librarian '' these columns are in truth rather deeply indebted ; and it is an indebtedness shared , as we have recently noted , by our antipodes .

		The `` Library Miscellany , '' published at
Baroda	LOCATION	in three languages , reprints in a late number Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	's clever bit of verse entitled `` The Reference Librarian '' which , how - ever , the editor has not attempted to translate for the Gujarati and Marathi sections of his journal , much as one would have liked to see him try it .

		1913 -RSB- THE D1A1 , 231 THE FIRST ILLUSTRATED ENGLISH BOOK Came under the auctioneer 's hammer the other day , when '' The Mirrour of the World , '' printed by
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	in
1490	DATE	, with the crudest of woodcuts , copied from those in the manuscript of Vincent of
Beauvais	PERSON	, was sold at
Sotheby 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first and unillustrated edition of this work made its appearance from
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	's press in
1481	DATE	; the illustrated issue is a greater curiosity in the book world , and the present copy has added value from having belonged successively to two cele - brated English artists ,
Millais	PERSON	and
Birket Foster	PERSON	, themselves illustrators as well as painters .

		From the rude designs in this
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	production , designs chiefly representing teachers instructing their pupils , and betraying an almost incredible clumsiness in the draughtsman , to the modern photogravure and other mechanical or semi-mechanical processes of book-illustration , both in black-and-white and in colors , it is a long leap , though it was far from being a leap in the actual evolution of the illus - trator 's art .

		Not per saltum , but per gradus , was the long distance covered .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		RADIOGRAPH OR SKIAGRAM ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Exactness in the choice and use of words is an indi - cation of culture and of refinement in ideas .

		The uncultivated person may describe the color of each of several objects as '' red , '' while one with a clearer perception easily recognizes that there are many hues represented , such as vermilion , scarlet , crimson , pink , rose , damask , ruby , and even maroon .

		We frequently find '' infer '' used in the place of '' imply , '' and vice versa .

		Exactness demands that so far as possible each word should have one definite meaning , and no other .

		Un - fortunately full compliance with this proposition would increase our vocabulary to a cumbersome extent .

		When , however , we have two words and two significations they should not be used indiscriminatingly , and the unneces - sary forms should be dropped .

		Dictionaries , are governed chiefly by usage , rather than by inherent right .

		Not seldom words receive their initial impulse from those who may be better versed in some other branch of science than they are in orthography , and the carelessness of others per - mits an error to be perpetuated .

		Thus we find a strong tendency among prominent surgeons to use the word '' radiograph '' to designate the shadow picture taken by means of the X-ray .

		Exactness is favored by reserv - ing certain forms for given ideas , and in our choice of words and forms we must be largely guided by their derivation .

		We have many words in the English language ending in '' - graph , '' '' - gram , '' and '' - graphy '' ; and approved usage , perhaps only through carelessness , has permitted some confusion as to the definite signification of these suffixes .

		The Greek word `` grapheiu , '' from which we derive the suffix '' - graph , '' is a verb , and designates the action of writing or making a picture .

		The result of the completed action was designated by the Greek '' gramma , '' and from the stem of this noun we have the suffix '' - gram . ''

		If , however , those ancients desired to indicate the result of continued or repeated action they used the noun '' graphia , '' from which we have the suffix '' - graphy . ''

		The ending '' - graphy '' therefore indicates an art , descriptive science , or treatise , as in '' telegraphy , '' '' geography , '' or '' archseography , '' and '' biography . ''

		We very properly use the suffix '' - graph '' in verbal forms , such as '' telegraph , '' and '' photo - graph . ''

		We also use this form to describe instruments by means of which the action may occur , such as '' phonograph , '' '' cardiograph , '' and '' actinograph . ''

		Etymologically considered , the result of the action should be described by the suffix '' - gram , '' as in '' tele - gram '' and `` skiagram . ''

		The uses of the ending '' - graph '' to denote the result of the finished action is secondary and unnecessary , and is therefore confusing .

		It is unnecessary because we already have the form '' - gram '' with that individual signification .

		Why then should the form '' photogram '' have been permitted to drop into oblivion ?

		Why not say '' phonogram '' and '' dictogram , '' rather than the more cumbersome expres - sions '' phonographic record '' and '' dictographic re - cord '' ?

		In spite of the authority of many dictionaries , therefore , it seems that the form '' skiagram '' is pre - ferable to '' skiagraph '' to indicate the picture taken by the
Rontgen	PERSON	ray ; and '' radiogram '' is better than '' radiograph . ''

		There are three objections to the use of '' radio - graph , '' '' radiogram , '' and '' radiography '' with refer - ence to the taking of shadow-pictures by the aid of the X-ray .

		In the first place they represent a compound of Latin and Greek stems .

		This is an etymological offense which , because it is without any excuse , betrays ignorance on the part of the user .

		It is without excuse because we already have the purely Greek compounds '' skiagraph , '' etc. , with the same applied reference , and at present without any further signification .

		Secondly , it is objectionable because it causes the use of two sets of words without change of meaning .

		Thirdly , it has been found that a chemical -LRB- radium -RRB- has a similar power of making shadow-pictures upon the photographic plate through ordinarily opaque objects .

		The use of the word `` radiograph '' and its companion forms should therefore be strictly limited to such photography by means of emanations from the chemical radium .

		It must be remembered that '' skiagraph '' is not a new word , as it was used long before we knew anything of the peculiar properties of the Rontgen ray .

		Though old methods have now fallen into disuse , and though strictly the term might cover all shadow pictures , practically it would be well to limit the use of the term `` skiagram '' to the photograph taken by the electric ray , and leave the form '' radiogram '' to describe such a product of emanations from radium .

		There is another use of the verbal suffix '' - graph , '' as found in a noun , which both usage and reason seem to approve .

		We have said that the suffix '' - graphy '' indicates the result of repeated , or continued , action , as found in an art or descriptive science ; and thus is dis - tinguished from a '' - gram , '' which is the result of one action .

		There is an intermediate form which is some - times needed , a sort of diminutive '' - graphy . ''

		Several characters are combined into one '' monogram . ''

		A '' monograph '' is more extended in signification , and the term is used to designate a short treatise upon a single topic or portion of a topic , generally in some science or

Evanston	LOCATION	, III. ,

		232 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, WAGNER
BAYREUTH	LOCATION	.

		* The story of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	's achieve - ment at
Bayreuth	LOCATION	is of absorbing interest .

		A genuine reformer in his art , he had all the reformer 's troubles and discouragements to meet ; but he had also the indomitable faith and determination which lead to success .

		The thought of a
National Play House	ORGANIZATION	, where the new operas which he had in contemplation might come to adequate representation , had risen upon his consciousness , and he never abandoned the prosecution of his plan for its realization .

		Time and time again affairs were so critical that everyone connected with the enterprise was ready to give it up .

		The Master himself once or twice appeared to have lost heart ; but he made a rapid recovery , was ready for additional sacrifices , devised fresh expedi - ents , and went to his task once more .

		Miss
Caroline V. Kerr	PERSON	has done an excellent work in translating and editing the letters of
Wagner	PERSON	which have to do with the inception and completion of the
Bayreuth	LOCATION	Theatre .

		Her introductory account is admirably adapted to give the needed unity to the collection .

		As early as
1848	DATE	Wagner published a paper on '' A Project for the Organization of a National Theatre . ''

		In
1863	DATE	,
Miss Kerr	ORGANIZATION	tells us , he produced an essay on `` A German National School of Music '' ; this he hoped to establish in
Munich	LOCATION	.

		He had not reached his thirty-fifth year before his mind was filled with the master - pieces to which he subsequently gave form .

		He had conceived the large tetralogy ; and a sacred opera was hovering before him which finally assumed the form of `` Parsifal . ''

		He recog - nized that as a dramatic poet he was to make use of the material furnished by German mythology , filling it , however , with a significance that was human and universal .

		His study of
Schopen	PERSON	- hauer and of Oriental literature gave him the idea of a religious experience which lay at the foundation of all religions , and out of this came `` Parsifal , '' and another opera of which we hear under the title of '' The Penitents , '' and of which a fragment was left at his death .

		In
1850	DATE	he tells his friend ,
Friedrich Heine	PERSON	: `` I am now thinking of writing the music to Siegfried .

		In order to be able to produce it properly some day , I am cherishing all sorts of * THE

		bold and unusual plans , for the realization of which nothing further is necessary than that some rich old uncle or other should take it into his head to die . ''

		In the preface to the first edi - tion of the drama of '' The Ring of theNibelung , '' which appeared in
1862	DATE	, he distinctly announces his plans .

		He prefers a small town free from the influences surrounding the metropolitan opera houses .

		He proposes a theatre designed strictly for artistic purposes , as he understood them ; the coming together of singers imbued with the seriousness and nobility of their calling ; the cooperation of instrumentalists who under - stood what the intentions of the Master really were ; and the presence of an audience of music - lovers from far and near , who would make of the occasion a new festival of the combined arts in their highest estate .

		No doubt in all this he had in mind the great festivals of ancient times .

		As Miss
Kerr	PERSON	very well remarks : ''
Wagner	PERSON	projected these ideas with that fine free breadth which characterizes the mind of genius , but the ' three full years ' which he allowed himself for the completion of his heroic musical task ' Ring of the Nibelung ' became , in reality , a quarter of a century filled with struggles and disappointments , baffling to anyone but a reformer fighting for an idea which em - bodied his ' conscious mission in life . ' ''

		The work thus remained a matter of earnest endeavor , persistent propaganda , and anxious anticipation until
1871	DATE	, when it assumed the proportions of a great effort on the eve of realization .

		Miss
Kerr	PERSON	, following Glasenapp , gives a fine characterization of the men on whom
Wagner	PERSON	chiefly relied for practical assistance .

		There were four
Friedrich Feustel	PERSON	,
Theodor Muncker	PERSON	,
Emil Heckel	PERSON	, and
Carl Brandt	PERSON	.

		It would be difficult to find anywhere exemplars of greater devotion , clearer understanding , or * higher secu - lar wisdom .

		The man with whom they had to deal was not one to engage readily in com - promises ; he had an unalterable conception of the dignity and significance of his labors had anyone ever more right to such self-confidence ?

		and the diplomacies of the manipulator of inevitable expedients met with characteristic treatment at his hands .

		The demands made upon him were excessive , but he met them at whatever cost or sacrifice .

		Of the four advisers ,
Feustel	PERSON	was engaged in political matters relating both to the German Empire and to his residence city ,
Bayreuth	LOCATION	.

		He was a man of affairs , an excellent manager of practical business , a competent financier , and so indefatigable a laborer in the cause that he received the appellation of '' the Flying Dutch -

Bayreuth	LOCATION	. ''

		Muncker was the
Burgo	PERSON	- master of
Beyreuth	LOCATION	, and he gave the new musical evangel his unfaltering attachment ; he took a personal share in the task of the Master , and was a bulwark of defense in time of trouble .


Heckel of Mannheim	ORGANIZATION	was an organizer of exterior enterprises everywhere ; he dissem - inated intelligence widely , and served the pur - poses of obtaining the necessary financial help and propagating the crusade in divers places .

		Last but not least we have
Brandt	PERSON	, the famous stage machinist of
Darmstadt	LOCATION	, for whom Wag - ner had the deepest regard , and whose advice and suggestion were invaluable .

		He was far more than a maker of stage machinery , he had to do largely and fully with the positive crea - tion of a suitable home for a new synthetic art that was far more than a mere extension of the limits within which music , operatic and other , had prospered up to the date of that art 's appear - ance .

		Music was to undergo a transfiguration of all its material , was to rise to a wholly new and higher plane .

		Why
Bayreuth	LOCATION	was chosen for the Music -
Drama Festival	ORGANIZATION	finds explanation in this extract from a letter to Feustel : '' The place must not be a large city with a permanent theatre , nor one of the large
summer	DATE	resorts where during the season an absolutely undesirable public would offer itself ; it must be centrally located in Ger - many , and moreover be a Bavarian city , as I also intend to take up my permanent residence in the place , and consider that I could only do this in
Bavaria	LOCATION	if I hope to enjoy the continued patronage of the King of
Bavaria	LOCATION	.

		Apart from these considerations , this pleasant old city , with its surroundings , made an indelible impression on me years ago , and the fact that I am an utter stranger to the citizens of
Bayreuth	LOCATION	gives me no cause for alarm . ''

		Miss
Kerr	PERSON	tells us that in the
spring of 1871	DATE	Wagner went again to the old hill town , and the '' indelible impression '' was deepened and the final decision made .

		It was during this visit that
Wagner	PERSON	, who was travelling incognito , fell ill , and Dr.
Carl Landgraf	PERSON	was called in to see him .

		The doctor became the uncompensated physician to the artist assemblage at
Bayreuth	LOCATION	, and he is assuredly to be named in any account of the enterprise .

		In
April of 1871	DATE	,
Wagner	PERSON	issued a communication to the public , now well disposed to his efforts , '' About the Perform - ances of a Stage Festival Play , ' Ring of the Nibelung . ' '' '

		In this he reiterated the explana - tions of his project formerly made .

		The esti - mated cost of the Festival was over two hundred thousand dollars , and the means for raising this sum were to be found through the Wagner So - cieties .

		The Societies were to issue membership certificates ; the holder of the certificate was to have a place at all of the performances , and three persons might share in one certificate .

		By the early death of
Karl Tausig	PERSON	his knowledge and enthusiasm were lost to
Wagner	PERSON	, and the main labor of establishing the Societies fell upon the broad and willing shoulders of
Heckel	ORGANIZATION	, whose wisdom and devotion had no superiors .

		He organized the first
Wagner Society	ORGANIZATION	in
Mann	PERSON	- heim in
1871	DATE	, and the ball was set in motion .

		The rest of the story , with its ups and downs , its manifold fluctuations , its hopes and tem - porary despairs , may be read in these letters .

		Here are the origirial sources , and they are per - vaded by the fervor of emotion which belongs to the success of enterprises of great pith and moment .

		At times it seemed as though im - passable barriers obstructed further progress .

		The Emperor of
Germany	LOCATION	was appealed to without result , and more than once
Louis	PERSON	of
Bavaria	LOCATION	was obliged to come to the rescue .

		At last the
Festival	ORGANIZATION	came into being , one of the capital achievements of mankind , only to sink into a subsequent silence of five years .

		Then , in
1876	DATE	, `` Parsifal '' resounded in the ears of men , and the
Bayreuth Theatre	LOCATION	was established .

		Miss
Kerr	PERSON	's translation is a good one ; although there seems an occasional misunder - standing of a German idiom .

		The connecting passages are excellent , and the series of letters becomes a consistent history .

		It is here that
Miss Kerr	PERSON	has done some of her best work , and she converts epistles written to various persons into a genuine chapter of autobiography .

		It was a fine thing to bring together these intimate communications relating to an important episode in
Wagner	PERSON	's life ; it was a still finer thing so to arrange and relate them as to give continuity of interest and narrative .

		The letters are charac - teristic of the author , who was always a won - derful letter-writer .

		A Critical Study .

		By
P. P. Howe	PERSON	.

		With portrait .


New York	LOCATION	:
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	.

		234 -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, sive information than we now possess .

		The biography in Mr.
Francis Bickley	PERSON	's little vol - ume consists of one chapter of nine pages ; and that , as far as actual biography is concerned , is mostly padding .

		Synge was born in
Dublin	LOCATION	, spent his wander-years 011 the continent as obscurely as
Goldsmith	PERSON	did , was discovered by Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	in a
Paris	LOCATION	garret in
1897	DATE	, and on the latter 's advice devoted himself to creative work in
Ireland	LOCATION	until his death in
1909	DATE	.

		Such are the outstanding facts of his life .

		What effect the years of study in French and German had upon
Synge	PERSON	's literary work has not as yet been fully developed , nor is it even satis - factorily indicated by Mr.
Howe	PERSON	in his '' critical study . ''

		It would form a very pretty subject for research , not even unworthy of a doctor 's dissertation , though , of course , repulsively mod - ern .

		It stands to reason that the formative years up to
1897	DATE	were probably formative in the real sense of the word .

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's very words that
Synge	PERSON	had `` nothing to show but one or two poems and impressionistic essays , full of that kind of morbidity that has its root in too much brooding over methods of expression , and ways of looking upon life , which come , not out of life , but out of literature , images reflected from mirror to mirror , '' these words explain , to some extent at least , the wonderful diction of the plays , and enable one to comprehend how this genius when brought into the open air of the
Aran Islands	ORGANIZATION	could turn to healthy use this morbid care for the word and phrase .

		Still more might one expect to find far-reaching influences in form and thought , as indeed has been pointed out by Professor
Sherman	PERSON	in the matter of
Synge	ORGANIZATION	's relation to
Anatole France	LOCATION	and others .

		Whatever results might be obtained from such a study of foreign influence , they would not lessen our appreciation of Synge 's genius any more than our knowledge of the pre-Shakespearean influ - ence decreases our admiration for the `` Comedy of Errors '' or `` Hamlet . ''

		The voice is a new one , as distinctively national as individual .

		`` The Well of the Saints , '' the chief of
Synge	PERSON	's plays , according to Mr.
Howe	PERSON	, has elements in common with
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's `` Les Aveugles '' and
Clemenceau	PERSON	's '' Voile du Bonheur , '' but it is as wholly characteristic of the Irish national genius as it is expressive of
Synge	PERSON	's sense of the greyness of life untouched by the poetic imagination .

		The play is no less a product of
Ireland	LOCATION	than the `` Playboy , '' which is based on a story told Synge by '' the oldest man on Inis - maan . ''

		Its local color is perfect in detail ; the characters have the complete flavor of the soil , so much so that the bit of supernaturalism upon which the action hinges is accepted by the audience as readily as are the superstitions of the locality by the inhabitants .

		The very con - trast , too , between the world of reality and that of imagination is characteristic both of the Celt and of Synge .

		Thus in this play of `` The Well of the Saints , '' two blind beggars , man and wife , weather-beaten and old , recover their sight by the miracle of an itinerant saint and discover that their beauty , which the villagers had made them believe as actual , was the grossest delusion .

		With their sight they get only misery , and not until their eyes become dimmed again and grad - ually become sightless , do they return to their former joy in the natural world about them .

		When the holy man returns and is about to repeat the cure by means of the sacred water , the man strikes the can containing it out of the saint 's hand and thus spares himself and his wife the misfortune of another miracle .

		Their world of imagination is better than that of things as they saw them with their eyes .

		The same note is struck in other plays .

		The Playboy discovers himself , by breaking away first from the dull tyranny of a brutal father and later from the fleeting joys of a false state of worship as a hero into the realization of his own spirit , till he be - comes `` a likely gaffer in the end of all , '' a poet ranging through the Western World of his vaunting imagination .

		So the Tramp in '' The Shadow of the Glen '' holds out to
Nora	PERSON	, who somewhat doubtfully accepts the prophecy ac - cording to which `` you 'll be hearing the herons crying out over the black lakes , and you '11 be hearing the grouse and the owls with them , and the larks and the big thrushes when the days are warm ; and it 's not from the like of them you '11 be hearing a tale of getting old like
Peggy Cavanagh	PERSON	, and losing the hair off you , and the light of your eyes , but it 's fine songs you '11 be hearing when the sun goes up , and there 'll be no old fellow wheezing , the like of a sick sheep , close to your ear . ''

		All this the Tramp holds out to her imaginative spirit , so that she goes out with him to face `` the cold , and the frost , and the great rain , rather than live with her husband in a lonesome place the like of this place . ''

		And in `` Deirdre of the Sorrows '' the contrast is carried to the extreme , so that when the world of facts becomes overpowering , the only refuge is death , but death lighted up by faith and love .

		Just before
Deirdre	PERSON	presses the knife into her heart and sinks into the grav ^ e , she thus addresses Conchubor , who has killed
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 235 her lover and husband ,
Naisi	PERSON	: `` I have a little key to unlock the prison of Naisi you 'd shut upon his youth forever .

		Keep back , Conchubor ; for the High King who is your master has put his hands between us .

		It was sorrows was fore - told , but great joys were my share always ; yet it is a cold place I must go to be with you ,
Naisi	PERSON	; and it 's cold your arms will be
this night	TIME	that were warm about my neck so often ... It 's a pitiful thing to be talking out when your ears are shut to me .

		It 's a pitiful thing , Conchubor , you have done this night in
Emain	LOCATION	; yet a thing will be a joy and triumph to the ends of life and time . ''

		Love is as great a transformer of the actual as is the imagination , and in
Deirdre	LOCATION	's case it has made the world so beautiful that death with her lover is better than life without him .

		Synge 's genius was much more tragic than comic .

		His comedy , `` The Tinker 's Wedding , ' ' is probably the least effective of his works .

		In - teresting types of character the tinkers and the priest are , but the dialogue is not particularly amusing nor is the plot very interesting .

		His comedy is at its best when it serves to heighten by contrast the grim or the pathetic .

		Thus how admirably in `` The Playboy '' is the character of
Shawn	PERSON	revealed when he disconsolately remarks to the Widow Quin a propos of his rival 's success : `` Oh , Widow Quin , what '11 I be doing now ?

		I 'd inform agen him , but he 'd be sure and certain to destroy me .

		If I was n't so God-fearing , I 'd near have courage to come behind him and run a pike into his side .

		Oh , it 's a hard case to be an orphan and not to have your father that you 're used to , and you 'd easy kill and make yourself a hero in the sight of all . ''

		The comic spirit in this play which is more marked than in any other , brings out more completely the tragic fate of
Pegeen	LOCATION	, who sees all her happiness suddenly vanish in her disillusionment .

		She has lost her playboy of the western world and nothing will ` fill the blank .

		`` Eiders to the Sea '' is a tragedy of a whole people who earn their bread on the waters , and it is filled with the brooding and fatalistic melancholy of the Celt .

		Maurya speaks with the solemn intensity of her kind .

		It is not the '' excitement of the will in the presence of at - tainable advantages '' we have in this tragedy ; it is rather the submission of the will crushed by the inexorable power of the sea .

		When her last son is brought in drowned , she cries : `` They 're all gone now , and there is n't anything more the sea can do to me .

		... I '11 have no call now to be up crying and praying when the wind breaks from the south , and you can hear the surf is , in the east , and the surf is in the west , making a great stir with the two noises , and they hitting one on the other .

		I '11 have no call now to be going down and getting Holy Water in the dark nights after
Samhain	LOCATION	, and I wo n't care what way the sea is when the other women will be keening . ''

		And how poignantly passion is expressed in the greatest tragedy of them all , when
Deirdre	PERSON	bids farewell to the home of her seven happy years as she leaves it for the un - known : '' Woods of Cuan , woods of Cuan ; dear country of the east !

		It 's seven years we 've had a life was joy only , and this day we 're going west , this day we 're facing death , maybe , and death should be a poor , untidy thing , though it 's a queen that dies . ''

		And again just before she presses the knife to her heart she says : `` Little moon , little moon of
Alban	LOCATION	, it 's lone - some you '11 be
this night	TIME	, and to-morrow night , and long nights after , and you pacing the woods beyond
Glen Laoi	PERSON	, looking every place for
Deirdre	PERSON	and
Naisi	PERSON	, the two lovers who slept so sweetly with each other . ''

		And the voice of this genius is new because his people are so wonderfully fresh and clear .

		What a great language they speak !

		How lucid and simple and poetic it is !

		Thus in `` The Well of the Saints ''
Martin	PERSON	tells of the sights the two blind beggars , he and his wife , have : `` Ah , it 's ourselves had finer sights than the like of them , I 'm telling you , when we were sitting a while back hearing the birds and bees humming in every weed of the ditch ; or when we 'd be smelling the sweet , beautiful smell does be rising in the warm nights , when you do hear the swift flying things racing in the air , till we 'd be looking up in our own minds into a grand sky ; and seeing lakes , and big rivers , and fine hills for taking the plough . ''

		Above all , the voice is new because the author is not concerned in solving a problem or exploiting a theory ; it is like the voice of the Elizabethans , which proclaims truth and beauty through the medium of pure art .

		DISRAELI AS POLITICIAN AND AUTHOR .

		* In the preface to the second volume of Mr.
William Flavelle Mony	PERSON	penny 's
Life of Disraeli	ORGANIZATION	, it is explained that the delay in publication was due to reasons of health .

		The preface is dated
October , 1912	DATE	; a little later news went abroad of the author 's death .

		The passing of a brilliant * THE LIFE OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI , EARL OF BEACONS - FIELD .

William Flavelle Monypenny	PERSON	.

		Volume II .

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		236 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, writer is always keenly felt ; in this case there is the added regret that death came while the author was in the midst of the greatest task of his career .

		Of his biography of Disraeli only two of the four volumes that he had planned have been published .

		We are assured , however , that he had the remaining volumes well under way , and that they will appear in due time .

		In the present volume the author has em - ployed the same literary method as in the earlier one .

		It is to a large extent made up of extracts from
Disraeli	ORGANIZATION	's letters and novels , which the author has strung together on a thin thread of original narrative .

		This method has decided advantages : it gives the reader an insight into
Disraeli	PERSON	's mental character that no discussion on the author 's part could give us .

		The great politician is made to reveal all the many traits of his extraordinary mind , his love for the fan - tastic , his ambition , his shrewdness , his faith in himself , his vanity , and the rest : the author makes no attempt at concealment .

		At the same time , there arises a doubt as to whether the method has not been overworked .

		It is import - ant to know what Disraeli thought of himself ; but we need also to be told what his contem - poraries thought of him .

		To some extent Mr.
Monypenny	PERSON	supplies this information , but too often it is given on the authority of Disraeli himself .

		It may be true that '' I spoke with great effect
last night	TIME	in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, the best speech on our side , '' and that '' my great speech in
1846	DATE	... was followed by the loudest and longest cheer that ever was heard in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, '' but we ought to have more evidence .

		The volume covers a period of nine years , beginning with
Disraeli	PERSON	's first appearance in parliament in
1837	DATE	and closing with his suc - cessful overthrow of Sir
Robert Peel	PERSON	in
1846	DATE	.

		A chapter is given to his marriage , and another to his stay in
Paris	LOCATION	during the winter of 1842-3 ; but the bulk of the narrative is devoted to liter - ature and politics , two subjects that were closely related in
Disraeli	LOCATION	's mind .

		Mr.
Monypenny	PERSON	has studied his subject from three sides : he sees him as a parliamentary orator , as a novelist , and as a political theorist .

		Disraeli the states - man will be the subject of future volumes ; for in his career previous to
1846	DATE	there were no clear indications that he would ever develop con - structive statesmanship ; nor would anyone have guessed in the days when he had to remain in - doors for fear of his creditors that he would some day prove a fairly successful chancellor of the exchequer .

		Considerable attention is given to
Disraeli	PERSON	's career as a parliamentary orator .

		The story of his maiden speech , when the radicals and the Irishmen howled him down , is told in detail , and the author shows that it was
Disraeli	PERSON	's own fault that he received such rough treatment : he went `` out of his way to provoke the hostility of the Irish , on whom the traditions of the
House	ORGANIZATION	were least likely to impose restraint . ''

		Ten days later he was again on the floor , and was satisfied with the impression that he made : `` I spoke again
last night	TIME	and with complete success . ''

		Three months later he made an unusually effec - tive speech , and '' sat down amid loud cheers '' ; but he adds : '' No one cheered me more vehe - mently than
Hobhouse	PERSON	, who was a little drunk . ''

		Before he had been six months in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, it seems that the press as well as parliament had begun to take him seriously .

		At least such is his own belief . ''

		I made a most brilliant and triumphant speech last night unquestionably and agreed upon by all hands the crack speech of the night ... Every paper in
London	LOCATION	,
Radical	ORGANIZATION	,
Whig	LOCATION	, or Tory , has spoken of my speech in the highest terms of panegyric , except the wretched Standard , which , under the influence of that scoundrel
Maginn	PERSON	, always attacked me before I was in parliament , and now always passes over my name in silence . ''

		The author also discusses
Disraeli	PERSON	's oratorical mannerisms , his monotonous drawl , his careless gestures , and the indifferent manner that he employed until he reached the really important parts of his speech , when he would suddenly rise to the occasion and give the enemy thrust after thrust .

		Two chapters are devoted to
Disraeli	LOCATION	's novels of this period , '' Coningsby '' and '' Sibyl . ''

		Mr.
Monypenny	PERSON	rates these very high , whether re - garded as works of art or as political treatises .

		But he is not oblivious to the defects in
Disraeli	LOCATION	's literary art , chiefly his inability to keep his purpose from dominating the story .

		The au - thor 's discussion of these novels is most illumi - nating . ''

		`
Coningsby	ORGANIZATION	' can be regarded either as a work of art , or as the manifesto of
Young England	LOCATION	. ''

		The chapter on
Young England	LOCATION	, a group of dreamers who looked to Disraeli as a leader , serves as an excellent introduction to the discussion of the novel itself , for some of the members of
Young England	ORGANIZATION	appear as characters in the story .

		In `` Sibyl '' Disraeli gives us a study of conditions among the impoverished industrial classes .

		It is Mr.
Monypenny	PERSON	's opin - ion that although `` Sibyl '' has been a favorite `` with the critics and with the elect , '' it is really inferior to '' Coningsby . ''

		`` Coningsby '' is important for the study of
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 237 Disraeli as a political theorist , because in this book he develops his ideas of historical Toryism ; '' Sibyl , '' because in this he shows the necessity of combining the older Tory idea with that of social reform .

		In tracing the growth of the new Toryism , Mr.
Monypenny	PERSON	finds that
Disraeli	PERSON	was not disloyal to his early radical convictions when he became a member of the conservative party .

		With his conservative friends he em - phasized the historic elements of the English constitution , the land , the church , and above all the monarchy .

		But he did not stop there : he realized that the industrial revolution had produced a new set of social conditions , and that the call for social reform should be heeded .

		Monarchy , as he viewed it , did not exist merely to conserve the existing institutions ; it was to serve as the agent of the nation in effecting social reform . ''

		For him in the political cosmos there are two great realities the throne at the centre , and the People at the circumference ; and on the maintenance of their nor - mal and unimpeded interaction the health and balance of all depends .

		` The privileges of the multitude and the prerogatives of the Sovereign had grown up together , and together they had waned ' ; together also they were to be redeemed from the selfish oligarchy which had usurped them , and the not less selfish and only less nar - row middle class which had now taken the place of the oligarchy .

		That , briefly stated , is the Disraelian posi - tion .

		There is no shrinking , as we can see , from democ - racy as such , though there is a shrinking from a sudden transference of power to a neglected and entirely unedu - cated democracy . ''

		It was , however , not as the exponent of a political theory , but as the supporter of a ques - tionable economic expedient , the corn laws , that Disraeli mounted to leadership .

		The fight over the corn laws is told in considerable detail .

		An effort is made to show that
Disraeli	PERSON	was abso - lutely honest in his opposition , and that he had given Peel warning in several notable speeches that an attempt to abandon protection might bring them to the parting of the ways .

		- It is in his discussion of this conflict that Mr.
Monypenny	PERSON	shows most clearly his own political bias ; this part of the narrative is therefore likely to meet with some criticism .

		For the author holds that the abolition of the corn laws ruined English agriculture , while it brought no help to
Ireland	LOCATION	; that the apparent prosperity of
England	LOCATION	in the following years was not due to the repeal , but to other causes : `` the great development of steam and railways that was proceeding when it was adopted , and the gold discoveries in
California	LOCATION	and
Australia	LOCATION	that soon followed '' ; and , finally , '' The repeal of the Corn Laws was the first decisive step in that policy of sacrificing the rural life of
England	LOCATION	to a one-sided and exaggerated industrial development which has done so much to change the English character aud the English outlook , and which it may not impossi - bly be the business of subsequent generations to endeavor to retrace . ''

		It is also a question whether the author is just in his treatment of Sir
Robert Peel	PERSON	.

		He admits that morally Peel was superior to
Disraeli	LOCATION	;
Disraeli	ORGANIZATION	's flat denial in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	that he had ever asked Peel for an office would make another conclusion impossible .

		Mr.
Monypenny	PERSON	makes no attempt to excuse the falsehood ; he adds , however , '' Let the politi - cian who is without sin in the matter of veracity cast the first stone . ''

		But , he argues , `` there is not only a moral but an intellectual integrity , and in intellectual virtue Peel was as much the inferior of Disraeli as in the moral he was his superior . ''

		It is likely that too much is made of
Disraeli	LOCATION	's devotion to principle ; for it seems impossible to disguise the fact that he was , after all , a political adventurer , who would leap at an op - portunity like that afforded by the plight of the squires who were threatened by
Peel	ORGANIZATION	's pro- posed legislation .

		But except in matters related to the great battle in
1846	DATE	, the author shows rare judgment and writes in a spirit of evident fairness .

		It must be remembered , however , that Mr.
Monypenny	PERSON	wrote in the year
1912	DATE	, in an atmosphere full of schemes for future corn laws and other forms of protection ; in such an atmosphere it would be difficult for the judgment of a Tory to maintain an even balance .


LAURENCE M. LARSON	PERSON	.

		THE WOMEN OF SHAKESPEARE .

		* Several years ago Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	, the
London	LOCATION	editor and dramatic critic , published a work on '' The Man Shakespeare , '' in which he professed to read the inner history of Shake - speare from youth to decline by finding him thinly disguised in his dramas under a recurrent type-character , now , for example , as
Orsino	PERSON	, now as
Hamlet	LOCATION	, and now as
Antony	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	's new volume of studies , reprinted from `` The English Review , '' are in effect a continuation of the same theme .

		By `` The Women of Shakespeare '' are meant primarily the four actual women who had most to do with the shaping of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's life and sentiments his mother , wife , mistress , and daughter .

		These women , like
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	himself , Mr.
Harris	PERSON	* THE WOMEN OB 1 SHAKESPEARE .

New York	LOCATION	:
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	.

		238 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, finds portrayed more or less faithfully in suc - cessive characters in the dramas , and he freely employs such phrases as Cleopatra-Fitton and Judith-Marina to convey his meaning .

		Natur - ally , the chief emphasis is upon the mistress ,
Mary Fitton	PERSON	, Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	's maid-of - honor .

		It was she , Mr.
Harris	PERSON	believes , who is to be credited with the development of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's tragic power , working in his soul and art a trans - formation paralleled -LRB- shall we say ? -RRB-

		only in such histories as those of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	.

		The matter of the volume is not entirely new .

		We have long been familiar , for instance , with the attempt to identify '' the whitely wanton with a velvet brow '' of '' Love 's Labor 's Lost '' with the dark lady of the sonnets , and this lat - ter with
Mary Fitton	PERSON	.

		But Mr.
Harris	PERSON	goes far beyond these slight conjectures , and attempts to extract from the plays not only , as already stated , a spiritual history , but even definite biographical details .

		For example , a scene in `` Coriolanus '' makes him `` feel that Shake - speare 's mother on her death-bed had probably begged something of Shakespeare which he had granted very reluctantly , '' that she had , in fact , '' made him promise to be reconciled to his wife . ''

		A declaration so bold as this excites one 's curi - osity to know by what process of deduction the author arrives at his conclusions .

		Example will be more satisfactory than description .

		Speaking of '' Coriolanus , '' he says : '' The wife plays hardly any part in the drama ; the whole interest is concentrated on the mother and son .

		... The speech of Coriolanus when he is on the point of yielding to his mother 's pleading is impossible in the mouth of a Roman general , but is all the more character - istic of Shakespeare at this time : Like a dull actor now I have forgot my part , and I am out , Even to a full disgrace ... ... You gods !

		I prate , And the most noble mother of the world Leave unsaluted : sink my knee , i ' the earth Of thy deep duty more impression show Than that of common sons ... Surely in the last lines of this self-revealing speech we catch an echo of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's pride in himself and his intense admiration of his mother .

		Why should
Corio	PERSON	- laniis praise his mother to us ? ''

		It seems to us rather more pertinent to ask , Why should Shakespeare praise his mother to a
London	LOCATION	audience ?

		But if that is not convinc - ing , perhaps the following may be this time with reference to `` Antony and Cleopatra '' : ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	had been in love with
Mary Fitton	PERSON	for years .

		She had got into his blood , and he could not but paint her for us in act after act , in a dozen differing moods .

		Even
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's intellectual conscience Enobarbus can not control himself when he speaks of her : I saw her once Hop forty paces through the public street ; And having lost her breath , she spoke , and panted That she did make defect perfection And , breathless , power breathe forth .

		This incident seems to me a veritable performance of
Mary Fitton	PERSON	reported by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		It must have made a deathless impression on him .

		Not only does it throw Enobarbus off his perfect balance : but it is in itself too peculiar to be imagined and is besides not at all in keeping with the character of the sensual queen .

		It reminds us too directly of the bold sonnet-heroine .

		That insistence upon ' power ' strikes the same note as in Sonnet 150 : from what power hast thou this powerful might ? ' '

		In the chapter on `` All 's Well that Ends Well '' Mr.
Harris	PERSON	makes out a strong case for the identification of
Bertram	PERSON	's character with that of
Lord Herbert	PERSON	, and the plausibility of this portion bespeaks serious consideration for his entire argument .

		But , unfortunately , no - where else does assent follow so readily , and very often one feels compelled to enter an emphatic denial .

		That Hamlet upbraiding his mother and beseeching her to abandon the King should be really
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	reproaching
Mary Fitton	PERSON	and begging her to cast off
Lord Herbert	PERSON	, ap - pears little short of ridiculous .

		And when , a little later , we are told that the unnatural cruelty of Hamlet in speaking with such contempt of the slain Polonius '' I '11 lug the guts into the neighbor room '' is only to be explained by the fact that '' Shake - speare is here again thinking of
Herbert	LOCATION	, the real object of his hate , whom often in imagina - tion he had killed with one quick thrust , '' one feels bound to protest that if this indeed be so , the creator of Hamlet was insane .

		If Mr.
Harris	PERSON	were not so serious and so evidently convinced by his own reasoning , we should be disposed to think it all a deliberate hoax , perpetrated pos - sibly with the object of showing the Baconians how , with persistence enough , one can read any - thing he pleases into the text of Shakespeare .

		Not the least strange part of it all is the au - thor 's fancy that his discovery somehow glorifies
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, even while he calls him a snob and a sensualist .

		He appears to think that now , for the first time , in the light of this new truth , is Shakespeare revealed in all his essential human - ity , and his character clothed with flesh and blood .

		But surely this is just what all men have always seen in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	.

		Life , we grant , indeed , we insist , he must have known to the core .

		What we refuse to believe , even granting the Herbert-Fitton episode , which is by no means established , is that he should have kept so nar - rowly within the pale of his personal experience
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 239 and hugged so closely his private wrongs that he merely transcribed them , schoolboy-like , into his plays , instead of transmuting them into that wonderful pageant of universal human passions that spectators and readers alike have taken them to be .

		Happily , not many of us are likely to be convinced .

		MYSTICISM : WHITHER BOUND ?

		* The world will not cease to demand from mysticism some firm human significance .

		Lack - ing this , a new mystic vision may indeed carry us off our feet for a time , but we will not fly far with it .

		Possessing this , it may transport us to very strange shores : we will '' adventure for such merchandise . ''

		History is instinct with this demand , and general thought will make it continually more pressing .

		Surely it is destined , working its way to the very roots of mysticism , to cultivate in time a hardier plant and lovelier flowers than have been .

		But just at present the process is acute and debilitating .

		The blossoms are not only strange but inherently fragile , for instance , those that blow in
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's garden .

		Graceful and assiduously tended as these are , they can scarce draw one 's approbation unmixed with the regret `` that it should come to this '' !

		Especially calculated to stir the Hamlet ` in one , are the essays on
Emerson	LOCATION	, Novalis , and
Ruys	PERSON	- broeck in their English dress .

		The translation , though on the whole adequate , is frequently the reverse of subtle , and in any case much of the original color and perfume was bound to flee the language of shop-keepers ; moreover , the studies in the volume represent , as the translator remarks , the sources of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's `` philo - sophic inspiration . ''

		As a result , his views confront the Anglo-Saxon reader in barer out - line than ever before , and readers are likely * ON

		to be numerous on account of the author 's popularity .

		Many who have seen
Maeterlinck	PERSON	through the general haze which hangs about him may be induced now to ponder somewhat thoughtfully the bare essentials of his mysticism .

		Indeed , although the essays are not new , they have now a fresh importance .

		They provide , unintentionally , a timely '' Past and Present . ''

		Joining with certain other influences which are working in the same direction , they will help compel our attention for the present state of mysticism .

		And more general meditation upon this subject should react to the good of mysti - cism itself , should indirectly hasten its period of firmer growth .

		Whither is it bound ?

		Mysticism comprises two main spiritual states , fundamentally inseparable and comple - mentary but nevertheless distinct : an apo - calyptic , in which truth seems merely to be revealed ; and a humanly creative , so to speak , in which new truth seems brought into exist - ence .

		At times , the dreamer is contemplating a transcendent picture from which a veil has dropped ; again , he is himself the artist , paint - ing with divine colors a scene not yet known to heaven or earth .

		For him , the joy of strangely mingled self-forgetfulness and creative exulta - tion is for the moment all-sufficient .

		He rele - gates to colder hours , or to other persons , the pursuit of a rational harmony .

		This pursuit reduces the two mystic states to aspects of what has so far appeared , in the world 's net verdict , a persistent dualism presenting such further discords as `` the one and the many , '' good and evil , eternity and time .

		Yet all considerable attempts at harmonizing these discords have soon reacted upon the nature of mysticism itself have been the true parents , indeed , of all mys - tic visions which have attained lasting human significance .

		Where , then , will the pursuit of harmony next lead us ?

		The effect of modern thought , certainly , has been to deepen the human terms of the old paradox .

		The tap-root of them all , plainly , is `` time '' roughly represented in ordinary speech by such expressions as flux , evolution , human progress , and the like : time in the largest sense of the word .

		This fact has been more and more firmly established among us , on the one hand by those who look askance on everything from
Rousseau	PERSON	to
Bergson	LOCATION	, and on the other by those optimists spiritual chil - dren of Comte who find the direct line of progress passing through the middle of our epoch .

		So that the central stream of human thought , if it follows its old commonplace pro- 240 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, cedure of issuing about midway between the conservative and radical channels , can scarcely do so without being colored , more deeply than before , with the current of time .

		That color - will slowly work its way in just what degree it is impossible to foretell , although certainly not in the
Bergsonian	LOCATION	degree through the general conception of ultimate reality .

		To this result the majority of nineteenth century writ - ers , most often unwittingly , have made sig - nificant contributions .

		Even those have done so who , like
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Browning	PERSON	, affected independence of the age 's trend and rendered inborn homage to '' the Quiet '' overhead .

		For by uniquely emphasizing , in effect , the lasting significance of human labor , `` the many , '' even evil , and various other constituents of the human drama , they edified the very plot and frame of that drama time itself .

		They all abetted time 's invasion of the Quiet 's realm .

		It seems that the central push of history was behind them .

		The eventual result for mysticism will be to intensify what was termed above its humanly creative mood .

		Implicit in this mood is the recognition that time possesses at bottom some ultimate reality .

		Nor will the intensification of that mood make it dissonant with the apocalyp - tic state in which time 's shackles seem to be loosed .

		For it is surely the function and value of mysticism to solve , as the world grows older , deeper discords than of yore .

		And the mystic himself may experience increasingly rich returns .

		The truth which he discovers will never again , indeed , have the pure simplicity and the static completeness of the Platonic vision .

		But if the divine excellence shall show some inherent need of development , it will evince also a transcend - ent capability for such unfolding .

		And the rapture of perceiving this excellence will be mingled more than ever with the deep joy of creatively aiding in that development .

		A prevision of this joy appears in
Emerson	LOCATION	: the `` Oversoul '' is overlaid with a peculiarly crea - tive '' Self - Reliance '' fruit of a long growth of human thought which in him attained a pro- phetic , if premature , harmoniousness .

		In
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's essay on
Emerson	LOCATION	, however , the thought-foundation has faded from view , and the self-reliance been reduced to a succes - sion of receptive moods .

		How strangely thin , then , here as in the writings of
Emerson	LOCATION	's less noted present-day disciples , does the Over - soul appear !

		And it is this sort of soul `` a capricious and hidden thing '' he once well terms it which the author pursues through the re - maining two essays , and distills into a haze of imagery .

		Mystic imagery , rather than mystic vision with its large background of thought , is what attracts him , notably in
Ruysbroeck	LOCATION	.

		The book is therefore thoroughly characteristic of contemporary mysticism .

		For this has fallen into the twofold estate produced always by peri - ods of transition : its apocalypse is weak , and its humanly creative vision is merged largely in a predilection for symbolism .

		Fleeting impres - sions of vague greatnesses often light shadows of past gods are elaborated through a finely graduated scale of symbolic images .

		Pick up almost any present literary production tinged with mysticism be it American lyric , German reverie , or Russian novel and you are told the same story .

		It throws one 's thoughts , distress - ingly , upon the merely latent , inert aspect of reality .

		The oversoul , without firm human foundation , easily sinks to an undersoul .

		Those - highest '' peaks '' of our being , for instance , that
Maeterlinck	PERSON	talks so much about , do they not quickly turn , if one rubs one 's eyes , into mere inverted images of valleys ?

		To be sure , it is well to be made conscious of our needs ; such a condition is pre-essential to reconstruction .

		And if the pursuit of symbol - ism can not fulfil those needs , nevertheless it has a certain secondary value .

		At its best , present - day literary mysticism is cultivating the high meaning of the small familiar things of life ; it is thus contributing in a minor fashion to that humanizing of mysticism which is bound in the future to run its course .

		And , indeed , flashes of truly constructive insight , indicating a develop - ment of fresh vitality in the general direction outlined above , are not wanting : witness the first part of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's essay on Novalis .

		But naturally the new harmony , in which time , with its increased reality , shall be reconciled again with eternity , must be built up not in the proper sphere of mysticism but in that of religious thought .


Browning	PERSON	's optimistic attempt at over - coming this discord was not merely Victorian , but also prophetic ; though smiled at nowadays , to be sure , by many of the critical , it has obvi - ously met a real need vaguely apprehended by the public mind .

		Other religious or semi - religious - thinkers , among them Professor Eucken , have - been more or less consciously contributing to the coming result .

		In the meantime , mysticism is - on the whole worshipping `` an unknown God . ''

		Whenever it has done this in the past , it has left , in its decay , no large kernel of human , significance .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 241 PROBLEMS OF LABOR AND INDUSTRY .

		* An eminent economic authority of a past genera - tion once said that , while production to a large extent is governed by fixed and immutable laws , the distri - bution of wealth varies according to the laws and customs of a country , one being fixed by nature , the other by society .

		If this is true -LRB- and there seems to be a consensus of opinion in that direction -RRB- the present industrial unrest is caused by the desire for a more equitable distribution of the fruits of human toil among the several producers .

		The capitalist has always been able to take care of himself , but now the laborer is coming into his own more than ever before in industrial history .

		Both capital and labor are indispensable factors in production , and through peaceful adjustments of difficulties right understand - ing and mutual well-being must be brought about .

		Discontent , to be effective , must express itself ; and even if the proposed remedies vary , as they do in the four books here considered , the inevitable out - come must be social progress .

		Sir
Arthur Clay	PERSON	discusses in `` Syndicalism and Labor '' the rise of militant methods in labor circles , and adds some notes upon various aspects of social and industrial questions of the day .

		The origin of Syndicalism is briefly described , and concerning its meaning we read : '' It may be correctly used to designate the system adopted by any association of persons formed to further common interests ; but in
France	LOCATION	of late years it has acquired a special meaning ' , and is now generally understood to denote the policy of the ' Confederation Gen ^ rale du Travail , ' the object of which is the destruction by force of the existing organi - sation , and the transfer of industrial capital from its present possessors to Syndicalists , or in other words to the revolution - ary Trade Unions .

		The means by which this object is to be secured is the General Strike . ''

		One faction looks to revolutionary methods , while the other to constitutional means , to accomplish their ends .

		The intellectual justification of Syndicalism in the writings of
Sorel	ORGANIZATION	is thus stated : '' In the absence of a virile and energetic middle class , human progress is impossible .

		In these latter days this class has become degenerate and cowardly .

		The only chance for its regeneration is that it should , be compelled to fight for its existence .

		The war of classes taught by the doctrine of Syndicalism can alone supply this necessary stimulant ; there - fore to teach this doctrine is to serve the true interest of humanity . ''

		In other words ,
Syndicalism	ORGANIZATION	is advocated as a relig - ion .

		The larger part of Sir
Arthur Clay	PERSON	's book is devoted to an historical resumti of the development of Syndicalism in
France	LOCATION	,
Sweden	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and the
United Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then follow chapters on trade unionism in
England	LOCATION	, and the influence upon it of growing socialistic sentiment .

		of the author is that of an extreme Tory , and the '' sacred rights of property '' are emphasized to the neglect of even the most conservative and humane considerations .

		All trades unions are regarded as necessarily anti-social bodies , and their present tend - encies are viewed with alarm .

		Although written almost entirely from secondary sources , and despite its reactionary tone , the book contains an interesting account of the ideas and growth of Syndicalism .

		Unlike the previous volume , Mr.
Portenar	PERSON	's book on `` Organized Labor '' is a discussion of labor prob - lems and how to meet them written from a trade - union point of view .

		The author is a member of the
Typographical Union	ORGANIZATION	, and his views are there - fore not theoretical but the result of actual experi - ence .

		The lesson to him of the McNamara affair , with all its attendant results , is not the necessity for a breaking up of trade unionism but for its more thorough organization .

		The way out is by peaceful means .

		Then , after a consideration of some of the existing grievances , the author says : '' Hence the first answer to the question , What shall we do ?

		is a negative .

		We shall not resort to open or furtive violence .

		Those to whom an ethical reason is sufficient need not be urged to refrain from it .

		Those who see in it a means of advancement should be satisfied that the best to be hoped from it is temporary gain , certain to be followed by punish - ment for the guilty and disaster for the movement .

		The two reasons together should control us all . ''

		A chapter is then devoted to
Syndicalism	LOCATION	, and its exposition in this country by the Industrial Workers of the World .

		Here also the writer takes the evolutionary and not the revolutionary view , and condemns the idea of the `` irritation '' strike as a common feature of industrial life .

		The way out is rather by cooperation for mutual benefit and pro- tection .

		Organization by industry as allied trades , with arrangements for the arbitration of grievances with employers , is strongly urged .

		But even with this ideal realized more or less fully , the strike is not to be discarded , because , as in war between nations , the strike is a last resource for the work - man , when all other efforts for justice have failed .

		Succeeding chapters are devoted to `` Insurance Benefits , '' `` Co-operative Trading , '' and related topics .

		The proposal is made that a great co - operative society should be formed , to be controlled and directed by the international unions , for the sale of union-made goods , thus doing away with the profits of the middleman and the expensive methods of the boycott and the union label .

		The dominant note of the book is one of practical common-sense combined with a belief that no problem is settled until it is settled right .

		`` The New Industrial Day '' is described as `` a book for men who employ men '' ; and its author , Mr.
William C. Redfield	PERSON	, a former member of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, presents in its pages the results of his own experience as a manufacturer and as an observer of industrial conditions .

		The thesis of the book is that the work - man should be so treated that he may do his best , and this involves a wage which has some relation to the profit realized from his work .

		The plea is for 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, an intelligent development of the workman , and the application of brains to business methods .

		The line of least resistance in reducing expenses seems to be the reduction of wages , and this is taken by many employers ; but the real need is for better methods of production and of business management .

		Says Mr.
Redfield	PERSON	: '' Given the scientific spirit in management , constant and careful study of operations and details of cost and this is the crux of the whole question given the scientific spirit in management , constant and careful study of operations and details of cost , modern buildings and equipment , proper arrangement of plant and proper material , ample power , space , and light , a high wage rate means inevitably a low labor cost per unit of product and the minimum of labor cost '' The reality of this statement is brought out in some nine chapters by a great wealth of illustration from practical experience .

		The days of the rule of thumb are gone , and to keep afloat to-day the manufac - turer must cease to be a Bourbon and must really understand his business .

		Particularly pungent and refreshing is the chapter entitled '' What Have We Got to Do with Abroad ? ''

		where our failures in foreign trade are traced to our neglect to comply with the demands of foreign buyers rather than to our high wage rate , which is in reality a low product rate .

		Costs and their causes are then dealt with in a spirit of inexorable logic , while the influence in their reduction of a well-paid and efficient working force is clearly brought out .

		The fact is insisted upon and reiterated that we have only gone half - way on the industrial road , and that in the light of the rise of human values account must be taken of the human factor in production as well as of ma - chinery and selling .

		The results coming from a scientific spirit in management are shown , and at the same time fair dealing with the worker is in - sisted upon as a requisite for success .

		The book is based not only upon sound sense but upon sound economics ; for , as the writer so clearly points out , high-priced labor leads to progress , efficiency , and improved methods , and these lead in turn to an increased output and to greater cheapness of the product .

		Fourteen papers , written from many points of view , are brought together in `` The Outlook for Industrial Peace . ''

		While lacking to a considerable extent any degree of unity , the result is a compre - hensive presentation of conditions and tendencies in the industrial world .

		The need of settling disputes between employers and employees without resort to strikes , and a method of accomplishing such a result , is brought out by Mr.
Marcus M. Marks	PERSON	in an exposi - tion of `` The Canadian Industrial Disputes Act . ''

		The initiative under this act for conciliation comes not from the government but from one or the other interested party , and results in the appointment of a
Board of Conciliation and Investigation	ORGANIZATION	.

		Pending the investigation of this
Board	ORGANIZATION	, the service must be uninterrupted , under penalty of heavy fines .

		After investigation , a published report is made , but there is no compulsion as to acceptance of this report or for arbitration . ''

		If both parties voluntarily agree to arbitration , well and good ; but the act contemplates only investigation and pub - licity .

		After the report of the
Board	ORGANIZATION	has been published , either party is entirely free to strike or lock-out ; the law has been complied with when employer and employed per - mit the situation to remain unchanged until the end of the period of investigation .

		However , workingmen are quite unlikely to risk the dangers of a strike in the face of an adverse opinion of such a
Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		Similarly , the employer will in almost every instance accede to the requests made by a fair tribunal . ''

		The effectiveness of this act is shown by the fact that during the past five years only fourteen instances out of one hundred and ten disputes so referred have resulted in strikes .

		In the light of such a result , it would seem well for our several states to adopt such a method .

		The aims and methods of various industrial organizations are discussed in the papers on '' The
National Civic Federation	ORGANIZATION	and Industrial Peace , '' by Dr.
Seth	PERSON	Low ; '' The
Joint Board of Sanitary Control	ORGANIZATION	in the Cloak , Suit and Skirt Industry in
New York City	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Henry Moskowitz	PERSON	; '' Industrial Betterment Activities of the
National Metal Trades Association	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Robert Wuest	PERSON	; and '' Industrial Peace Ac - tivities of the
National Electric Light Association	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Arthur Williams	PERSON	.

		Then the related topics of scientific management and industrial education are emphasized in '' The Attitude of Labor towards Scientific Management , '' by Mr.
Hollis Godfrey	PERSON	; '' Education and Industrial Peace , '' by Mr.
Herman Schneider	PERSON	; and '' Factory Organization in Relation to
Industrial Education	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Hugo Diemer	PERSON	.

		The most thoroughgoing paper of all is the one on '' Conditions Fundamental to Industrial Peace , '' by Mr.
George B. Hugo	PERSON	.

		After a scathing indictment of the surrender of the
Boston Elevated Railway Company	ORGANIZATION	to organized labor in the recent strike , the assertion is made that there is no choice for the individual between the two evils of corporate capital and organized labor .

		Each is as bad as the other .

		Over against these is placed the ideal of individual economic freedom .

		How this is to be brought about is not indicated , except in the state - ment that '' government will again assume its abdi - cated function of protecting the individual . ''

		But large-scale production and big business units are already here ; and it is entirely unlikely that in - dustry can be forced back into past conditions .

		In conclusion it may be said that industrial peace means industrial democracy , and the consequent passing of absolute monarchy -LRB- not to say despot - ism -RRB- in industrial relations .

		The contrast between democracy in government and absolute monarchy in industry , as now existing , is too glaring an anomaly to last .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 243 RECENT AMERICAN POETRY .

		* In `` A Day at Castrogiovanni , '' Mr.
George Edward Woodberry	PERSON	has crystallized in noble verse the impressions of a happy Sicilian day .

		It was a day
five years ago	DATE	, spent on the site of
Demeter	ORGANIZATION	's temple and in view of
Etna	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are three poems : a sonnet called `` Etna , '' an ode to `` Proserpine , '' and a didactic poem in stanzas upon ''
Demeter	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The sonnet may be given complete : '' Bird-wakened out of sleep , my darkling eyes Saw Etna bloom and whiten in the dawn , While over hollow leagues of crag and lawn Brightened earth 's edge upon the far-set skies ; Now , volleying light , the lucid mountain lies Transfigured , in the breath of gold updrawn , Dim base to rosy plume , and high the wan Worn moon turns snow , and worships as it dies . ''

		Then o'er the shoulder of that mount in heaven Rose like a moon divine , celestial sun , The Star to which all glory hath been given , The orb of life whence all things here have been .

		The nightingales sang on , and I shall see No sight so mighty in tranquillity . ''

		Of the '' Prosperpine '' we will quote the closing section : '' O Prosperpine , dream not that thou art gone Far from our lives , half - human , half-divine ; Thou hast a holier adoration won In many a heart that worships at no shrine .

		Where light and warmth behold me , And flower and wheat enfold me , I lift a dearer prayer than all prayers past ; He who so loved thee that the live earth clove Before his pathway unto light and love , And took thy flower-full blossom , who at last Shall every blossom cull , Lover the most of what is most our own , The mightiest lover that the world has known , Dark lover , Death , was he not beautiful . ''

		The burden of the ''
Demeter	ORGANIZATION	'' is that worship is one , however diverse the names of its gods and the systems to which they belong .

		Lo , I have believed in all the gods in turn , And know they have no being but in me ; All is the form of what doth inly burn , Up from the fetich to eternity ; Wherever man doth pray , and finds faith there , I kneel beside him and repeat his prayer . ''

		Man doth prevail , who masters , age by age , The secret forces that through nature ply , And with the changes of the mind grows sage , Whose faith burns brighter as the old truths die ; Truth is the cloud , molded by every storm ; Faith , like the rainbow , changes not its form . ''

		This reminds us of
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' Hymn of Man , '' without its fierce invective , or of the prelude to the '' Songs before Sunrise . ''

		It expresses the essence of the religious belief of the emancipated mind which sees life steadily and sees it whole , and echoes also the wistful sympathy of such a poem as '' Die Gotter Griechenlands . ''

		Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	's position as the first of living American poets would be secure without the credit of this new volume ; of its con - tents we may simply say that they are entirely worthy of the genius that gave us '' Wild Eden '' and The North Shore Watch . ''

Peary	PERSON	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, and others .

		The '' Uriel '' of the collection is
William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	, who is also the subject of another poem , '' To the Fire - Bringer . ''

		We quote some scattered stanzas from the titular poem : '' Because he never wore his sentient heart For crows and jays to peck , of ttimes to such He seemed a silent fellow , who o'ermuch Held from the general gossip-ground apart , Or tersely spoke , and tart : How should they guess what eagle tore , within , His quick of sympathy for humblest smart Of human wretchedness , or probed his spleen Of scorn against the hypocritic mart ! ''

		But special-privileged investitures Of beauty liked him not .

		To him the fact Was by its passion only made compact Of beauty ; as , amid the
Gloucester	LOCATION	moors , The loveliness , which lures The artist 's eye , for him was nature 's prism To illume his love of country : art which endures At once is poetry and patriotism , In spite of jingoists and epicures . ''

		Mr.
MacKaye	PERSON	's thought is fine and true , but he has many forced and infelicitous phrases , and his diction , as the close of the above stanza shows , is sometimes anything but poetic .

		The following stanza is ex - plained by this note : `` Shortly before his death , he told a friend about a new drama , on the theme of Saint
Paul	PERSON	, the outlines of which had come to him splendidly as a vision '' : '' Darkling those constellations of his soul Glimmered , while racks of stellar lightning shot The white , creative meteors of thought Through that

Paul	PERSON	, blazing a theme Of living drama from a fiery scroll Across his stretched vision as in dream When Death , with blind dark , blotted out the whole . ''

		In `` The Vaunt of Man , and Other Poems , '' Mr.
William Ellery Leonard	PERSON	has given us a detailed and intimate relation of the adventures of his soul in far-off lands and the realms of gold which literature discloses to the seeker , adventures with faiths and ideals , with '' men of high report , '' with love and life .

		His poems are intensely intellectualized , and shaped in the mould which results from a wide acquaint - ance with literature and with the currents of thought that have flowed down through the ages .

		His temper may fairly be called academic , which is not to our mind a term of dis - praise , albeit his outlook and his moods are distinctly modern .

		The sonnet is his favorite form , and he thus uses it to state his poetical programme or con - fession of faith : '' I would make mention of primeval things , Oceans , horizons , rains , and winds that bear Moist seeds from isle to isle , caves , mountain air And echoes , clouds and shadows of their wings On lakes or hillsides , autumns after springs In starlight , sleep and breathing and the blare Of life 's reveille , love , birth , death , and care Of sunken graves of peasants as of kings .

		The wide world over , O be bold , be free !

		Strip off this perfumed fabric from your verse , Tear from your windows all the silk and lace !

		And stand , man , woman , on the slope by me , O once again before the universe , O once again with Nature face to face ! ''

		It may be said that the writer keeps fairly true to the line thus marked out for himself .

		In the follow - ing piece he strikes a note that was sounded for us by
Arnold	LOCATION	and Sill : '' Our life is threefold ; toil for daily bread , A little vintage and a little oil , Consumes the middle day ; and after toil , When golden sunlight -LRB- else for joyance shed -RRB- Once more behind the hill or holt is sped , Then sleep must take us from the stars and foil The joyance of the splendor-night and coil Around us dreary shades or dreams of dread ; '' But in the space between our toil and sleep , An hour at level dawn , at eve an hour , A sacred watch we keep , or ought to keep : Then stands the soul at peace , as in a tower , And hears the world 's eternal music sweep , And knows its heritage of light and power . ''

		Mr.
Leonard	PERSON	's poems are good to read and to pon - der over .

		They get at the realities of life , and have something worth while to say about them ; and always in a grave , measured , and exalted expression .

		Happy the poet who can sing from his heart : '' Yes , I have been in
Avalon	LOCATION	, The faery Isle in faery seas ; Therefore it is my face is wan , My heart at peace remembering these .

		It may not be , and yet I seem Forever waking from a dream . ''

		If he can say this , he will walk among men apart , taking fortune 's buffets and rewards with equal thanks , with only pity in his heart for those who look at him askance and call him visionary or ideal - ist .

		The great army of philistines , their thought fixed upon mean ideals , will bestow upon him neither their understanding nor their applause , but he will be sure of his reward despite their purblind disre - gard .

		Mr.
Madison Cawein	PERSON	, whose song we have just echoed , is one of those whose consecration to the poetic calling has long been attested , and his new volume , '' The Poet , the Fool , and the Faeries , '' was not needed to make sure his election to the company of our approved singers .

		We must find space for one of these new lyrics , and our choice shall be '' In the Deep Forest . '' ''

		In the deep forest when the lightning played , Pallid and frail a wilding flower swayed , Lifting its blossom from the streaming sod , Trembling and fearful , like a child dismayed , Who in the darkness has forgotten God . ''

		In the deep forest , in the thunder 's roll , Face to pale face I met with my own soul ; And in its eyes were trouble and alarm , Like that which held the heaven from pole to pole , And doubt of God above the
night	TIME	and storm . ''

		In the deep forest , when the tempest passed , The flower smiled unbroken of the blast ; And in the forest , as the day dre-w on , Hand in pale hand , with sure eyes upward cast , My soul and I stood confident of dawn . ''

		One little chink may be found for this exquisite bit of imagery : '' Godiva-like , the moon rode into sight , Cautious , yet confident that no one sees ; The naked moon , astonishing the
night	TIME	, Brightening the thoroughfares of all the trees : Holding her course unfaltering and sure , Knowing herself as beautiful as pure . ''

		Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	is not , as far as we know , a popular poet ; his verses are not sought after by the news - papers , nor do they offer the combination of slangi - ness and sentiment which appeals to the host of readers who think they like poetry without having the remotest notion of what it really is .

		But he has long been sure of his following among those whose judgment really counts , and for whom poetry to be poetry must be a deep interpretation of nature and the soul of man .

		In a new `` Vagabondia '' volume this time without the collaboration of
Richard Hovey	PERSON	Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	once more rings the changes upon the old themes of nature 's pageant , the legendary lore of the past , and the joys of the care-free life under the sun on the open road .

		The following is typical : '' We travelled empty-handed With hearts all fear above , For we ate the bread of friendship , We drank the wine of love . ''

		Through many a wondrous autumn , Through many a magic
spring	DATE	, We hailed the scarlet banners , We heard the blue-bird sing .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 245 '' We looked on life and nature With the eager eyes of youth , And all we asked or cared for Was beauty , joy , and truth . ''

		We found no other - wisdom , We learned no other way , Than the gladness of the
morning	TIME	, The glory of the day . ''

		So all our earthly treasure Shall go with us , my dears , Aboard the Shadow Liner , Across the sea of years . ''

		This pretty , facile stuff is anything but difficult to write , and it goes out of one ear as quickly as it goes into the other .

		Mr.
Carman	PERSON	properly calls these pieces `` Echoes , '' we might have read them all before without now being conscious of the fact .

		And we must considerably qualify the praise bestowed on a poet who is capable of writing `` Me for there ! ''

		as the ending of a lyric of yearning for the beauty of a scene known in the past .

		Of Mr.
Hermann Hagedorn	PERSON	's `` Poems and Bal - lads , '' the ballads are better than the poems , but they are too long to reproduce .

		If we were to choose one for that purpose , it would be `` The Devil and St.
Donat	PERSON	, '' which opens thus : '' The Devil hath made him a ship To bear the sinful souls ; He hath made it well of roots from Hell , And sulphur and brimstone and coals . ''

		To say `` sulphur and brimstone '' is like saying '' poems and ballads . ''

		Of the pieces which the au - thor is content to describe as poems , the sonnet on our national infamy of repudiating the
Panama	LOCATION	treaty with
England	LOCATION	shows us that the poets are ever watch - ful of our country 's honor .

		It is addressed to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Blind guardians of the glory of our land , Defenders of our fame , what have you done ?

		Crying !

		Our holiest pledges every one Are idle words writ on the windy sand !

		How shameless at the judgment do we stand !

		Through cynic
Europe	LOCATION	hear the laughter run ; Shrewd Machiavellis mocking as they shun The great republic of the faithless hand ! ''

		Yea , we are great , but not by juggled phrases !

		Yea , we are strong , but not by troth denied !

		The age is full of change and insecure ; Hot in the fevered blood of nations blazes The strife of souls .

		Only by clear-descried Intrepid equity can we endure . ''

		Mr.
John Hall Wheelock	PERSON	discourses thus of '' The New Love '' : '' Before the morning I arose and went Over the snowy meadows clear and cold , And with the dawn a deep and new content Awoke in me .

		Farewell , dear love of old . ''

		Now that I love you , what is there to say !

		Who would have harmed you , what shall now be said !

		The morning wind has purged it all away .

		Before this love all the old lusts lie dead . ''

		The holier love more deep than all desire Into my spirit from the morning came , Out of the sacred and the whitening Fire It rose within me like a silent flame ; '' And the winds blew it to me from the west , Over the sad fields of unbroken snow , Patient and pure as your own naked breast And hopeless as our love of long ago .

		1 ' The verses sound as if they meant something , but close scrutiny discloses little more than inarticulate emotion tricked out with imagery .

		We quote this poem , and make this comment upon it , because most of the contents of Mr.
Wheelock	PERSON	's volume , `` The Beloved Adventure , '' invite similar observa - tions .

		Gauzy fancies and nebulous ideas abound in his collection , but we rarely find in it either clear-cut thought or lyric rapture .

		Moreover , Mr.
Wheelock	PERSON	's verses are somewhat freer in form than is permis - sible to anyone not an approved master .

		It is only at great risk that a minor poet may attempt what a
Verlaine	PERSON	or a Whitman is free to do without censure . ''

		The Call '' of the poet is thus apprehended by - Mr.
Selden L. Whitcomb	PERSON	: '' Sing no more of the meadow brook That wanders amid the grasses ; Sing no more of the lover 's look When the careless maiden passes ; But sing of passion that endureth , large , Sweeping the soul to life 's untrodden marge . ''

		Sing of Peruvian peaks that rise In silence , barren , regal ; Unseen , unsought of human eyes , Too lonely for the eagle ; Where only the winds of God are unafraid To search the eternal terrors He has made . ''

		It is a tonic prescription , but Mr.
Whitcomb	PERSON	does , not seem to apply it very resolutely to his own case , , for he has much to say of birds and flowers and lovers .

		Nevertheless , he has force here and there , , and sometimes sounds a resonant note , as in '' My Own . '' ''

		I would suck the bitter , perilous fruits , I would chew the bark of nauseous roots , I would gnaw the wolf 's abandoned bone , If I might find my own . ''

		Lash me atop the swaying mast Amid the sleet and the midnight blast That bends with the breaking vessel 's groan , .

		If I may find my own . ''

		Shackle my feet and bind my hands , Bear me a slave to deadly lands To strike all day on the stubborn stone , If I may find my own . ''

		I would woo the fever 's wasting heat With the taunting demons at my feet , The sunken eyes whence reason has flown , If I might find my own . ''

		Tear off the wreath the master gave , And break the marble over my grave To be by brambles overgrown If I may find my own . ''

		246 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, For a collection of first poems , the '' Interpreta - tions '' of Miss
Zoe ' Akins	PERSON	are distinctly promising .

		She has grace , passion , and sensuous charm , and her ear for music is keen and sure .

		This little lyric is a singularly haunting thing : '' I am the wind that wavers , You are the certain land ; I am the shadow that passes Over the sand . ''

		I am the leaf that quivers , You the unshaken tree ; You are the stars that are steadfast , I am the sea . ''

		You are the light eternal , Like a torch I shall die , ... You are the surge of deep music , I but a cry ! ''

		These lines from the long poem ''
Mary Magdalen	PERSON	, '' reflecting the courtesan 's thoughts after the vision has come to her , show how well the writer has mastered the subtleties of blank verse : '' What if my hands be white mine eyes like pools Made deeper by the shade of standing reeds ?

		What if my house be still and beautiful ?

		My slaves as fair and fleet and soft of foot As Aphrodite 's doves ?

		What if I live As long in legend as that Spartan queen For whom a war was made in perished Troy , And whose gold hair shall flame when stars are dark ?

		I care no more to watch the wandering moon Launched like a burning galley in the sky , Or swinging like a lantern through the clouds , And from the even-hour I hide my head . ''

		From the tender and heart-felt tribute '' In Memory of Swinburne , '' we take these two stanzas : '' Not all of
England	LOCATION	's armies , nor her ships , Could leave , as thou , Her language on a million singing lips , Alien till now ; '' And that the land that bore thee leaves unsaid Praise for thy name , And does not lay the laurel o'er thee , dead , Is thy land 's shame . ''

		Mrs.
Alice Corbin Henderson	PERSON	's little book of verse invites such epithets as iridescent , fantastic , and ethereal .

		Her lyrics are not easily reducible to any form of intellectual statement , and their appeal is through music and delicate imagery , sug - gesting not a little the measures of the Celts who have been troubling the poetic waters of late years .

		One of them is frankly styled a `` Reve Celtique , '' a title which these stanzas justify : ' For
Danu	ORGANIZATION	, Lir , and
Cleena	PERSON	with light feet , Who tossed the bubble of the world away .

		And with light laughter , music low and sweet , Covered it over and left it till a day , '' Have vanished with their softly waving spells , Their flame-white dances and bright hair wind-tossed Sadder than deaths the wars of worlds have cost , The keening of the winds in these low dells : `` While we have turned from beauty and have lost Our sense of aneient kinship with the earth , Under the running wave the flaming host Dance in the heart of time and knew no birth . ''

		Sometimes the verses are conceits , as in
Pygmalion	LOCATION	's description of his beloved statue : '' Her waist is the faint horizon Where night and day are drawn , Her low left hip is the twilight , And her right hip is the dawn .

		Her breasts are hills of widsom , And the pale pink rose Of the summit is veiled with marble , Where the color comes and goes , '' or , as in '' Moon of Peace '' : '' Lap me in scented waters , moon of peace , In silver waters flowing under the moon , For now the water-bearer 's pouring flood Pours rivers of silver peace under the moon , The dragon is killed , the archer 's arrow sped , The bearded goat has trampled out the wine , And now the water-bearer 's pouring flood Pours rivers of silver peace and silver wine . ''

		They are very pretty conceits , and their astronomy is not ar fault .

		But we must represent this volume by at least one complete poem , and '' Nodes '' is the one that seems to us the best single example of Mrs.
Henderson	PERSON	's work : '' The endless , foolish merriment of stars Beside the pale cold sorrow of the moon , Is like the wayward noises of the world Beside my heart 's uplifted silent tune . ''

		The little broken glitter of the waves Beside the golden sun s intent white blaze , Is like the idle chatter of the crowd Beside my heart 's unwearied song of praise . ''

		The sun and all the planets in the sky Beside the sacred wonder of dim space , Are notes upon a broken , tarnished lute That God will some day mend and put in place . ''

		And space , beside the little secret joy Of God that sings forever in the clay , Is smaller than the dust we can not see That yet dies not , till time and space decay . ''

		And as the foolish merriment of stars Beside the cold pale sorrow of the moon , My little song , my little joy , my praise , Beside God 's ancient , everlasting rune . ''

		Mrs.
Florence Earle Coates	PERSON	is a poet who is con - tent with the old forms of expression , and who holds fast to the old sanities of thought .

		This alone is much in an age when so many of the followers of the muse are given over to f reakishness , and when originality at any cost is held to be necessary to arrest the atten - tion .

		Mrs.
Coates	PERSON	keeps to the tried and safe ways , and makes her appeal neither by stridency nor eccentricity .

		Sometimes she gives beautiful voice to an abstract idealism , as in the closing page of her new volume , where we find an injunction to '' Dream the Great Dream '' :
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAI , 247 `` Dream the Great Dream , though you should dream you , only , And friendless follow in the lofty quest , Though the dream lead you to a desert lonely , Or drive you , like the tempest , without rest , Yet , toiling upward to the highest altar , There lay before the gods your gift supreme A human heart whose courage did not falter Though distant as Arcturus shone the Gleam .

		`` The Gleam ?

		Ah , question not if others see it , Who nor the yearning nor the passion share ;
Grieve	PERSON	not if children of the earth decree it The earth , itself their goddess , only fair !

		The soul has need of prophet and redeemer : Her outstretched wings against her prisoning bars , She waits for truth ; and truth is with the dreamer , Persistent as the myriad light of stars . ''

		It is love in the high spiritual sense of the mystics and the saints , rather than in the grosser vision of the sensualists , that is enshrined in these verses on `` Eros '' : '' I , who am love , come clothed in mystery , As rose my beauteous mother from the sea , Veiling my luminous wings from mortal sight Whether at noon or in the star-strewn night That I may pass unrecognized and free . ''

		Ignoring them that idly seek for me Unto mine own , from all eternity I come with heart aflame and torch alight I who am Love ! ''

		What bring I them ?

		Ah , draughts that sweeter be Than willing waters of Callirhoe !

		What give I them ?

		Life !

		even in Death 's despite ; And upward still I lead them to the height Of an immortal passion 's purity !

		I who am Love . ''

		Most of the poems in this collection are of the occa - sional class , suggested now by the death of a great man , now by a news-item , now by an intimate personal experience .

		The tendency to moralize is perhaps a little too pronounced , but the idealism is always fine , and the emotional note rich and com - pelling .

		As the title indicates ,
Miss Robinson	PERSON	's `` The Call of Brotherhood and Other Poems '' voices the newly - awakened social conscience of our time , the humani - tarian feeling that is so intense as to be somewhat reckless in the choice of instruments for the attain - ment of its goal .

		`` The Great Question '' Voices the perplexed state of mind of many a worker for the cause of humankind : '' My heart is weary with the world 's distress , The cry of those who struggle in the
night	TIME	.

		Oh !

		Lord , who sent thy Son for our redress , We pray thee as of old ' Let there be light ! '

		I would not ask the ' Why ' nor pierce the veil ; All that I long for is to know , behind The torture , and the terror , and the wail Of human woe , there is no cruel , blind ,
Unreasoning Chance	ORGANIZATION	, that hurls us here and there , Victims of an insensate Tyranny ; I would not ask the Cause , but this my prayer To know there is a Cause for Misery ; Could I but see the working of Thy Hand I should be willing not to understand . ''

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Ripe reflections Contributed originally to a religious on life 's weekly journal , the little essays in minor problems .

		`` Along the Road -LRB- p utna m -RRB- , by Mr.
Arthur Christopher Benson	PERSON	, are not unnaturally devoted largely to questions of conduct , to specula - tions on the great mysteries by which our every-day life is surrounded , and to such personal reminiscences as have a bearing on the spiritual problems that con - front all thoughtful persons throughout life .

		Treat - ing the commonest of daily experiences with the geniality and the insight that lend charm to his dis - cussion of whatever topic , Mr.
Benson	PERSON	here gives his readers a new sense of the height and depth and illimitable richness of existence .

		Ethical questions alternate with glimpses of great men and bits of nature-study and description .

		Such subjects of uni - versal interest as conversation , tactfulness , pride , reading , absent-mindedness , gossip , letter-writing , jealousy , sympathy , and sincerity , form the staple of his well-considered and often suggestive and stimu - lating talk in most of these brief chapters .

		Concern - ing interruptions , for example , he well says that `` there is no form of self-discipline to be compared to that which can be practised by dealing with little tiresome engagements and interviews and interrup - tions in a perfectly tranquil and good-humoured way , giving the whole of one 's attention to the matter in hand , and not allowing the visitor to feel that he is being hurried or that he has intruded . ''

		The fol - lowing is pertinent to the season : `` I do not at all like the languor , about three degrees this side of faintness , which
Keats	PERSON	said was one of the luxuries of
spring	DATE	; I like to be judiciously and temperately frozen , when all that one does is sharp-set and has a keen edge on it . ''

		A story of Alpine experience , which he entitles '' The Face of Death , '' and which describes his narrow escape from falling into a cre - vasse , reminds one of
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's harrowing narrative of `` A Bad Five Minutes in the Alps , '' except that
Stephen	PERSON	's tale is fictitious and covers forty-eight pages , while the other is undoubtedly true , and -LRB- chiefly for that reason -RRB- takes only seven pages in the telling .

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	is thoroughly enjoyable in these latest essays of his , even though they are sometimes in the nature of miniature sermons .

		One of the most voluminous of re - Cent W0rks deali `` S with the ent is Mr.
Lancelot Lawton	PERSON	's `` Empires of the Far East '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		During the period of preparation , two of the three empires dealt with
Korea	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	changed their status ; but the original title was retained and the narrative brought down to
March , 1912	DATE	, while the splendid map shows the Republic of
China	LOCATION	.

		It is difficult to summarize the contents of these bulky volumes .

		The
1571	DATE	pages of text are divided into eighty-four chapters of varying length .

		At least a thousand pages , comprising forty-three chapters , 248 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, are devoted to
Japan	LOCATION	, `` for the reason that she is the first Oriental country within modern history to be accorded a place of front rank among the Powers of the world . ''

		These chapters deal with the geography and history , the administrative , social , economic , financial , and industrial conditions of that empire , the war of
1904-5	DATE	, and the problems of the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		Seven chapters , comprising seventy pages , describe conditions in
Korea	LOCATION	since the Japanese occupation , while an eighth treats of the other colo - nial possessions of
Japan	LOCATION	.


Manchuria	LOCATION	is considered in eighteen chapters of 250 pages , receiving some - what more attention than
China	LOCATION	, which is dealt with in fourteen chapters of 214 pages .

		In the case of
China	LOCATION	the narrative is concerned solely with the reform movement , the recent revolution , and the establishment of the Republic .

		It is difficult also to estimate the value of this elaborate piece of work .

		Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	tells us that `` Hitherto the critics of our allies have been met with the charge of failure to substantiate their statements .

		Consequently I have taken special pains to produce chapter and verse for all that is written . ''

		If this were the case the work might be almost invaluable , but as a matter of fact exact citations are rarely given .

		Such state - ments as '' I have it on the authority of an American Consul '' and `` the notable speech delivered some years ago by Sir
Thomas Sutherland	PERSON	'' hardly consti - tute a citation of `` chapter and verse . ''

		Throughout , Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	is a vigorous critic of the Japanese We learn that `` to
America	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	has become what in
Europe Germany	LOCATION	has so long been to
Great Britain	LOCATION	'' ; that in
Manchuria	LOCATION	`` the policy persistently pursued by the Japanese since the war has been ... one of deception and despoliation '' ; and it is certainly a new interpretation of history to assert that the exclusion policy of the Tokugawas '' was the outcome of a petty and primal arrogance which dictated a savage hatred of other peoples and an ignorant contempt for their ways . ''

		The volumes do contain , however , a great mass of valuable inform - ation concerning the most recent happenings in the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		Folk-tales Ten ^ a ^ es from an old woman , who from the in turn had heard them from her fforff eous East .

		gran dmother , two from an old Brahman , three from an old barber , and from another old Brahman enough more to make twenty - two , such was the farrago offered by the Rev.
Lai Behari Day	PERSON	in his `` Folk-tales of
Bengal	LOCATION	, '' published originally thirty years ago , and now re - issued by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a `` colour-book '' edition , printed on heavy paper in large type and illustrated with no less than thirty-two full-page pictures by Mr.
Warwick Goble	PERSON	.

		Now , the present reviewer admits frankly that he is a lover both of folk-tales and of almost anything Indian , so his judgment may not be quite as trustworthy as he tries to believe ; but to him the book was very wel - come , and its merits seemed to justify fully its reappearance in such a new and elaborate dress .

		Brahmans , and rakshasas , and gold-mohurs ; mar - vellous horses called pakshirajes or kings of birds ; elephants that are king-makers ; the kapila cow that gave milk whenever it was needed ; the hiraman , or green-gem parrot , that '' not only replied intelligently to every question the king put , but recited to him the names of the three hundred and thirty millions of the gods of the hindu pantheon '' ; toontooni eggs that hatch into beautiful maidens ; the boy with the moon on his forehead ; the child suckled by seven mothers ; gardens of heavenly scented flowers ; wonder-working jewels guarded by serpent kings , who would not hear about them all ?

		Then there is the popular life and popular wisdom that always appear in the folk-tale , whether it is told beneath the Bear of the North or the Cross of the South .

		And through every page breathes that haunting spirit of the Orient which attracts an occidental so irresistibly , if it attracts him at all .

		The author vouches for his material in these words : `` I have reason to believe that the stories are a genuine sample of the old , old stories told by Bengali women from age to age through a hundred generations '' ; but a punctilious critic might question whether two or three of the narratives are folk-tales in the strict sense of the word .

		However , neither this point nor a few minor defects need interfere with the pleasure of any reader who has a taste for popular tales and the gorgeous East .

		Character ^ considerable amount of interest building is being manifested throughout the in school .

		educational world to-day in the prob - lem of moral training in the schools .

		Most people seem to think that school children should receive ethical instruction , but there is little agreement respecting the way in which this should be accom - plished .

		The French people have elaborated a course of moral instruction , beginning with the earliest school year and continuing on through the Iyc6e ; but American teachers have not had much confidence in this system , because it has seemed too formal .

		Miss
Jane Brownlee	PERSON	, in her volume en - titled '' Character Building in School '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , presents a method of moral instruc - tion for young children which does not seem as rigid and mechanical as the French system .

		Her methods were worked out in the public schools of
Toledo	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, and they have attracted favorable attention .

		As administered by
Miss Brownlee	PERSON	herself , the sys - tem accomplished a good deal in making her pupils conscious of ethical principles , and observant of these in their daily lives .

		Her plan aims to lead children to form clear and accurate notions regarding the duties of everyday life .

		The teacher is simply a guide to the children in working out ethical prob - lems .

		Miss
Brownlee	PERSON	presents most of the questions which she would ask children on any topic , and in - dicates just how she would guide her pupils to reach sound conclusions in regard to their conduct in daily life .

		This book should be of genuine service to all who have to do with the training of young children .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 249 But if a teacher should attempt to use it as a French instructor often uses his text-book on ethics , it is doubtful if good results would follow .

		The success of a method of this sort depends largely upon the personality and attitude of the teacher .

		The relation between teacher and child must be wholly natural , unaffected , spontaneous .

		The questions must seem to the pupil to come directly out of his daily experi - ence , and not to be thrust upon him from the outside .

		In the hands of a formalist , work of this sort would be as likely to do harm as good .

		It seems to the present reviewer that
Miss Brownlee	PERSON	has included too much in her plan .

		She has tried to cover all the ethical relations of pupils , whereas it would seem better to limit the instruction in the youngest years to those relations which are most prominent in a child 's adjustments to those about him .

		It is prob - ably impossible to build up effective ethical notions about relations which have not yet been assumed , or to think straight about duties beyond the experience of the child at the time he is being instructed .

		Ten women Women as champions of worthy of light and causes are more and more making leading .

		tne j r i n fl uen ce felt , though not always of late in the most womanly manner .

Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	,
Frances E. Willard	PERSON	,
J. Ellen Foster	PERSON	, and Miss
Jane Addams	PERSON	the record being neces - sarily , and fortunately , incomplete in the case of the last-named .

		The volume has been prepared to help meet a demand for `` adequate short biographies of those women who have done the most for the world 's progress during the last century , '' and is designed especially for `` young women of from twelve to thirty , '' as the preface explains .

		A six-page chron - ological table at the end shows interestingly the overlapping and interlocking of the ten lives related , and gives an idea of their connection with some of the great reform movements of the last hundred years .

		In the body of the book , facts and dates and statistics are wisely made subordinate to more gen - eral and more largely significant matters ; but this course has not quite succeeded in avoiding all errors of statement .

		One , at least , arrests attention , in the account of Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	.

		`` In the late sixties , '' we are told , `` Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	watched with the interest of a traveler and a linguist the progress of the
Franco	LOCATION	- Prussian war .

		Her mature conclusion was that the war had been hatched up by politicians for political reasons , without any heat whatever on the part of the soldiers who fought in it .

		The war had been won and lost , and thousands of lives had been snuffed out . ''

		But the war did not begin until the
summer of 1870	DATE	; its first rumblings go back no further than
June	DATE	of that year .

		Moreover , it may be questioned whether Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's interest in the war was primarily that of '' a traveler and a lin - guist . ''

		Portraits of the ten heroines of progress are appropriately inserted , and a short introduction by Mrs.
Ellen M. Henrotin	PERSON	opens the volume .

		A

		evidently recent year , the story of Mrs.
Henry Wade Rogers	PERSON	's experience as an amateur farmer on a small
New Jersey	LOCATION	estate inherited or otherwise acquired from her maternal grandfather is agreeably told . ''

		The Journal of a Country Woman '' -LRB-
Eaton & Mains	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the name she gives to her book .

		It is small , well illustrated , well printed , and fragrant throughout with odors of the farm and the field .

		The Palisades of the Hudson are near by , and the whole environment presents itself as all but ideal for the agricultural experiment entered upon with zest by the writer all the more so because of the manifest sufficiency of material as well as mental resources with which she essays her task .

		Of her conception of the dignity and difficulty of the farmer 's calling , she leaves the reader in no doubt . ''

		In advis - ing my young college friends , '' she says , '' to choose farming as a lifework the God-ordained work for mankind I discriminate , and advise only the specially bright and energetic ones to take it up , the honor men .

		A mediocre man may earn a scanty living in law , medicine , the ministry , or other lines , but he could hardly worry a living out of the soil .

		Brains , energy , and insight must go to make the successful modern farmer . ''

		She might have added capital to the other prerequisites .

		Quotations from
Whitman	LOCATION	,
Gilder	PERSON	, Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	, and other poets and prose-writers appropriately diversify the narra - tive .

		Apparently Mrs.
Rogers	PERSON	is planning to con - tinue the agricultural enterprise so auspiciously begun , even though she is forced to delegate its immediate management to someone else for some months in the winter .

		Hers is a book to make one long for a grand-paternal farm in the beautiful Hudson valley , with a grand-paternal fortune to spend in making it rejoice and blossom as the rose * A book on evolution which says so ethi g really new is by way of being an extraordinary phenomenon , whether regarded from a literary or a scientific standpoint .

		To be sure , much that is novel in the way of fact or principle is being added just now to the sum of knowledge about the factors of evolution ; but such contributions are , in the first instance , almost invariably to be found in some biological journal or the proceedings of some learned society .

		So when a book like Professor
R. E. Lloyd	PERSON	's '' The Growth of Groups in the Animal Kingdom '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- appears , with a mass of new and pertinent facts , analyzed in a critical and unorthodox manner , it constitutes an event worthy of special mention .

		250 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, As a consulting zoologist of the Indian Plague Com - mission , Dr.
Lloyd	PERSON	had the opportunity of examin - ing many thousand rats collected in all parts of
India	LOCATION	through the exterminatory activity of that commis - sion .

		In the course of this examination specimens were found from time to time which differed from all known species of rats in particulars which had been and are used by systematic zoologists as the basis for distinguishing species .

		These findings led Dr.
Lloyd	PERSON	to speculate as to the probable origin of these aberrant groups of rats .

		The present book is the outcome of these speculations .

		It opens with a careful critical discussion of the concept of a natural species .

		The treatment of this perplexing subject is excellent .

		It clearly and convincingly sets forth the essentially artificial and unnatural way in which the problem of species separation and description is handled by practical working taxonomists .

		Having cleared the ground in this way , the author proceeds to describe in detail his own results in regard to the nature , origin , and distribution of new '' groups '' of rats , which one may or may not call `` species '' as he chooses .

		Cogent evidence is adduced to show that these new natural groups arise by mutation , and that natural selection has nothing to do with their origin .

		The concluding chapters are devoted to the discus - sion of the results of similar purport obtained by other workers , and to an exposition of the author 's general philosophy of evolution .

		The book is a sub - stantial contribution to the literature of evolution .

		The human Under the somewhat arresting title of basis of `` Human Quintessence , '' Dr.
Sigurd	PERSON	our life .

		Ibsen -LRB- once premier of
Norway	LOCATION	and a son of the dramatist -RRB- has written a work which even the professional philosophers , into whose pre - serves the author boldly enters , must acknowledge as most suggestive and stimulating , and one which the unprejudiced reader is quite likely to hail as a true and an emancipating book .

		Like many other thinkers and laymen , Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	has tired of the spirit in which , for the
last half century	DATE	, the great problems of human life have been approached .

		Dur - ing that time , some such abstraction from natural phenomena as the struggle for existence or the dogma of utilitarianism , or the dogma that man is nothing but the product of heredity and material environment , has been taken as a starting point , and from it rules of human conduct have been laid down .

		Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	objects to all such criterions of life on the ground that they are artificial .

		We may know , intel - lectually , he says , that we are not the central beings of the universe .

		We may be Copernican in creed .

		But such knowledge has never been emotionalized and made part of our springs of action .

		When we actively live we must do it on a Ptolemaic basis that is to say , we must regard our humanity as the centre of things and always act in reference to that rather than to any extra-human standpoint .

		And the distinctively human thing about us , he further says , is that self-conscious use of reason by which we can mould our destinies as we will .

		Hence he out - lines a social policy that will remind the reader of the social rationalism of the eighteenth century .

		In fact , he frankly avows belief in the '' eighteenth - century belief nowadays so despised that social systems are capable of being reconstructed from the beginning and on a strictly reasonable basis . ''

		It is easy to scoff at such a view as this , but Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	is not alone in trying to resuscitate it , and his book may be cordially recommended as an offset to some of our more uncritical brands of social psychology .

		A gallery of ^ r '
Francis Gribble	PERSON	's busy pen has Devonshire been at work noting down the many worthies .

		illustrious names associated more or less closely with the county of
Devon	LOCATION	, and chroni - cling some of the things said and done by the bearers of those names .

		`` The Romance of the Men of Devon '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is in plan and scope somewhat after the pattern of the same author 's `` Romance of the Oxford Colleges , '' being a chatty and entertaining book abounding in curious informa - tion and anecdote not likely to be already familiar to the reader .

		The great names that any mention of Devonshire calls up are , of course , those of
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	,
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Humphrey Gilbert	PERSON	,
Francis Drake	PERSON	,
John Davis	PERSON	,
Charles Kings	PERSON	- ley ,
James Anthony Froude	PERSON	, and
Richard Blackmore	PERSON	; but there are also many more Devon men of note , such as
Thomas Bodley	PERSON	, the judicious
Hooker	PERSON	,
Miles Coverdale	ORGANIZATION	,
Benjamin Robert Haydon	PERSON	,
John Gay	PERSON	,
Philip Gosse	PERSON	, the naturalist , and his son
Edmund	PERSON	.


Thomas Newcomen	PERSON	receives conspicuous honor at Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	's hands as a
Dartmouth	LOCATION	man and the real inventor of the steam engine ,
James Watt	PERSON	and his bubbling tea-kettle to the contrary notwithstand - ing .

		At the other end of the scale stands
Jack Rattenbury	PERSON	, `` as hard as nails , and an ingenious rascal to boot .

		He hit upon the subtle device of smuggling lace in the interior of disembowelled geese , '' but found in the end that the way of the transgressor is hard .

		Not all the persons so agree - ably mentioned in Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	's pages have very much to do with
Devonshire	ORGANIZATION	, but they help to fill out a readable volume .

		Good illustrations abound , but the index to be expected at the end of such a work is lacking .

		Father
Bernard Vaughan	PERSON	's '' Social - Socialism from ... & .

		.

		the Catholic ism from the Christian standpoint standpoint .

		-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a strange combina - tion of a rigid adherence to the old natural rights philosophy , the advocacy of Jesuit teachings , the frequent and unwarranted use of slang , and the extended glorification of the Church fathers .

		In no way can the book be looked upon as a contribu - tion to the literature of Socialism .

		The author discloses the grossest ignorance concerning not only the more fundamental ideas underlying the socialist movement , but also the developments which have taken place in the fields of philosophy , political science , and economics since the opening of the nineteenth century .

		He declares man to be `` a
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 251 moral being , with inalienable personal rights and an eternal destiny '' ; he maintains that `` God made the family '' and `` established civil society '' ; while he looks upon the
State	ORGANIZATION	, not as `` the output of mere economic conditions '' or as '' the dynamic expression of material evolution , '' but on the contrary as `` a natural institution with well defined rights and duties , limited by the prior rights and duties of the family and of the individual . ''

		Any group of men , or any movement , which looks at these matters from any other viewpoint , is to be condemned most vigor - ously as being detrimental to the welfare of society .

		Destructively , the author attempts to show that So - cialism is '' non-natural , if not unnatural , '' and that it is opposed to religion , the home , and to personal and property rights .

		Life under Socialism `` would be as deadly dull as that seen in a boarding house , a charity school , or a barrack room . ''

		Construc - tively , Father
Vaughan	PERSON	advances the idea that `` if the old Catholic laws about pi'operty , and the obliga - tions attaching to it , were once more brought into general practice , we should find ourselves many mile - stones nearer to a solution of our present-day social problems . ''

		Other than this , he proposes nothing more definite as a Catholic solution of the problem than a `` Triple Alliance '' of `` the Church , the
State	ORGANIZATION	, and Private Initiative , working in harmonious accord . ''

		The scenery In '' Highways and Byways of Som - and records of erset '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Edward Somersetshire	PERSON	.

		Hutton writes with even more than his usual enthusiasm .

		For in
Somerset	LOCATION	was the home of his childhood , and the glamor of the child 's vision still rests upon the land .

		From a neighboring hill-top , he believed it was the world that lay spread out beneath him .

		He saw its cities ,
Bristol	LOCATION	, the port of the sea ; Bath , upon the hills ; Wells , half - hidden in avalley ;
Taunton	LOCATION	, with shining wind-vaned towers .

		Here , on this very hill-top , had the Legion halted ere it went singing on its way to
Rome	LOCATION	.

		There , mysteriously alone , islanded in the evening mist , rose Avalon , where St.
Joseph	PERSON	hid the Grail .

		Beyond , loomed Camelot , very dark and strong , that was
King Arthur	PERSON	's , that saw Guinevere go by , and heard the tumult and the shouting .

		Yonder , in the marsh , lay Athelney that hid
King Alfred	PERSON	, and Wed - more where he curbed the
Danes	LOCATION	.

		It is easy to read between the lines that the author has found it a gracious task to fill in the outlines of his well - remembered vision , to describe the noble archi - tecture of manor and cottage , of cathedral and village church ; to portray the country , often of rare beauty and always of great peace ; to recount the historic associations where the fathers signalled the passing of the Legions , the onset of the Saxons , the retreat of the
Danes	PERSON	, the advance of the Normans , the conn - ing of the Armada .

		Somerset has been one of the least-visited parts of
Southern England	LOCATION	by the tourist .

		But this book will surely tempt many to include the county in their next itinerary .

		One hun - dred drawings by Miss
Nelly Erichsen	PERSON	add much to the charm of the volume .

		The life story The late
William Leroy Broun	PERSON	, for of a Southern the last twenty years of his life presi - educator .

		< jent o f tne
Alabama Polytechnic Institute	ORGANIZATION	, and before that at various times connected with
Vanderbilt University	ORGANIZATION	and
the University of Texas	ORGANIZATION	, was a man who had worked his way up against difficulties that would have discouraged the ordinary youth .

		A brief but impressive account of this struggle and its triumphant issue , with illustra - tive selections from Dr.
Broun	PERSON	's correspondence and public addresses , has been prepared by his brother , Major
Thomas L. Broun	PERSON	, assisted by his daughter ,
Miss Bessie Lee Broun	PERSON	, and his granddaughter , Miss
Sally F. Ordway	PERSON	.

		`` Dr.
William Leroy Broun	PERSON	'' -LRB- Neale -RRB- , as the book is entitled , is really a compila - tion , the compilers holding themselves modestly in the background and allowing other more disinterested observers to tell the story of Dr.
Broun	PERSON	's achieve - ments as Confederate army officer , science teacher , and college president .

		A noteworthy chapter de - scribes a memorable clash between
Alexander H. Stephens	PERSON	and the subject of the biography , with its momentous consequences .

		Dr.
Broun	PERSON	was con - spicuous among the too few well-equipped workers for
Southern	ORGANIZATION	education , and his death in
1902	DATE	at the age of seventy-five removed one whose character and services were held in the highest repute .

		Por - traits of Dr.
Broun	PERSON	, his wife and daughter , and some of
Bis	ORGANIZATION	associates , are given in the book .

		Nine pages of autobiographical notes , especially interesting for their account of school days and early manhood , are inserted near the beginning .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		A dignified library edition of '' The Political Debates between
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	and
Stephen A. Douglas	PERSON	'' has just been published by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		The work is edited by Dr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, who sup - plies it with a historical introduction .

		The Right of the Child to be Well Born , '' by Dr.
George E. Dawson	PERSON	of the
Hartford School of Religions Pedagogy	ORGANIZATION	, is a brief but excellently presented statement of the purpose and possibilities of the eugenics move - ment .

		The discussion of what should be the mutual relations of religion and eugenics is quite the best treat - ment of this fundamentally important phase of the eugenics progaganda which has come to our attention .

Funk & Wagnalls Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- `` Literary Influences in Colonial Newspapers ,
1704	DATE	-
1750	DATE	, '' by Miss
Elizabeth Christine Cook	PERSON	, is a publica - tion of the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss Cook has examined the files of the chief colonial newspapers for the half-century in question , and has made notes upon such portions of their contents as have a literary flavor .

		Nothing of much importance is thus rescued from obliv - ion , but a demonstration is afforded that the newspapers of that period were not altogether without a tincture of letters , and that they were considerably addicted to the reprinting of passages from current English literature , and of framing imitations upon these models .

		Miss Cook 's notes and extracts make very interesting reading .

ANDREW LANG	PERSON	AND OTHERS .

		The thin pamphlet which reports the pro- ceedings of the
Academic Committee of the Royal Society of Literature	ORGANIZATION	, at a meeting held
four months ago	DATE	, offers material of varied inter - est. .

		The chief feature of its contents is a com - memorative address upon the late
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, delivered by Professor
William Paton Ker	PERSON	, a writer of whom it may be said almost in the sense in which it may be said of
Lang	PERSON	, that he touches nothing which he does not adorn .

		`` Learning and the pursuits of literature , '' said the speaker , `` have had many hard things said of them ; but they are essentially honorable , and few men of letters have done more to show this than
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, in two ways particularly in the help he gave so freely to anyone who wanted it , and in his absolutely regardless fashion of working on any question which he took up . ''

		Lang has sometimes been dispraised because he scattered his brilliant powers , instead of coordinating them and con - verging them upon the preparation of a magnum opus .

		But it was of the very essence of his genius to work in this way , and he preferred to attack a subject by a minute critical examina - tion of its separate aspects rather than by a deliberate effort to build it from the ground up in orderly fashion upon a preconceived archi - tectonic plan .

		Thus many of his books are bigger than they seem , simply because they are unconventional in their elaboration .

		His `` Custom and Myth '' is an example .

		It is a collection of popular essays upon a variety of subjects , `` an advance of skirmishers in front of an army '' he called it , but the fire of these skirmishers had a definitely concerted aim , and its effect was to strew the field with slain the - ories , thus preparing it for the occupation of the constructive engineers that would later take possession .

		Speaking of
Lang	ORGANIZATION	's poetry , Professor Ker dwells lovingly upon its lighter or more fanciful aspects , quoting the stanza in which he condoles with
Stevenson	PERSON	on the unenlightened condition of the Samoan Islands : '' There are nae bonny
U. P. Kirks	PERSON	, An awfu ' place ; Nane kens the Covenant o ' Works Frae that o ' Grace . ''

		284 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	He also places stress upon
Lang	PERSON	's love for places , as expressed in these verses on the Tweed : '' Like a loved ghost , thy fabled flood Fleets through the dusky land ; Where
Scott	PERSON	, come home to die , has stood , My feet returning stand . ''

		A mist of memory broods and floats , The Border waters flow , The air is full of ballad notes , Borne out of long ago . ''

		` These verses are too simple and obvious to win anything but scorn from the young priests and vestals of the modern poetic cult , but the speaker is surely right when he says that '' they have their place in the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Fame as surely as any poem by the greater masters . ''

		This tribute to
Lang	ORGANIZATION	is followed by a memo - rial address on the late
A. W. Verrall	PERSON	, spoken by Professor
John William Mackail	PERSON	.

		Verrall 's name is known to every classical scholar , but probably means little to those outside the fold .

		Yet few classical scholars of our time have done so much as he to make the dry bones of scholar - ship live , and that is a service which outweighs many times its volume of pedantry and linguistic achievement .

		It is the sort of service for which
Andrew Lang	PERSON	and Sir
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	in En - gland , Professor
Gildersleeve	PERSON	and Professor
Shorey	PERSON	in this country , have placed us under a debt of deep obligation , because it is the sort of service of which the classics stand in most need .

		As the speaker said ,
Verrall	PERSON	was not one of those who '' move like laborious ghosts , out of the daylight , immersed in a dead world , '' and in praising his memory `` we are not following a grammarian 's funeral . ''

		The following passage gives us the central theme of the tribute which Professor
Mackail	PERSON	was so well qualified by his own precept and practice to pay the dead classicist : '' For him letters , both ancient and modern , were a world crowdedly and intensely alive .

		He brought to the study of the classics of these masterpieces which have been so thumbed and worn by long currency the fresh mind at whose contact they sprang into fresh vitality .

		He brought the same fresh interest and enjoy - ment to English letters and the literary art of his own day .

		To hear him discourse on modern authors was to realise that they were not separated in his mind from the ancient authors among whom he worked profession - ally .

		To both alike he applied the same rapid intelligence , in both alike he felt the same living interest .

		And that was the interest neither of classicism nor of modernism ; it was the interest of literature as a fine art . ''

		It is well to call attention to the work of any man who shows `` how the art of letters can sus - tain and reinforce the art of living ; how com - merce with great writers may and does kindle in their students some corresponding greatness of soul ; and how literature is not a region abstract and apart , but a real thing , the image and in - terpretation of human life . ''

		With all his `` humane impishness '' and super-subtlety , Ver - rall was a scholar who showed us these things ; and because this was his mission , we cherish his memory .

		The contents of our pamphlet close with the remarks made by Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	in award - ing , on behalf of the
Academic Committee	ORGANIZATION	, the Polignac prize for the best work of imaginative literature produced during the preceding twelve - month .

		The award fell to Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	for his poem , '' The Everlasting Mercy . ''

		We are anything but sure that this poem deserved the prize , but it is a pleasure to quote the eloquent words in which Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	stated what he believed to be its claims . ''

		As we read ' The Everlasting Mercy , ' which is a narrative of conversion , a story of the light of God breaking into a dark soul through the cracks which pain and shame have made in it , we feel the mysterious pulse of humanity beating , throbbing all around us .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	takes us away from
Mayfair	PERSON	, and away from Fleet Street , too .

		But not into any remote symbolic province or mystically fabulous No-man 's land .

		We stand with him among the familiar inland English hills , in fields where Piers Plowman might have walked or
Bunyan	PERSON	prayed , and the robust voice of the new poet , like those of all the earlier singers and yet unlike them all , chants to us of the meaning of daily life , and of God 's insistent call to human frailty . ''

		We have taken this pamphlet as the subject of an article because we believe thoroughly in the importance of such bodies as the
Royal Society of Literature	ORGANIZATION	, in their implied functions of upholding standards , of crowning distin - guished work , and of memorializing the great who pass away .

		They may at times be mistaken in their judgments , but they stand for the acad - emic idea , which never more than at the present day needs to be upheld in all the fine arts .

		The flood of the bizarre in poetry , painting , music , and the other arts threatens more than ever before to tear us from our aesthetic moorings and set us adrift upon uncharted seas .

		And we are very sceptical of the notion that those seas are lik ; ly to disclose strange new worlds to our view .

		Their expanses are more likely to reveal impassable ice barriers than visioned mounts of purification .

		And , applying the lesson to our own country , we are glad that we have , in the
National Institute of Arts and Letters	ORGANIZATION	, a body corresponding to the
Royal Society of Litera	ORGANIZATION	- ture , a body to which the nation may look alike for warning and for guidance , in confidence that while it will prove all things artistic , it will con - tinue to hold fast to that which is good .

		THE DIAL 285 THE PROBLEM OF BAUDELAIRE .

		i .

		The history of literature is rich in grimly humor - ous coincidence .


Charles Baudelaire	PERSON	, who translated into French the works of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	, hated
America	LOCATION	for its failure to appreciate his idol .

		In his judgment
America	LOCATION	was '' a great gas-lit barbar - ism , '' and it is perhaps a bit of poetic justice that to-day , when on the Continent and even in
England	LOCATION	'' Les Fleurs du Mai '' holds a large place in the his - tory of modern poetry , few Americans know the very name of Baudelaire .

		There is , to be sure , a wide gulf between his talent and our canon of taste , a gulf so wide that this poet can not be read in the schools .

		And French authors whose works are not read in the schools have for us scarcely more than a legendary existence , thin and unsubstantial as that of ghosts in the Elysian Fields .

		Is this fact due to our literary press ?

		Let us consult
Poole	ORGANIZATION	and the periodical indexes .

		Between
1881	DATE	and the end of
1912	DATE	, while scores of studies on Baudelaire were being published in
Europe	LOCATION	, we find on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	only Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	's essay .

		I am aware , certainly , of the role of the American magazine as mentor of adolescence .

		But the existence of `` Les Fleurs du Mai '' is now a fact of literary history , and on the whole a rather important fact .

		A single essay in twenty years !

		And even its occurrence loses in significance when we add that it was written , not by a professional scholar but by a musical critic , an American who had learned in
Paris	LOCATION	a larger cosmopolitanism and a tolerance perhaps too undiscriminating .

		With characteristic enthusi - asm , Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	proposed to demolish the '' Legend of Baudelaire . ''

		But his study , * unfortunately , pre - sented only one side of the question , its evidence being taken from
Baudelaire	LOCATION	's friends
Crepet	PERSON	and
Gautier	PERSON	.

		A dithyramb of praise , it is really an attempt to make a saint out of a sinner .

		And , with all due appreciation of the discovery that Baudelaire '' wrote a Latin hymn to Saint
Francis	PERSON	, '' one finds it hard to admit that '' at heart he was a believer , '' and it is to be feared that the critic places too much emphasis upon the '' hymn '' in question - !

		further - more , why quote '' Pacem summum tenent '' ?

		Is it to bring out the singular nature of the subject ?

		This unique essay , however , may have had its effect .

		In any case ,
1913	DATE	, already an annus mira - bilis , has given us in one short month not only Professor
Marinoni	PERSON	's admirable article , !

		but a crit - ical study an English production which , by its mere bulk and the range of its quotations , indicates to even the casual eye the importance which this poet must henceforth assume in the history of liter - ature .

		A tall octavo of nearly three hundred pages , Mr.
Turquet-Milnes	PERSON	's '' Influence of Baudelaire in * Published in `` Scribner 's Magazine , ''
February , 1909	DATE	.

		t See `` Les Fleurs du Mai , '' LXII. , Franciscae meae laudes , and the
Notice	ORGANIZATION	, p. IN .

		I In `` The Sewanee Review , ''
January , 1913	DATE	.


France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, '' * considers , not merely his descendants in literature on both sides of the Chan - nel , but the poet himself , with his relations to
Poe	PERSON	, Sainte-Beuve ,
Gautier	PERSON	,
Aloysius Bertrand	PERSON	, and Pt - rus
Borel	PERSON	.

		Some of these chapters are extremely in - teresting , and the last two names will certainly be new to English readers .

		In
France	LOCATION	,
Baudelaire	ORGANIZATION	's posterity numbers Villiers de PIsle
Adam	PERSON	,
Barbey d'AureVilly	ORGANIZATION	,
Verlaine	PERSON	,
Huysmans	PERSON	, and Mallarme ^ together with the less known figures of Corbiere ,
Rollinat	LOCATION	,
Samain	LOCATION	, and
Laforgue	PERSON	.

		In
England	LOCATION	we find , with a few minor poets ,
Swinburne	LOCATION	, O'Shaugh - nessy , and
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	.

		America , too , by the way , has produced at least one volume of Baudelairian verse , the `` Book of Jade , '' published anonymously some ten years ago .

		So perhaps it may be interesting to revert to this curious poet , who pushes to a singular perversity a certain tendency in all Romanticism .

		n. Even from its beginning the French Romantic school , confident as it was that it had superseded Classicism and set up in its stead a living ideal , con - tained the germ of the malady which was eventually to prove its own destruction .

		Romanticism revealed to the world the secret of a new beauty the Beauty of the Personal ; but with that interest was involved , implicit and inevitable , the element of curiosity .

		Now curiosity may take a more or less objective expression , as in Hugo 's use of the grotesque ; or the mind may turn its scalpel upon itself , as in most of
Rousseau	ORGANIZATION	's descendants from `` Rene '' '' and S ^ nancour to
Alfred de Vigny	ORGANIZATION	and Sainte-Beuve .


Theophile Gautier	PERSON	, preoccupied as he was with plastic beauty , reveals in a great deal of his early verse this morbid curiosity , but it reaches its height , set over against the love of Beauty as in
Gautier	LOCATION	, yet fascinated at the same time by the ugly and the macabre , in the poetry of
Charles Baudelaire	LOCATION	.

		A true son of the Romanticists in his exasperated sensibility , this poet expiated the excesses of two generations of lyrical egoism .

		Temperamentally , Baudelaire is related to three French Romanticists , the Vigny of the Mo'ise , the Sainte-Beuve of the Poesies and Volupte , and the
Gautier	PERSON	of the Comedie dela mort and the Albertus .

		\ His first characteristic is a neurasthenic sensibility , exasperated by excess and the habit of self-analysis .

		This manifests itself even in his childhood , and his memories of daily strolls taken with his father among the statues of the
Luxembourg	LOCATION	Garden are no less significant than his boyish suffering at the time of his mother 's second marriage .

		So we find him moody and misunderstood in his life at school , hat - ing its routine as he hated his step-father at home .

		*
New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		t A deeper analysis , of course , would trace this whole aspect of Romanticism back to
Chateaubriand	LOCATION	.

		The morbid egoism of Ren6 , the Satanic lyricism of
Atala	PERSON	's dying speech , and the brutality of cruelly realistic detail throughout '' Les
Natchez	LOCATION	'' -LRB- especially in the battle-scenes -RRB- , all foreshadow Baudelaire .

		This relationship is not noted by Mr.
Turquet	PERSON	-
Milnes	PERSON	.

		286 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	Sick and overstrung , the revelation of life seems to have come to him as a series of shocks , moral catastrophes which , in a nature not strong enough to react healthily , left a morbid desire to shock the world in its turn .

		Here , too , as has been suggested in the case of Prosper Me ` rime'e , we may have the explanation of Baudelaire 's impassibility and his dandyism , and perhaps , also , of that very pose of Satanic paradox which Me ` rime'e himself , at times , used as a mask against the
Philistine	LOCATION	.

		A neuras - thenic type , he felt moreover the fascination of shock - ing , and the truculence or brutality which marked his conversation and a part of his literary product is , properly considered , not merely a paroxysm of revolt against convention , but an index of a pathological condition .

		Those who believe that
Baudelaire	PERSON	was all '' pose '' should read his letters and his journal .

		Turning now to the dedication of `` Les Fleurs du Mai , '' we find a lyrical presentation of his atti - tude a poem describing the sufferings of the artist , doomed to misunderstanding and contempt , in a world of the bourgeois .

		Yet this conviction does not make Baudelaire entirely a stoic or a hermit , except in moments of absolute nervous revulsion .

		Like
Gautier	PERSON	, he is one for whom the visible world exists ; like Vigny , he feels the poet 's solitude , so well expressed in his predecessor 's Mo'ise .

		More of a hedonist than Vigny , he is both charmed and repelled by the world without ; and there is something char - acteristic in the description , recorded , I believe , by
Asselineau	ORGANIZATION	, of one of Baudelaire 's early studios .

		Over the lower half of his window the poet had drawn a heavy curtain , but in that window , looking out only on the sky and the passing clouds -LRB- compare the first of the Prose-poems -RRB- , stood a vivarium filled with curious reptiles .

		The anecdote is certainly suggestive .

		All of Baudelaire is revealed in it ; his de-humanized idealism and his fascination with the grotesque , his love of solitary revery and that morbid curiosity which craves its stimulant even in moments of seclusion .

		A thorough hedonist , a seeker of impressions for their own sake , Baudelaire loved all the arts , more especially the plastic arts of form and color .

		In his Salon de
1846	DATE	, he showed that he was an art-critic of no mean order .

		Like
Gautier	PERSON	, he attempted to transpose the arts ; and some of his poems are fashioned like statuettes of metal or stone .

		His very ideal of poetic beauty is the sculptor 's , as we may see in his sonnet to Beauty : '' Je suis belle , 6 mortels , comme un re `` ve de pierre , Et mon sein , oil chacnn s ` est meurtri tour k tour , Est fait pour inspirer au poete un amour Eternel et muet ainsi que la matiere . ''

		Je trone dans 1 ` azur comme un sphinx incompris J'unis un coeur de neige k la blancheur des cygnes , .

		Je hais le mouvement qui d ^ place les lignes Et jamais je ne pleure et jamais je ne ris . ''

		Thus , with
Gautier	PERSON	,
Baudelaire	PERSON	is the real ancestor of the Parnassian poets .

		Of painting he says -LRB- notably in the midst of a generation of realists -RRB- , '' Pas de grande peinture sans de grandes pense'es '' ; yet he admits also the art that is purely decorative , a pendant to his love of the arabesque in ornament and the rococo in architecture .

		In music his cham - pionship of
Wagner	PERSON	, at that time , at least proves that Baudelaire always had the courage of his artistic convictions .

		And when he speaks of the windows of a certain cathedral , `` coloured with the intense colours with which a profound temperament invests all the objects of life , '' he is , in fact , only describing his own attitude .

		A preternatural quickness to sensation , an almost clairvoyant keenness of impres - sion , responsive to melody , color , and perfume , and with this a sense of the mystery of beauty , gave to Baudelaire in poetry something of the quality that
Delacroix	PERSON	and
Moreau	PERSON	attained in painting .

		Some of his poems , it is true , have been compared to `` moonlight shining on a dung-heap , '' and fully deserve the comparison .

		But , in the main , it is the moonlight that prevails .

		Of course the poetic expression of such a talent , at once curious and introspective , will often be sensu - ous , and even consciously sensuous , as in the hero of Sainte-Beuve 's novel .

		The soul bent back upon itself , always seeking within that ultimate Beauty of which the expression just eludes its grasp , suffers an exhaustion of spirit which turns in reaction to the pursuit of physical pleasure .

		Hence the sensu - ousness exhibited by many of the Romantic poets , often confused with their idealism as in the glare of an overwhelming `` illumination . ''

		So with
Baude	PERSON	- laire , as with not a few others , life is reduced to the double service of Art and Love -LRB- `` Le Ranon '' -RRB- , and woman , in whom his sensual egotism sees nothing but a Delilah , becomes in turn his goddess and his evil genius , or by a refinement of perversity which reveals his neurasthenia , goddess and demon at the same time . ''

		Je t ` adore a l' e `` gal de la voute nocturne , O vase de tristesse , O grande taciturne , Et t ` aime d'autant plus , belle , que tu me fuis , Et que tu me parais , ornement de mes nuits , Plus ironiquement accumuler les lieues Qui apparent mes bras des immensite 's bleues . ''

		From Love , as from Art itself , he asks but a moment of forgetfulness .

		`` One must ever be drunken , '' he says in one of his prose-poems : '' One must ever be drunken .

		Everything is in that ; it is the only question .

		In order not to feel the horrible burden of Time that is breaking your shoulders , bending you earth - wards , you must be ceaselessly drunken . ''

		But with what ?

		With wine , poetry or virtue , as you will only intoxicate yourself ; and if sometimes , on the steps of a palace , on the green sward of a grave , or in the mournful solitude of your room you wake to find the intoxi - cation diminished or vanished , ask of the wind , or the wave , or the star , or the bird , or the clock ... ask what time it is ; and the wind , wave , star , bird , and clock will tell you : ' It is time to be drunken . '

		Lest you should be the martyred slaves of Time , be ceaselessly drunken !

		with wine , poetry , or virtue , as you will . ''

		III .

		The Anglo-Saxon ideal is to measure life by action , by accomplishment , by moral or intellectual activity .

		For Baudelaire , life was a matter of artistic emo - tions , a service of the senses , a matter of moods .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 287 Nowhere else in literature is this attitude exempli - fied so completely .

		For such a nature there is no development ; Baudelaire never reached that stage in which the life of the intellect detaches itself , rises supreme from the early tyranny of sense and feel - ing .

		Indeed his very thoughts take their color from his moods , and he is so lacking in convictions that he can '' conceive how one may desert a cause for the sake of testing the joys of fighting on the oppo - site side . ''

		He is a creature of moods , uncontrolled by an intellectual or ethical norm , and being a poet , he is necessarily a poet of moods .

		It is this that made him one of the favorite authors of `` Young
France	LOCATION	'' of a generation since , full of contrasted impulse and lacking as it was in religious or philosophical bases .

		For no one has noted so surely as Baudelaire , or with so keen and felicitous a touch , the curious return upon itself , the mordant ennui that sooner or later seizes upon him who lives entirely to his moods and impressions .

		Moods and sensations for their own sake is the aim of his art , always the attempt to seek out and fix a new impres - sion , to define a new substratum of feeling .

		The poet 's part in life , as he conceives it , is not merely that of an observer but an experimentalist , and his ends are always egotistic .

		But where a Goethe , with his objectivity and his power of intellectual detach - ment , could realize such a life ,
Baudelaire	LOCATION	, deficient in will and character , was forced to pay the price .

		In truth , life seems opposed to the very theory of the hedonist ; one can never re-live an impression .

		Only too soon , for Baudelaire , came the time when the first fine response to life was lost , when the freshness of youth had left him , as the sun sinks behind the horizon in '' Le Coucher du Soleil Romantique . '' ''

		Mais je poursuis en vain le Dieu qui se retire ; L'irre ` sistible nuit e ` tablit son empire ,
Noire	LOCATION	, humide , funeste , et pleine de frissons .

		Une odeur de tombeau dans les te ` nebres nage , Et mon pied peureux froisse , au bord du mare ` cage , Des crapauds impreVus et de froids limagons . ''

		This , then , is the result of his artistic impressionism . ''

		Le Printemps adorable a perdu son odeur . ''

		And now , of course , it is too late to escape from self in the objective intellectual world , and the poet must go on to the end as he has begun , unable to break the chains of sensibility or to rise above it .

		So it was that
Baudelaire	PERSON	, eager to lose himself again in the tense emotions of youth , was drawn more and more toward those morbid moods , unnat - urally stimulated by wine and opium , that he had at first cultivated only through revolt or curiosity .

		4 ' Les charmes de 1 ` horreur n'enivrent que les forts ! ''

		he cries ; but we are not deceived by this self - glorification ; it is evident that his pursuit of the brutal , of the perverse , and of the macabre came to be his only escape from boredom .

		The poet is caught in a spiritual impasse , and the Furies are gaining upon his slackening steps .

		And here and there , in an image that palpitates with an insanity of realism , his poems reveal the disease of the nerves which foreshadows the end .

		It is a sombre spiritual tragedy that we read between the lines of `` Les Fleurs du Mai . ''

		His ennui becomes a chimera : it is the dragon that besets his life -LRB- Preface -RRB- .

		He comes to envy the dull stupidity of the brute world -LRB- xxxi . -RRB-

		; he longs for death with a depth of feeling that recalls the Middle Ages .

		And after the desperate invocation which ends the volume , after the cry which con - cludes one of his prose-poems , we feel that , at the worst , death could hardly transfer his spirit to a darker hell .

		`` N'importe ou , '' he cries , echoing
Poe	PERSON	, '' n ' importe ou , hors du monde ! ''

		Anywhere out of the world !

		Never was moral clearer .

		Each for himself , men forge their dreams of life , but no palace of art or pleasure was ever reared with walls high enough to keep the spectre of ennui outside .

		His will atrophied by introspec - tion and inaction , he found himself a prisoner in a self-created dungeon , bestridden by his chimera as by the Old Man of the Sea .

		Again and again he tried to break his bonds we catch a glimpse of the struggle in his letters and diary , but it was too late .

		The self-reproaches of his sterile genius , rendered more powerless by the clutches of his vice , the tortures of a vision which he could not realize , were added to his punishment .

		So , when scarcely nine years after the publication of his volume of poems , he fell , stricken with paralysis and aphasia , on the steps of one of those old churches which he loved to study , we may be sure that
Baudelaire	PERSON	had descended to the lowest depths of the spiral reached the bottom of the Inferno , which , a new Dante of the Perverse , he had discovered in the recesses of his own soul .

		And that curious tomb of his at
Paris	LOCATION	, against the wall in the
Cimetiere Montparnasse	LOCATION	, that tomb where , immortalized in marble , Baudelaire lies beneath the brooding eye of a marble Lucifer , recalls in horrible symbolism his long death agony , the bed of pain whereon he awaited Death for eighteen months , motionless and speechless , a spirit prisoned in a living corpse .

		AN INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION OF THE BOOK INDUSTRY AND THE GRAPHIC ARTS is planned for the
summer of 1914	DATE	by the
Deutscher Buchgewerbe	PERSON	- verein , in celebration of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	for the Graphic Arts and the Book Industry , at
Leipzig	LOCATION	.

		Under the patronage of the
King of Saxony	ORGANIZATION	, and with an
Honorary Committee	ORGANIZATION	of one hundred and forty men of note , mostly Germans , this interesting exposition of the art of book-printing , book-illustrat - ing , book-binding , etc. , will open its doors , it is expected , about the middle of
May	DATE	, and close them about the end of
October	DATE	.

		A spacious plot of ground in the suburbs of the book city has been offered by the city fathers for the occasion , and city and king - dom have appropriated two hundred thousand marks each to defray expenses .

		The exhibits , as now 288 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	planned , group themselves under sixteen heads , thus denominated : Free graphic arts ; applied graphic arts ; instruction in the industries of the book trade ; paper manufacture ; the working-up of paper ; manu - facture of colors ; photography ; technics of repro - duction ; letter-cutting , type-founding , and allied trades , stereotypy and electrotypy ; printing process ; bookbinding ; publishing , retail and commission book-trading ; newspaperdom and intelligence de - partment , methods of advertising and canvassing ; library business , bibliography , bibliophilism , and collections ; machinery , apparatus , materials and im - plements for the entire printing industry ; measures for the protection and benefit of the work-people .

		In the library section will be illustrated the fitting-up of libraries , with library plans , views , furniture , catalogues , etc. ; also public libraries and reading - rooms will have a special sub-section to themselves , as will bibliography and amateur printing and poster-collections , ex libris , and stamps all these coming under Group 14 in five sub-sections or classes .

		In the words of the prospectus , `` Each group is to be introduced by a historical and a technical instruc - tive department , whereby laymen will be stimulated and encouraged .

		The development and the position in the history of civilization of the various branches of the book industry will be clearly demonstrated , and the technical stages of each process will be shown in a way suited to the general intelligibility .

		An ethnographical section will be devoted to the products of primitive peoples .

		Workshops in going order , models and apparatus for demonstrating purposes , and cinematograph performances are to stimulate the interest of experts and general public in equal degree . ''

		THE RECENT PERFORMANCES OF BRIEUX 'S `` IiES A VARIES '' in
New York	LOCATION	, under the management of Mr.
Richard Bennett	PERSON	, backed by the '' Medical Review of Reviews '' Sociological Fund , attracted a tremendous and largely legitimate interest .

		How far they advanced the definite aim of those who were instrumental in getting the play produced , the enactment of a Federal law which shall forbid marriage without certificates of good health from both parties , only time can tell .

		Certainly no speech received quite so much applause as the doctor 's arraignment of the old notary for investigating his prospective son-in-law 's financial and moral standing , and asking nothing about his physical health ; but the applause at this point may prove only that the audience knew why it had been asked to hear the play .

		Whatever one may think about the advisa - bility of producing `` Les Avarie 's '' the English version is entitled '' Damaged Goods '' it can not be denied that this particular presentation was conducted with dignity and seriousness , and was admirably acted throughout , so that full justice was done to both the dramatic and the sociological values of
Brieux	ORGANIZATION	's play .

		The special public who witnessed the performances by virtue of their con - nection with the Sociological Fund found it highly engrossing and impressive , and paid the actors gen - erous tribute of enthusiastic and grateful applause .

		The text of the play is familiar to readers of modern drama in the original or in Mr.
Pollock	PERSON	's translation .

		It is , of course , a masterpiece of `` thesis drama , '' an argument , dogmatic , insistent , inescapable , cumulative , between science and com - mon sense , on one side , and love , of various types r on the other .

		It is what Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	has called a '' drama of discussion '' ; it has the splendid movement of the best
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	plays , unrelieved and undiluted by Shavian paradox , wit , and irony .

		We imagine that many in the audiences at the Fulton Theatre were astonished at the play 's showing of sheer strength as acted drama .

		Possibly it might not interest the general public ; probably it would be inadvisable to present it to them .

		But no thinking person , with the most casual interest in current social evils , could listen to the version of
Richard Bennett	PERSON	,
Wilton Lackaye	PERSON	, and their associates , without being gripped by the power of
Brieux	ORGANIZATION	's message .

		THE DEATH OF TWO COEVAL ENGLISH AUTHORS ,
William Hale White	PERSON	-LRB- `` Mark Rutherford '' -RRB- and
Thomas Hodgkin	PERSON	, brings regret to all who have admired the sterling qualities in each of these workers in different but not unrelated branches of literature .

		Dr.
Hodgkin	PERSON	's birth-year is given as
1831	DATE	, and Mr.
White	PERSON	's as `` about
1830	DATE	, '' which will make the foregoing adjective '' coeval '' sufficiently apposite .

		Few readers of the noteworthy trilogy of novels , '' The Autobiography of
Mark Rutherford	PERSON	, '' ''
Mark Rutherford	PERSON	's Deliverance , '' and '' The Rev - olution in
Tanner	PERSON	's Lane , '' have known the author otherwise than by his pseudonym , and as ''
Mark Rutherford	PERSON	'' he will still continue to be known .

		His stories were really studies of social , domestic , and religious questions , and their appeal was to the thoughtful , not to those who read for mere amuse - ment .

		His later works of fiction , ''
Miriam	PERSON	's Schooling , '' ''
Catherine Furze	PERSON	, '' and '' Clara Hop - good , '' have won less notice than the first three .

		His biography of
Bunyan	PERSON	, in the '' Literary Lives '' series , his '' Pages from a Journal '' and '' More Pages from a Journal '' are the chief of his later productions .

		It is to be noted that his adoption of authorship as a calling came about largely in con - sequence of his expulsion from the Congregational ministry for his views on inspiration .

		Dr.
Hodgkin	PERSON	, like
Grote	PERSON	a banker and a historian , attained by his ''
Italy	LOCATION	and her Invaders '' -LRB- eight volumes published at the time of his death -RRB- considerably less fame than did
Grote	PERSON	with his twelve volumes of Greek history , the popularity of which was such that twelve hun - dred copies of the final volume were sold in one week ; but the literary art and the large grasp of his subject shown by the later historian were of no mean order .

		Dr.
Hodgkin	PERSON	was of
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	antecedents , and his own dignified bearing and simple habits
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 289 were in harmony with the traditions of the
Society of Friends	ORGANIZATION	.

		The two men here bracketed together seem to have had in common a deep religious seri - ousness and interest in the ethical aspects of things .

		POETRY AS A VOCATION of a bread-winning , life - sustaining character has been followed by compar - atively few ; as an agreeable and harmless avocation it has been embraced by many .

		Just now public attention is turned toward Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	as an example of one who has succeeded in making poetry his servant , as a provider of material necessities , as well as his mistress .

		From the day he left
Oxford	LOCATION	to the present time his verses have been commercially successful , and also successful in a far higher sense .

		No such experience has he known as that so amus - ingly recorded by Mr.
Yoshio Markino	PERSON	, who high - heartedly bade farewell to
Japan	LOCATION	and turned his face toward the New World '' with a hope to become a poet or a writer in English , '' only to meet with speedy disappointment .

		`` I had to make livelihood , '' he tells us , '' by washing windows and dishes , or a little better thing , making sets of false teeth for some dentists . ''

		Another and a more confident aspirant to poetic distinction -LRB- and the attendant emoluments -RRB- was little
Mary Antin	PERSON	from
Polotsk	LOCATION	in
Russia	LOCATION	, who has told us all about her coming to
Boston	LOCATION	at twelve years of age , and the enthusiasm with which she adopted
America	LOCATION	to be henceforth her own country .

		Of her early hopes and plans she writes : '' As I understood it , my business was to go to school , to learn everything there was to know , to write poetry , become famous , and make the family rich .

		Surely it was not shirking to lay out such a programme as that .

		I had boundless faith in my future .

		I was certainly going to be a great poet ; I was certainly going to take care of the family . ''

		Still another instance , this time a more conspicuous one in the world of letters , comes to mind .

		When
Thomas Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	entered his uncle 's commis - sion house in
Pearl Street	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, his real life was not passed in the brokerage business , but was lived in the little back hall bedroom on the third floor of his boarding-house in
Clinton Place	LOCATION	, where he collected Japanese fans , meditated high themes in poetry , and , as he says , wrote '' a lyric or two '' every day before going down town .

		And when , one red-letter day , the editor of ``
Harper	PERSON	's '' accepted a poem and paid him fifteen dollars for it , he could not refrain from publishing the glad tidings in his uncle 's office .

		`` Why do n't you send the d d fool one every day ? ''

		was that thrifty person 's re - joinder .

		But the poet in
Aldrich	LOCATION	was proof against scoffs and jibes , as it ever will be in him whose eyes are fixed on Parnassus .

		THE REGENERATION OF LEISURE through the establishment of civic theatres , indoor and outdoor , was the subject of a recent address by Mr.
Percy MacKaye	PERSON	at
Smith College	ORGANIZATION	, in the town distinguished by the possession of a highly successful civic theatre which his own cordial encouragement helped to establish .

		The refining of popular amusements was urged by the speaker as one of the needs of the age .

		The civic theatre would substitute the habit of filling time for that of killing time , and under its lead social evils might be made to give place to cooperative pleasures .

		`` Finally , '' declared the speaker , `` it should succeed in making commercial playhouses appear tawdry ... Outdoor theatres deserve atten - tion ; most of them are privately owned at present , but a recollection of the glory of the Greek outdoor theatre shows what they can do .

		The success of the one at
Berkeley	LOCATION	,
Cal.	LOCATION	, has been notable .

		The public park of every city should have one .

		The workers in the theatre should join with the city to form committees to advance the regeneration of leisure .

		In the civic theatre puppet-shows will live again , and the pantomime exemplified by '
Sumurun	PERSON	' will have its part .

		Here the lyric poet will regain his lost right of appeal to an audience rather than to an individual .

		There may be a revival of the old-time art of masques , so valuable for their influ - ence on large numbers at once ; these , too , are best given outdoors .

		Redemption of leisure by art may take the course of a return to symbolism and renewed use of ancient nature symbols . ''

		The open-air pageant whose revival has of late met with encouraging favor is in harmony with this scheme of wholesome and refining recreation , and was com - mended by Mr.
MacKaye	PERSON	.

		Amusement is , indeed , as he expressed it , `` one of the mightiest positive forces in
America	LOCATION	.

		Art is self-government at its highest .

		It has only begun to give articulate ex - pression to the vast modern revulsion of ideas now in process of growth , and its future rests with the people . ''

		... MAKING THE BOOK READY FOR THE READER , classifying and cataloguing and labelling it , some - times costs more than the price of the book itself , as all librarians very well know .

		It is estimated that the public libraries of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	alone are spending half
a million dollars	MONEY	yearly in making their stores of literature readily available for the most advantageous use .

		The
State Library	ORGANIZATION	at Bos - ton , numbering about three hundred thousand vol - umes , is at present undergoing expert treatment at the hands of cataloguers , at a cost of
five thousand dollars	MONEY	a year , the work to continue probably eight years or five years if an annual expenditure of eight thousand dollars should be authorized .

		The catalogue is , of course , to be of the card form , the only convenient shape in which a catalogue can be kept up to date .

		At
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	the old card catalogue is being transformed into a printed card catalogue of uniform character throughout , this change meaning a cost of forty or forty -
five cents	MONEY	per volume cata - logued ; and even at that rate the printers are com - plaining that there is little or no profit in the job for them .

		Mr.
Charles J. Babbitt	PERSON	, the library expert now engaged in cataloguing the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	, is quoted as estimating the cost of a type-written cata - logue for that library as
eleven cents	MONEY	for each book 290 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	treated ; but , on the other hand , the librarian of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	is said to question whether so small an expenditure will cover the cost of a good card cata - logue .

		At any rate , amid all the agreements and disagreements of the learned librarians , it is safe to say that the purchase price of a book represents much less of its real cost to the public library than one person in a thousand ever suspects .

		A HUNDRED YEARS OF GRIMM 's FAIRY TALES have not outworn their popularity .

		On the con - trary , their fame has spread amazingly from the day of their publication .

		English was the first foreign language into which they were translated , and no one knows in how many others they are now current .

		Those of us who were brought up on `` Hansel and Gretel '' and the rest of the fascinating tales will never find anything in narrative form to fetter the interest as did those nursery stories of long ago .

		Professor
Erich Schmidt	PERSON	has been celebrating their centennial in the
Deutsche Rundschau	ORGANIZATION	, reminding us again of the varied and often obscure sources from which they were drawn , and paying tribute to the mastery of simple , idiomatic German displayed by the two brothers who so diligently labored in collecting and preserving them .

		From old peasant women , especially the `` cattlewife of Schwelm , '' of marvellous memory , from
Maria	LOCATION	the sewing girl , and from
Dorothea Wild	PERSON	, whom
Wilhelm Grimm	PERSON	later took to wife , many of these folk tales were gathered and put into literary form .

		The Cobbler of
Nuremberg	LOCATION	,
Hans Sachs	PERSON	, is ultimate authority for others , and old jest-books and mediaeval Latin poems were drawn upon for still other of these homely narratives .

		In fact , the net was spread wide , and all sorts of waifs and strays were gathered in , to be immortalized with the touch of genius at the hands of the brother collectors .

		In the tales , virtue is rewarded , vice is punished , and true lovers made happy , in a way never other than satisfying to the unspoilt juvenile taste .

		Now and then a sly stroke of humor gives variety , but rather puzzles than pleases the literal-minded child reader as at the end of one story where it is printed , `` Anybody that does not believe this tale must pay a dollar , '' a com - mand that is said to have brought one unbelieving but strictly honest little maiden to the door of the brothers
Grimm	PERSON	with a thaler in her small hand .

		She was as upright and downright as is the manner of most of these homely but entrancing tales .

		SHORT CUTS TO A LEARNED PROFESSION are commonly to be mistrusted , and our State laws are more and more making them impossible .

		Among learned professions no librarian would hesitate to include his own , to which , with all our library schools and their two-year and three-year courses , short cuts are not unknown .

		It is probably well that the subordinate positions in library work should be open to apprentices of little or no technical training , and it may also be well that even the head librarian - ship should be not beyond the reach of the born librarian unequipped with a library-school diploma .

		Of the many libraries now conducting training classes for the filling of vacancies in their own service , that at
Detroit	LOCATION	has recently called our attention to its activities in this field .

		Its apprentice class receives ten months ' instruction , no fees re - quired , and its members become `` eligible to serve as substitutes at the end of the first month , and in this manner have an opportunity to earn some part of their support .

		After the final examination those who prove acceptable during the course are eligible to appointment to the regular staff . ''

		The formal instruction is limited to one hour five times a week , and does not pretend to take the place of regular training-school instruction , though it `` covers in a general way the curriculum of such a school , with a special view of meeting local needs , '' and the subjects to which most careful attention are given include `` cataloguing , reference work , children 's work , book selection , book ordering , and trade bibliography . ''

		In existing conditions the appren - tice class has an indisputable place .

		OUR PLETHORA OF WORDS , as evidenced by the ponderous tomes of the great
Oxford Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, now in the letter T and progressing majestically toward `` zygosis '' and `` zyxomma , '' causes dis - quietude in some breasts .

		Are we pruning the luxuriant growth of our vocabulary as we ought ?

		Should every foreign term that falls lightly from the tongue or pen of him who is too indolent to search for its native equivalent be naturalized before the completion of a long term of residence among us ?

		To take a familiar instance , has the French word for `` ingenuous , '' which we have never been able to decide whether to adopt in its mas - culine or its feminine form , any legitimate place in our vocabulary ?

		And does it not savor of some - thing like pedantry or priggishness , or a desire to appear learned and well-read , to sprinkle our dis - course with such exotic terms as `` provenance , '' '' format , '' '' gauche , '' '' gaucherie , '' '' diva , '' '' tenore , '' `` concetti , '' and other like substitutes for adequately - expressive English words ?

		Occasionally the foreign term seems to be the only one for the exact shade of meaning one wishes to convey , and its use as a last resort is unobjectionable .

		Importations from the domain of science are further swelling our dictionaries , and the slang term obtains rather too ready admittance .

		We rejoice , of course , that ours is a living and growing language , but there is such a thing as a growth too rapid for either health or strength or beauty .

		A GREAT LIBRARY-ORGANIZER 'S WORK came too - early to its close in the death ,
March 11	DATE	, of Dr.
John Shaw Billings	PERSON	, since
1896	DATE	head of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and before that in charge of the Library of the Surgeon-General 's Office at
Washington	LOCATION	, where his labors in compiling the great sixteen-volume catalogue of that collection , and in making the collection itself the most valuable med -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE D1A1 , 291 ical library in the world , brought him merited dis - tinction .

		He was born
April 12 , 1839	DATE	, in
Indiana	LOCATION	; attended
Miami University	ORGANIZATION	and the
Medical College of Ohio	ORGANIZATION	; served as surgeon in the Civil War , attaining the rank of lieutenant colonel ; has held various posi - tions of usefulness and eminence , including the chair - manship of the board of trustees of the Carnegie Institution at
Washington	LOCATION	; and was largely instru - mental in securing the
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	grants for building up the
New York	LOCATION	public library system .

		The plan and arrangement of the latter 's great central library building are credited to him , and to his organizing genius also the
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	Hospital at
Baltimore	LOCATION	is greatly indebted .

		Honorary degrees and society memberships at home and abroad were bestowed upon him in profusion .

		Among his published works the `` National Medical Dictionary , '' in two volumes , deserves prominent mention .

		Dr. Billings was a man given to large undertakings of public useful - ness , and whatever he undertook he seems to have carried to success .

		THE PLAY-GOER 'S IMAGINATION has far less exer - cise now than in the early days of the theatre which is rather to be regretted .

		The staging of a play in ancient
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	was a simple matter compared with the elaboration of scenery and cos - tume now demanded .

		And in
Elizabethan England	LOCATION	it was not much more of an undertaking .

		As Pro- fessor
Felix Schelling	PERSON	said the other day at
Amherst	LOCATION	in his
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	lecture , `` our method of present - ing a play makes for the reduction of intellectual effort ; we are personally conducted throughout , and the imagination is rarely taxed . ''

		Between Shake - speare 's Snout playing the part of a wall , with a daub of plaster or loam on his person to foster the illusion , and Mr.
Edison	PERSON	's kinetophone reproducing grand opera or scenes from real life , with every movement and color and sound , even to the spoken word , somewhat accurately rendered , there may well stretch three centuries of effort and experiment and evolution .

		Such triumphs of realism drive some of us to the quiet of the study and the congenial atmosphere of the library , there to take our fill of the drama in a manner befitting one whose imagina - tion needs not the guidance of leading-strings .

		A CLEARING HOUSE FOR PERIODICALS IS con - ducted by the
Minnesota Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, as explained in its '' Seventh Biennial Report . ''

		By means of this clearing house the libraries throughout the
State	ORGANIZATION	are greatly helped in completing their sets of magazines and reviews for reference use .

		A sur - plus at one place supplies a deficiency at another , through the mediation of the clearing house .

		`` The
Commission	ORGANIZATION	pays the freight on all magazines sent in , and the libraries upon those which they receive .

		During the period of nineteen months covered by this report ,
2171	DATE	numbers have been given to libraries , a smaller number than in preceding years , for the reason that the majority of libraries have practically completed their back files and are now subscribing for the magazines which are reg - ularly bound each year .

		Of the more popular magazines which are not valuable for reference material ,
1059	DATE	numbers have been sent to lumber camps , where they are greatly appreciated . ''

		The thought here suggests itself that if all
State	ORGANIZATION	library commissions were to establish similar clearing houses and then unite in the maintenance of a central or national clearing house a clearing house of clear - ing houses , in short the completion of defective sets of periodicals in all the public libraries of the
United States	LOCATION	might be facilitated .

		But perhaps the scheme would be too complicated for practical use .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		ART IN THE MAGAZINES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		My letter published in your issue of
February 1	DATE	called forth only seven replies , or eight counting the one published .

		One of these is a gentle and courteous protest from the Editor of the '' Century , '' who notes that the
April	DATE	number of that magazine will contain an article criticising new fads in art , with a lot of illustra - tions . ''

		When you see these you will not consider Mr.
Dearth	PERSON	's picture an extreme example of a general type , but will think it conservative . ''

		Six letters support my opinion of the picture criticised , with a variety of vigor - ous expressions .

		No real defense has been attempted , if we except that of Mr.
R. U. Johnson	PERSON	, who merely urges that the work is '' conservative '' compared with other pictures now before the public , which is of course a fact .

		On the whole the referendum has not been a conspic - uous success , but another time we might do better .

		Dr.
E. E. Hale	PERSON	, in a semi-facetious manner , raises the ques - tion whether the plan proposed could be expected to give results of any value .

		Judged by their attitude toward works of art , people may be divided into three groups : -LRB- 1 -RRB- those who care especially for the technique ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- those who value the work for its mission to mankind ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- those who regard it with comparative indiffer - ence , and have no strong feelings of any kind regarding it .

		At the present time , it is probably no exaggeration to say that at least ninety per cent of our people belong to the third class , whose opinions on the subject , so far as they have any , are not definite or well considered enough to be of much value .

		Consequently an attempt to collect opinions wholesale , without any sort of selec - tion , would scarcely repay the trouble .

		The professional group , representing the first class in our classification , is organized and articulate , and naturally dominates the situation .

		It is of course true that the best representa - tives of art belong equally to the first and second classes , so that the second point of view is never lost sight of entirely .

		It is , however , my contention that the present state of the fine arts and of art criticism in this country is unsatisfactory on account of the insufficient attention paid to what I conceive to be the real mission of art , and that the remedy lies with that body of educated people who value art for its influence on morality , using that word in its broadest and original sense .

		These people , owing to the size of our country and the lack of any obvious common bond , are too inarticulate , too little able to bring to a focus the very considerable body of 292 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	opinion they represent .

		It seemed to me that perhaps the readers of THE DIAL were a sufficiently selected group to be of value in this connection .

		Judging by those personally known to me , I should say that on the whole they must represent the group it is desired to reach fairly well .

		If the referendum became customary and received adequate support , I believe the results would be of real value .

		In no instance would all , or nearly all , the readers send in opinions , and thus the indifferent in relation to the matter under discussion would be eliminated .

		Another possible development of the same idea would be to ask readers to nominate , say , one hundred persons , who would be asked from time to time to briefly express their opinions on particular topics , with the understand - ing that they would only do so if they felt sufficiently competent and interested .

		Then , as the result of a par - ticular referendum , we might have before us a numeri - cal summary of the general vote , with a selected series of statements giving the opinions of specially competent individuals .

		In zoology , at the present time , there is much discus - sion of nomenclature , and the methods outlined above have been followed by certain journals , I think with wholly beneficial results .

		Whenever such methods are employed , they tend to increase interest , and shift the power and feeling of responsibility from the few to the many .

		Democracy is not in itself a cure for all our ills ; how much of it we need in particular cases will depend upon circumstances , but unless we have demo - cratic ideals , the tendency will be all the other way , with eventually disastrous results .

		With regard to the immorality of bad art , I would say this : bad drawing is not necessarily immoral , but when a work comes to have any importance as art , its effect on the public morals can not be avoided .

		This is too large a subject to discuss here , ; but it will , I think , be generally admitted that our feeling for harmony or beauty is intimately connected with the very fibre of our morality .

		Some of the preposterous things which have lately been exhibited as '' art '' are scarcely im - moral , because they have , I suppose , no real grip on the imagination .

		The maximum of injury arises from works which are , as Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	says , relatively '' conserva - tive . ''

		It is just as it is with people : we are in danger of being misled and degraded by those who are moder - ately abnormal , but no one fears the influence of a lunatic .

		`` ARE N'T I '' AND `` A N'T I. '' -LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The longer the discussion regarding the use of '' are n't I '' goes on , the more I am impressed with the fact that consultation of the dictionary , with some recog - nition of the attempt to spell according to sound , would have quieted apprehension among those who fear for the purity of our mother tongue .

		The instances of this usage come from southern En - gland and
New England	LOCATION	.

		In both , the sound of final '' r '' has practically ceased to exist .

		Consequently the phrase referred to is pronounced to rhyme with `` ca n't , '' as that abbreviation is properly pronounced , with the low-back-wide vowel which we term in English , some - what inaccurately , '' Italian a. '' Reference to the New English Dictionary gives the abbreviation '' a n't , '' pro- nounced to rhyme with `` ca n't , '' as in literary use in English since
1706	DATE	, the date of the first example cited ; and defines it as the '' contraction for are n't , are not ; colloquially for am not ; and in illiterate or dialect speech for is not , has not -LRB- ha n't -RRB- .

		A later and still more illit - erate form is AINT . ''

		Of the six instances of the use of '' a n't '' cited , five are of its use in the plural as a contraction for `` are n't , '' and only one , from the `` Rejected Addresses , '' of its use in the singular , where it is colloquially used for `` is not . ''

		I am impressed with the notion that more profound search would have shown its extended use in the first person singular .

		It is formed upon precise analogy with '' ca n't '' for can not '' and '' sha n't '' for '' shall not , '' where the dropping of the closing consonant of the first member of the abbreviation is followed by a lengthening of the `` short English a '' to the `` Italian a , '' as if for compensation , precisely as in the case of '' a n't '' from '' am not . ''

		Note a similar lengthening of the vowel in '' do n't '' and '' wo n't . ''

		When a
Boston	LOCATION	father reports his child as saying '' are u ' t I , '' in standard English , which knows not the sound of final '' r , '' the child has merely said '' a n't I '' quite correctly , and the same is to be said of the citation which occasioned this controversy .

		And as the
New English Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, by implication , authorizes its use as literate , why may we not recognize it as having been literate , certainly since
1706	DATE	, and content ourselves therewith , at least as a permissible colloquialism ?

		ANOTHER DISINHERITED BRITICISM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		An example of questionable British idiom , more ear - distressing to me than any of those cited in the inter - esting paragraph on '' Freaks of Language '' in your last issue , may be found in the current number of '' The English Review . ''

		In what is otherwise an excellently - written short story , the hero addresses this remarkable query to the heroine : '' I used to be great on material forces , use n't 1 ? ''

		Perhaps it is not without significance that this linguistic vagary is put in the mouth of an American character , thus paving the way for that inevi - table day when some
Saturday	DATE	Reviewer will confront us with this latest instance of a '' barbarous Americanism . ''

		AN OMITTED ACKNOWLEDGMENT .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		At the time that my '' Journal of an Expedition across
Venezuela	LOCATION	and
Colombia	LOCATION	'' was published I was absent from this country on an expedition to
South America	LOCATION	.

		An appendix on '' Temperature and Weather '' was prepared from my notes by Mr.
Burton M. Varney	PERSON	, of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Owing to a misunderstanding , which would not have arisen had I been in this country at the time the volume was published or had Mr.
Var	PERSON	- ney not been so very modest , this acknowledgment was not included in the preface .

		An '' Additional Note '' stating this fact has been prepared in such form that it may readily be inserted in the volume .

		If any of your readers who own copies of the book will send a line to that effect to the
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	or to me , I shall be very glad to fur - nish them with the inset .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 298 CHAPTERS FROM A NATURALIST 'S EARLY LIFE .

		* A more severe or puritanical upbringing than that pictured by Mr.
John Muir	PERSON	in his '' Story of my Boyhood and Youth '' could hardly be imagined .

		At school in his native town of
Dun	ORGANIZATION	bar ,
Scotland	LOCATION	, the rudiments of book - learning were soundly thrashed into the male pupils , the boys were flogged again at home for delinquencies at school , and they were also well birched by the paternal hand for seeking to ease the strain of unremittent discipline by pommelling one another .

		Sundays were made formidable by the rigors of church-attendance , and if a fearful joy was snatched on
Saturdays	DATE	from the indulgence of irrepressible youthful impulses , the recreation was likely to be paid for with additional administrations of chastise - ment .

		A little later in the autobiographer 's life , in the hard pioneer days of his early
Wisconsin	LOCATION	experience , only two holidays , the fourth of
July	DATE	and the first of
January	DATE	, were granted to him and his brothers and sisters by the strenu - ously industrious parents ; and , by his own con - fession , the chronicler of these hardships and severities seems to have had assigned to him all the most back-breaking and heart-breaking of the fearful tasks encountered in subduing the wilderness of a frontier homestead of sixty years ago .

		No wonder he was called the '' runt '' of the family .

		Although he migrated to
America	LOCATION	at eleven years of age , he can scarcely be said to have grown up with the country ; hard work stunted the growth .

		Under the inflexible rule of a father who held the Bible to be the only book profitable for in - struction , and to know ''
Jesus Christ	PERSON	, and him crucified , '' the only knowledge of value , the eager intellect of the son must have been in some danger of atrophy .

		It is pathetic to imagine the lad snatching surreptitious glimpses of the inside of a book on church history probably the only reading available except the
Bible	LOCATION	and being sternly ordered to bed by the father , to whom such frivolity seemed doubly unpardonable when protracted beyond the hour of eight o'clock at night , the family bedtime .

		It is almost with incredulity that we read of the amount of scripture committed to memory by the son at the parental bidding .

		The better * THE STORY OF MY BOYHOOD AND YOUTH .

		By
John Muir	PERSON	.

		With illustrations from sketches by the author .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Miffiin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		part of the Old Testament and all the New he tells us he was at one time able to repeat per - haps he is still able to do so .

		Dick 's ''
Chris	PERSON	- tian Philosopher '' he hoped to be allowed to go through on the strength of the first word of the title .

		But he says his father '' balked at the word ' philosopher , ' and quoted from the Bible a verse which spoke of ' philosophy falsely so - called ' '' though he must have altered the text if he used those exact words .

		With approach - ing manhood , however , the book-hungry lad seems to have succeeded in providing himself with a few of the English classics ; and this is what he says about them : '' I remember as a great and sudden discovery that the poetry of the
Bible	LOCATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and
Milton	PERSON	was a source of inspiring , exhilarating , uplifting pleasure ; and I became anxious to know all the poets , and saved up small sums to buy as many of their books as possible .

		Within three or four years I was the proud possessor of parts of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's ,
Milton	PERSON	's ,
Cowper	PERSON	's ,
Henry Kirke White	PERSON	's ,
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	's , and
Akenside	ORGANIZATION	's works , and quite a number of others seldom read nowadays .

		I think it was in my fifteenth year that I began to relish good literature with entlmsiasm , and smack my lips over favorite lines , but there was desperately little time for reading , even in the winter evenings , only a few stolen minutes now and then .

		Father 's strict rule was , straight to bed immediately after family worship , which in
winter	DATE	was usually over by eight o'clock . ''

		At last paternal permission was obtained to use as much of the
early morning	TIME	for reading as was desired .

		Fired with zeal to make the most of this opportunity , the son was out of bed the next morning long before daylight ; and when he found by the kitchen clock that it was only one o'clock , his exultation at the prospect of five free hours knew no bounds .

		But the kitchen fire was out , and he feared to strain his father 's indulgence too far by re-kindling it at so unheard-of an hour .

		The temperature was below freezing , and the only alternative to going back to bed was to take refuge in the compara - tive warmth of the cellar not to read , how - ever , as it was too cold even there for the enjoy - ment of poetry , but to give bodily shape to some of the many mechanical inventions with which the boy 's head was teeming .

		All the world knows of Mr.
Muir	PERSON	as a naturalist , but before he devoted himself to the wonders of natural science he had earned a reputation as a most ingenious and skilful inventor .

		Without ever having seen the inside of a clock or watch , he conceived the idea of a clock that should not only tell the time of day , but also the days of the month and of the week ; and he whittled out the machine in these early morning hours in the cellar , following it up with other curious con - 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	structions , and making them `` go , '' too , when they were set up .

		From an iron rod , three feet long and five-eighths of an inch in diameter , that had formed part of a wagon box , he made a most delicate and accurate thermometer , multiplying the expansion and contraction of the rod by a series of levers , and making it so sensitive to variations of temperature that the dial hand would move at the approach of a person .

		Another contrivance would tilt a bed on end at any desired hour a most effective kind of alarm clock .

		Sketches of a number of these curious products of his inventive genius are drawn by the author for the illustration of his book .

		His account of these machines , and of the glory they won for him at county fairs and at the
State University	ORGANIZATION	, where his room became a museum of wonders not yet forgotten , is exceedingly diverting and often amusing .

		Equally engrossing is his description of his eagerness for a college education and the way in which he contrived to gratify his longing .

		Let a short passage be here inserted : '' With fear and trembling , overladen with ignorance , I called on Professor
Stirling	PERSON	, the Dean of the Faculty , who was then Acting President , presented my case , and told him how far I had got on with my studies at home , and that I had n't been to school since leaving
Scotland	LOCATION	at the age of eleven years , excepting one short term of a couple of months at a district school , because I could not be spared from the farm work .

		After hearing my story , the kind professor welcomed me to the glorious
University	ORGANIZATION	next , it seemed to me , to the
Kingdom of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	.

		After a few weeks in the preparatory depart - ment I entered the Freshman class In Latin I found that one of the books in use I had already studied in
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		So , after an interruption of a dozen years , I began my Latin over again where I had left off ; and , strange to say , most of it came back to me , especially the grammar which I had committed to memory at the
Dunbar Grammar School	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		But to this student , Latin and Greek were only the dead sticks of knowledge ; the living tree was science , with its manifold wonders .

		Not surprising is it , therefore , that he refused to follow the prescribed course leading to a diploma , but picked here and there such studies as chemistry , geology , and botany , and spent his four college years more profitably than if he had pursued the usual routine ; for he had a maturity of mind and a wealth of hard-won experience not found in the average collegian .

		The problem how to support himself during his course at Madison was not the easiest one to solve , and at times he was reduced to
fifty cents	MONEY	a week for the supply of his bodily needs .

		He boarded himself , as did many of his comrades , and worked at farming in
summer	DATE	and at teach - ing in winter to keep the wolf from the door .

		And through it all he turned his inventive fac - ulty to good account , constructing a thoroughly successful automatic fire-lighter for the country school he was teaching , thus saving precious time for his studies , and filling his room at the university with divers sorts of labor-saving devices .

		Here is his account of one of his summers : '' At the beginning of the long
summer	DATE	vacation I returned to the Hickory Hill farm to earn the means in the harvest-fields to continue my
University	ORGANIZATION	course , walking all the way to save railroad fares .

		And although I cradled four acres of wheat a day , I made the long , hard , sweaty day 's work still longer and harder by keeping up my study of plants .

		At the noon hour I collected a large handful , put them in water to keep them fresh , and after supper got to work on them and sat up till after
midnight	TIME	, analyzing and classifying , thus leaving only four hours for sleep ; and by the
end of the first year	DATE	, after taking up botany , I knew the principal flowering plants of the region . ''

		With the completion of the university course the narrative comes to an end , much to the reader 's regret .

		Let us hope it may be con - tinued at an early date .

		There is a freshness and truth and simple sincerity about it that go far toward making it one of the great pieces of writing of its kind .

		It clears the brain and braces the system to read so genuine , unpre - tentious , homely , and convincing a bit of auto - biography .

		Sweet are the uses of adversity when it can shape such a life as is so unassum - ingly portrayed in Mr.
Muir	PERSON	's pages .

		No one , having once opened the book , can lay it down unfinished ; and no one , having finished it , can fail to feel himself the better for it .

		In form and workmanship the volume is worthy of its contents .

		A fine portrait of the author faces the title-page .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 295 knowledge lies within the reach of mental per - ception and what particular range of human knowledge can be grasped only through spirit - ual perception '' ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- that of this thought and this century the master poetic mind was
Robert Browning	PERSON	.

		To trace how
Browning	PERSON	entered into the arena and ventured to tackle , as early as in his second poem , the supreme problem of his age the rela - tion of mind and spirit is a purpose never lost sight of by the author .

		For example , in '' Saul '' she sees not only what the average reader sees a poem full of humanity , tenderness , and sheer poetic beauty , but also an interpretation of the origin of prophecy .

		It places
Browning	PERSON	not only in the van of the thought of the century on questions connected with biblical criticism , but in a still more advanced position by virtue of the psychological tinge given to
David	PERSON	's ex - perience .

		Miss
Clarke	PERSON	points out that
William James	PERSON	himself could not have portrayed better a case of religious ecstasy growing out of gen - uine exaltation of thought .

		The special contri - butions of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	,
David Strauss	PERSON	,
Cardinal Wiseman	PERSON	, and the group of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	men in the
Tractarian Movement	ORGANIZATION	are summarized to show that
Browning	PERSON	in his mid-century poems was abreast and sometimes ahead of even such leaders as these , in the battle of mind and spirit .

		Again , when later in the century scientific thought brought to the fore the problem of evil and its corollary , the conception of the Infinite ,
Browning	PERSON	was also completely abreast of the current .

		This is shown most fully in ''
Ferish	PERSON	- tah 's Fancies '' and '' Parleyings . ''

		Miss
Clarke	PERSON	is quite warranted in calling it a '' strange freak of criticism '' that so many , even of
Browning	PERSON	's admirers , have failed to note the importance of these later works .

		The great outcry against them , of course , has been the old one that philosophical and ethical problems are not fit subjects for treatment in poetry .

		But , she argues , it is just as prejudiced and unforeseeing in these days to limit poetry to this or that kind of a subject , or to say that nothing is dramatic which does not deal with immediate action , as it would have been for Homer to declare that no poem would ever be worthy of the name that did not contain a catalogue of ships .

		By using the dramatic form , the poet has been able to convey a deep sense of the characteristics peculiar to the century .

		The latter half of the Victorian period , in its thought phases , lives just as surely in these poems as
Renaissance Italy	LOCATION	in its art phases lives in '' Fra
Lippo Lippi	PERSON	, '' ''
Andrea del Sarto	PERSON	, '' and the rest ; and this is true , though one group is cast in the form of Persian fables , and the second in the form of '' Par - leyings '' with worthies or un worthies of past centuries .

		The lyrics in `` Ferishtah , '' albeit not con - forming to Elizabethan models , are accounted by
Miss Clarke	PERSON	as among the finest ever written .

		It was a happy thought to place them as a com - panion picture to Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's `` Sonnets from the Portuguese . ''

		The Sonnets portray the sunrise of a great love ; the `` Ferishtah '' lyrics reflect the subsequent development of such a love , through the awakening of whole new realms of feeling , love for humanity as a whole , all the little trials of life dissolved in the new light , and divine love realized with a force never before possible .

		The chapters on `` Political Tendencies '' and `` Social Ideals '' are less convincing , since the author is forced to admit that
Browning	PERSON	's poetry shows little interest in the political ideas of his own age and century , and that his social ideals have no touch of nineteenth century utilitarian - ism .

		While his work is instinct with sympathy for all classes and conditions of men ,
Browning	PERSON	does not feel the ills of life with the intensity of a
Carlyle	LOCATION	, nor its ugliness with the grief of a
Ruskin	LOCATION	, nor yet its lack of culture with the concern of an
Arnold	LOCATION	; nor would he stand in open spaces and preach socialism to the masses as did
Morris	PERSON	.

		His thought was centred upon the worth of every human being to himself and for God .

		Earth is after all only a place to grow in , and to prepare one 's self for life to come ; and failure here , so long as the fight has been bravely fought , is to be regarded with anything but regret , for it is through the failure that the vision of the future is made more sure .

		One of the most acceptable features of this intensely interesting volume of nearly four hun - dred pages is its freedom from padding of any kind .

		Miss
Clarke	PERSON	has avoided the custom of most of her predecessors , who fill in with long citations of the poet 's own words .

		She is so thoroughly familiar with the poems that she assumes her readers to be , also .

		She is so thor - oughly steeped in their spirit that we are quite ready to agree with her , in this passage near the close : '' The century had to grow up to him .

		It is needless to say that it did so .

		Just as out of the turmoil of conflicting scientific and religious thought has emerged a serene belief in man 's spiritual destiny , so out of the turmoil of conflicting schools of criticism has arisen a perception of the value of the new , the original , the different in art .

		Critics begin to apply the principles of evolution to their criticism as
Browning	PERSON	applied it to 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	his art , ... not forgetting that the poet or dramatist may have a farther vision of what is to come than any other man of his time .

		The people first , for the most part , found out that here in
Browning	PERSON	's work was a new force , and calmly formed themselves into groups to study what manner of force it might be , regardless of the sneers of newspaperdom and conventional academies .

		And gradually , to the few appreciative critics of the early days have been added one authoritative voice after another until the chorus of praise has become a large one , and
Browning	PERSON	, though later than any great poet of the century , is coming into his own . ''

		Through her latest volume ,
Miss Clarke	PERSON	has added one more to our long list of obligations to her as the editor and interpreter of
Browning	PERSON	.

		It is unfortunate that in this new book so many printer 's errors have escaped the proof-reader , such as `` Chancer '' for '' Chaucer , '' ``
Athen	LOCATION	's '' for ''
Athens	LOCATION	, '' and others equally obvious .

		The illustrations consist chiefly of half-tones from photographs of nineteenth century notables ; some of these are good , but the one at the close of the volume , showing
Browning	PERSON	himself , is so badly reproduced as to be almost a caricature .

		the limits thereto which altitude with its reduced atmospheric pressure may establish .

		Laboratory experiments , indeed , and balloon ascensions in - dicate limits far above those of our greatest mountain peaks ; but such tests lack the very factors of exertion , endurance , and climate which are of essential value to the mountaineer .

		The first ascent of Mont Blanc -LRB- 15,780 feet above sea-level -RRB- was made toward the close of the eighteenth century .

		Since that time the goal has been steadily pushed higher and higher till it now stands at 24,600 feet , achieved by the Duke of the
Abruzzi	LOCATION	on Bride Peak in his latest expedition .

		This exceeds by 700 feet the great - est mountain altitude achieved by men up to this time .

		Not only this , but the party lived for thirty - seven days at or above 16,000 feet , and then for another seventeen days were never below 18,000 , nine days of this latter period being spent at or above 21,000 feet .

		During this time they made two ascents , involving four days of fatiguing work , sleeping at 21,673 and 22,483 feet , and reaching 23,458 and 24,600 , all of this being accomplished under adverse conditions of cramped quarters , constant bad weather , and reduced nourishment due to loss of appetite .

		Expeditions such as this are possible to but few persons .

		They require profound technical experience in geographical exploration , long and expensive preparations , complicated and heavy equipment to be conveyed by porters -LRB- often natives unaccustomed to the work and to the appurtenances of civilization -RRB- , and , above all , energy , will , decision , and power of organization .

		They require also a genius for leadership which will sustain the morale alike of Swiss guides and of hired helpers , as well as of companions , at times when human effort is taxed to the limit of endurance amid dangers seen and unseen , when a false move or a mistake in judgment means certain disaster .

		Dr.
Filippi	PERSON	's narrative is not a fulsome encomium of his leader , but one does not need to read far between the lines to appreciate the fact that the expedition to the Karakoram had the advantage of both studied scientific management and of inspiring leader - ship commanding the loyalty of all .

		But notwithstanding all that ample provision and wide experience could do , the flag of Savoy does not float from the summit of U K 2 . ''

		Snow - mantled precipices , threatening avalanches , and almost continuous storms rendered the ascent impossible , though attempted at several angles and though the great elevation of 23,458 feet was reached .

		Baffled at this , the objective point
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 297 of the expedition , the leader turned to Bride Peak , and here , in spite of the cumulative effects upon himself and his party of the previous strenuous work at high altitudes , the cold of the almost continuous blizzard which enveloped them , and the malnutrition due to loss of appetite , he succeeded in attaining the hitherto unprece - dented height of 24,600 feet , but only to find himself balked again in reaching the summit by impassable precipices .

		The backbone of
Asia	LOCATION	covers a region five hundred miles wide , from
Afghanistan	LOCATION	to
Burma	LOCATION	, a distance of
1500	DATE	miles , far more than all the mountains of
Europe	LOCATION	and the
Caucasus	LOCATION	piled up together .

		North of the
Punjab	LOCATION	, and sepa - rated from it by the upper course of the Indus , stretches a huge system of towering peaks , the Karakoram , whose snowy mantle feeds a vast system of radiating glaciers .

		The route of the expedition lay through the
Vale of Cashmir	ORGANIZATION	, and thence with a party recruited en route to the number of 250 porters and guides , they pushed across icy passes and the barren outliers of the distant range , over wavering bridges of twisted withes , across glacier-fed torrents , a dis - tance of 225 miles to the head of the
Godwin Austen Glacier	PERSON	, whence they had their first sight of the object of their quest . ''

		Suddenly and without warning , as if a veil had been lifted from our eyes , the wide
Godwin Austen	PERSON	valley lay before us in its whole length .

		Down at the end , alone , detached from all the other mountains , soared up K 2 , the indisputable sovereign of the region , gigantic and solitary , hidden from human sight by innumerable ranges , jealously defended by a vast throng of vassal peaks , protected from invasion by miles and miles of glaciers .

		Even to get within sight of it demands so much contrivance , so much marching , such a sum of labors . ''

		This mountain , whose estimated altitude is 28,000 feet , is not alone in its grandeur , but lies amid a sea of peaks more numerous even than in the
Mt. Everest	LOCATION	region .

		In the 450 miles of the Karakoram chain there are no less than thirty-three known peaks of 24,000 feet or more .

		To these the Duke of the
Abruzzi	LOCATION	's explorations added one new peak exceeding 27,000 feet , and at least fifteen others all over 23,000 , now measured for the first time .

		For many weeks the party marched across the great
Baltoro Glacier	PERSON	, and from their sev - eral base camps essayed the subjugation of the towering white-robed pinnacle of `` K 2 '' at its head .

		While the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	and his experienced Swiss guides were making their hazardous attempts to find some passable shoulder or chimney , other members of the party were actively working upon a very complete photo - grammetric survey and exploration of the Bal - toro
Glacier	ORGANIZATION	and its tributaries .

		Most notable of all the records of these explorations are the wonderful photographs taken by
Cav	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sella , and reproduced in the atlas accompanying the narrative .

		These fine panoramas , together with the excellent photographs reproduced freely in the text of the narrative , constitute a revelation of snow-clad peaks and pinnacles , and veritable torrents of moraine-covered ice sweeping down from every valley and merging in one vast sea of seracs , crevasses , and disrupted and dishevelled debris of cliff and precipice , a chaos of the world in the making .

		It is no exaggeration to state that these photographs of Cav .

		Bella 's are unsurpassed in the magnificence and sublimity of the scenery they reveal .

		A distinctly new standard has been set , in reference to both sub - ject and execution of the plates .

		They fittingly accompany a straightforward and keenly inter - esting tale of a good piece of exploration emi - nently well done .

		The appendices deal with the scientific results of the expedition .

		The equipment for scientific exploration was exceptionally excellent , and the results are correspondingly significant .

		The greatest achievement was the accurate mapping of the
Baltoro	LOCATION	,
Godwin	PERSON	,
Austen	PERSON	, and Savoia glaciers , with their surrounding peaks and moun - tain chains , by means of the photogrammetric apparatus perfected by
Comm	ORGANIZATION	.

		Paganini of the
Military Geographical Institute of Florence	ORGANIZATION	.

		The plane table , tape , and theodolite are super - seded by a panoramic photographic apparatus provided with special measuring devices which furnish the photographic perspectives with the elements needed for the survey .

		In the field a series of views are taken from the different stations , with bearings to surrounding trigono - metrical points .

		These pictures serve later as - the basis for all those operations in map-making which under any other method must be per - formed in the field .

		The method is especially adapted to the survey of steep mountainous country , or of places in which for any reason the time for field work is limited or the country difficult of access .

		The nature and result of this survey are recounted by Lieut.
Cambiasco	PERSON	; and Professor Omodei reports upon the extensive meteorological and altimetrical observations carried on coincidently during the period of the exploration at a number of stations of consid - erable altitude along the route .

		These consti - tute a valuable addition to the climatology of these remote and little-known lauds .

		Novarese , of the Italian Geological Survey , and Mr.
R. D. Oldham	PERSON	, of the
Geological Survey of India	ORGANIZATION	.

		Their papers deal mainly with the tectonics of these ranges of mountains , and the interpretation of the remarkable courses which the Indus and its tributaries have cut through the mountain ranges ; and with the nature of the rock samples , which show that at least parts of these massive mountains are of Mesozoic origin .

		Discussion of the glaciers is confined to the nar - rative of the expedition .

		The last appendix , by Professor
Pirotta	PERSON	and Dr.
Cortesi	PERSON	, gives a list of the plants collected at these high altitudes .

		To the professional mountaineer the book brings a revelation of a well-planned , efficiently organized , and admirably executed expedition , together with the stimulus of an example of untiring effort , and it leaves the poignant chal - lenge of the unaccomplished .

		To the casual reader it brings a picture of the top of the world so interestingly portrayed that one is loath to leave it .

		To the lover of mountains it opens a new vista of glaciers , avalanches , and mountain peaks swathed in snow , grim , awful , and uncon - querable by the indomitable spirit of man , but still surpassingly beautiful and majestic .

		* It would not , of course , be fair to state that the fame of
Mary Sidney	PERSON	, Countess of Pem - broke , has been overshadowed by that of her brother
Philip	PERSON	, with whom she was so closely and happily associated .

		On the contrary , she has gained a measure of immortality through this association that she could hardly have hoped to win otherwise .

		Biographers have loved to dwell upon the deep and tender tie that bound brother and sister whose mutual confidence was so perfect , and whose tastes were so kindred .

		They have often painted the charming picture of the joint literary labors of these two in the great library , or in the lovely park , at
Wilton	LOCATION	, during the period of
Philip	LOCATION	's exile from
Court	ORGANIZATION	through the Queen 's displeasure .

		A gracious legend has even shown them engaged in active collaboration upon
Sidney	PERSON	's idyllic romance , `` The Countess of
Pembroke	LOCATION	's
Arcadia	LOCATION	'' ; and the sister 's assumed share in the actual com - position of this work has assured her hitherto a much higher and more important place in *

		Elizabethan literature , on the creative side , than modern criticism is now disposed to allow her .

		The recent discovery , by Mr.
Bertram Dobell	PERSON	, of three new manuscripts of the ''
Arcadia	LOCATION	'' seems to prove conclusively that Lady Pem - broke 's share , outside of what inspiration she may have afforded , was strictly limited to cer - bain corrections and changes which she deemed necessary when preparing for the press a com - plete version of the story out of several incom - plete manuscript '' states . ''

		Her edition , which was the second , appeared in
1593	DATE	, or three years after
Lord Brooke	PERSON	's partial printing .

		And yet , although
Mary Sidney	PERSON	has gained so much , she has also lost something , through the closeness of this association with her brother .

		Absorbed so completely into his personality , certain individual traits of her own have be - come more or less obscured , and her peculiar position in Elizabethan letters has not always been sufficiently emphasized .

		Lady
Pembroke	PERSON	was not only her brother 's sister although she herself accepted this secondary role with a hu - mility that would be touching did it not contain so much noble pride and herself a writer of moderate merit , whose literary undertakings were largely identified with his .

		She was also a great lady of the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	, one of the first women of high rank in
England	LOCATION	to adopt that liberal attitude towards literature of which so many women of
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	bad already given illustrious examples .


Nicholas Breton	PERSON	compared her with the Duchess of
Urbino	LOCATION	, and this comparison '' is of very great interest , '' writes Miss Young , whose monograph deals very thoroughly and suggestively with this aspect of her subject , '' showing , as it does , that the Italian fashion of a cultivated lady of rank as the centre of a literary and artistic circle had reached
England	LOCATION	, along with all the other Italian ' influences ' of that and earlier periods . ''

		`` It should be remembered , '' the writer con - tinues , `` that Lady Pembroke was only one of a group of ladies of rank whose tastes were literary , and whose purses were more or less open .

		Margaret , Countess of
Cumberland	LOCATION	... Lucy , Countess of Bedford ...
Anne Clifford	PERSON	... Countess of
Dorset	LOCATION	and Mont - gomery , were all women of this type .

		Lady
Pembroke	LOCATION	, however , easily surpasses them all in the solidity of her attainments , and the real scope of her contributions to letters and culture . ''

		The same may be said of her active patronage of men of letters .

		While her husband lived and she remained chatelaine of
Wilton	LOCATION	, that house formed a veritable refuge for poets whom
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 299 she befriended and who repaid her with compli - mentary addresses and epistles-dedicatory like that with which
Thomas Howells	PERSON	prefaced his * ' Devises . ''

		This , dated
1581	DATE	, when Lady Pem - broke was still hardly more than a girl , is the earliest which the author has been able to find .

		Among the other poets and men of letters who contributed to this galaxy of praise , are men - tioned
Nicholas Breton	PERSON	,
Abraham Fraunce	PERSON	,
Samuel Daniel	PERSON	,
Thomas Nashe	PERSON	-LRB- as well as his adversary ,
Gabriel Harvey	PERSON	, so Lady Pembroke would seem to have kept fairly clear of current literary controversy -RRB- ,
Thomas Watson	PERSON	,
Barnaby Barnes	PERSON	,
Thomas Churchyard	PERSON	,
Michael Drayton	PERSON	, and so on almost without end , while , of course ,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's tribute to her poetical powers , in '' Astrophel , '' is well known .

		Some of these poets she actively influenced , as in the case of
Daniel	PERSON	, whose tragedy after the Senecan model , `` Cleopatra , `` doubtless owes its direct inspiration to her own translation of Garnier 's ''
Antonie	PERSON	. ''

		Lady
Pembroke	ORGANIZATION	's dramatic interests and sym - pathies were , like her brother 's , clearly classical , and doubtless her influence was , as far as pos - sible , exerted against the rise and spread of the romantic school .

		But whatever hope there may have been for a moment that her taste might triumph was soon dispelled by the eclipse of
Kyd	PERSON	another of her proteges who , it has been suggested , was her master in the structure of English blank verse , and who was still a third translator of Gamier .

		It is to this particular development of the contemporary drama , rather than , as
Miss Young	ORGANIZATION	seems inclined to think , to any imperfect sympathy with the dramatic form as such , that should be attributed the slightness of her connection , so far as we know , with the dramatic art of her time .

		There is , indeed , a paucity of playwrights among the poets * ' whom she countenanced and subsidized , '' and many of whom `` are , to our modern view , as mediocre of their kind as the most mediocre and extravagant dramatist of the time . ''

		But the extravagance and mediocrity of her sonneteers were well within the regies of the art they practiced , while those of the dramatists were of a strange new variety which seemed to have no root in the literary culture of the past , and even to attack and set this culture at naught .

		Yet , even so , it would seem strange that , as Miss Young points out , Lady Pembroke apparently never `` gave countenance financial or other - wise to that gifted but needy and reckless youth , ''
Philip Massinger	PERSON	, whose father ,
Arthur Massinger	PERSON	, was for so many years in her hus - band 's employ as `` a kind of secretary and trusted agent , '' and whom , therefore , she must have known all about .

		Perhaps , however , it is the records that are at fault ; anyway , it is easier to believe that this is the case , than that the Countess was actually guilty of what might well seem gross indifference or even neglect of a member of the family of an old and faithful retainer especially on any such grounds as mere lack of complete literary sympathy .

		For
Mary Sidney	PERSON	may have been , as Miss Young asserts , an accomplished type of the `` blue-stocking '' though she uses the term without prejudice , simply to indicate what seem to her temperamental reasons for rejecting any intimations of renaissance Platonistic tendencies on the part of her heroine .

		She was this , but she was much more besides an exceedingly lovable , warmhearted , loyal , and altogether hu - man woman .

		Fragmentary as are her personal records , and incomplete as must therefore ne - cessarily be our estimate of many sides of her character , one intimate trait , at least , stands clearly forth , along with her high intellectual quality and her well-attested practical capacity in the management of her affairs .

		This is a strain of genuine gentleness , that comes out again and again in her letters , and that shows her to have been ever considerate and thought - ful for others , and full of a grave and tender concern for their welfare .

		The letters themselves are not numerous , and they often deal mainly with matters of indifferent interest .

		But nearly all have certain self - revelatory touches that tend to bring the writer more closely to us .

		We have to thank Miss Young for thus collecting them , and also for printing , for the first time ,
Lady Pembroke	LOCATION	's translation of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's `` Trionfo della Morte , '' which is full of verbal and met - rical felicities .

		The little book , as a whole , con - tains as complete and well-rounded a picture as it would be possible to make of this literary great lady whose character and activities , no less than her sentimental associations , entitle her to an important place in the history of English society and literature .

		300 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	THE PROGRESS OF EUROPEAN SOCIALISM .

		* In more than one of the important countries of continental
Europe	LOCATION	the socialists hold to-day the centre of the political stage .

		The aspect of national and local elections which is scrutinized most keenly is the showing of the spcialist party .

		The parliamentary group most watched , and most feared , is the socialist .

		And the measures which absorb the most serious efforts of the
State	ORGANIZATION	are not infrequently those of socialistic origin and character .

		For people accustomed to the political impotence and the sluggish head - way of the socialist movement on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	it is difficult indeed to conceive how vast a place socialism fills in the politics and everyday thought of
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, or
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		The progress of European socialism is to be measured only in part by the swelling statistics of party membership .

		The figures are unques - tionably impressive , but the developments of largest significance are those relating rather to the spirit , aim , and trend of the socialist propa - ganda .

		To arrive at an estimate of socialism 's inward character at the present day , a non - socialist American investigator , Dr.
Samuel P. Orth	PERSON	, has undertaken recently a study of the subject on the spot and in consultation with the most authoritative exponents of the creed .

		The results , which have been gathered in a somewhat sketchy but readable volume , under the title '' Socialism and Democracy in
Europe	LOCATION	, '' are well worth the attention of every student of contemporary social phenomena .

		The aspects of the socialist movement in the four countries covered
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and Bel - gium which are adjudged most fundamental at the present time are its practical , even oppor - portunist , character and the readiness of the majority of its partisans to employ ordinary political means to attain their ends .

		The poli - tical connections , policies , and triumphs of the socialist masses become , indeed , the real theme of the book .

		It is shown that the majority of socialists have cast off entirely such earlier ec - centricities as the ravings against religion and the espousal of free love ; that there has come gradually an understanding that institutions are the products of ages and '' can not be changed at the fancy of every new and disgruntled prophet '' ; that the old cry of class - war has been largely discarded , in the reaJization that the interests of the worker are not fundament - * SOCIALISM AND DEMOCRACY IN

		ally different from those of the rest of the com - munity ; that the end to be sought has been discovered to be a levelling-up , not a le veiling - down of society ; and that the old ideal of change by bloody revolution has given place to the newer one of reform by methods of peace and persuasion .

		Under the influence of these ideas the social - ists as a body have turned their attention in all countries from overpowering and remotely pos - sible achievements to less ambitious but more readily realizable ones .

		Collective ownership of the means of production and distribution , the destruction of capitalism , the abolition of pov - erty these remain ultimate ideals .

		But the objects to which present attention is directed are rather such as relate to workingmen 's com - pensation legislation , old age pensions , sickness and accident insurance , regulation of the hours of labor , and other phases of social legislation in the interest of the laboring masses .

		The instru - ment of achievement is the ballot , and where the power of the ballot is inequitably distributed , as it is in
Germany	LOCATION	, electoral reform is likely to stand at the forefront of the socialist programme .

		Syndicalism , involving as it does the employ - ment of force , represents a reversion to the semi-anarchistic spirit of the socialism of sixty years ago ; but it seems to be Mr.
Orth	PERSON	's opinion that syndicalism will not be able to hold its own against the more moderate influences of the evolutionary socialists .

		The practical achievements of political social - ism are shown to have been enormous .

		Indeed , it has been only since the socialists have begun to be represented actively in the parliaments and sometimes in the ministries as well of
Germany	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	,
Denmark	LOCATION	, and other countries , that positive achievements of an important nature can be accredited to them .

		Of these achievements three are emphasized by the author as of prin - cipal importance .

		The first is the extension to the laboring masses of the democracy established for the middle classes by the bourgeois revolu - tions of
1848	DATE	and after .

		Always and every - where the socialists stand for universal suffrage , direct elections , and the secret ballot , and in
Belgium	LOCATION	and other countries their influence has been decisive of the policy to be adopted in respect to a variety of such matters .

		Secondly , the socialists , becoming themselves lawmakers , have been able to force upon the attention of lawmaking bodies the question of labor in all its aspects and to obtain labor legislation of a most beneficent character .

		And , thirdly , they
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 301 have prodded the
State	ORGANIZATION	to the assumption of manifold obligations and activities which form - erly were regarded as lying quite beyond its sphere .

		The State in these days not only makes and enforces laws , levies taxes , conducts foreign relations , and makes war ; it inspects mines and factories , maintains asylums and hospitals , pro- vides schools , pensions aged workmen , insures against unemployment , regulates housing , and does scores of other things which it rarely or never did in times past .

		These things it now does largely as a matter of course , and mainly because the power of socialism , whether visible or hidden , has accomplished the partial `` social - ization '' of the state , even though contrary to the will and intent of the so-called governing classes .

		The book is provided with a brief but well - selected bibliography , and an extended appendix contains useful documentary materials -LRB- chiefly socialist declarations of principles -RRB- , synopses of electoral laws , and statistical tables .

		Crammage , correctly printed in the bibliography , appears on page 53 as Grummage .

		GENERAL , GRANT 'S LETTERS .

		* In his introduction to the newly published Letters of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	remarks that `` there is no utterance that can give as faithful a picture of a man 's method of thought and principle of action as the personal letters written , with no thought of later publication , to those who are near to him . ''

		Applying this principle to
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's correspond - ence , Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	says that `` these letters , dating back to the time of his youth , give a clear and trustworthy impression of the nature of the man and of the development of character and force that made possible his all-valuable leadership . ''

		But the general reader will probably feel that while the collection is of considerable interest it hardly measures up to the standard suggested by Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		It would not be fair to the great general to say that these papers are of extraordinary value ; they are straightforward , frank , and brief , and they show a development of character from first to last ; but they do not reflect the whole nature of the man as do the
Sherman	PERSON	letters .

New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		vate letters of his chief lieutenant ,
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's are somewhat dry and reserved .

		Sherman poured out on paper his plans , feelings , affections , disappointments , hesitation , prophecy ; Grant , for the most part , confines his correspondence to simple statements of concrete facts , in sim - ple language , with a lack of imagination and absence of prophecy .

		His '' Memoirs '' are less reserved , and must be used with the letters to give a fair picture of the man 's character .

		The letters do have , however , considerable value .

		For one thing , they throw light on the seven years before the Civil War , when , accord - ing to some unfriendly critics and ill-advised admirers , Grant was living in the depths of poverty .

		This tradition is now effectively dis - posed of .

		The letters show that he had `` a large farm , '' '' 200 acres of ploughed land and 250 in pasture '' ; that at one time he had three negro slaves , and at another `` seven negroes were sick '' ; that he raised six different kinds of crops ; and that , like Lincoln , he split some rails , though probably they were few .

		Most of the letters , which were written to his father and his youngest sister , contain news about family matters , how the children are growing and studying -LRB- `` Fred does not read '' -RRB- , visits to and from relatives in
Kentucky	LOCATION	and
Illinois	LOCATION	, and , before
1861	DATE	, about business mat - ters .

		In a letter of
1857	DATE	this wish is expressed : `` I am anxious to make one more visit home before I get old . ''

		He hesitates about his wife 's visit to
Kentucky	LOCATION	because the boat will make so many landings in free states , and the `` servants may cause trouble . ''

		After selling his farm and going into the real estate business in
St. Louis	LOCATION	, Grant seems to have taken an interest in politics .

		He was defeated by the Free-soilers when he ran as a Democrat for county engineer , and later he failed to get a desired position in the custom house because he was not sufficiently Democratic .

		Of his politics he wrote in
1859	DATE	: `` I never voted an out and out Democratic ticket in my life .

		I voted for
Buchanan	PERSON	to defeat
Fremont	LOCATION	, but not because he was my first choice .

		In all other elections I have universally selected the candidates that in my estimation were the best fitted for the different offices , and it never happens that such men are all arrayed on one side . ''

		The letters of
1861	DATE	contain but little speculation about the outcome of the Secession movement ; in two in - stances only does the writer venture to predict the future : `` My opinion is that the war will be of short duration , '' and `` the negro will never disturb this country again . ''

		A few weeks later 302 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 1	DATE	he withdraws from the field of prophecy with the remark , `` I have changed my mind so much that I do n't know what to think . ''

		Grant 's opinion of secessionists may be seen in the fol - lowing extract from a letter of
April , 1861	DATE	: '' Great allowance should be made for
South Carolin	LOCATION	- ians , for the last generation have been educated , from their infancy , to look upon their Government as oppres - sive and tyrannical and only to be endured till such time as they might have sufficient strength to strike it down .


Virginia	LOCATION	, and other border states , have no such excuse and are therefore traitors at heart as well as in act . ''

		That Genera -RSB- Grant was sometimes somewhat annoyed by his father , who was proud of the growing fame of his son , is shown in the war - time correspondence .

		The father thought that his soldier son was neglected by the newspapers and the authorities , and he sometimes made public his opinions of military leaders and public men , much to the embarrassment of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	.

		The father also requested favors for friends and neighbors , which the son did not wish to grant .

		The following passages exhibit the irritation of the son : '' I can not take an active part in securing contracts .

		If I were not in the army I should do so , but situated as I am it is necessary both to my efficiency for the public good and my own reputation that I should keep clear of
Government	ORGANIZATION	contracts . '' ''

		You are very much disposed to criticise unfavorably from information received through the public press , a portion of which I am sorry to see can look at nothing favorably that does not look to a war upon slavery . '' ''

		I would write you many particulars but you are so imprudent that I dare not trust you with them ; and while on this subject let me say a word .

		I have not an enemy in the world who has done me so much injury as you in your efforts in my defence .

		I require no defend - ers and for my sake let me alone . '' ''

		You are constantly denouncing other general officers and the inference with people naturally is that you get your impressions from me .

		Do nothing to correct what you have already done but for the future keep quiet on this subject . '' ''

		I have no hobby of my own with regard to the negro , either to effect his freedom or to continue his bondage .

		If
Congress	ORGANIZATION	pass any law and the President approves , I am willing to execute it .

		Laws are certainly as binding on the minority as the majority .

		I do not believe in even the discussion of the propriety of laws and official orders by the army .

		One enemy at a time is enough and when he is subdued it will be time enough to settle personal differences . ''

		The post-bellum correspondence is scanty and of less interest ; but here and there are strik - ing passages , for example , he says that the strikes of
1877	DATE	`` should have been put down with an iron hand and so summarily as to pre - vent a like occurrence for a generation . ''

		In 1 8 8 he fears that the Democratic party will return to power , but , he says , '' I sincerely hope that the North will so thoroughly rally by next elec - tion as to bury the last remnant of secession proclivities , and put in the Executive chair a firm and steady hand , free from Utopian ideas purifying the party electing him out of exist - ence . ''

		Perhaps the most characteristic letter in the collection is the following brief note to a relative , in which he breaks the news of his financial misfortunes : '' I regret that I have not more cheerful news to write you than I have .

		Financially the
Grant	PERSON	family is ruined for the present , and by the most stupendous frauds ever perpetrated .

		But your Aunt
Jennie	PERSON	must not fret over it .

		I still have a home and as long as I live she shall enjoy it as a matter of right ; at least until she recovers what she has lost .

		Fred is young ^ active , honest , and intelligent , and will work with a vim to recuperate his losses .

		Of course his first effort will be to repay his aunts . ''

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 303 them when the child
Percival	PERSON	shall have reached his majority .

		But fate so has it that
Percival	PERSON	and Hollo are thrown together as children , and become devoted friends .

		As they approach manhood , both love the same girl , who loves the former , but becomes pledged to the latter through the urging of her match-making mother .

		Then the great revelation is made to Per - cival , who can not bring himself to accept , at the cost of his comrade 's happiness , the title which might be his .

		The matter is brought home to him poignantly when he finds that the secret is also known to a lackey , crazed with socialistic folly , who is determined to reveal it .

		Percival has an encounter with this fel - low , and the Gordian knot of the whole complication is cut when he receives a fatal wound in his struggle for the mastery .

		Thus does he finally qualify for the ascription of the title which Mr.
Hutchinson	PERSON	has given to the story , and which is meant for its hero .

		This is a very beautiful and vital book , with a great deal of outdoors in it , besides its other elements of humor , pathos , movement , suspense , and romance .

		Its outdoor phase is chiefly related to the gypsy car - avan with which
Percival	PERSON	travels for a time , and in which he becomes an adept in the `` manly '' art .

		His fight with the bully of the caravan is one of the most vivid in literature , and is hardly surpassed by either Borrow or Meredith .

		The character of the gypsy girl whose love for
Percival	PERSON	remains unre - quited is one of the most striking and sympathetic in the novel , and hardly less so is that of her phil - osophical father .

		The book is one that stands out conspicuously among the novels of the year .

		A forecast of the future is essayed by `` G. A.
Birmingham	LOCATION	'' -LRB- the Rev.
J. O. Hannay	PERSON	-RRB- in `` The Red Hand of Ulster , '' the latest of his delightful inventions .

		The deadly seriousness of the discus - sion which has attended the Home Rule bill during its stormy passage through the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	is relieved by Mr.
Hannay	PERSON	's humorous handling of the subject , which toys with this grave political problem in the most delightful fashion .

		One
J. P. Conroy	PERSON	, an Irish - American of great wealth , casting about for something which shall bring the element of excitement into the monotonous course of his existence , turns his attention to Ulster , and resolves to finance the revolution which he sees to be impend - ing .

		One would suppose that the sympathies of such a man would be with the Nationalists , but to join forces with them would be too tame a proceeding , and the romantic possibilities of an alliance with the unionists , determined not to be set under the heel of a hated alien government , prove irresistible in their appeal to him .

		There is evidently much more fun to be got out of a revolution than out of mere acqui - escence in the ruthless plan of the government to crush the liberties of the protestant counties of the north of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		So
Conroy	PERSON	lays his plans , and pulls the right strings , in consequence whereof the revolt is soon organized , and preparations for armed resistance to the change of government are well under way before the authorities have any definite notion of what is going on .

		A situation which is likely to become grim reality in the near future , if the government persists in its mad plan to coerce the liberties of a brave and determined people , is thus foreshadowed by the novelist , whose belief in the righteousness of Ulster 's cause is very evident , although he never loses his temper in talking about it .

		He is not one of those who say that `` Ulster will blaster , but Ulster will not muster , '' for he knows too well the temper of the people among whom he lives , believing that they will fight for their liberties , , if forced to take that stand , in the spirit of the covenanters or of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's soldiers .

		But the author can not discuss even so grave a problem as - this other than good-naturedly , and so , when it comes to actual fighting in the streets of
Belfast	LOCATION	, he keeps the carnage well out of view .

		The city is bombarded from the harbor , and the fire from , machine-guns sweeps its thoroughfares , but nobody in particular seems to get killed , and the worst damage recorded is the shattering of a statue of Queen Victoria .

		But the government does not dare to force the issue to a desperate conclusion , and makes terms with the insurgents , agreeing to their stipula - tion that it shall withdraw from
Ireland	LOCATION	altogether .

		Thus the delightfully illogical outcome of a rebellion against the imposition upon
Ireland	LOCATION	of a limited sort of home rule is that the government concedes un - limited home rule , and the rebels cheerfully accept it as what they have been fighting for all the while .

		The whole story is told in the gayest of spirits , and the various types of character that such an agitation brings forth the official , the agitator , the indiffer - entist , and the fiery `` patriot '' are limned with ex - traordinary skill and insight into human nature .

		The imperturbable good nature and comic opera spirit of the narrative make it one of the most delightful that the author has written .

		But the matter of which it treats is too serious to be disposed of by solventur risu tabulae , and we apprehend that his - tory will record for it an outcome considerably less .

		farcical than that which is here chronicled .

		Mr.
W. B. Maxwell	PERSON	's novels have a way of mak - ing themselves remembered .

		Thinking over the four or five of them that we have read during the past ten years , we find that they stand out in the memory in theme and general outline far more clearly than most other novels of the same period .

		Each of them has either a distinctive central char - acter or a definite central situation so clear-cut in its presentation , and so skilfully built up out of a multitude of significant details that it makes an impression not easily effaced .

		There are few digressions or irrelevances , and not much episod - ical matter for the distraction of the attention .

		These considerations apply to `` General
Mallock	PERSON	's Shadow , '' which is a fine example of the art of writing a strong and interesting novel .

		General
Mallock	PERSON	is a man who nurses a grievance until his mentality shades into monomania , and his brain is on the verge of collapse , when its equilibrium is restored by a sharp crisis in his life , which calls into renewed activity his old-time powers , effectively 304 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	arresting the forces of decay .

		Many years before the story opens , he had been the commander of a forlorn hope on an outpost of the Indian frontier , and had surrendered to the enemy to save the lives of the women and children .

		For this he had been severely censured , and his name had been removed from the army list .

		Now , in his solitary house on the
Yorkshire	LOCATION	moors , he is found brooding , as he has done ever since the disaster , over the injustice done him by the authorities .

		His household includes a son and two daughters , and over them all the shadow has lain from their childhood .

		For the hand of his elder daughter , whose life is devoted to the care of her ageing parent , there appear two suitors a country physician , and a titled land - owner among whose properties is a large stone - quarry .

		The latter has difficulties with his men , which culminate in a strike and much violence .

		In the denouement , the house is attacked by several hundred angry rioters , for the purpose of capturing an obnoxious manager who has taken refuge within its walls .

		It has for its defense the General and his daughters , the two suitors , and a few servants .

		In this crisis , the old General throws off his lethargy , becomes once more the commander in the field , and takes complete direction of events , giving his orders with sharp decision .

		After a four hours ' siege , the enemy is repulsed , and this defeat puts an end to the strike .

		All
England	LOCATION	rings with the ex - ploit , and both compliments and honors are heaped upon the old man , making tardy but complete repa - ration for the disgrace of many years before .

		The stirring scene , and the moving narrative of what fol - lows , bring the story to a fine ending .

		`` The Royal Road '' -LRB- an ironical title -RRB- is the story of
Teddy Hankey	ORGANIZATION	, a
London	LOCATION	workingman in the fierce grip of circumstance , told in staccato style by Mr.
Alfred Ollivant	PERSON	.

		Teddy is a very common sort of individual , the type of his class , who saddles himself with a family before his prospects warrant such a venture , and then runs through all the gamut of distress and illness until fate is too much for him , and he becomes a victim of the great white plague .

		It is a pathetic story of the slums , intense in its development , and minute in its sordid realism , and doubtless the counterpart of what occurs to thousands who struggle for a livelihood in the Great Wen .

		Teddy has a spring of hope in his breast which keeps him buoyant nearly to the end , and the vision of what may be a pitiful cockney vision , at best makes his path to the grave a '' royal road '' in some sort of transcendental sense .

		A story of purely human interest , unconcerned with any problem and not depending upon any historical setting as a lure to the attention , a story of fine texture and engrossing charm , is found in Mr.
Ronald McDonald	PERSON	's ''
Lanchester	PERSON	of Braze - nose . ''

		Lanchester is a successful novelist and war - correspondent , happily married , as he supposes .

		Returning to
London	LOCATION
late one night	TIME	, some hours in advance of his expected arrival , he discovers a man in the house , and his wife in a suspicious state of agitation .

		She has certainly been indiscreet , and , despite her protestations of innocence , he leaves his home , engages lodgings elsewhere , and the next day sends for his personal belongings .

		Soon thereafter , two letters are interchanged , hers to the effect that she has not been unfaithful , his to the effect that whether unfaithful or not she has shattered his idol .

		Her letter is returned as an enclosure with his , and thereby ensues a complication not fully to be un - tangled for years .

		These two letters are captured by a prying nurse-maid , who substitutes blank sheets for them , and burns the latter at the command of her mistress , and in her presence .

		Lanchester , after reflection , finding himself unwilling to return to his wife , takes the quixotic position that the divorce must come from her , and manufactures evidence that shall be sufficient to convict him of both cruelty and adultery .

		Thus he makes himself a kind of outcast , and spends several years in foreign wander - ings .

		During these years , one of his oldest friends , believing her to be a deeply injured woman , wins the love of the divorced wife , and persuades her to marry him .

		Returning to
England	LOCATION	,
Lanchester	PERSON	learns what has happened , and becomes greatly con - cerned about his child , custody having been given to the mother by the court .

		He learns that the child is deprived of a mother 's love , and , although well cared for , is growing up into a mollycoddle through lack of judicious education .

		He is determined to get possession of his boy , and , having no legal rights , resorts to kidnapping .

		The plot is successful , and all
England	LOCATION	rings with it , thus bringing the secreted letters back into the story .

		For the woman who holds them writes to the mother threatening their disclosure to the husband unless the child is per - mitted to remain with his father .

		At this point the story takes a new angle , for the father , hastening from pursuit with his child , falls in with an old
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	acquaintance , now the actor-manager of a provincial theatrical troupe .

		He asks to be taken in as a member of the company , which he believes will prove an effective mode of concealment .

		His request is granted , and from now on the story has a strong theatrical tinge .

		It is ''
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	'' over again , and all the other novels in which the ex - periences of a travelling theatrical company are made a means for the development of character and the devising of plot .

		Lanchester becomes the good angel of the company , helps it over many a rough spot , writes a play for it , leases a
London	LOCATION	theatre , and falls in love with the young woman known as '' Divvy-Di , '' who is the genius of the troupe .

		Meanwhile , the child is very happy with his newly - found father and friends , and rapidly developes the manly qualities that his father so wishes , and that have never before had a chance .

		When the com - pany comes to
London	LOCATION	, the secreted letters make a final appearance in the plot , for the ci-devant nurse - maid has a husband , who steals them , and proceeds to use them for blackmailing purposes .

		How Lan - chester and '' Divvy-Di '' get on his track , hunt him down , and get hold of the letters , is a thrilling
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 305 story all by itself , and fills the closing chapters of the novel .

		The letters are destroyed ,
Lanchester	PERSON	's former wife is freed from her haunting fear , and
Lanchester	PERSON	wins in the new love more than he had lost in the old one of years agone .

		This summary is far from doing justice to either the ingenuity , the dramatic force , or the all-pervading charm of the novel , which is one of the very best of the year 's output .

		For a story of adventure , thrilling to the last degree , and free from descriptive or psychological padding , Mr.
Frederick Ferdinand Moore	PERSON	's `` The Devil 's Admiral '' is to be highly commended .

		It is a story of the
China	LOCATION	seas , where `` the devil 's ad - miral '' is a name to conjure with .

		He is a mysteri - ous person , who somehow boards one ship after another , and works his fell purpose to such effect that the ship is never heard of again , and no one is left living to tell the tale of its tragic fate .

		It is left to an English journalist to solve the mystery , and put the fiend out of business .

		The action takes place on the
Kut Sang	LOCATION	, bound from
Manila	LOCATION	to
Hong Kong	LOCATION	, and a sanctimonious missionary , calling him - self the Reverend
Luther Meeker	PERSON	, is revealed as '' the devil 's admiral . ''

		He has a gang of allies in the ship 's company , and when the hour is ripe , they mutiny under his direction , take possession of the ship and its consignment of specie , and bury the loot upon a desert island .

		But the journalist and the Yankee skipper outwit the pirate chief , put an end to his evil life , and recover the gold .

		It is almost as good as `` Treasure Island , '' and will delight the hearts of all boys , young and old alike .

		Mr.
Robert Herrick	PERSON	has long been recognized as one of the most minutely observant and conscientious interpreters in fiction of American life .

		Despite his absolute lack of the vital quality of humor , and despite the jaundiced eye which reports his search - ing , and often clinical , investigations , his work has the sharpness of etching , and one is always conscious of the acid which bites the lines .

		`` One Woman 's Life '' is the title of his new novel , and it is exactly descriptive , for the work is just -LRB- imaginary -RRB- bio - graphy , remorselessly detailed , with no more plot than the average commonplace life exhibits , and no moments more dramatic than are likely to be found in the career of the ordinary mortal .

		It is the life - history of
Milly Ridge	ORGANIZATION	, between the ages of sixteen and forty .

		Milly is a girl without education , and with no social position except what she can make for herself , a girl of humble station with which she is anything but content , a girl determined to `` get on , '' a girl who realizes that there are better things in life than her immediate environment offers , and whose instincts lead her unerringly into the ways whereby these desirable things may be encompassed .

		She is a good girl , conventionally virtuous , kindly of dis - position , but firm in the conviction t hat the world is her oyster , and determined to possess herself of its succulent contents .

		When she comes to
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1885	DATE	at the beginning of the story , fate plants her upon the West Side , and she makes the best of it by going to the right church , cultivating the right acquaintances among the congregation , and getting herself sent to the right school .

		Then she contrives to get her father to plunge into business for himself , and to take an expensive house on the
North Side	LOCATION	, where her beauty and amiability soon make her a social favorite .

		About the time of the World 's Fair , she engages herself to a wealthy bachelor , but after a while balks at his personal characteristics , and breaks off the match in a pet .

		Then a visit to
Mackinac	LOCATION	, `` on the shore of Lake Superior , '' leads to a quasi-engagement with a well-to-do
California	LOCATION	fruit-grower .

		Before this is consummated , however , she becomes fascinated by a young newspaper-artist who earns thirty dollars a week , and throws discre - tion to the winds by marrying him .

		They go abroad , live in
Paris	LOCATION	for a couple of years , and a child is born to them .

		But European life under these con - ditions is not what fancy had painted it , and she is not sorry to return to
America	LOCATION	when their funds give out .

		Settled in
New York	LOCATION	, she develops gifts as a spender which drive her husband to overwork , and he succumbs to pneumonia .

		Then Milly culti - vates the acquaintance of a celibate woman , the successful manager of a laundry , and enters into a housekeeping arrangement with her .

		Becoming restless , she conceives the plan of starting a French pdtisserie in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and persuades her friend to stake her capital upon the venture .

		The Cake Shop is triumphantly successful for a year or two ; then the expert servants drift away , the cakes get soggier , and the trade falls off until the doors of the estab - lishment have to be closed .

		At this juncture , the
California	LOCATION	suitor opportunely turns up , and
Milly	PERSON	is willing to become the mistress of his ranch .

		She is thus comfortably provided for , and the story ends , or rather dribbles out , as most actual life-stories do .

		Milly has had many kinds of experiences , and has learned shrewdly to profit by them .

		She has got from the world less than she wanted , but probably more than she was entitled to expect .

		Her story is that of `` one woman 's life , '' but it is typical of all the class of ambitious , restless , dissatisfied women which is at least a numerous one in our dynamic civilization .

		We think that the author places him - self a little too much upon
Milly	PERSON	's side in her rebel - lion against surroundings in which a woman of better poise and more normal temperament would find a reasonable degree of satisfaction .

		Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	has now lived in
Chicago	LOCATION	for the greater part of twenty years , and all the time he has been pouring forth a stream of caustic comment upon the many phases of its life .

		He does not like the place , and assumes to - ward it invariably the offensive attitude of the superior person .

		And to him the
West Side	LOCATION	, with its church - going habits , its na'ive domesticities , and its feeble gropings after culture , is simply `` impossible . ''

		Yet the
West Side	LOCATION	is preeminently that part of
Chicago	LOCATION	in which the wholesome life of the home is most in evidence , and in which the simple virtues which lie at the basis of American civilization are most gen - erally practiced .

		But to Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	it is , even 306 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	more than
Chicago	LOCATION	as a whole , the quintessence of meanness , sordidness , and vulgarity .

		Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	's latest story , like his others of recent years , is an example of maundering that is extremely disheartening to those of us who discerned in `` The Choir Invisible '' and some of the earlier books an artistic distinction which almost seemed to promise us a second
Hawthorne	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	seems now to have made fetich of style , in which he is not above toying with conceits and to lead his story-telling gift into a morass of psycho - logical analysis . ''

		The Heroine in Bronze '' has no story worth speaking of .

		It tells -LRB- in the first person -RRB- of the calf-love of a poor young author for a girl of wealth and high social position .

		He is a bumptious youth who can not possibly be taken at anything like his own valuation .

		That the girl eventually does so take him does more credit to her heart than to her intelligence .

		Here and there , the story has pages of beautiful prose that is unmarred by affectation or preciosity , but as a narrative , or as a serious depiction of character , it is naught .

		And such stilted conversation as engages the youth and the maid bears little resemblance to the actualities of human or even of lovers ' intercourse .

		The publishers of `` My Little Sister , '' by Miss
Elizabeth Robins	PERSON	, describe the work as `` an intense story , '' which it assuredly is .

		Three-quarters of it describes the life of an English country household a mother and two daughters in intimate portrayal and keen characterization , but all the time with a sense of impending disaster .

		Then the tragic climax comes , swiftly and sharply , with the sister 's journey to
London	LOCATION	to visit
Aunt Josephine	PERSON	, whom neither of them has ever seen .

		For one of the vultures who prey upon girlhood has learned of the visit , and the girls are met at the station by a procuress , imper - sonating their aunt , who carries them off to '' one of the most infamous houses in
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		During the
evening	TIME	, the eyes of the elder sister -LRB- who tells the story -RRB- are opened to their situation , and a man among the company who has not lost all sense of decency helps her to escape from the house .

		She rushes frantically to the real aunt , and to the police , for assistance , but in her excitement she has for - gotten to locate the house of sin , and can not guide the rescuers to the place where her sister is held .

		All her efforts are fruitless , and the sister sinks out of sight forever .

		The book , which has great power , is obviously written as a tract , and gives one a grip - ping realization of the horrors of white slavery .

		It must be urged against it that a girl of such a family , of such high social standing , would be less likely than another to be sought as a victim of such designs , which inherent improbability considerably weakens the tragic force of the very moving and poignant narrative .

		Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's `` The Reef '' has all the charm of diction and subtlety of elaboration that we are accustomed to expect from her work ; it only just misses the kind of distinction that characterizes `` The Valley of Decision , '' for example .

		We could imagine it to have been written by any one of sev - eral other people , something which we could not possibly imagine of the masterpiece which we have just named .


George Darrow	PERSON	, a young English diplomat , is on his way from
England	LOCATION	to
France	LOCATION	to meet the woman whom he has long loved , and who he hopes will consent to become his wife .

		She is
Anna Leath	PERSON	, a widow with a child and an adult stepson .

		On the way , he receives a telegram which postpones his visit , and he is considerably upset thereby .

		Among his fellow-passengers is a girl who seems to be in distress , and he befriends her .

		She is a `` companion '' out of a situation because she could not put up with a cantankerous employer .

		Friendless and almost penniless , she accepts Dar - row 's proffered friendship , which includes compan - ionship as well as material aid .

		They spend a few days in
Paris	LOCATION	, seeing the sights and going to the theatres , and then they part .

		This is `` the reef '' upon which
Darrow	PERSON	's happiness is wrecked .

		It all seems innocent enough , and we hardly suspect , not having the cynical viewpoint , that it is not .

		But when
Darrow	PERSON	eventually finds himself the guest of Mrs.
Leath	PERSON	, he discovers his travelling acquaintance installed in the household as a governess to the child , and already the object of the stepson 's affections .

		Mrs.
Leath	PERSON	gets wind of the girl 's previous acquaint - ance with
Darrow	PERSON	, and puts the worst possible con - struction upon it , a construction which we are con - strained to accept from his admissions as the true one .

		Up to this point the reader , although he may have had suspicions , has on the whole believed
Darrow	PERSON	to have been guilty of nothing more than an indiscretion , and to have given this impression is obviously a fault of construction .

		As a result of this complication , both engagements are broken off , and the girl goes off to
India	LOCATION	with her former em - ployer .

		The situation becomes very tense at the height of the argument , and is handled with Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's marvellous skill in the analysis of motive .

		But we can not escape many a pang of sympathy for the four lives thathave broken to pieces on `` the reef . ''

France	LOCATION	.


Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- contains a survey of the history of the ^ French Republic from the war with
Germany	LOCATION	to the end of the administration of President Fallieres .

		The author is , we believe , an English newspaper correspondent who has spent most of his life in
France	LOCATION	and has enjoyed the acquaintance of a large number of French scholars and men of affairs , concerning many of whom he writes with the information that comes from per - sonal knowledge .

		He describes in turn the war with the Germans , the work of the national assembly and the government of
Thiers	ORGANIZATION	, the efforts of the pretend - ers and their followers to re-establish the monarchy ,
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 307 the administrations of all the Presidents beginning with
Thiers	PERSON	, the rise and fall of the more than fifty cabinets that have governed the
Second Republic	ORGANIZATION	, French , foreign , and colonial policy , the relations between
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	, the rise and collapse of the Boulangist movement , the
Panama	LOCATION	scandal , the anarchist terror , the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	affair , and various other events and movements , political , social , and industrial .

		Some of his narrations , such as those on the rise of
Boulanger	PERSON	and the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	affair , are very informing ; but at times he descends to exces - sive detail , and indulges in trivialities that scarcely deserve mention in a serious history .

		His portraits of French statesmen , with many of whom he was personally acquainted , are generally interesting .

		For
Gambetta	PERSON	he expresses high admiration ; but he does not ignore , as many historians do , the faults of that great man .

		GreVy he pictures as personally a very honest and able man , though an impersonal President who in his last years was too old and infirm to exert any marked influence on public affairs .

		Carnot , unlike GreVy , travelled much about
France	LOCATION	, showed himself to the people , took part in their national fetes , and was widely popular .

		Casimir-Perier was a man of great wealth , and did not desire the Presidency .

		He possessed masterful qualities and was a fighter , in consequence of which he was quite out of place as President ; for the Presi - dent of
France	LOCATION	is expected to play an impersonal role , and leave the government to the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	and ministers .

		He had a deep sense of his respon - sibility as the chief executive , and when he found that his office was one of impotency he resigned in disgust after having occupied it less than six months .

		Faure , like
Carnot	PERSON	, was fond of travelling ; but he was a man of inordinate vanity , addicted to display , and he introduced at the Elyse'e ceremonies such as had characterized the court functions of the days of the Empire and the
Monarchy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nevertheless , while
Faure	PERSON	had his faults he possessed certain good qual - ities .


France	LOCATION	did well , we are told , when it chose
Loubet	PERSON	to the Presidency .

		He was the best man available , and history will eventually assign to him a really high place in the history of the Republic .

		`` No worthier man was ever President of
France	LOCATION	. ''

		He was firm in his republicanism , tolerant in his religious views , shrewd in his judgment of men , sincerely patriotic , benevolent to the poor , a staunch friend of every good cause , simple in his life , and extremely solicitous for the well-being of the masses .

		The wakins-up The author of One Way Out , '' who of a sleepy signs himself ''
William Carleton	PERSON	, '' farming town .

		nas f o u owe -LRB- i up that notable success in realistic autobiography and sound democratic doctrine with an even more remarkable narrative of personal experience in `` New Lives for Old '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which he tells how he and his wife took hold of an abandoned New En - gland farm and made it a source of health and happiness and pecuniary profit to them , while at the same time they awoke the community to a realization of its wasted agricultural opportunities and instituted a cooperative system of market-gardening which brought prosperity to the town of `` Brewster '' and all the '' Brewsterites '' fictitious names , evidently .

		The place had been a great unused industrial plant , like hundreds of other neglected farming regions in our eastern states , until the author discerned its possibilities as a feeder to the large city -LRB-
Boston	LOCATION	, presumably -RRB- twenty miles distant ; then , with his ideas and example acting as a leaven , the whole lump of fatalistic indifference and indolence was made effervescent with ambition and activity .

		It was simply the spirit of our pioneer ancestors that he breathed into their degenerate descendants , awakening them to the opportunity knocking un - heeded at their very doors , but being eagerly re - sponded to by the Italian and other foreign tillers of the soil who were taking up as fast as they could the unappreciated acres of the old settlers .

		The plea that western farming has killed eastern farming is shown to be invalid in these days of rapidly rising prices for agricultural products .

		To effect this re-awakening of a lethargic community , various expedients were adopted , such as brass bands and moving pictures , a social club and lecture courses , old-fashioned agricultural fairs and cash prizes for best results in rural industries .

		Advice and help from the
State College of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	were asked and gladly given , which at first went much against the grain of the hayseeds and the moss-backs .

		The book is a fine and inspiriting record of what one man with ideas and initiative and force can do .

		If every farming town that has gone to sleep could be aroused in like manner , `` high cost of living '' might become a meaningless phrase for a large part of the country .

		English and In examining Mr.
C. H. Moore	PERSON	's French church `` Mediaeval Church Architecture of architecture .

		England '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the less care - ful readers of this author 's earlier work on Gothic architecture may be surprised to find that he is not blind to merit in the mediaeval architecture of coun - tries other than
France	LOCATION	.

		The more careful readers , whether they agree or not , have understood his con - tention to be that the French architecture differs from the others in its fundamental principle .

		In his latest book he explicitly disavows any condem - nation of English architecture .

		Nevertheless , he is still insistent on its inferiority to that of
France	LOCATION	.

		He also reaffirms with greater emphasis than ever its totally different structural character , and conse - quently , in his view , its essential difference of style .

		He is now less dogmatic in asserting that the word '' Gothic '' should be confined to the style of the Ile-de-France , though the title of the new book in - dicates that his own preference in the matter has not changed .

		The essential difference in structural principle between English mediaeval architecture and French can hardly be questioned by one not blinded by chauvinism .

		Although Mr.
Moore	PERSON	min - imizes instances of similarity , he rightly maintains 308 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	that the English structural system was based pri - marily on direct resistance to vault thrusts by sheer massiveness of wall ; the French , primarily on trans - mission of thrusts through an organic skeleton .

		That this difference constitutes a difference in architect - ural style depends on whether structural character is an adequate criterion of style .

		May not general artistic impulse be an equally valid criterion ?


Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, more appreciative of spiritual forces , says in his '' Historical Studies of Church Building in the Middle Ages '' : `` The motives which inspired the great buildings of this period , the principles which underlay their forms , the general character of the forms themselves , were in their es - sential nature the same throughout
Western Europe	LOCATION	from
Italy	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	.

		The differences in the work of different lands are but local and external vari - eties . '' ''

		Christian , '' indeed , might be a better name for this pervading architecture ; yet the attempt to confine '' Gothic '' to any single division of it , how - ever superior , is to wrench an accepted term by mere definition .

		The superiority which Mr.
Moore	PERSON	accords to the French structural system , though generally acknowledged , rests likewise on assumptions which are perhaps open to question .

		No argument is adduced that the French churches are stronger , or that their piers obstruct less of the view into the nave , for instance .

		The superiority advanced is solely one of abstract logicality , in the economical and expressive adaptation of structural members to their functions .

		Yet if one can detach one 's self from accustomed veneration of the French monu - ments , one may feel a lack of underlying logic .

		Its possession becomes very dubious when ` one considers the tremendous complexity of the means necessary to obtain the desired effect , and the proved frailty of this system of construction , the original purpose of which was permanence .

		That the surrounding nations felt this defect may have been a reason why , though they adopted the French forms , they did not abandon their own more conservative systems of construction .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's special plea seriously limits the general usefulness of his book .

		The stu - dent , however , will find in it a wealth of accurate observations and painstaking drawings , which make it indispensable in any collection of books on the subject .

		Two new books on social ethics from SL r cSU .

		the point of view of Christianity and the Church Bishop
Chauncey B. Brewster	PERSON	's `` The Kingdom of God in American Life '' -LRB-
Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- and Professor
Scott Nearing	PERSON	's `` Social Religion '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- add to the sym - posium in which we are vigorously engaged .

		Can there be too many speakers ?

		one begins to ask .

		Hardly , for each has a word of his own to say , and a special group ready to listen .

		Bishop
Brewster	PERSON	of
Connecticut	LOCATION	, for instance , addressing an Anglican audience , has little that is new to present to those already liberal in their way of social thinking .

		It is the conservative who may profit by this cautious , well-balanced , and honest book ; and to him its absence of partisan spirit , its grave recognition that we are entering a crisis , even its intelligent cogni - zance of the more radical contemporary forces , may well bring genuine illumination .

		Like Dr.
Rauschenbusch	PERSON	, Bishop
Brewster	PERSON	finds in the infu - sion of the ideal of the Kingdom of God the remedy for our social ills .

		Unlike the bolder thinker , how - ever , this infusion is perceived by him as affecting details rather than as transforming fundamental economic relations .

		Professor Nearing 's book , orig - inally an address given before the
Society of Friends	ORGANIZATION	, breathes a warmer and more invigorating air .

		There is little that is penetrating or broadly synthetic about the author 's thinking , and his constructive sugges - tions are no more definite than those of Bishop
Brewster	PERSON	.

		But the constructive spirit is present , and any progressive -LRB- with either a small or a large P -RRB- might find himself quickened to greater clarity of vision and warmth of feeling by this fearless dis - cussion .

		The author has marshalled his case against modern society well and succinctly , with an abun - dance of telling illustration and sound information .

		The book is a useful compendium of effective facts which a reformer might well carry in his pocket .

		And the insistence in both these books on the service which the
Christian Church	ORGANIZATION	must be roused to render in the process of socializing democracy , through the intellectual attitude as well as through the active work of its members , is an inspiring sign of the times .

		Bird life in ^ lover of birds and a close observer the Scottish of their peculiarities , Mr.
Seton Gor	PERSON	- highiand * .

		don ?

		F.z.S. , M.B.O.U. , writes about them in much the same engaging manner as does Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	, enlivening his pages with char - acteristic anecdotes of bird life and generously shar - ing his ornithological discoveries with the reader .

		`` The Charm of the Hills '' -LRB-
Cassell	PERSON	-RRB- is made up of selected articles of his that have appeared in various British periodicals , such as `` Country Life '' and `` The Scotsman , '' and they are profusely and admir - ably illustrated from photographs taken by the au - thor .

		That he has been able to obtain near views , of so many wild creatures , often in lofty , and diffi - cult situations , speaks well for his zeal and skill and hardihood .

		Photographs of the snow bunting amid the eternal snows of its mountain haunts , of the young of the golden eagle in their initial flight from the eyrie , of the brooding ptarmigan on her nest , with others of equal interest , make up a collection of bird pictures of rather unusual character .

		In number they exceed four-score .

		Highland scenery and other occasional forms of wild life beside birds receive appreciative attention .

		The concluding four of the book 's thirty-five chapters take the form of notes appropriate to the four seasons of the year , and these are followed by a good index .

		In illustra - tion of the author 's habit of observing the unusual or otherwise interesting in bird life , here is an anec - dote .

		`` I was once , '' he says , `` the witness of a
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 309 somewhat novel affray between a green plover and a heavy-looking cormorant .

		The cormorant was winging his way up the estuary of a river , and was flying at a great speed , helped by a following wind , when a lapwing , feeding on the river-side , suddenly swooped out and attacked the stranger with great fury .

		The unwieldy bird was quite taken aback , and after attempting for some little time to avoid the determined onslaught of `` the green plover , half fell to the water , and sought to escape from his enemy by swimming low .

		The lapwing was evi - dently satisfied at the sign of surrender on the part of the cormorant , for it flew off highly gratified with the result of its impromptu sally . ''

		Eighteenth Mr ' AuStin
Dobson	PERSON	' s latest book > century `` At Prior Park and Other Papers '' by - ways .

		-LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , is an excursus into the by - paths and along the hedge-rows of the eighteenth century .

		No one knows this century better than Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	, and few make better guides .

		Only two men of first importance find a place in this vol - ume , and they only in the obscurer events of their lives .

		Garrick 's Grand Tour and Fielding 's sojourn in
Lisbon	LOCATION	are what concern us here with these men .

		Fielding 's life is illuminated by the `` find '' of two of his letters to his brother , which last year sold for 305 .

		Two of the most interesting papers are on places , Prior Park and
Stowe	PERSON	, haunts of famous lit - erary men of the century .

		The essays on Gray 's biographer ,
Mason	ORGANIZATION	, and on
Robert Lloyd	PERSON	suggest an invidious contrast .

		Mason inherited an estate of 1500 a year , and combined '' the most lofty views on poetry with the keenest eye for the financial results '' ;
Lloyd	PERSON	's melancholy story `` exemplifies most of those ills which his great contemporary had gloomily declared to be the allotted portion of letters : ' Toil , Envy , Want , the patron , and the Jail . '

		But he was spared the Patron . ''

		Other papers are on the painters ,
Carmontelle	PERSON	and Loutherbourg , and on the French pre-revolutionary sailor ,
Bailli de Suffren	PERSON	, who came into quite close touch with the English in war .

		Carmontelle has given us the single picture of the two Garricks , the tragic and the comic ;
Loutherbourg	LOCATION	, besides being an
R.A.	LOCATION	, was for a while scene painter for
Garrick	PERSON	.

		A disappearing The Rev.

England	LOCATION	.

		man > an -LRB- j putting it to good use in a literary way , adds to his admirable studies of the old - time parson and the parish clerk a third antiquarian treatise , of a flavor not destitute of piquancy , on `` The Old English Country Squire '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- , a personage now rapidly going the way of the dodo and the ichthyosaurus , and therefore caught by Dr.
Ditchfield	PERSON	's camera just in the nick of time .

		The book completes the author 's rural trilogy , and pre - serves in convenient and attractive form much scat - tered information , from books and from unpublished sources , on a character full of picturesque interest to every lover of English literature and English history .

		Viewing the squire from all sides and in every possible light , the author sketches for us the squire of ancient days , the Elizabethan squire , the seventeenth-century squire , the squire in his attitude toward religion , the sporting squire , the
Yorkshire	LOCATION	squire , the squire in literature , popular squires , eccen - tric squires , and other sorts of squires ; also the squire 's lady , his house , his garden , stories of squires ,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's caricature of the old-time squire , and a German view of the English squire .

		Not unnatur - ally the writer is indignant at the Whig historian 's unflattering picture of Tory squires and parsons , a picture which he reproduces in full before proceed - ing to prove it a monstrous caricature .

		For the purposes of this demonstration he avails himself of Sir
George Reresby Sitwell	PERSON	's privately printed `` Letters of the Sitwells and Sacheverells , '' with other information more or less curious and rare .

		But after all , as the general reader will still remain convinced from his studies in English history and literature , the old-time squire was not a person of polish or even of great intelligence , however useful and praiseworthy as a part of the established order of things .

		The '' German view '' above-named is the work of a certain Professor von Holtzendorff , and was given to the world half a century ago .

		It now furnishes matter for a readable chapter in Dr.
Ditchfield	PERSON	's book .

		Many illustrations , chiefly from old prints , and eight of them in color , enliven the work .

		A transplanted Mr ''
Arthur K Bostwick	PERSON	, born and Easterner in bred in the
East	LOCATION	, where he rose to a the
Middle West	LOCATION	.

		p O8 iti O n of responsibility in the
New York Public Library	LOCATION	, but for the last few years a resident of the
Middle West	LOCATION	, where he is doing good work as head of the
St. Louis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, is well qualified to contrast the manners and customs of these two sections of the country , as he does in a bright and entertaining fashion , with play of humor and apt introduction of anecdote , in his book on `` The Different West '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , the adjective having reference to the points of unlikeness between East and
West	LOCATION	.

		His brief chapters , written in the briskly journalistic style of one who is more than a mere reporter , treat chiefly of flying impressions , of the
East	LOCATION	's misunderstanding of the West and the
West	LOCATION	's misunderstanding of the
East	LOCATION	, of the West 's political and economic unrest , of education and lit - erature , science , and art , in the West , of society in the West , of the sources of the West 's population , and of the speech and manners of the
West	LOCATION	.

		A dexterous use of new or unusual terms , as `` hyste - resis '' -LRB- of obvious Greek derivation -RRB- to denote a certain slowness of perception , heightens the enjoy - ment here and there .

		The tone of the book and its author 's style are well illustrated in the following passage : '' I have sat in a faculty group in a western state university , in the rooms of one of their num - ber .

		All were merrily jesting and drinking beer , and with them sat the honored president of the 310 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	university , similarly employed .

		Many holders of western chairs , if perchance their eyes fall on this page , will ask , with open eyes , ' Well !

		why not ? '

		There is absolutely no reason ' why not ' ; but if you go to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, or
New Haven	LOCATION	, or
Princeton	LOCATION	to see a similar gathering , you will wait until the infer - nal regions are sheathed with a very heavy coating of ice . ''

		The treatise is not profound , and is not meant to be , but it abounds in shrewd observation and illuminating comment .

		An anthology Mr ' W ' H <
Beveridge	PERSON	's `` John and of thoughts Irene '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- has for its sub - about women .

		title u ^ Anthology of Thoughts on Women . ''

		The sub-title best describes the work , for the `` John and Irene '' part consists only of a prefatory note of about a dozen pages .

		John , it seems , was a feminist with advanced ideas about woman .

		He met
Irene	PERSON	, who was not a feminist , wooed her , wedded her , and awakened her mind to such an extent that she soon distanced her husband in championship of her suppressed sex .

		Then she read one of Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	's books , and came to the conclusion that a true woman could not live in the degradation of the marriage bond .

		She ac - cordingly parted from her husband , who became a misogynist ; but the work goes on , for the torch has passed into
Irene	PERSON	's hands , and she sees that the light is kept burning .

		We could wish that there were more of this story , for the anthology which it prefaces is not nearly as interesting .

		This is to be taken , we are told , `` as being an accompaniment to that story , a sort of continuous Greek chorus of general reflections , indicating the topics and the tendency of the drama , but forming part of it only at rare moments of crisis . ''

		There are some eight hundred extracts altogether , classified progressively under the heads of `` The Meeting , '' `` The Conver - sations '' -LRB- which are very lengthy and comprehen - sive -RRB- , `` The Quarrel , '' and `` Convalescence . ''

		The compiler of this anthology has roamed far and wide in search of his citations , and his collection of com - ments with a cynical turn is particularly choice .

		Further Sir
Henry Lucy	PERSON	's chatty volume , memoriet of '' Sixty Years in the Wilderness , '' '' Tob V ' M - p '' has been followed with little delay by a second of the same title , with the added sub-title , '' More Passages by the Way '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		This later selection of memories and letters was half promised in the preface to the earlier , where the author wrote in regard to his decision to limit his first venture to one volume : '' If the gentle public please , they shall have the other at a later time . ''

		And now an `` exceeding generosity of response en - courages fulfilment of the conditional undertaking . ''

		From
1870	DATE	to the end of
1891	DATE	the reminiscences , with extracts from the author 's diaries and corre - spondence , ramble agreeably through the field of European and especially English politics , with many side excursions into adjacent domains .

		On an early page is found a contribution to the history of English literature , in the form of an extract from '' The Sporting Magazine '' describing the Derby of
1837	DATE	, set side by side with
Disraeli	PERSON	's account of the same famous race in his ''
Sybil	PERSON	. ''

		The two are almost identical .

		Among the many pen portraits of celeb - rities is one of
Arabi Pasha	PERSON	in his exile at
Colombo	LOCATION	, studying English and making translations in an exercise-book , and exulting with almost childish vanity in his fancied progress in the language .

		General
Boulanger	PERSON	, too , is shown in a near view , not greatly to his advantage .

		Since their recent appearance in the '' Cornhill '' these '' passages by the way '' have been considerably amplified .

		Punch 's cartoon -LRB- '' Sir
Toby	PERSON	, M. P. '' -RRB- celebrating the knight - ing of its famous contributor appears as frontispiece .

		The creator of The new biography of
James Fen	PERSON	- `` Leather - imore Cooper , by Miss
Mary E.	PERSON	stocking . ''

		Phillips , will be welcomed as a sup - plement to Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's admirable critical account of the novelist .

		Miss
Phillips	PERSON	's emphasis is exclusively on the man , not the author ; by means of a wealth of illustrations -LRB- hundreds of them , in fact -RRB- and of quotation '' from every available source since the earliest mention of the author 's name , both in print and out , '' the physical appearance of
Cooper	PERSON	, his mode of life at home and abroad , and his vigor - ous personality are presented with great distinct - ness .

		As a biographer ,
Miss Phillips	LOCATION	is agreeably nawe and pious rather than gossipy in the usual sense .

		Amazingly uncritical at times , she has clogged her pages with inane quotation and countless irrele - vancies and nothings ; but she has done so with a simple faith that wins an unfailing indulgence on the part of the reader .

		After all , there are two kinds of small talk , one springing from a talent for triviality , the other from a genius for admiration ; and
Miss Phillips	LOCATION	's is clearly the latter .

		Although the book adds nothing of importance to our knowl - edge of
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	, and although it is not written with judgment or with felicity of style , it has ample rea - son for existence in the fact that it is the first delib - erate and elaborate record of Cooper the man .

		The volume contains a rather brief index .

		Old and new Mr '
Francis Gribble	PERSON	, author of many stories of the books of entertaining biography , French stage .

		Acting on this principle , he has made his `` Romances of the French Theatre '' -LRB-
Appleton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- an undeniable contribution to the general reader 's knowledge of sundry stars , now long extinct , of the
Paris	LOCATION	stage .

		For instance , the life of
Marceline Desbordes-Valmore	PERSON	, poet as well as player , has recently been illumined with a flood of fresh light thrown upon it by certain unpublished documents , and this illumination is reflected in some of Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	's pages .

		Not the least of the services which this new edition does for us is that of calling renewed attention to the author 's half-forgotten earlier works , which are , if anything , better tban his '' best sellers '' of recent years .

		The interesting ''
Cambridge Manuals of Science	ORGANIZATION	and Literature '' now number an even fifty volumes .

		The latest issues are : '' The Civilization of Ancient Mexico , '' by Mr.
Lewis Spence	PERSON	; ''
China	LOCATION	and the Manchus , '' by Professor
Herbert A. Giles	PERSON	; '' Brasses , '' by Mr.
J. S. M. Ward	PERSON	; '' The Individual in the Animal Kingdom , '' by Mr.
Julian S. Huxley	PERSON	; `` Brewing , '' by Mr.
A. Chaston Chapman	PERSON	; '' The Psychology of Insanity , '' by Dr. Ber - nard
Hart	PERSON	; and `` The Work of Rain and
Rivers	PERSON	, '' by Dr.
T. G. Bonney	PERSON	.

		These volumes compete very suc - cessfully with those of the ''
Home University Library	ORGANIZATION	, '' and , like them , deserve to be widely known .

		Two small volumes of '' Short-Story Masterpieces , '' containing characteristic stories of ten French authors translated into English , with Introductions , by Dr.
J. Berg Esenwein	PERSON	, editor of ''
Lippincott	PERSON	's Magazine , '' are issued under the imprint of the
Home Correspondence School of Springfield	ORGANIZATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		The writers rep - resented are Coppe'e , de Maupassant ,
Daudet	LOCATION	, Me ` rime'e ,
Pierre Loti	PERSON	,
Balzac	LOCATION	,
Hale	PERSON	`` vy , Theuriet ,
Gautier	PERSON	, and
Anatole France	LOCATION	.

		In the general introduction the trans - lator analyzes the French short-story as a national genre , principally from the point of view of technique , and also suggests a few of the important forces in French life which have influenced its highly individualized content .

		A brief essay on the author prefaces each of the short - stories .

		Mr.
John Macy	PERSON	thinks that most manuals of Amer - ican literature fail to exhibit a proper sense of propor - tion .

		Believing that '' a living lion is better than a dead mouse , '' he would give Mr.
Riley	PERSON	a place rather than
Bryant	PERSON	, and Father
Tabb	PERSON	rather than
Taylor	PERSON	.

		He also claims that a chapter on
William James	PERSON	belongs in any book '' in which a chapter on tbat dreadful bore ,
Jona	PERSON	- than
Edwards	PERSON	, would pass unchallenged , '' which seems - to us a happier opinion tban tbe other .

		It is in the spirit of these observations that Mr.
Maey	PERSON	has written hi * breezy work on '' The Spirit of American Literature '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- , a work which the young lions of news - paper criticism will doubtless take to their hearts .

		It will not be taken very seriously by anyone else .

		Two new additions to the ''
Macmillan	PERSON	Standard Li - brary '' are
Lafeadio Hearn	PERSON	's ``
Japan	LOCATION	: An Attempt at Interpretation '' and Mr.
Liberty H. Bailey	PERSON	's '' The Country Life Movement in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Nearly forty volumes are now ready in this series , comprising some of the most noteworthy recent contributions to serious thought .

		Such books as these , in so substantial a form and at so low a price -LRB-
fifty cents	MONEY	-RRB- , constitute a decided boon .

		The same publishers have begun publi - cation of a '' Modern Fiction Library , '' in similar form and at the same price .

		The first volumes are Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	's '' The Reign of Law , '' Mr.
William Stearns Davis	PERSON	's `` A Friend of Caesar , '' Mr.
Richard Washburn	PERSON	Child 's ''
Jim Hands	PERSON	, '' and Mr.
Jack Lon	PERSON	- don 's '' Burning Daylight . ''

		Mr.
L. P. Gratacap	PERSON	's '' Popular Guide to Minerals '' -LRB-
D. Van Nostrand Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , now in its second edition , is intended chiefly for the use of visitors to public cabinets ` and collections of minerals , but is so arranged that it forms an adequate text for elementary teaching in mineralogy as well .

		Its value as a universal guide-book is enhanced by the fact that the system of classification here adopted is the same as the succession observed in the fifth and sixth editions of
Dana	PERSON	's '' System of Min - eralogy . ''

		To those unacquainted with the general scientific aspects of mineralogy and its connection with related sciences , the introductory chapters will prove of interest .

		A new chapter on the
Bement Collection	ORGANIZATION	of minerals in the
American Museum of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	has been added .

		It can hardly be said that Mr.
W. H. Hudson	PERSON	's '' Story of the Renaissance '' -LRB-
Cassell	PERSON	-RRB- fills a long-felt want , but it does put into convenient form a treatment of tbe various aspects of the Renaissance , and will serve admirably as an introduction to a more extended course of reading or study in the history , art , and literature of this period .

		The book does not pretend to be an orig - inal contribution ; it does not do more than bring to - gether facts that are familiar enough to the scholar for the benefit of his zealous brother who would extend the boundaries of his learning beyond those set in the edu - cative pages of tbe popular magazine .

		The author is a staff Lecturer to the
University Extension Board of tlfe University of London	ORGANIZATION	, and the book smacks of the Ex - tension course .

		At any rate it would form an admirable 312 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	book of reference for such a course .

		It is none the worse for this , but one should not go to it with the expectation of finding in it any new thing .

		A second edition of '' Food in Health and Disease , '' by Dr.
Nathan S. Davis	PERSON	, Jr. , is published by
Messrs. P. Blakiston 's Son & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author 's aim has been to provide an up-to-date and practical hand-book of dietetics ; and recent additions to the knowledge of physiology and the management of diseases by diet have demanded a revision and rewriting , in large part , of the original text .

		The main sections of the book are de - voted to discussions of the general principles of diet , diet in health , and diet in disease ; and , aside from its technical value , the book should appeal to all who take more than passing interest in matters pertaining to the preservation of health .

		In its present form it consti - tutes one of the fullest treatises on the subject of non - medicinal therapeutics yet contributed by an American author .

		NOTES .

		The plays of Mr.
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	are being collected for publication in book form during the autumn .

		Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	's latest narrative poem , `` The Daffodil Fields , '' will be issued at once in book form by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A book of Central American travel entitled '' The
Southland	ORGANIZATION	of
North America	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
George Palmer Putnam	PERSON	, editor of the Bend -LRB-
Oregon	LOCATION	-RRB- '' Bulletin , '' will be published this month by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		A magazine serial of unusual interest begins in the
April	DATE	'' Scribner '' with the opening chapters of Mr.
John Galworthy	PERSON	's latest novel , '' The Dark Flower . ''

		This is described in a sub-title as '' The Love-Life of a Man :
Spring	DATE	,
Summer	DATE	,
Autumn	DATE	. ''

		Mr.
Winthrop Ames	PERSON	, director of The Little Theatre ,
New York	LOCATION	, is offering a prize of
$ 10,000	MONEY	for the best play by an American author , submitted before
August 15 of this year	DATE	.

		Particulars of the contest may be obtained from Mr.
Ames	PERSON	.

		That Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's popularity is not yet on the wane is indicated by the fact that a new English edition of his works , limited to one thousand sets and priced at twenty-three guineas , has been entirely subscribed for two months in advance of the appearance of the first volumes .

		Some personal recollections of the Irish playwright
J. M. Synge	PERSON	, by Lady
Gregory	PERSON	, appear in the
March	DATE	'' English Review . ''

		This issue also contains an inter - esting study of `` George Meredith : Freethinker , '' by Mr.
G. W. Foote	PERSON	, embodying some unpublished letters of
Meredith 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The address delivered by Dr.
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	,
Lampton	PERSON	professor of English literature in Yale Uni - versity , before the recent meeting of the
American Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Letters and the
National Institute of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Letters , is published for the first time in the
April	DATE	'' Century . ''

		We learn from Mr.
Clement Shorter	PERSON	's always - interesting literary letter in the
London	LOCATION	'' Sphere '' that Sir
William Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	has been engaged for some time upon an elaborate history of Victorian literature , that the work will consist of six volumes of 200,000 words each , and the first volume will be pub - lished in
October	DATE	of next year .

		Scholarly readers everywhere will rejoice in the an - nouncement that the famous ''
Bohn	PERSON	's Library '' is to be reissued in pocket volumes , cloth-bound , at a shilling each .

		An initial batch of twenty volumes will appear at once . ''


Bohn	PERSON	's '' holds a place apart among all standard series .

		Emerson once said that '' the transla - tions of
Bohn	PERSON	's Library have done for literature what railroads have done for internal intercourse . '' ''

		Bedrock , '' the new English quarterly journal of scientific thought , will be published in this country by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, beginning with the
April	DATE	issue .

		The contents of the forthcoming
April	DATE	issue of the magazine will include the following articles , among others : '' Mimicry , Mutation , and Mendelism , '' by
E. B. Poulton	PERSON	; `` Modern Vitalism , '' by
W. McDougall	PERSON	; and '' Japanese Colonial Methods , '' by
Ellen C. Semple	PERSON	.

		A committee , composed of Messrs.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	,
John Galsworthy	PERSON	,
C. H. Herford	PERSON	,
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, and others , is inviting donations for a memorial to
George Gissing	PERSON	.

		This memorial will take the form of a scholar - ship for the encouragement of literary studies , and will be attached to the
University of Manchester	ORGANIZATION	, which
Gissing	PERSON	attended in his early days .

		It is hoped that not less than
2000	DATE	may be raised , of which amount 200 has been promised .

		A study of Dickens by Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, hitherto unpublished , is soon to appear in
London	LOCATION	.

		Two other volumes on the novelist , announced for
spring	DATE	publica - tion , are '' Studies in
Dickens	LOCATION	, '' by Sir
W. Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	, and ``
Charles Dickens	PERSON	: Social Reformer , '' by Mr.
W. Walter Crotch	PERSON	.

		We understand , also , that a son of
Dickens	PERSON	's famous illustrator and intimate friend ,
Hablot K. Browne	PERSON	-LRB- `` Phiz '' -RRB- , is preparing from his father 's letters and papers a volume of reminiscences of the writer .

		Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	, the Publisher to the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, has just retired at his own wish , after thirty - nine years of work as manager of the
London	LOCATION	busi - ness of the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Humphrey Milford	PERSON	, who has for some years been associated with Mr.
Frowde	PERSON	, has been appointed as his successor .

		Though Mr.
Frowde	PERSON	is retiring from the active supervis - ion of the business , he will , it is understood , be available for consultation , so that his knowledge and experience will not be lost to the Press .

		An unusual number of promising literary biographies appear in the English publishers '
spring	DATE	announcement lists .

		Some of the more important of these are : '' Swin - burne , '' by Mr.
John Drinkwater	PERSON	; ``

1913	DATE	By HENKY JAMES A Small Boy and Others This is the story of
Henry James	PERSON	's own boyhood .

		The little figure of himself , which he sees with characteristic detachment , is as happily depicted as any he has ever drawn .

		Among the surroundings of a
New York	LOCATION	that seems to belong to past ages , the small boy learns his different worlds : that of his family , sharply individualized types , as they must have seemed even without the help of his unequalled characterization , of his schools and tutors , a delightful procession drawn with quite irresistible humor , of his schoolmates and playmates , and of the half-compre - hended but endlessly interesting circle of `` grown-ups '' that make one of the unconscious studies of a child .

		351 AMBASSADOR PAGE .

		Three times and out !

		President
Wilson	PERSON	's third choice for the most important of our diplomatic posts is one that does the highest credit to his intelligence and sound judgment , and the country is to be congratulated upon the acceptance of this exalted position by one who is an embodiment of the finest qualities of Amer - ican idealism .

		Mr.
Walter Hines	PERSON	Page is a man who will really represent us , and whose name will not seem out of place in the list that includes the names of
George Bancroft	PERSON	,
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	,
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	, and
John Hay	PERSON	.

		The President 's first choice for this post occa - sioned some misgivings , for Mr.
Olney	PERSON	was too deeply implicated in the blustering infamy of the Venezuelan episode of
1897	DATE	to seem entirely qualified to serve as the official cementer of cor - dial relations between the two chief branches of the English-speaking race .

		The choice of Pres - ident Emeritus Eliot was not open to any such criticism , and was wholly admirable , except for his advanced age , which would seem to qualify him better for the part of wise counsellor to his fellow-countrymen at home than for his active participation in diplomatic affairs .

		But neither of these objections , nor any other that occurs to us , can be made to Mr.
Page	PERSON	, who is in the prime of life , and who has done nothing to our knowl - edge which should make him persona non grata to any considerable section of the English people .

		Not the least conspicuous merit of this ap - pointment is the fact that it puts an end to the period of vulgar ostentation in our
London	LOCATION	embassy .

		Mr.
Page	PERSON	will not , we are safe in assuming , spend several times his official stipend in the rent of a house .

		That stipend is a nig - gardly one , all things considered , but those of our representatives abroad who cut their coats according to the cloth thus provided are the ones who display the truest patriotism and set the finest example .

		If there is any discredit in the simple living thus conditioned , it is at least not personal ; and if it in any way redounds to the disadvantage of the country , the country has the remedy in its own hands .

		But remembering how well Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	served his country a quar - ter of a century ago in the modest apartment which he occupied , we can not believe that the 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	splendors of
Dorchester House	ORGANIZATION	have given us as a nation any prestige that was worth buying at such a price .

		The most thoughtful organs of British opinion have been prompt to applaud this appointment and to recognize its signifi - cance .

		The
London	LOCATION	`` Nation '' makes the following comment : s '' President
Wilson	PERSON	has made an interesting experi - ment .

		He has boldly reverted to the scholar-diplomat as the type of man most qualified to represent the
United States	LOCATION	abroad .

		In doing so he has paid a silent but striking compliment to the good sense of the British people .

		He has assumed that what we most value in an American ambassador is not his wealth and his ability to lavish it on magnificent houses and huge entertain - ments , but his personality and his achievements and the extent to which he brings with him the true flavor of American life . ''

		The appointment `` fits in with one 's conception of what
America	LOCATION	should be and at her best really is , and it may not be without its useful - ness in restoring to
London	LOCATION	society a more just sense of values . ''

		In conclusion , we are assured that Mr.
Page	PERSON	`` will be recognized as the au - thentic salt of Americanism , and will gain much and suffer nothing by coming to the
London	LOCATION	embassy simply on his own merits as a citizen and a servant of the republic . ''

		One important thing to be said about Mr.
Page	PERSON	is that he will represent the whole country .

		A Southerner by birth , whose active years have been spent almost wholly in the North , he has made it his special mission to bind up the nation 's wounds , and all his work as editor , publisher , author , and public speaker has been done with an eye to the special needs of the section that has not even yet wholly freed itself from the incubus of the social system that caused the great cataclysm of our history .

		In his denunciation of the old-time prejudices that yet linger , and in his constructive suggestions for the future , he has made a powerful plea , and one that has not gone unheeded , for the saving ministries of education and industry .

		Several years ago , he formulated a creed which we will reproduce : '' I believe in the free public training of both the hands and the mind of every child born of woman . ''

		I believe that by the right training of men we add to the wealth of the world .

		All wealth is the creation of man , and he creates it only in proportion to the trained uses of the community ; and , the more men we train , the more wealth everyone may create . ''

		I believe in the perpetual regeneration of society , in the immortality of democracy , and in growth ever - lasting . ''

		It is a good creed , even if it does not embody the whole sum of social idealism , and at least implies most of the things that it does not ex - press .

		And it has this proposition for a corol - lary : '' It is a shining day in any educated man 's growth when he comes to see and to know and to feel and freely to admit that it is just as im - portant to the world that the ragamuffin child of his worthless neighbor should be trained as it is that his own child should be . ''

		We do not suggest that our new ambassador is going to lecture the English people on their shortcomings in the matters of education and industry .

		He could be no more guilty of such tactlessness than of following the amazing exam - ple of his chief when the latter recently exacer - bated English feeling by injecting his own dog - matic opinions into the field of partisan English political controversy .

		He will commit no blaz - ing indiscretions for the sake of the Irish or any other vote .

		But he will be the spokesman of democracy as
Lowell	PERSON	was , and like his pre - decessor , will charm his hearers by the persua - siveness of the gospel that will be implicit in his public utterances .

		He will represent us at our typical best , as
Lowell	LOCATION	and
Phelps	PERSON	and Bay - ard and Hay and
Choate	PERSON	represented us , and his advances will meet the same generous response that was accorded to those men by all the cultivated and high-minded elements of English society .

		In the appointment of Mr. Page the Presi - dent has given earnest of his disposition to set our diplomatic service upon a high plane of character and intelligence .

		The number of foreign posts that have been filled by mere poli - ticians or mere plutocrats has of late years been discouragingly large .

		We believe that the President has a higher conception of these offices than that of using them for the payment of political debts , and that fitness will be the foremost consideration in filling them .

		Above all , we trust that he will avoid the blunders of sending men to countries of whose language and history they are ignorant .

		It would perhaps be too much to demand that the Chinese embassy should be filled by a Sinologist , but it is not too much to insist that our representative in almost any European country should be a man having some acquaintance with the language of the coun - try to which he is sent .

		There is plenty of the right sort of material to choose from , and when a man who does not know Italian or Spanish is sent to
Italy	LOCATION	or
Spain	LOCATION	, or when one who does not know Danish or Dutch is sent to
Denmark	LOCATION	or
Holland	LOCATION	, it always creates an uneasy suspicion that someone is being rewarded for political services or campaign contributions .

		The Van Alen scandal still reeks in the American nostrils ,
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 329 and no President can afford to give us another horrible example of that sort .

		The character of an administration is perhaps better revealed in its diplomatic appointments than by any other test , and we confidently hope that the President will follow the fine lead which he has given us in his appointment to
St. James	LOCATION	.

		From a series of such appointments it will not be a long step to the final goal of our desire to the goal of a permanent diplomatic service in which demonstrated capacity shall mean life tenure , and every trace of spoils shall disappear from the administration of the
State Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		HISTORIES OF LITER A TURE AND A RECENT EXAMPLE .

		What mysterious law of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	exists which compels a History of English Literature written by an Englishman or an American to be dull , is prob - ably beyond investigation .

		The fact is there , how - ever .

		The sprightliest and most vivacious writers , once submitting to the sad mechanic exercise of grinding out chronicles of the intellectual life of our race , become apparently hopeless and produce books calculated to repress the enthusiasm of youth and chill the reasoned ardor of age .

		Is it because they assume extra-judicial functions in their efforts to balance the claims of a thousand writers , and cease to be light-hearted advocates and appreciators ?

		Or is it because the great masters of literature in such a book appear like painted spaces on a card , red , yellow , blue , green , scarlet , turquoise , which the historian revolves slowly , so that they run into each other , yet do not make a dazzling white , only a muddy kind of grey ?

		Or is it because they are like objects in a museum of natural science , and we wander among them and the curator points them out with his wand and seems to triumph over them with his interminable drone , as though to say , `` Poor wretches !

		You were once alive but now you are dead and stuffed and shelved and ticketed in this morgue , and depend entirely on me to rehearse the lively mo - tions of your prime '' ?

		Certainly the chief impression one gets from such books is that the writers of the past are dead .

		The ethereal music and glowing imagery of Shakespeare and
Milton	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	become thin and ghostlike ; the wit of
Dryden	PERSON	and
Congreve	PERSON	and Pope evaporates ; the thronging characters of the novelists and playwrights can not lift themselves up from the dismal pages .

		Yet if we only throw our his - tory of literature aside and go to the books it treats of , we find them as much alive as ever .

		Nothing that is really great in literature ever does die .

		Yet there have been histories of English litera - ture , histories of other literatures , which were worth while .

		Taine 's book , being a work of genius , is full of faults .

		Its central conception of literature as an utterance of a great national organism , leaves out of account the accidental , the inspirational , the uni - versal .

		And to English readers , at least , there are a thousand errors of proportion and detail .

		But what vitality , what power !

		The masters of our verse and prose stride about like gods and giants playing with the dominions of the world ; the humblest reader feels the contagion of their force , the lift of their tone , and thinks more nobly of himself because he is sealed of their race .

		It is a book to breed great writers .

		Then there is
Symonds	PERSON	's `` Greek Poets . ''

		No doubt there are many persons living who date their knowledge of and love for Greek literature from the reading of this book .

		Perhaps it is the novel and unfamiliar view-point which makes an alien 's opinion of any literature startling and vivi - fying .

		Use and custom dull our outlook .

		We are like people who dwell by a bay of the sea with great hills and mountain ranges piled around us and behind .

		But always the same peaks jut up in the same place , the same slopes fall down in the same way .

		The scene becomes monotonous .

		Then a voyager comes along and invites us to enter his boat and circumnavigate our island or patrol the front of our continent .

		Immediately the land - scape begins to dissolve and recreate .

		New moun - tains arise , the old ones change their relation to each other , and everything has a different bearing and aspect .

		This is the service that such writers as
Taine	PERSON	and
Brandes	PERSON	do for us .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's `` History of English Literature '' is no worse than its precursors of the kind ; in some respects it is better .

		For one thing the glad and tricksy spirit which dominated
Lang	PERSON	's style would not always be denied , and often raises him above the official showman 's drone .

		For another thing , though the tone of his whole picture is drab enough , yet , as far as may be , the values are preserved ; the proportions are correct .

		But the work is utterly uninspiring .

		Even the best sections , those on Shake - speare and
Scott	PERSON	, are uninspiring .

		And Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's treatment of the mass of his writers , well ! ''

		He is more than usual calm , He does n't give a single damn . ''

		There is one matter , however , for which we in
America	LOCATION	owe the memory of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	the sincerest thanks .

		For the first time , we imagine , in a work of this kind , American writers are used with absolute respect .

		They are given as full a share of space as their English compeers , and their treatment is not any more colorless .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	suggests that we ought to accept
Whittier	LOCATION	as our national poet .

		Perhaps this is only his fun .

		More probably , though , it is a half-unconscious expression of a settled En - glish opinion as to our rights and privileges .

		A travelling acquaintance of ours has always been very indignant at the citizens of modern
Rome	LOCATION	because they prefer to live in new and comfortable houses .

		Ruins are their forte , he insists , and they ought to stick to ruins .

		Similarly , or conversely , the English demand that American writers shonld deal with the 330 THE DIAL A -LSB-
April 16	DATE	new and crude of our country , and leave the rest of the world and the whole backward of time to their own piratical plundering .

		No one denies the spirit and interest of
Whittier	LOCATION	's home-made verse ; but if he is the best we have had , we are still in the horn - book state of tutelage .

		If to be a national poet , a writer must deal with home scenes and near times , what national poet has
England	LOCATION	?

		It can not be
Spenser	PERSON	, for his scene is laid in
Fairyland	LOCATION	.

		Nor
Shakespeare	PERSON	, for two-thirds of his plays deal with foreign lands and peoples .

		Nor
Milton	PERSON	, for Hebrew antiquity furnishes the basis for the bulk of his work .

		Nor
Byron	PERSON	, who dealt with
Italy	LOCATION	and the
East	LOCATION	.

		Nor
Shelley	PERSON	, nor
Keats	PERSON	, nor
Tennyson	PERSON	, for they revived the legends and the life of
Greece	LOCATION	.

		Less than any other nation has
England	LOCATION	built its literature up out of its own materials and within its own confines ; yet that is what its critics insist upon Americans doing .

		However , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's suggestion is only a slight one ; and , as we have said , his treatment of American authors , if not enthusiastic -LRB- he is hardly ever enthusiastic -RRB- is eminently fair .

		We do not suppose for a moment that Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, in writing this book , had any idea of changing or reforming the opinions of real lovers of literature .

		It is a piece of bookwork intended primarily for young students .

		But herein , it seems to us , resides its danger , and the danger of all such dry-as-dust compilations .

		If we could point to any one thing calculated to disinherit such students of their rightful estates in the realms of gold , disenchant them with the charm and nobility of great literature , and de - press them in their own ambitions , it would be the ordinary school history of literature .

		The young student does not need a wide knowledge of even our own literature : that will come in time if he begins right .

		He does not even much need instruction in balancing the claims of innumerable authors .

		What he needs is inspiration .

		He needs to have his sen - sibilities aroused , his enthusiasm awakened .

		It is better for him if he can come to thrill with the magic of a single poem of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	or
Keats	PERSON	than if he knew the dates of every English writer from
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	times to the present , and had their official rating firmly fixed in his mind .

		The temptation in schools is to substitute a history of literature for lit - erature itself .

		Always students should be directed to the originals .

		These need neither be many nor recondite , to guide good taste .

		The old books of Elegant Extracts , so much ridiculed now , had their uses .

		They probably helped to breed many gener - ations of real readers .

		If criticism must be offered to young students it should be the best , the most vivid , the most inspiring .

		A small volume could be put together of essays by Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Hazlitt	PERSON	,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Arnold	LOCATION	, and
Lowell	LOCATION	, which would cover the great epochs and major writers of English literature , and which would be more valuable to students than any historic survey on the market .

LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE PROBLEM OF BOOK-DISTRIBUTION in a country so poorly provided with bookshops as our own , and where the carriage of books by mail or express is relatively so expensive , and where also the mere calling of the would-be purchaser 's atten - tion by advertisement to the particular book he would gladly buy is so uncertain and difficult and costly , is not the least of the problems every year becoming more perplexing to the American pub - lisher .

		Mr.
George P. Brett	PERSON	, president of the
Macmillan Company	ORGANIZATION	, dwells at length on this question in a current `` Atlantic '' article on `` Book - Publishing and its Present Tendencies . ''

		Although our annual book-production has doubled in twenty years , running now as high as thirteen or fourteen thousand new publications , the total annual sales are little if any in excess of those prevailing in that earlier period ; and this , Mr.
Brett	PERSON	believes , is due to the inadequacy of our means for getting the books to the people who want them .

		Even in fiction , which always finds the readiest sale , the increase in production has been attended by no corresponding increase in total circulation .

		Dr.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	used to maintain , as Mr.
Brett	PERSON	recalls , that no work of general literature had ever been adequately distributed or `` published , '' in the literal sense of that word .

		The costs of such distribution are prohibitive .

		Some new and efficient method of bringing books and their most likely purchasers together is what is needed .

		Where is the inventive genius that shall devise the machinery ?

		In
England	LOCATION	a classified card-catalogue system of British book-buyers , so far as the names and addresses of such buyers can be obtained , is undergoing trial at the hands of a certain firm of booksellers .

		Notices of new books likely to interest the person thus catalogued are sent to him from time to time , and results gratifying to all concerned ought to follow .

		But , as Mr.
Brett	PERSON	says , such a plan is far less practicable with our much larger and less stable population .

		After all is said that can be said on the subject , our publishers should not be made to bear the blame for evils which they , more than anyone else , deplore .

		They rejoice in the discovery of a meritorious manuscript among the thousands submitted to them , though they can pub - lish only a fiftieth part of such submitted works ; and when they do issue a book , their profit on it is commonly about one-half that of the author .

		The publisher 's position is surely no fat-salaried sinecure .

		As a concluding suggestion on this whole subject , one might query whether an increasingly effective agent of distribution may not be found in the public library .

		The rather rapid extension of the free - library system , in the founding of new libraries , the multiplication of branches , and the growth of travel - ling libraries , furnishes a ready means for reaching a constantly enlarging reading public and , to some
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 331 extent , a buying public .

		At any rate , the libraries themselves constitute a purchasing class of no mean proportions , and these proportions are on the increase .

		European bookshops excel ours in num - ber and excellence , but American public libraries acknowledge no superiors .

		A TOUR DE FORCE IN LIBRARY-RECONSTRUCTION is to be credited to Director
J. I. Wyer , Jr.	PERSON	, and his corps of assistants at the
New York State Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two years have passed since the destructive fire in the capitol at
Albany	LOCATION	almost wiped out of existence the most valuable State collection of books and manu - scripts in the country .

		But the proverbial alacrity in locking the stable door after the horse is stolen showed itself , and an adequate fire-proof building was speedily erected to receive the new collection for which a wisely compliant legislature voted an appropriation of one and a
quarter million dollars	MONEY	.

		The story of the shifts and expedients , the embar - rassed labors and the baffling problems , of those intervening months of stress and strain , as told by Mr.
Wyer	PERSON	in a recent Report , will convince the most incredulous that even the librarian 's life may have elements of strenuosity .

		Especially interesting is his account of the rescue of charred manuscripts from the glowing embers , at considerable personal risk , and of the restoration of these damaged treas - ures , so far as restoration was possible .

		One would like to know what proportion of manuscripts and of books was saved out of the whole collection , but we are merely left to infer that the salvage was incon - siderable .

		The rapidity with which new books and other material have been bought is marvellous .

		Com - plicating the whole situation has been the necessity of conducting the
Library School	ORGANIZATION	without interrup - tion ; but even this , with help from
Washington	LOCATION	and elsewhere , has been achieved .

		Librarianism hath her victories no less renowned than certain other callings commonly regarded as more arduous or more heroic .

		MR.
GORDON CRAIG	PERSON	'S `` SCHOOL FOR THE ART OF THE THEATRE , '' so inspiringly mapped out in his book of
last year	DATE	, has lately become a reality .

		When Mr.
Craig	PERSON	's mother ,
Ellen Terry	PERSON	, celebrated her sixty-fifth birthday a few weeks ago , one of the pleasantest features of the day was Mr.
Craig	PERSON	's announcement that , through the generosity of
Lord Howard de Walden	PERSON	, the projected `` School for the Art of the Theatre '' was established upon a sound financial basis .

		This school , as is obvious to anyone familiar with Mr.
Craig	PERSON	's theories , will differ essen - tially from any of the existing dramatic academies .

		The final plan involves two great divisions .

		The experimental school , to which Mr.
Craig	PERSON	attaches the greater importance , will aim `` at infusing the life of imagination into every art and craft connected with the stage , so that fresh vigor will be given to the creative power of those actively connected with the drama . ''

		It will gather a body of .

		earnest and thorough workers , who , under Mr.
Craig	PERSON	's direction , will undertake theatrical productions in any part of the world .

		The preliminary work will be done at the school 's theatre , where , also , the members of the secondary school for the study of stage crafts will find opportunity for practical work .

		All students in this course must study speech and movement ; and they may choose , in addition , one '' elective '' from such crafts as costume - making , lighting , preparation of properties , and so on .

		The course will cover three years , and at the end of the first year examinations will be held to weed out the unfit .

		Disciples of the feminist movement will be annoyed to find that Mr.
Craig	PERSON	absolutely excludes women from his experi - mental school .

		... THE
BUFFALO EDUCATIONAL UNION	ORGANIZATION	, already noticed by us , is intelligently developing its powers for usefulness .

		The cooperating bodies are
the Society of Natural Sciences	ORGANIZATION	, the Fine Arts Academy , the
Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, the
Grosvenor Library	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Walter L. Brown	PERSON	, head of the last-named institution , says in his current Report : `` This Union has already resulted in several discus - sions of the field of work and in a better under - standing than before existed .

		The present plans for work are mainly in the direction of publicity .

		A poster is now being printed picturing and describing the means and kinds of education offered free by these five institutions .

		It is designed that this poster shall be hung in the schools and in other places where many people gather or where many are employed .

		A directory of all the means of education available in the
City of Buffalo	LOCATION	is proposed .

		Another plan , which
the Union	ORGANIZATION	has under way , provides for talks illus - trated by lantern slides to be given to the pupils of night schools and to club organizations , describing the work of the societies and what they offer to the residents of
Buffalo	LOCATION	. ''

		Probably no other city of the size of
Buffalo	LOCATION	has its library needs ministered to by so many agencies branches , deposit stations , school libraries , travelling collections , and so on .

		These run into the hundreds .

		There are forty-two `` firemen 's libraries , '' to say nothing of hospitals , settlement houses , clubs , police stations , and other societies or institutions that receive special attention from the public library .

		An interesting statistical summary shows a nearly steady increase , during the last sixteen years , in those figures that a librarian likes to see increase , and an equally steady decrease in that one department of circulation he likes to see decrease , fiction .

		From a percentage of 72.7 in
1897	DATE	it has declined to 59 in
1912	DATE	.

		THE COLOR OF WORDS , to those who tend to see all things in terms of color , is very real and often very vivid ; and there are probably few persons to whom certain words do not at least suggest bright - ness and certain other words gloom .

		Mr.
Yoshio Markino	PERSON	, the Japanese artist whose oddly charac - teristic literary style has attracted many readers , entertained and amused most of them , and stirred the unsympathetic merriment of a few , is evidently 332 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	one who finds something in words that appeals strongly to sense perception .

		His article on '' Emo - tion and Etymology '' in the
April	DATE	`` Atlantic '' is a curious study of that quality in words which no mere effort of the intellect can grasp .

		All-important is the feeling behind the words and showing through them .

		The ability to make the same vocables ex - press a great variety of meanings by variations of tone and accent is probably more characteristic of the Chinese than of the Japanese .

		At any rate , it is a peculiarity developed comparatively little in other languages .

		What Mr.
Markino	PERSON	has to say in his essay will interest some readers less than his inim - itable manner of saying it .

		Let us quote a few sentences .

		`` There are quite many people who are over-cautious even when they are among their most sympathetic friends .

		They are frightened to utter a single word in fear that ' it might make the listeners misunderstand . '

		These people are evidently trying to make the world deadly dull .

		It is all through their lack of sense and wisdom as well as sympathy , and I simply get sick of them ! ''

		One willingly excuses the triteness of some of Mr.
Markino	PERSON	's observations because of their amusing oddity of form .

		For example : `` There is some difference between the public speech and private conversation .

		Just the right words for the public speech may become too much superfluous for the private con - versation .

		Too much exciting gesture and too many emphasized words are absolutely unnecessary to convey our emotion among a few people .

		You would not shoot partridges with the twelve-inch gun , would you ? ''

		Mr.
Markino	PERSON	closes with an able defense of his style against the charge of `` pose , '' and with his reasons for spelling his name as he does rather than without the r , as he has been told he ought to do .

		THE TRU-BLU SPELLING-REFORMER will giv a harty welcome to the latest innovations adopted by the
Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		He will not be bacward in accepting this further economy of the alfabet now accomplish !

		by the hed reformers in council assembled .

		Some of the nu words may look strange , but nothing is too stif in this sort to disharten him .

		Let others snif or laf or turn away in a huf ; he is not of that kidny , and you can safely bet your mony on his stedfastness .

		All thot of weakening is foren to his nature , and he regards the half-harted with sovren contempt .

		He writes the nu spellings on the tables of his hart in bold blac inc , the blacer the better .

		Let those scof who will ; by no caitif dout is he ever distraut .

		Tho there be wailing and nashing of teeth thruout the ranks of the anti-reformers , naut will ever make him untru to the cause .

		It may be a weary jurny to the complete metamorf osis of our written language , but long enuf hav the unregenerate spellings held undis - turbed their ancient rein .

		No ,
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	has not turned its coat , seamy as is the appearance of the foregoing , but is merely trying to keep itself and its readers at least partially informed of the latest indignities offered to our orthography by certain misguided zealots .

		One feels moved to ask the spelling-reformer , as
Cicero	LOCATION	on a certain occasion demanded of Catiline , Quousque tandem abutere patientia nostra ?

		Quern ad finem sese effrenata jactabit audacia ?

		A MEMORIAL TO A MASTER OF THE SHORT STORY is likely before long to greet the visitor to
North Carolina	LOCATION	's new
Hall of History	ORGANIZATION	and Literature .

		Professor
Archibald Henderson	PERSON	, of
the University of North Carolina	ORGANIZATION	, issues a booklet setting forth the plan and purpose of this memorial .

		He says : '' At the last meeting of
the State Literary and Historical Association of North Carolina	ORGANIZATION	a movement was be - gun for the purpose of preserving memorials of all sorts pertaining to the literature of
North Carolina	LOCATION	and its makers .

		In the new
Hall of History	ORGANIZATION	it is expected that a section will be reserved for Litera - ture .

		Here may be placed busts , medallions , por - traits , miniatures , autograph letters and documents , original manuscripts of literary works , autographed copies of the works of native men and women of letters , etc. , etc. '' The one whose genius it is now proposed to commemorate with a bust or medallion is that favorite of short-story readers ,
William Sidney Porter	PERSON	, better known as ''
O. Henry	PERSON	, '' who was born at
Greensboro	LOCATION	a little more than fifty years ago , and whose writings have just achieved the distinction -LRB- comparatively rare in the case of magazine stories -RRB- of a complete edition , in twelve volumes .

		Contribu - tions for the memorial are solicited , and may be sent to Professor
Henderson	PERSON	at
Chapel Hill	LOCATION	, N. C. LURING THE LITTLE FOLK TO THE LIBRARY means , as a rule , the winning of life-long friends to good books .

		At
St. Joseph	LOCATION	,
Mo.	LOCATION	, this end is hastened by the distribution of copies of an attractive folder , explanatory and hortatory , among the ten thousand school children of the city ; and these folders , going into the homes of some fifty thousand persons , work their charm on others beside the juvenile members of the community .

		The librarian informs us that , incredible though it may seem , within the first four days after the distribution of the folders began , the demand for books on the part of borrowers showed an increase of fifty-nine per cent .

		The little sheet contains a short list of '' books for young people , '' one of `` books for women , '' a note on `` books for men , '' a general invitation to the library , with a few words on the freedom of its privileges , a brief note `` to the boys and girls , '' and , under an outline sketch of a St.
Joseph	PERSON	little girl absorbed in a book , the following : '' Good books are my friends they bring me wisdom and happiness .

		In our Public Library I have found hundreds of pleasant books to read .

		I am only one of over 13,000 others who read there .

		Are you ? ''

		... THE DECLINING PERCENTAGE OF FICTION in the publisher 's output and , to some extent , in the public library 's circulation , is attributed to a recent marked increase in the demand for books on such subjects as sociology , economics , useful arts , medicine , hy -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 333 giene , applied science , sports and games , nature - study , and even religion , philosophy , and poetry and the drama .

		Mr.
Fred E. Woodward	PERSON	, of Washing - ton , D. C. , has been gathering statistics for '' The Literary Digest , '' and his figures , with accompanying diagrams , are interesting .

		From them it appears that whereas in
1890	DATE	the whole number of books published in this country was 4,559 , of which nearly a quarter were works of fiction , in
1912	DATE	the whole number had risen to 10,135 , of which not quite a tenth part were in that class .

		Indeed , the decline in novels seems to have been absolute as well as relative , from 1,118 to 1,010 .

		But the statistician notes 733 reprints among the novels issued twenty -
two years ago	DATE	, while he fails to indicate their num - ber for last year .

		Thus it may be that new novels are appearing in larger numbers now than formerly ; and indeed one must believe this to be so until proof to the contrary is brought forward .

		The relative decline , however , seems indisputable , and is not to be regretted .

		A SUN-DIAL INTERESTING TO BOOKMEN has been set up in the garden of the
Country Life Press	ORGANIZATION	at
Garden City	LOCATION	,
Long Island	LOCATION	; and an artistic little paper - covered book descriptive of its curious construction is issued by the same press , with the imprint of
Messrs. Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Walter Gilliss	PERSON	, the designer of the dial , writes the description , and excellent illustrations are added . ''

		A Printers ' Sun Dial '' is the title of the treatise , and it tells how the dial came to be erected , how the
Gutenberg Bible	ORGANIZATION	, as the first of printed books and the `` Book of Books , '' was chosen for representation on its face , and how the marks of twelve early printers were selected for the twelve hour spaces .

		No expense seems to have been spared in making the dial a thing of beauty and a most solid and lasting construction .

		Its ped - estal extends three and a half feet below the surface of the ground , to ensure against disturbance by frost , and concrete , cement , and brass are the materials used , with a perdurable composition of an unnamed sort as filling for the engraved lettering on the open pages of the
Bible	LOCATION	, which itself is said to be exactly reproduced from the fifty-thousand-dollar copy secured at the late Hoe sale by Mr.
Henry E. Hunt	PERSON	- ington .

		Appreciative visitors are welcome in the '' cedar room , '' as it is called , of the beautiful garden where the Printers ' Sun Dial is to be seen .

		THE STORY OF A RARE COPT OF `` AL AARAAF , '' an early product of
Poe	PERSON	's pen , is going the rounds .

		Two women , mother and daughter , both of advanced age , living in
Washington	LOCATION	,
D. C.	PERSON	, called in a local dealer in second-hand books a few weeks ago to ap - praise a small collection of their own .

		But it held nothing to attract the eye of a connoisseur , and he was about to depart when he chanced to notice a pasteboard-bound volume serving in place of a lost caster to a bureau in the room .

		`` What 's this ? ''

		he asked , stooping to look at the book . ''

		Oh , that 's nothing , '' replied the daughter .

		`` It 's by Mr.
Poe	PERSON	.

		He used to call on
Adeline	PERSON	and
Alvina Wolfe	PERSON	, two women who lived in
Baltimore	LOCATION	, and he gave it to them .

		It fell very flat when it was published . ''

		The book proved to be a first edition of '' Al Aaraaf ,
Tamerlane	LOCATION	, and Minor Poems '' -LRB-
Baltimore	LOCATION	,
1829	DATE	-RRB- , a copy of which recently sold , it is said , for twenty -
seven hundred dollars	MONEY	at auction ; and the dealer could have had the thing for the price of a new caster .

		But he chanced to be a man of honor , and so he paid the poor women two thousand dollars , be - ing glad enough to secure the treasure at that price .

		It is rather odd to find in
Charles Lamb	LOCATION	's writ - ings not infrequent use of this vulgarism , not only in his letters but also in his more serious works .

		I suspect it will be found not to be a later form but as old as spoken English .

		I have heard it on the lips of men and women of comparatively high culture in the country districts of
Maine	LOCATION	, where it is also used as a contraction for `` are not '' and '' is not , '' as for example , `` ai n't you going ? ''

		and '' ' t ai n't neither . ''

		In the same way '' hai n't '' is used for '' have not '' and '' has not , '' as in '' I hai n't seen her , '' '' Hai n't John got one ? ''

		I must confess to a lingering fondness for these delightful old colloquialisms .

		All kinds of dialects are interesting , and the dying '' Yankee dilact '' which
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	treated so sympathetically and which one may occasionally come across even now in out-of-the-way places has a flavor particularly its own .

		My Uncle
Isaiah	PERSON	, who was one of the most particular of men and who at his death left in manuscript a universal Gram - mar of half a dozen different languages working on it served him in place of a lung for many years !

		some - times in his speech fell instinctively into the old habit of saying '' ai n't '' and doubling his negatives , as if he were speaking Greek , which he knew as few men do .

		Up till within a few years in
Templeton	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, there were relics of the local dialect of the English dis - trict from which the early settlers came .

		At
Ogunquit	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, until recently an isolated fishing - village , you still hear `` the natives '' speak of a man as a '' cutter , '' though they call an animal a '' critter . ''

		The mother of a patri - archal family , when some surprise was expressed by a
summer	DATE	visitor at the number of her offspring , remarked : '' Yes , ' t is a fruitsome place . ''

		Even our characteristic or supposedly characteristic American humor , that of exaggeration upwards or downwards , is really an im - portation .

		An early sixteenth century writer in one of his books speaks of the
Atlantic Ocean	LOCATION	as `` the ditch '' !

		I vastly prefer '' ai n't '' for '' am not '' to the wretched French idiom beginning with '' it was , '' followed by '' that '' instead of '' when , '' i.e. , '' It was on the sixteenth of
June	DATE	that he came . ''

		It may be occasionally effective to introduce a clause with '' It was ... that , '' but its universal and spreading use in newspapers , magazines , and books , with sometimes four or five instances of it in a single page , is excessively annoying to one who likes a clear concise style .

		It is like a blight ruining idiomatic English .

		334 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	A NEW ENGLAND WORTHY OF THE 17TH CENTURY .

		* More than seventy years ago the late Mr.
John Wingate Thornton	PERSON	began a loving study of the history of his ancestor ,
Daniel Gookin	PERSON	; more than thirty-five years ago this work was taken up by his kinsman , Mr.
Frederick William Gookin	PERSON	.

		The exhaustive record of the
Gookin	PERSON	family in
America	LOCATION	, and of its descendants , which resulted has proved as yet too extensive for pub - lication .

		The privately printed Life of Major General
Daniel Gookin	PERSON	, lately issued in
Chicago	LOCATION	, would alone justify all the pious care bestowed on the subject through two generations .

		In all respects the book is admirable : to the eye , at first , as one delights in the beauty of its printed pages ; to the mind , as one perceives the compact solidity of its substance and the secure certainty of its composition ; to the finer sesthetic sense , as one begins to feel the implicit excellence of its style , never obtrusive and never inadequate , an almost imperceptible vehicle of the meaning which comes straight to the reader with no conscious effort in the reading .

		Above all , it is admirable in its full and final effect .

		The name of
Daniel Gookin	PERSON	has hitherto been little more than a name to those who knew it at all ; to any who read this book it must surely become the token of an individual life , bravely lived and singularly typical of what we love to believe most deeply characteristic of the
America	LOCATION	he helped to found .

		Among the worthies of our seventeenth cen - tury ,
Daniel Gookin	PERSON	was almost unique in being at once of
Virginia	LOCATION	and of
New England	LOCATION	, in both colonies a man of rank .

		He sprang from a family of
Kentish	LOCATION	gentry , of which the origin and the affiliations are in this book abundantly recorded .

		His father , courageously adventur - ous in the full spirit of Elizabethan adventure , settled himself for a while in
Ireland	LOCATION	, in the very year when
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	died ;
five years later	DATE	he was in
Virginia	LOCATION	, on his own adventure , with fifty colonists under him ; and when in
March , 1622	DATE	, a rising of the Indians drove the other planters to shelter , '' only Master Gookins at
Nuport	LOCATION	's - news would not obey the Commis - sioners ' command in that , though he scarce had five and thirty of all sorts with him , yet he *

		thought himself sufficient against what could happen , and so did , to his great credit . ''

		Ten years later he died in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		At that time two of his sons , neither more than twenty years old , were probably on his Virginian estates .

		John died there in
November , 1643	DATE	, being about thirty years of age ; his tombstone is the oldest now legible at
Church Point	ORGANIZATION	,
Lynn Haven	PERSON	.


Daniel	PERSON	, the subject of the volume be - fore us , survived to the age of seventy-five ; and lies in the old graveyard of
Cambridge	LOCATION	in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, opposite the gates of
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	.

		He had removed to
New England	LOCATION	just about the time of his brother 's death .

		Puritan in conviction , as were most of his English kinsfolk , he had found himself unwilling to live under the
Virginian Act of Conformity	ORGANIZATION	.

		Arrived in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, he had presently become there a man of consideration .

		His first intimate friend - ship , which was life-long , seems to have been with the celebrated
John Eliot	PERSON	, minister of Rox - bury , and still remembered as the '' Apostle to the Indians . ''

		In
Eliot	ORGANIZATION	's noble philanthropy
Daniel Gookin	PERSON	was his most constant associate throughout ; to the end ,
Gookin	PERSON	's devotion to the welfare of the
New England Indians	ORGANIZATION	remained faithful .

		This alone would have made him mem - orable ; so would the record of his other and constant public services .

		Being `` a very for - ward man to advance Marshal discipline , and withal the truths of Christ , '' he was for some forty years captain of the train-band of Cam - bridge ; and in
1681	DATE	he was made Major Gen - eral , or commander-in-chief of all the military forces of the colony .

		Meanwhile he was often a deputy to the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	and for a time its speaker ; he was for a long time Assistant , or one of the Council of eighteen magistrates to whom , with the Governor and Deputy Governor , the government of the colony was entrusted .

		During a visit to
England	LOCATION	in
1655	DATE	, he had been charged by
Cromwell	PERSON	, apparently in person , with the fruitless task of endeavoring to per - suade good people of
New England	LOCATION	to transfer themselves as colonists to the newly captured island of
Jamaica	LOCATION	.

		During another visit abroad , just before the Restoration , he had been for a while Collector of Customs and Deputy Treas - urer at War in
Dunkirk	LOCATION	.

		He finally returned to
New England	LOCATION	in the same ship with the regicide judges ,
Goffe	PERSON	and
Whalley	PERSON	.

		Thence - forth to the end there , the record of his life is one of unbroken devotion to public duty , in no aspect more excellent than when , during the janics of
King Philip	LOCATION	's War , he stoutly de -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAJL 335 fended , in the face of popular clamor , the rights of such Indians as had not proved themselves hostile or treacherous .

		He had planned the writing of a History of
New England	LOCATION	.

		Of this only two fragments remain , probably all he ever finished .

		Both deal with the
New England Indians	ORGANIZATION	one to the year
1674	DATE	, the other dur - ing the three years ensuing ; the former was pub - lished by the
Massachusetts Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	in
1792	DATE	, the latter by the
American Antiquarian Society	ORGANIZATION	in
1836	DATE	.

		It is by these publications that he has hitherto been known , so far as he has been known at all .

		The book now before us , faithfully collecting and collating what letters and documents of his and concerning him remain , at last revives his worthy memory .

		What Mr.
F. W. Gookin	PERSON	writes of him sums him up best : '' Altruism is of all the virtues the most difficult to acquire and practice .

		It is also the hardest for the selfish multitude to fathom ... Had
Daniel Gookin	PERSON	's talents been devoted to his own advancement , he might be better known to the world at large .

		Instead he chose the nobler part .

		... In whatever aspect -LSB- his -RSB- life and character be regarded , he stands the test of the most rigid scrutiny ... His mind was that of a statesman .

		The public documents prepared by him attest his sagacity and skill , the breadth of his outlook , and his understanding of his fellow men ... The calm certainty of his judgment is a salient trait ... Though never vacillating , he was never rash ... What he had to say he set down in a simple and direct manner .

		His concern was with the substance of his remarks rather than with their form .

		-LSB- And -RSB- from the inflexible firmness with which -LSB- he -RSB- stood for every speci - fic right of the colonists he has been called * the origin - ator and prophet of that immortal dogma of our national greatness no taxation without representation . ' ''

		When he died in
Cambridge	LOCATION	on the
19th of March , 1686-7	DATE	, the colony had lost its charter ; the pristine theocracy in which he believed had fatally fallen ; the causes for which he had lived seemed desperate .

		But , if we may credit
Sewall	PERSON	's dream of him , his courage never failed : Sabbath , Dec 30th *
1688	DATE	`` Last night I dreamed of military matters , Arms and Captains , and of a suddain Major
Gookin	PERSON	, very well clad from head to foot , and of a very fresh , lively coun - tenance his Coat and Breeches of blood-red silk , beckened me out of the room where I was to speak to him .

		I think ' t was from the Toun-house . ''

		All that was more than two centuries ago .

		More than once between whiles , as to many nowadays , the outlook of our country has seemed dark and threatening .

		Beyond all things else , such faithfulness to duty as
Daniel Gookin	PERSON	's has kept alive what we still love to believe the true spirit of ancestral
America	LOCATION	.

		As we , of his children , look back on his memory , there can surge up no more fervent hope than that in times to come the children who shall
spring	DATE	from us may find us worthy of the tra - ditions which , for our little while , we hold in trust from him .

		IRISH PLAYS AND PLAYERS .

		* The Irish Players have recently finished their secotid American tour , not counting the Fay brothers ' earlier engagement to furnish curtain - raisers for a conventional farce-comedy , under the
Frohman	PERSON	management .

		Their appearances this
winter	DATE	have witnessed no recurrence of the riotous disapproval that greeted the first Ameri - can performances of '' The Playboy '' a year ago .

		As far as we know ,
Lady Gregory	PERSON	, though she accompanied the Players again this
winter	DATE	, has given no more lectures on the
Irish Literary Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	and the Abbey Theatre movement .

		Lady
Gregory	PERSON	's talks last year were explanatory and more or less defensive .

		The necessity for defending the Players , or their plays , is now happily past ;
America	LOCATION	has accepted the Irish Players and the Irish drama as a character - istic and altogether delightful feature of the contemporary theatre .

		The American audi - ences have not always been large , but they have been , like the
Dublin	LOCATION	audiences , eager and con - stant attendants ; and , if opportunity is given , we feel sure that , like the
Dublin	LOCATION	audiences , they will grow ; for a person of discrimination who has seen the Irish Players once , will come and bring his friends to see them through their repertory .

		And the next year , if they repeat their performances , he will repeat his .

		The account of a large and vital movement before lecture audiences must of necessity be brief and incomplete .

		Lady
Gregory	PERSON	and Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	satisfied only in small measure the curious interest that the Irish Players , with their nat - uralness , their eloquence , their dignity , their versatility , the convincing impression they give of being actors born , not made , had aroused in us .

		And now the spoken words of Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	and Lady
Gregory	PERSON	have been worthily supple - mented by more detailed and comprehensive accounts of the whole dramatic movement in Ire - land , from the pen of Mr.
Cornelius Weygandt	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Weygandt	PERSON	, from the vantage-point of an
American University	ORGANIZATION	, has followed the Irish revival with sympathy and interest from its beginnings ; and he has come close to it by repeated visits to
London	LOCATION	and
Dublin	LOCATION	, and by * IRISH PLAYS AND PLAYWRIGHTS .

April 16	DATE	friendly intercourse with many of the leaders of the movement . ''

		Irish Plays and Playwrights M is therefore written from a point of view that delightfully combines sympathy and understand - ing with the breadth of view and the detachment essential to the success of so detailed a study .

		It is a book to delight all good lovers of Irish drama , and to bring it to the attention of many drama-lovers who have hitherto ignored the Irish playwrights .

		Portraits of a dozen or more of these writers , with one of
Sara Allgood	PERSON	, the `` leading lady '' of the
Abbey Company	ORGANIZATION	, add vividness and interest to the text .

		Mr.
Weygandt	PERSON	, easily recognizing the source of American interest in his subject to be the Irish Players , wisely begins his work after a brief general survey of the theme with a chapter on `` The Players and their Plays , their Audience and their Art . ''

		His estimate of the
Abbey Theatre	ORGANIZATION	's achievement , the history of which he traces with understanding and lucidity , is summed up in his concluding tribute : '' I think the dramatic movement the most significant part of the
Celtic Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	, a movement to me the most original movement in letters the world has known since that movement in
Norway	LOCATION	which so definitely stimulated it , a movement that gave
Bjornson	PERSON	and Ibsen to the world . ''

		That the
Abbey Theatre	ORGANIZATION	and its modest pre - decessors gave the dramatic literature its reason for being , furnishing a poet and dreamer like
Yeats	PERSON	, a genius like
Synge	PERSON	, a practical reformer like ''
A. E.	PERSON	, '' and patriotic Irish writers such as are nearly all the
Abbey	ORGANIZATION	playwrights , with an opportunity , and even with a demand for Irish drama that could not but put them to work , is Mr.
Weygandt	PERSON	's excuse , if one were needed , for beginning where he does .

		In suc - ceeding chapters dealing with Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	and
Lady Gregory	PERSON	, Mr.
Edward Martyn	PERSON	and Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	, the four founders of the Abbey Theatre ; with Mr.
George W. Russell	PERSON	-LRB- A. E. '' -RRB- , who shares with Dr.
Douglas Hyde	PERSON	the honor of having inspired the Celtic revival ; with
John Millington Synge	PERSON	, in Mr.
Weygandt	PERSON	's opinion '' the greatest dramatist in English that our stage has known in a century '' ; with the younger dramatists , Messrs.
Colum	PERSON	,
Boyle	PERSON	,
Robinson	PERSON	,
Mayne	ORGANIZATION	, and the rest ; and finally with
William Sharp	PERSON	, friend of Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	and `` A. E. , '' writer for the Irish stage , and chief commentator in the English reviews on the work of the Irish writers : in the course of these studies there is drawn an increasingly clearer picture of the movement .

		Relationships are explained , plays are sketched , ideals developed , purposes made plain .

		And all this is done with enthusiasm tempered by a discriminating judgment trained by the study of drama in many languages and of many schools .

		Possessing sympathy and fine feeling , Mr.
Weygandt	PERSON	is naturally able to express his crit - ical estimates in a fashion to make them ap - peal strongly .

		Apropos of a meeting with Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	at Lady
Gregory	PERSON	's hospitable country - house , he writes thus of the poet of '' the Other World '' : '' There is a side of Irish life , the side the world knows best , that Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	does not present , but that which he does present is true , though the poet 's per - sonality is so dominant that we get more of this than of
Ireland	LOCATION	in his poetry .

		So it should be , so it is with every artist .

		All the world can ask of him is his inter - pretation of what he knows .

		Yet so native is Mr.
5Teats	PERSON	that the atmosphere of his poetry is the very atmosphere of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		The artist and the setting of his art are in an unwonted harmony .

		No reader of Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	who knows the brooding landscape of
West Ireland	LOCATION	can escape that realization , but only he who has met the poet amid the scenes that inspired his verse may know how complete is their accord .

		Such a meet - ing was mine one lowering
August	DATE	day , in whose late afternoon we walked in the
Woods of Coole	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then I knew at last what Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	meant by ' druid charm ' and ' druid light . '

		I felt the < druid charm ' that was potent in gray skies over gray water and gray rock and gray-green woods ; the bewildering ' druid light ' flashed out as the sun followed westward the trail to
Hy Brasil	PERSON	, leaving in the
Atlantic	LOCATION	skies wild after-glow of winter yellow . ''

		And thus , with fine discrimination , does he sum up the wild , erratic genius of the poet - playwright Synge : '' The freshness and audacity of his imagination , and the beautiful extravagance of his speech , a speech modulated to a rhythm that
Synge	PERSON	was the first to catch , are in themselves enough to give distinction to almost any subject .

		There was granted
Synge	PERSON	more than this , however , a keenness of vision into the pathetic hu - manity of ugly things and a power to realize this with a beauty that was granted to no one before , though to Swift it was granted to see the ugliness as a bitter thing .

		Borrow had , indeed , a glimpse now and then of the pathetic beauty there is in ugliness , ... and Whitman , too ; but no man before
Synge	PERSON	had the power at once to see the ugly subject as beautiful from a new angle of vision , humanize it , irradiate it with a new glow of imagination , reveal it through a style that for the first time ennobles English prose drama as blank verse has long ennobled English verse drama . ''

		* Mr.
Weygandt	PERSON	has put us deeply in his debt for a study of the Irish plays at once exact and interesting , dramatic and carefully proportioned .

		Lovers of Irish mysticism and lyric poetry will find his point of view , notably upon Synge , ''
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	, '' and Messrs.
Yeats	PERSON	and Rus - sell , broad enough to include much that , while contributing indirectly to the poetic feeling that
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 337 gives grandeur to the Irish drama , still would lie outside a narrower and slighter conception of the subject .

		Mr.
Weygandt	PERSON	's essays belong to the vital literary output of the year .

		A REALISTIC PROGRAMME AND PLATFORM .

		* The temper of the speculative science of the
latter half of the nineteenth century	DATE	was marked by nothing so much , perhaps , as by the qualities of caution and of humility .

		Concerning the primacies and ultimacies of existence it bowed its head and said , '' Agnosco . ''

		To it the '' real '' was the `` unknowable , '' and its unknowable shapes were unknowably protean .

		Nothing , again , is so striking in the temper of the specu - lative religion of the same period as its caution and humility .

		Concerning the ultimacies and primacies of existence , it contented itself with * ' I believe . ''

		Its attitude was assumptive and positive where that of science was skeptical and negative , its sentiment fideistic where that of science was agnostic .

		Dogmatism had gone from both , and seemed to have gone forever .

		Speculative thinking had acquired an unpre - cedented lability , attributable chiefly to the victorious confirmation of Darwinism and the entry of '' evolution '' into the commonsense and the vocabulary of the daily life .

		Darwinism carried within itself , however , the embryo of a renewed dogmatism .

		Regarding all things from the standpoint of natural selec - tion and the struggle for survival , it inevitably implied that intellect and thinking are a biolog - ical function having for aim the survival of the thinker , and that consequently intellection is merely derivative , secondary , symbolic , while those aspects of our nature which are biologically prior , which are non-reflective , are more akin to the stuff and inward go of reality , and hence more able to apprehend it .

		This hypothesis got considerable confirmation from the experimen - tation in biology and the psychological analysis in religion which ensued close upon the fading of the war of words .

		They made prominent two points .

		First , that living matter seemed to contain something altogether refractory to laboratory methods and elusive to scientific anal - ysis .

		Second , that religious experience seemed * THE NEW REALISM .

		to reveal something altogether refractory to the methods of psychological experimentation and the logic of science .

		In both , this refractory something seemed to be a thing potent to deter - mine the nature and constitution of what was amenable ; in both it seemed a thing fluid , fleet - ing , always escaping thought , and somehow so altering what did not escape as to vitiate all of thought 's conclusions concerning that .

		Intui - tion , will , whatever acts , could touch it ; intel - lect never .

		Events like these are clearly not calculated to keep speculative religion humble in belief .

		Science fails , it boasted triumphantly , science fails again and again .

		Thought can not tell .

		It is a mean thing , surely nothing more than ancilla vitce .

		And in my deeps , my religious experiences , my operations and intuitions , there is no thought , there is the very reality itself in all its effulgent bliss and power .

		I need no longer be confined to belief .

		I have a way of knowing .

		I do know , and knowing , I am saved forever .

		From ancilla vitce to ancilla theologies is but a change of words : for is not God always described as the source of life and love , their very substance and efficacy ?

		and the change of words is easily and fluidly made .

		The outcome of the change is the dominant systematic phil - osophies of the present day .

		Vary as these may in background , personal flavor , and literary character , they are unanimous in the vitalistic criticism of science and intellect and the dog - matic assertion of a saving `` spiritual force '' knowable in non-intellectual ways .

		The modern - isms of both Protestant and Catholic theology , the obscurantistic sentimentalism of Eucken , the somewhat transcendental evolutionism of
Berg	PERSON	- son , are all at one in these matters , however else they may differ otherwise .

		The apparent shortcomings of science in biol - ogy and the psychology of religious experience were , however , more than balanced by her aston - ishingly rich positive results in mathematics and in the '' new '' psychology , fields of enormous philosophic interest .

		The latter succeeded in analyzing experimentally into objective rela - tions of space , time , and motion even so purely `` subjective '' and psychological entities as sec - ondary qualities like color and so on .

		The former became experimental and empirical , even with respect to arithmetical systems , and pro- ceeded to reconstruct the great continua of space and time , the complexities of causality , of motion , and promises to reconstruct organic existence out of simpler and simpler elements , 338 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	ultimately , out of instants of time ancTpoints of space , with the relations between them .

		Neither the achievements of psychology nor of mathe - matics were so easy of accomplishment nor so unanimous as the critical analyses of the biologiz - ing and religionistic tempers .

		The mathema - ticians are divided into two schools intuitionists and formalists , and it is only for the formalists that the reconstruction of reality from mathe - matical entities is an assured and real thing .

		And psychologists are far from agreed on the `` independent '' reality of secondary qualities , and on the identity of their underlying constitu - tions with the elements of space and of time .

		A new scientific dogmatism , consequently , which should confront the new theological dog - matism , had of necessity to be somewhat slower in getting under way than its opponent .

		For one thing , its task is harder : for its task is that of constructive analysis , whereas religionistic dogmatism has primarily that of destructive criticism .

		For another , it is compelled to pay close attention to the course of experience and to exhibit the harmony of its reconstructions with every detail of experience , whereas its opponent need and does merely attach the epi - thet `` appearance '' to experience , and then apply to its own desiderated dogmas the eulo - gium of `` reality . ''

		However , slow as the new scientific dogmatism was in coming , it is here at last .

		And it is here in the shape of this co - operative philosophical enterprise , '' The New Realism . ''

		The essays herein brought together are un - even in stylistic quality and philosophic value , varying as they do from the clumsy , redundant , inaccurate , and question-begging rehashing of mathematical commonplaces by Mr.
Spaulding	PERSON	to the incisive , epigrammatic , and somewhat bad-tempered though highly original contribu - tion on the reality of illusions and hallucinations by Mr.
Holt	PERSON	.

		But the book as a whole repre - sents a systematically developed body of doc - trine , which is perhaps the most significant philosophic utterance in the English-speaking world since the publication of
William James	PERSON	's `` Pragmatism . ''

		It marks the fact that the cohorts have gathered again , that the dogmas of sentimentalism are again confronted by the dogmas of intellectualism , and that the era of agnosticism in science , even as the era of mere belief in religion , is at an end .

		Again men are assured they know .

		The truce is over and the immemorial war between sentiment and sense is on again .

		The book therefore is not only a citadel of intellectualism , it is an attack as well .

		Its nov - elty , which lies there , consists rather in the radi - cal use it makes of its doctrines than in these doctrines as such .

		Its most interesting hypoth - esis that of the reality of illusions , of secondary qualities is common to all materialisms .

		It is a commonplace of the Epicurean systems , and
Lucretius	PERSON	devotes the major part of Book IV. , in '' De Rerum Natura '' to a demonstration of this reality .

		Hobbes offers analogous arguments both in the '' Leviathan '' and '' De Corpore . ''

		The '' New Realism '' differs from these older materialisms in its sources rather than its con - clusions .

		Like these , it is synchronous with changes in mathematical methods and dis - coveries ; and , like them , it is enamoured of mathematical rigor in demonstration that reality can be analyzed into mathematical elements and can be reconstructed from those elements .

		It asserts , indeed , as did Spinoza , that all exist - ence can be treated in mathematical terms , and when it has cleared away the objections of the enemy will proceed to do so .

		New Realism offers itself first as a polemic .

		To it , the whole philosophic doctrine of the opposition is vitiated by one or more fallacies the fallacy of believing that because you must be aware of the thing you know , your knowing the thing creates it ; the fallacy of supposing a thing to be simple when it really is n't or may not be ; the fallacy of supposing that a thing can have only one character at a time , so that
T. R.	PERSON	can not be a father and an American citi - zen at the same time ; the fallacy of assuming that the beginning of a thing determines its nature ; the fallacy of supposing that there must be an all-inclusive something , in which all things are united ; the fallacy of verbal suggestion , ap - pearing in such terms as `` Eternal , ' '' `` infinite , '' `` highest , '' '' Unity '' ; the fallacy of attributing importance to a thing which does n't really have it .

		To avoid these fallacies common to all philos - ophies , neo-realism proposes the scrupulous use of words , the most careful definition of the terms it uses , rigorous analysis , regard for logi - cal form ; particularly , division of the question , and the formulation of all points of explicit agreement among philosophers .

		It proposes , furthermore , `` the separation of philosophical research from the study of the history of phil - osophy . ''

		Neo-realism proposes , in a word , mathematical rigor in method .

		It suggests the starting-point of a new scholasticism , the scholasticism of science .

		As such , it offers itself as a common platform to the special
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 339 sciences , as a coordinator , synthesizer , and gen - eralizer of them , in a real world metaphysically plural in which cognition has the role of an ex - ternal relation of the organizer to an independ - ent environment ; in which , that is , knowledge does not constitute or alter the nature of what is known . ''

		The world is of an articulate structure that is revealed by analysis , consisting of complexes , like bodies , persons , and societies as well as of simples .

		The simple constituents of the world comprise both sensible qualities and logical constants .

		Both enter into the tissue of fact , and both possess an inherent and inalienable character of their own .

		There is no safe refuge from this conclusion in the abandonment of intellectual rigor .

		Hence all speculative versions of the world that require the withholding of analysis , or that depend on the unique and preeminent status of the act of cognition , must be rejected , no matter how eagerly they may be desired for the justification of faith .

		They must be rejected in favor of such hypotheses as may be formulated in terms of the evident composition of the known world , and verified by its actual interrelations , history , and trend . ''

		The book consists from here on of an elabor - ation of this dogma .

		Inasmuch as epistemology is the stronghold of the idealistic conception of the world , Mr.
Walter T. Marvin	PERSON	shows that metaphysics is independent of epistemology .

		Since , in epistemology , the argument for ideal - ism turns on the conception that the things we know depend for their existence on our knowing them , it becomes needful to demonstrate that being known and being dependent are not the same , and that conversely being known is a case of '' independence . ''

		This makes needful a defi - nition of independence , which Mr.
Kalph Bart	PERSON	- on
Perry	PERSON	supplies , not altogether successfully .

		Since the new dogmatic sentimentalism bases so much of its construction on the criticism of intellect and analysis , there is needful a defense of analysis .

		This is made by Mr.
Edward Gleason Spaulding	PERSON	, but it is error to think that analysis is any better off when he is done .

		With Mr.
Spaulding	PERSON	's work the road is cleared , and the constructive papers begin .

		The first , by Mr.
William Peppernell Montague	PERSON	, offers a `` realistic theory of truth and error '' unusually like
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	's , and unusually out of sympathy with the conceptions of his comrades of the book .

		Then follow Mr.
Edwin B. Holt	PERSON	's papers on the place of illusory experience in a realistic world , and Mr.
Walter B. Pitkin	PERSON	's paper on `` Some Realistic Implications of Biology . ''

		Both are hard and too compact , but they are well worth the effort of reading .

		The upshot of their keen analyses is the mathematization of the universe , but it has still to be shown that a universe aboriginally through and through mathematical is not quite as wonderful a piece of imagination as a universe aboriginally through and through psychological .

		And there is some advantage in being able to build on facts instead of being compelled to deny them .

		THE GENESIS OF ENGLISH CHIVALRY .

		* Chivalry as a living force in modern civiliza - tion , as a guide to conduct , and as an inspiration to nobler conceptions of human duty is the theme of Professor
Schofield	PERSON	's new volume , which is an amplification of lectures delivered at the Sor - bonne and at
the University of Copenhagen	ORGANIZATION	.

		In his Introduction the author says : '' My object in these lectures is to show , if I can , by an examination of the life and works of four celebrated English writers , how the ideal of French chivalry entered into English literature and thereby affected the attitude of the English-speaking world .

		... I shall endeavour , in sum , to indicate the genesis of the idea conveyed by the English word gentleman , ' with all that it suggests in our use .

		Much enthusiasm will be awakened by the sensitive and high-minded way in which Professor
Schofield	PERSON	has illuminated certain of the ideals of chivalry , and has indicated their share in forming the ethical standards of a race famous for courage and honor .

		Sketching briefly the essential details of biography , he proceeds to point out the specific illustrations of chivalric ideals in the work of
Chaucer , Malory	ORGANIZATION	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and to phrase each author 's peculiarly individual attitude towards mediaeval chivalry .

		There is something pleasantly paradoxical in this spectacle of an American defining to a French audience the way in which the English race has refined and polished French ideals .

		Comparative literature is fast breaking down our preconceived notions about sharply-defined racial differences of imagination , and we are emerging from our bigoted belief in instinctive national virtues ; yet there is danger that we may be led astray by apostles who discover too many resemblances and too much consanguinity in interpreting a theme .

		This , in some degree , is a fault of Professor
Schofield	PERSON	's book , for he fails to do justice , in his study of chivalry , to those qualities which are derived not from French but from Germanic sources .

		He says , quite * CHIVALBY IN ENGLISH LITERATURE .

		340 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	specifically -LRB- p. 272 -RRB- : `` In Northern heathen - dom , warriors were sturdy , but they believed in brag ; they were straightforward , but given to ferocity ; to them revenge was a duty , and sweet . ''

		Was Roland free from brag , were
Arthur	PERSON	and
Launcelot	PERSON	and
Gawain	PERSON	free from ferocity , was revenge a duty to
Charlemagne	LOCATION	after
Roland	ORGANIZATION	's death ?

		Surely a dispassionate reader will find in Beowulf a courtesy , a graciousness , a love of truth and steadfastness as noble as in any French knight .

		The German stock does not yield to the French in stability of purpose , in grim deter - mination and perseverance , and we will not cede to the French complete domination over our ideals of `` Trouthe and honour , fredom and curteisye . ''

		It must be remembered that the words trouthe and fredom -LRB- generosity -RRB- are Saxon by derivation , by inheritance , and by loyal service .

		The essay on Chaucer seems the most satis - factory , partly because
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	is closer to the mediaeval world , and partly because it is less difficult to choose the significant aspects of his work .

		The account of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's life and the exposition of his spiritual development are ex - cellent , for here are classified many traits in Chaucer which have hitherto been treated ob - scurely .

		Special note should be taken of Pro- fessor
Schofield	PERSON	's observations upon the French source of Chaucer 's description of the knight .

		This is a contribution to Chaucerian scholarship that will not soon be forgotten .

		Next in order of importance is the account of Spenser , for here the mood of the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	is interpreted very eagerly and appealingly by the author , who `` through infusion sweet '' is quick to appreciate the philosophy of the poet .

		Genuine admiration and scholarly understand - ing characterize this study of Spenser .

		To
Malory	PERSON	and to Shakespeare the author has not given as significant treatment as to the other two writers , and in these discussions appears a flaw in his presentation of chivalry .

		No true conception of the mediaeval knight can ignore the part which warfare occupied in his life .

		In serving his God , his lord , and his lady , he had , perforce , to do battle , furious and bloody .

		The chevalier was a warrior , and in Spenser 's `` Faerie Queene '' we read again and again how '' He stroke , he soust , he foynd , he hewd , he lasht . ''

		Our modern repugnance to war can not excuse us from placing a proper emphasis upon this crude and bloody element in mediaeval chivalry .

		The beauty of
Malory	ORGANIZATION	's book lies very largely in his pictures of the brilliant pageantry of battle , where struggling , baffled , yearning knights blunder along their mortal pathway and slowly learn that spiritual strength was his `` who only overcame himself . ''

		The militant note in chivalry should be more strongly emphasized , for the warring and crusading strength of the knight has been a high ideal to many a modern Englishman who has scorned to sit in noble contemplation while there were wrongs to be righted by action .

		In the essay on Shakespeare it is unavoid - able that there should be unevenness , and that topics should be merely touched upon rather than developed adequately .

		While there is much that is true and suggestive in the study of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's conception of honor , and in the account of his presentation of love from the chivalric point of view , it seems as if Professor
Schofield	PERSON	conveys an impression of far deeper obligation than
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	ever owed to chiv - alry .

		Could any foreigner , hearing this account , doubt that
Shakespeare	PERSON	was essentially imita - tive ?

		It is because Shakespeare so supremely exceeded his traditions and his reading , because he went so profoundly to the original heart of things , that it is unfair to trace his conceptions of honor and of love back to knightly codes .

		If he does use the diction associated with chiv - alry , he is not indebted to that for his ideals .

		From Plutarch and from Homer , as well as from French chivalry , did Shakespeare derive ideals of honor and of noble loyal love , but his own imaginative penetration was the formative element in his philosophy of true gentility .

		Either less should be said about chivalry or more about his original and distinctive outlook , if we are to have a right opinion of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's philosophy of honor .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 341 gives the reader pause .

		In other sciences the body of fact is larger , the liberty of personal interpretation on important points much less .

		This should work out to enrich the reference and text books on this subject ; what really happens is that they tend to become a little dry and erratic , this tendency being obviously limited in accordance with the insight , depth of nature , and extent of experience of the individ - ual author .

		You can not write conclusively or acceptably , for the mature mind , about woman 's place in the social order without these three qualifications .

		It is rare that the academic sociologist possesses them all in over-flowing measure , and yet he needs them greatly .

		He lias in his hands a most powerful lever affecting human action .

		It will not matter very much in after-life if the college-student should accept unsound doctrine in physics or geology or even biology , but if he accepts it in sociology it may matter greatly .

		It is perhaps for the best that youth grows less docile under instruction in these latter days !

		Sociological speculation is probably as desir - able as it is inevitable , but it is equally desirable that there should be some line of demarcation in teaching between the body of facts common to all in the profession , and the purely personal interpretation of them .

		One finds illustrations of individual bias even in the most open-minded writers . ''

		The Woman in Modern Society , '' ` by Professor
Earl Barnes	PERSON	, is lucid , cautious , and sane beyond the wont of such studies , but the author regards the modern family as one of our institutional forms much in need of revision .

		Though he is as far as possible from irrational denunciation of any of civilization 's existing moulds , he seems to think that marriage as it is must eventually go to the scrap-heap .

		He is especially opposed to any sacramental theory of marriage , regarding this as entirely a church - made product resting upon theological dogma .

		The young person studying these pages would never guess that the Church did not `` make marriage a sacrament '' by arbitrary fiat , but , instead , acknowledged openly a secret human belief whose roots run down to the core of being .

		Such beliefs may change their names or their forms , but they do not pass away .

		They remain to be reckoned with while civilizations rise and fall , and sociologists needs must reckon with them .

		Mr. and Mrs.
Nearing	PERSON	's '' Woman and Social Progress '' is simply and clearly written , as for beginners in thinking .

		It discusses in lively fashion the influences that have shaped the American woman , with especial reference to the breadth of her present opportunities and her best use of them .

		Young readers will find it sincere and helpful , especially in the chapters dealing with woman 's opportunity through eu - genics , education , domesticity , and philanthropy .

		The authors wisely recognize that a woman 's best work will be done with the grain of her tastes and characteristics rather than against it ; but the older reader wonders how they harmonize the sweeping statement that `` some industrial occupation is necessary '' for several classes , in - cluding all girls between school and marriage , for all young wives and all middle-aged women , with the just stress they lay upon the creation of atmosphere in the home .

		For atmosphere is not a work of art , once created and forever en - during ; it is a laboratory product that must be distilled daily , and while woman can , and does , do most things excellently well to-day , she can not in one life-time do all things and do them well .

		The author of `` Why Women Are So '' adopts as a working hypothesis the theory that `` the characteristic behavior called feminine '' is an attitude of mind produced by coercive social habits of the past .

		She deals especially with the women of the nineteenth century , finding that they were for the most part what men expected them to be , their foibles being due to sex-tradition rather than sex-characteristics .

		This hypothesis is much more reasonable than the method Professor
Coolidge	PERSON	takes to prove it .

		The first half of her book is very amusing , but hardly susceptible of verification .

		She assumes a typical woman of sixty years ago , re - creating from the pages of `` Godey 's Ladies ' Book '' and the `` Books of Beauty '' a frail , ignorant , silly , would-be genteel little person .

		She compares this invention , not with the hobble-skirted , heavy-hatted bridge-fiend of the
last decade	DATE	, but with the finest twentieth - century type imaginable , and then belabors the poor creature , her virtues , habits , education , clothes , all that is hers , until the reader revolts .

		Surely the author must , even now , meet many of the still-surviving nineteenth-century women of the better class .

		Few younger matrons have the force , wit , intelligence , and the curious depth of personality to be found in hundreds of the dames now between seventy and ninety-five .

		With all the modern girl 's fine qualities , her opportunities are too numerous to profit by , and , as compared with her grandmother , she sometimes lacks depth and exhibits egotism .

		Nevertheless , it would be most unfair to re - construct her , some sixty years hence , from 342 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	our current fashion plates and Mr.
Harrison Fisher	PERSON	's pretty but soulless pictures .

		When Professor
Coolidge	PERSON	abandons the attack on this mid - Victorian Frankenstein and begins to fore - cast the future , her observations , which are always entertaining , become at once judicious and as sound as it is possible to be upon a subject so little permitting dogmatism as the coming woman .

		The gist of the lay reader 's complaint against current sociology , when dealing with woman , is that it lacks insight into many elemental con - cepts of human nature and many long-established standards of worth ; that it loses sight of all but economic values , and is pragmatic in the de - based sense of demanding that woman 's work for society be such as can be appraised in dollars .

		Just in so far as it does these things , it becomes arid and unprofitable .

		Few writers make all of these mistakes , and some make none of them .

		The author of '' Woman 's Share in Social Cul - ture '' has achieved the feat of becoming a soci - ologist and remaining exquisitely reasonable and human .

		The book has atmosphere , perspective , human interest ; it is full of stimulus to thought and of an admirable justice and right-mindedness .

		To the sanity and lucidity so necessary in such studies , the author unites a keen sense of the eternal values .

		We have a right to demand this latter quality in work which can not be broadly - based without it , yet thus far sociological writers have met that demand but meagrely .

Emerson Venable	PERSON	.


Cincinnati	LOCATION	:
Stewart & Kidd Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		By generation was to give to the Werder lectures , published in
1875	DATE	, he might have disapproved the connection of his name with
Werder	ORGANIZATION	's as heralding a solution of the problem , he might have disclaimed scaling any heights himself , and have suggested that
Werder	PERSON	had missed his foot - ing by proving too much in the concluding lec - ture of his course , where , with characteristic vigor in animating the minutest incidents of a scene , the inquiry is implied whether the revenge of the Ghost is accomplished after all , whether the minds of the assembled court know , or even suspect , the existence of a ghost , the murder of a king , the minds that delay the revenge , ac - cording to the Werder argument ; or whether , in the minds of the court , and perhaps the twentieth century audience of the play , the re - venge of the Queen prompts Hamlet to actions or whether the King 's real object with the poisoned cup and the envenomed point excite ; a revenge in Hamlet easier understood by the audience for whom the play was written an audience among whom duels were honorable and ghosts able to execute their own commands .

		In any event , the Werder theory has re - ceived more adherents than any that have gone before .

		And certainly the vigor and terseness of
Werder	ORGANIZATION	's style , in connection with the eloquence inspired by the rapture of his `` discovery , '' have had the effect of rejuvenating a literary interest in the play .

		Werder aroused the combative spirits .

		Professor
Bradley	PERSON	's work , published in
1905	DATE	, took issue with the Werderites , and since then the Werder stock has been falling , while a new crop of Hamlet theories is materializing .

		Mr.
Arthur Stringer	PERSON	has discovered Hamlet 's malady to be
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's neurasthenia ; and Dr.
Ernest Jones	PERSON	has discovered it to be some - thing worse , or better , according to your appre - hension of his theory -LRB- `` The CEdipus-Complex as an Explanation of Hamlet 's Mystery : A Study in Motive , '' by
Ernest Jones	PERSON	,
M.D.	LOCATION	, `` American Journal of Psychology , ''
January , 1910	DATE	-RRB- .

		Not being a physician , I must leave Mr.
Stringer	PERSON	to Dr.
Jones	PERSON	, and Dr.
Jones	PERSON	to his fellow-practitioners .

		Mr.
Venable	PERSON	's theory has been proclaimed as original , and certainly it is more intelligible to a layman than some of greater pretensions .

		That theory , briefly , is of a mystery within
Hamlet	LOCATION	, as well as in his external difficulties .

		Mr.
Venable	PERSON	presents Hamlet as a reflex of our - selves , reflecting experiences in an inner world that are common among all human beings of every age and clime .

		Here are Mr.
Venable	PERSON	's own words :
1913	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 343 '' In view of the breadth of the author 's design in this tragdy and the organic relation of the central person to that design , one conclusion is unavoidable : that since Hamlet , in the many-sidedness of his character , may be said to typify mankind , representing , as it were , the universal human , his internal struggle must be typical and representative . ''

		This theory does not , however , in its main outline , differ materially from that propounded in
1888	DATE	by Mr.
Martin W. Cooke	PERSON	, and answered in
1910	DATE	by Mr.
Robert Russell Benedict	PERSON	-LRB- `` The Mystery of Hamlet , Prince of
Denmark	LOCATION	, '' Lip - pincott -RRB- , who maintained that `` Hamlet is plainly not a type , but one individual , '' for '' Shakespeare shows in all his other plays his interest in and knowledge of the individual , and it is this inter - est and knowledge , together with his poetic imagination , that have given us that gallery of human portraits which we recognize at a glance , and linger to study and enjoy .

		Nothing is more improbable , nor impossible , than that he should , or could , have entirely changed his mental habit and method of work in writing Hamlet . ''

		Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Mr.
Venable	PERSON	's eloquent treatment of his subject is the importance he gives the soliloquies as rep - resenting
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's method of shedding light upon the progressive action of the drama .

		He represents these soliloquies as expressions in gradation `` from immature to mature man - hood , a mental and spiritual ripening . ''

		At the opening of the play , Hamlet is a `` blown youth '' the inference of Mr.
Venable	PERSON	being that he is considerably younger than at the close of the play , where the capricious text is accepted that suggests Hamlet has reached the mature age of thirty .

		It seems to me that in some of the earlier passages , notably in the scene with the Ghost , and in the scene where he unmasks his school - fellows , the Prince has the poise of a seer , is rich in experience , acumen , and wisdom .

		The scene in
Ophelia	LOCATION	's grave is excused by some as an outburst of youthful passion .

		While there is anything but mature mind here , the scene may be a concession by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	- to the Elizabethan passion for personal combats , espe - cially when a woman 's honor was involved .

		It was not needed for the advancing of the action .

		Laertes was already in a vengeful state .

		In any event , the soliloquies can not be relied upon to explain away all the difficulties in the play .

		In passing , mention should be made of the doubt which the soliloquy in Act IV. , Sc .

		iv. , caused
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was dropped in the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	, and Professor Miles is entitled to more attention than he has received in what he has to say on the subject .

		In the words of Mr.
Venable	PERSON	, his `` Review of Hamlet '' is a `` sane appreciation '' of the play .

		But Mr.
Venable	PERSON	fails to mention this doubt , which it is perfectly clear Shakespeare had .

		With regard to the celebrated speech of `` To be , or not to be , '' Mr.
Benedict	PERSON	and Mr.
Venable	PERSON	are far apart .

		Mr.
Benedict	PERSON	can see nothing in the passage but a rhythm so perfect in wording that it `` drugs the senses and lulls the reader into a repose that neither doubts nor questions . ''

		It is incoherent in argument , and a dramatic discord in the play .

		Mr.
Venable	PERSON	says nothing about its setting , but is impressed with its implication `` typifying a universal human experience . ''

		Mr.
Venable	PERSON	's and Mr.
Benedict	PERSON	's essays should be read together .

		They help each other by their opposite methods of treatment .

		Each whets an interest in the play .

		Each writer is charmed with this child of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's brain .

		Perhaps the play can not be spoiled so long as the critics use the rod only on each other .

		344 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	takes us to the extreme western limits of the country the almost unknown islands of the north
Pacific	LOCATION	coast ; while the last describes a journey down the
Mackenzie River	LOCATION	to
Fort McPherson	LOCATION	and up the Yukon to
Dawson City	LOCATION	.

		In an entertaining volume of some 350 pages , Mr.
Stanley Washburn	PERSON	describes his adventures in the
Canadian Rockies	ORGANIZATION	, between the years
1897	DATE	and
1909	DATE	.

		During this period he made some half-dozen trips into the mountains , at first confessedly as a '' tenderfoot , '' afterward as a more or less experienced traveller .

		Sometimes with pack-trains , sometimes with canoe , he wandered far and wide throughout the lofty borderland between
Alberta	LOCATION	and
British Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, camping by unknown rivers , or at the foot of towering , unnamed peaks , hunting mountain sheep and smaller game , or filling his kettle with fish from the clear , cold waters of some mountain stream .

		The book has the defects as well as the advantages of a gossipy , discursive narrative ; but through it all runs the compelling charm of the wilderness , of days and nights beneath the stars , of misty mountain peaks , dancing streams , and the whispered music of the pines , of the trail that leads you know not whither , of unforgetable glimpses of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's fairyland , of the camp-fire , the evening pipe , and the yarns of hunter and trapper .

		And with it all is much practical comment on railway building , grades through the mountains , and the coming era of development in the new country to which the Yellowhead Pass is the gateway .

		Much , too , gleaned from old trappers and pioneers , of the vanishing days of the fur-trade , when
Jasper House	ORGANIZATION	and Boat Encampment and the Tete Jaune Cache were familiar names , and the all-powerful
H. B. C.	PERSON	ruled over an almost continental empire .

		That six summers in the mountains have not weakened the influence of the wilderness , would appear from Mr.
Washburn	PERSON	's concluding words .

		`` If all goes well , '' he says , `` by the time these pages reach the printer 's hands ,
Fred Stephens	PERSON	-LSB- the well-known mountain guide -RSB- and myself will be well down the turbulent waters of the old
Fraser	PERSON	, poking into the lair of cer - tain grizzly bears that he knows about , with the roar of the river , unlocked from winter 's grasp , as our lullaby while we sleep with the blue canopy of heaven overhead and a foot of pine needles for our couch . ''

		Mr.
Hulbert Footner	PERSON	modestly disclaims his fit - ness to describe the '' New Rivers of the North '' which form the subject of his narrative . ''

		It needs , '' he says , `` a geologist , a botanist and a poet to do them justice . ''

		It is conceivable that such a combin - ation might not be an altogether happy one ; and on the whole one may safely prefer this bird in the hand to three perhaps discordant birds in the bush .

		Mr.
Footner	PERSON	is the sort of travelling companion any sane man would choose , in preference to a geologist , a botanist , or even to a poet if one may say it with - out seeming offensive to those learned and ornamen - tal members of society .

		He is an ideal companion to travel with through the pages of his book , and , from what one sees of him there , it is equally safe to say that he would be an ideal companion for any man on such an expedition as he so entertainingly describes .

		His narrative is instinct with the pure joy of the wanderer in wild places .

		At every bend of the river he makes you share the unalloyed delight of the traveller who knows not what may lie beyond that bend : what fascinating vista of mountain or meadow or unspoiled woodland ; what blood-stirring glimpse of approaching rapid or waterfall ; what bewildering labyrinth of islands , or lost channels , or elusive portage .

		He does not attempt to gloss the discomforts of such a journey : the inevitable rainy days , the accidents that must sometimes happen to canoe or tent or provisions , the inquisitive black fly and the industrious mosquito ; but he makes one feel that with good health , an even temper , and the saving gift of humor , even the deadly '' galley-nipper '' may be endured , for the sake of the many things that are worth while in such an expedition .

		The earlier part of Mr.
Footner	PERSON	's journey was over waterways which , although unfamiliar to most of us , were not altogether untravelled .

		When , however , he reached the banks of the
Hay River	LOCATION	, he was almost in unexplored ter - ritory .

		Bishop
Bompas	PERSON	had descended the river in
1872	DATE	and discovered the falls ; and twenty-six years afterward a three-man outfit , bound for the Klon - dike , had passed the same way .

		In
1887	DATE	,
R. G. McConnell	PERSON	, of the
Canadian Geological Survey	ORGANIZATION	, had surveyed the river from its mouth up to the falls , but not beyond .

		Provisions ran short on the long journey down the Hay , the season was getting late , and Mr.
Footner	PERSON	had almost despaired of reaching the goal of his ambition ,
Alexandra Falls	PERSON	, when , at the last moment , he came upon it unexpectedly .

		One shares his enthusiasm as he stands at the brink , where the great river '' steps off into space . ''

		`` After the invariable flatness and tameness of all the country above , this sudden cleft in the world impressed one stunningly .

		It had the same dramatic effect as the passion of a quiet man .

		I can only compare it to
Niagara	LOCATION	on a smaller scale , but
Niagara	LOCATION	as it must have burst on La Salle 's eyes , sans tourist-hotels , power-houses , and railway bridges .

		Its charm was in its insolent wildness . ''

		Mr.
Footner	PERSON	secured a number of remarkable photo - graphs of the falls , and these and many others taken elsewhere along his route add materially to the value of his volume .

		Mr.
Joseph Adams	PERSON	's book might be described as the narrative of an attempt to get off the beaten track in
Canada	LOCATION	.

		That he was successful in his attempt , his book bears witness .

		From French River in the east to the
Skeena Valley	LOCATION	in the west , this indefatigable and wide-awake English traveller made his way into many comparatively unfamiliar parts of the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	, noting everything that a man of very catholic tastes could find interesting .

		And as it was necessary in order to reach the more remote corners of the country to pass through the
Eastern Provinces	ORGANIZATION	, as well as the rapidly growing and ambi - tious cities of the western prairies , Mr.
Adams	PERSON	improved the opportunity by studying the social , industrial , and political life of the people as he went along .

		His book is , in fact , something of an ency -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 345 clopaedia of present-day
Canada	LOCATION	, written from the point of view of a sympathetic and fair-minded observer .

		If it has a fault , it is in the attempt to crowd too many topics , too many varieties of topics , into a 300-page volume .

		The reader is bewildered with the kaleidoscopic changes from Canadian scenery to Jesuit missions , politics , scientific angling , cooperative labor , natural history , folklore , agricul - ture , transcontinental railways , education , million - aires , chinook winds , horse breeding , irrigation , suffragettes , and the cost of living .

		On the whole , however , the book is well worth reading , and no part of it more so than the very clear and interesting chapter on
Northern British Columbia	LOCATION	, or
New Cale	LOCATION	- donia , the tremendous and varied resources of which are even to-day only beginning to be realized .

		Those who recall Mr.
Charles Sheldon	PERSON	's ``
Wilder	PERSON	- ness of the Upper Yukon '' will need no recommend - ation of this companion volume , `` The Wilderness of the
North Pacific Coast	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		If anything , the last book is even better than the first .

		Mr.
Sheldon	PERSON	now takes us with him while he hunts wapiti on
Vancouver Island	LOCATION	, the huge bear of
Montague Island	LOCATION	, and his brother of
Admiralty Island	LOCATION	, and the elusive caribou of the
Queen Charlotte Islands	ORGANIZATION	.

		But while a keen sportsman and scientist , he is something more , as the following passage will witness : `` All winter my thoughts had turned toward
Montague Island	LOCATION	and its bears .

		Now the trip was accomplished and past .

		But all the incidents and experiences of it still linger with me .

		The beautiful , calm ocean voyage ; the village of Nuchek and its natives ; the snow-bound
Zaikof Bay	LOCATION	, where the air vibrated musically to the echoing voices of the water - fowl , where sweet bird notes sounded from the woods and the exquisite little humming-bird darted about my camp ; the east coast , rock and reef bound , bordered by white breakers and dotted far out from shore by foam from the sea surging over the reefs ; the high , rugged snow-capped mountain ranges ; the hilly woods , resplendent glades , deep canyons , gorges , and dashing cascades ; the rumble of sliding snow in the mountain-girdled basins overlooking the ocean below ; the violent storms , and gloomy , blank days passed in the inhospitable barra-barras ; the irresponsible natives ; the joyous fulfilment of
spring	DATE	in the wilderness . ''

		Here , again , one must feel grateful for the many excellent photographic illustrations that help so materially to keep the reader in intimate touch with Mr.
Sheldon	PERSON	's narrative .

		In the year
1906	DATE	, Mr.
Elihu Stewart	PERSON	, as Super - intendent of Forestry for the
Dominion of Canada	ORGANIZATION	, made a journey on behalf of the government down the
Mackenzie River	LOCATION	to
Fort McPherson	LOCATION	, and by way of the Porcupine to the Yukon and
Dawson City	ORGANIZATION	.

		His official report is a valuable public docu - ment , and contains a great deal of very important material on the timber and other resources of the immense region through which he travelled ; but in the very nature of things , he had to omit from that report many interesting details of his journey , re - lating to the country and its native and occasional civilized inhabitants .

		These details he has brought together in his volume entitled `` Down the Mac - kenzie and Up the Yukon . ''

		With the addition of some thirty photographic illustrations , for the most part taken by himself , Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	has succeeded in producing a very readable book , and one that adds something of value to the scanty literature of this remote region .

		One incident may very well suggest the quality of the book .

		On the outer edges of civili - zation , before one actually jumps off into the land of the Indian and fur-trader , there are certain very primitive and uncomfortable inns called `` sleeping places . ''

		Says Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	: '' I had the honour of occupying a place on a wide bed made on the floor of one of these road houses .

		Among the company were
Bishop Young of Athabaska Landing	ORGANIZATION	, the late Bishop
Holmes	PERSON	, then
Archdeacon of Lesser Slave Lake	ORGANIZATION	, a Roman Catholic priest from
Peace River	LOCATION	, and several half breeds .

		Bishop Young and I agreed to ' double up ' under the same blankets , while the
Archdeacon	PERSON	and Pere Lazaret made the same arrangement .

		After each of the men of Holy Orders had offered up his evening devotions in his own forms , the priest and the archdeacon , who were neighbours in the mission field , commenced a conversation , not in the native language of either , but in
Cree	LOCATION	.

		There was no affec - tation in this .

		Father Lazaret was of course familiar with French but knew very little English , while the archdeacon was not particularly fluent in French ; but a common ground of communication was found in the tongue of the Cree Indian in which both were equally at home . ''


LAWRENCE J. BURPEE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS oiv NEW BOOKS .

		During the last twenty years , the fnmanv ^ ands .

		amovmt f S od work that has b done in the domain of art history , by the systematic and well-regulated labors of trained explorers and excavators , is truly enormous .

		Even the last half-dozen years have revealed some thirty palaeolithic picture-galleries , as well as much sculp - ture of the same period .

		Through these , we have learned that the origins of art are much more remote than formerly they were supposed to be ; also , that even in these remote periods , there were traces of varying phases , sometimes spasmodic develop - ment , sometimes stagnation , sometimes retrogres - sion .

		Reports of these `` finds '' have been issued from time to time , mainly through technical bulletins or journals .

		Few , except specialists , perhaps have realized either the amount or the value of the new knowledge .

		Some general and connected narrative has been much needed .

		Hence , '' The Childhood of Art '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , by Dr.
H. G. Spearing	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, of Queen 's College ,
Oxford	LOCATION	, is a book to command attention .

		It is , in fact , so fully up to date that it makes more or less note of everything thus far published and of some things so new as to be yet unpublished .

		The geologist , the archaeologist , the ethnologist will each find something in his own field ; and all will be especially grateful for the 482 repro - ductions in black and white and the sixteen color plates , some of which now appear for the first time .

		The sub-title of the book is `` The Ascent of Man , '' and this subject is traced from prehistoric times to the beginnings of Greek Art .

		But the volume is far from being merely a technical work .

		The style 346 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	is so vivid , the treatment so picturesque , that the narrative is as entertaining as it is enlightening .

		The cave men painted or carved , not as we do for decoration or diversion , but mainly for the sake of creating fetiches or charms , thinking thus to gain some mysterious power over the objects represented .

		Clean , firm , unhesitating strokes were distinctive of palaeolithic artists ; they were mighty hunters as well as close observers of wild animals ; they drew neither from life nor from models , but from memory .

		Although the cave man must have had a hard time fighting for his existence , he managed to exercise his faculties of perception and memory and to create works of art that are far superior to any by the modern savage .

		What became of the palaeolithic man with his acute artistic perception and his simple manner of life , no one knows .

		The centre of artistic interest shifts next to
Africa	LOCATION	and
Siberia	LOCATION	; later to
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Chaldea	LOCATION	,
Crete	ORGANIZATION	, and
Greece	LOCATION	.

		In each case , the stimulus to artistic effort was given by impulses wholly unconnected with any desire for works of art .

		Palaeolithic man evolved his art from a desire to have control over the forces of nature ; the Asiatic from a desire to display his control over his fellow-men ; the Egyptian from a desire to secure a dwelling - place for his spirit after death ; the Greek from a desire to secure the earthly presence of his gods .

		Yet in all the Yvistory of art , there is no single in - stance of an artistic race going forth to conquer .

		Strange paradox of fate !

		The bearers of the light are doomed to death , and yet the light survives and glows .

		A scientist 's ^ ne heterogeneous collection of essays discussion of and addresses by
Sir Oliver Lodge	ORGANIZATION	varied subjects , brought together under the title , `` Modern Problems '' -LRB-
George H. Doran Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , may seem to some readers a mere jungle of `` shoes and ships and sealing-wax . ''

		Still , it well deserves the dignity of the name `` book '' ; for , according to the definition of
Ruskin	PERSON	-LRB- whom Sir Oliver so delights to quote -RRB- , it is `` a wise man 's work honestly and benevolently done . ''

		Through the apparent mis - cellaneity there is evident the unity of a great and sympathetic man 's mind ; from the successive flashes on this and that subject , a reader soon learns to locate and revere the writer .

		The range of theme is truly amazing .

		It is doubtful whether any other recent writer in an age of specialization has shown so many clear-cut facets to his thinking , or approached so many fields with a like preparation and adequacy .

		Here one finds philosophy -LRB- ''
Balfour	PERSON	and
Bergson	PERSON	'' -RRB- , science -LRB- `` The Nature of Time '' -RRB- , literary criticism -LRB- `` The Responsibility of Authors '' -RRB- , sociology -LRB- `` The Position of Women '' and `` Some Social Reforms '' -RRB- , economics -LRB- `` The Functions of Money '' -RRB- , and ethics -LRB- `` The Pursuit of Wealth '' -RRB- .

		The author 's sphere , so far as manifested in this book , is not creative in any field ; there is nothing here that is altogether new .

		But there is a wealth of luminous illustration and a delightful lucidity and sanity of interpreting power .

		The discussion of the old fallacies of mo - tion ,
Zeno	ORGANIZATION	's and others , in `` The Nature of Time '' will be found good .

		This essay , together with ``
Balfour	PERSON	and
Bergson	PERSON	, '' reprinted from `` The Hib - bert Journal , '' `` The Responsibility of Authors , '' an address delivered before the
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	in
1909	DATE	, and `` The Pursuit of Wealth , '' an address to Evening Students at Liverpool given in
1886	DATE	, are among the most valuable pieces .

		Space will not permit of quotation , though many passages would richly merit notice for style as well as substance .

		Admirers of Professor
William James	PERSON	will find numerous evidences of stylistic as well as intellec - tual kinship between these two great contemporary men of science and letters .

		Perhaps there appears more of the indulgent patriarch in these essays than in the writings of the American , but there is never - theless the same charm of intellectual camaraderie .

		Four months ' on a
United States	LOCATION	battleship , outing with the even in the piping times of peace , is
Atlantic Fleet	ORGANIZATION	.

		no ^ d ev oid of ever-varying interest and excitement , as is made evident by Mr.
Robert W. Neeser	PERSON	's report of his four months ' sojourn on the '' Kansas '' during a practice cruise of the
Atlan	PERSON	- tic Fleet in Cuban waters . ''

		A
Landsman	PERSON	's Log '' -LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- tells the story of his experi - ences , describing minutely and realistically the daily routine , the various drills and inspections , the spec - tacular and awe-inspiring gun-practice , the recrea - tions and holiday diversions of the sailors , and other things little known except to those who go down to the sea in ships of war .

		An early conversation with the Navigator of the '' Kansas '' left the author be - wildered by the variety of his new knowledge and unable to retain it all . ''

		But one thing that I do remember , '' he says , '' perhaps because it was the easiest thing to comprehend , was that part of his -LSB- the Navigator 's -RSB- special duties that related to his position as librarian of the ship .

		And then I found out what a splendid collection of books , works on geography , history , professional subjects , travel , fiction and general literature , is at the disposal of every officer and enlisted man on board Uncle
Sam	PERSON	's ships wherever they may be ...
The American Navy	ORGANIZATION	was the first to institute the custom , and the first ship 's library was placed on the old ship-of-the - line
Franklin	PERSON	in the early twenties .

		Few agencies in recent years have done more to raise the tone of the enlisted men in the service , to improve their standards of character and efficiency , and to add to their contentment , than these well-selected libra - ries which are now placed on board our ships .

		Scores of men may daily be seen , scattered about the decks during the idle hours that necessarily do occur even in the busy life of a modern man-of-war , reading , or with pencil and paper working on some problem . ''

		Twenty-six pages of naval statistics and other related information follow the narrative .

		Some of these items might need correction to bring them up to date , as for example the average annual cost of main - taining a battleship , which is given as
$ 682,517.18	MONEY	, including repairs , whereas later figures , if we mis -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 347 take not , make it considerably more than eight hundred thousand dollars .

		At any rate , it is sure to reach the million-dollar mark in the super - dreadnaught of the near future .

		Many excellent views , mostly from the author 's own camera , heighten the attractiveness of his volume .

		.

		.

		It is no doubt worth while , from social progress time to time , to attempt a survey of in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		^ ne soc i a l achievements of the imme - diate past .

		What the nineteenth century accom - plished , in the way of social amelioration , will suggest what the twentieth century may be able to accomplish .

		Of such surveys we have already a considerable number ; we need more of them , how - ever , and therefore welcome Professor
Frederic Austin Ogg	PERSON	's little volume , '' Social Progress in Con - temporary
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		One who attempts to cover the whole social movement in
Europe	LOCATION	through a century of rapid change is necessarily forced either to select carefully the topics for treat - ment , or to describe events in the barest outline .

		The latter is the alternative chosen by Professor
Ogg	PERSON	.

		As a consequence his book reads like a chronicle , rather than like a history .

		The reader is inclined to put it aside as a manual for reference .

		Yet if one does read it from cover to cover , the final impression is inspiring .

		All these old institutions destroyed and all these new institutions created through the unfolding of a single vital impulse , the democratic movement , the realization of the aspira - tions of the common man !

		Such at any rate is the philosophic basis of Professor
Ogg	PERSON	's work .

		Other social philosophers will raise the question whether the social changes of the last century may properly be regarded as the unfolding of a single social force .

		The early nineteenth century gave us liberalism ; the end of the century gave us social democracy .

		Are not the two principles essentially antagonistic ?

		One who believes this to be true will read not without impatience a book which sums up under the caption `` social progress '' all movements , whether in the direction of liberalism or in the direction of social democracy .

		Social insurance is not progress , from the liberal point of view .

		Free trade is not progress , from the social democratic point of view .

		Nor is progress from the one point of view purely negative from the other .

		Accordingly it is an open question whether social historians can profitably treat of social progress at all , whether they would not best confine themselves to the more modest task of describing social change .

		The breezy American style of Mr. .

		* U '
Higinbotham	PERSON	's '' Three Weeks in
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Reilly & Britton Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- makes the book diverting from cover to cover .

		That its humor should repeatedly remind one of
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	will , we hope , be taken by the author as a compliment . ''

		There are two towns in
Monaco	LOCATION	, '' says Mr.
Higinbotham	PERSON	, '' Monaco proper and
Monte Carlo	ORGANIZATION	which is not . '' ''

		The American away from home , '' we read , `` behaves worse than when at home .

		The Parisian does not .

		He can not .

		He has not the facilities . ''

		`` At Nhnes , with a cupola over the ` i , ' we found an up-to-date hotel with an electric-lighted room and a bathtub resembling a small natatorium . ''

		A little later in his description of the same place , the author says , with rare con - sideration for the printer : `` I will not mention the name of the town with great frequency for fear of running out of ' i ' shades , but you will remember where we are . ''

		The book , with its twenty-three chapters of rapid comment and description and anecdote , and no single page or paragraph devoted to
Paris	LOCATION	, proves very conclusively , if proof were wanted , that there is a
France	LOCATION	, and one well worth visiting , apart from the gay metropolis .

		It is a book that may induce readers to go and convince themselves of this truth by actual experience . ''

		Equipped as she is with excellent railroads , com - fortable hotels , magnificent scenery and centers of historical interest , she -LSB-
France	LOCATION	-RSB- is a model host that all the world might copy to great advantage and profit .

		Whatever is worth doing , is , to
France	LOCATION	, worth doing well . ''

		Good illustrations from photo - graphs accompany the reading matter , but their lavish profusion is paraded neither on the title-page nor in any table of contents .

		Records of doubtless be refreshing to the English many readers , in these revolutionary house-wife .

		days , to turn from the teeming rec - ords of suffragist discussion and activities to such a book as Miss
Rose M. Bradley	PERSON	's `` The English Housewife in the 17th and 18th Centuries '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- .

		Here , at least , one finds the old household gods firmly fixed in their old places .

		At the very outset , on the title-page , stands a text from that chap - ter of Proverbs from which our great-grandmothers chose the verses corresponding to their birthdays , embroidered them on their samplers , and founded their lives upon the precepts they embodied .

		A good portent this , and in the following pages it is easy to trace
King Solomon	PERSON	's impress on the hearts of the long line of house-wives who have kept faith from
Tudor	LOCATION	days , through the varying fortunes of the reigns of the Stuarts with the chill interreg - num of the Commonwealth to the larger oppor - tunities of Georgian days .

		Much gossip , it is true , enlivens Miss
Bradley	PERSON	's chapters , but there is also an abiding sense of honest scholarship in the patience with which old letters , old diaries , old cookery books , and old ledgers have been studied , and made to yield so much that is valuable as well as interesting .

		It was not an easy thing to rule the household province over which the lady the loaf giver of the past was set .

		Her duty it was to see to the spinning and weaving of the flax and wool , which furnished the bedding and napery for her great family ; hers to keep the plate and pewter ; to oversee the cooking and the labors of the still-room .

		She it was who must see that her servants were fittingly clad ; as well as that her sons went to the wars , her daughters 348 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	to their bridals , and herself and her lord to the pleas - ures of the town and court in seemly comfort and splendor .

		She had the ordering of orchard and garden and herh-beds , of poultry-yard , of dairy , and often of the preserving of game .

		Upon her shoulders were laid the care of the aged , and the medication of the ill ; and all the gentle graces of hospitality must be at the tips of her capable fingers .

		Some - times she had a long purse at her command , some - times but a short one ; but throughout her story , shifting from generation to generation , one is always conscious of the basic qualities of devotion to duty , of regard for position , and of a sincere wish to be helpful and gracious .

		Several illustrations from old sources add to the interest of Miss
Bradley	PERSON	's enter - taining volume .

		A cruise to the The awe and mystery of the wide tropics in a ocean and the nameless terrors of the tramp steamer .

		.

		< jense tropical forest are just suffi - ciently felt by the reader of `` The Sea and the Jungle '' -LRB- Button -RRB- to make him glad to take on trust the somewhat rough experiences therein described , and to leave to the author , Mr.
H. M. Tomlinson	PERSON	, the actual encounter with the varied hardships and dangers through which he seems to have a happy faculty for making his way unharmed .

		From Swan - sea to
South America	LOCATION	, up the
Amazon	LOCATION	and far up the
Madeira River	LOCATION	, in the tramp steamer '' Capella , '' Mr.
Tomlinson	PERSON	made his adventurous way , and some - what in the manner of Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	he tells his story , interweaving as he proceeds the yarns spun on shipboard by one and another of his mates .

		The voyage into that density of luxuriant tropical growth appears to have been undertaken to ascertain the feasibility of opening a route for freight boats in con - nection with a new railway line projected by some daring capitalists , and having its location near the boundary line between
Brazil	LOCATION	and
Bolivia	LOCATION	.

		Para , '' a flat congestion of white buildings and red roofs in the .

		sun , '' is touched at on the way , and is made the subject of a good descriptive passage .

		The captain of the `` Capella '' is an interesting character with an almost superstitious aversion to talking about '' getting there , '' as if such talk invited disaster . ''

		He laughed from his mouth only , throwing his head back , showing surprisingly perfect teeth , and laughter did not change the crystalline glitter of his eyes . ''

		Portions of the book have already found acceptance in various leading periodicals .

		Wordsworth as '' The histor y of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's mental poet of nature and spiritual unfolding '' is usually and poet o / man .

		more interesting to the student than consideration of his style , and it is this former aspect that Professor
Elias Hershey Sneath	PERSON	considers in his volume entitled ''
Wordsworth	PERSON	, Poet of Nature and Poet of Man '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- .

		The French critic ,
M. Legouis	PERSON	, has already admirably covered this field as far as the early life of
Wordsworth	PERSON	is concerned ; and in his treatment of the same period Professor
Sneath	PERSON	does not vary much from his predecessor , as he readily admits by frequent quotation and refer - ence .

		Naturally the Frenchman pays considerably more attention to the influence of the Revolution , and to the personal contact of the poet with
Beaupuy	PERSON	-LRB- who is mentioned only once in the volume under review and that quite casually -RRB- than does the Amer - ican .

		For all spiritual biographies of
Wordsworth	PERSON	, '' The Prelude '' is , of course , the ultimate source ; and Professor
Sneath	PERSON	uses it on every page , espe - cially for those years of the poet 's development when he was tried in the fire and not found wanting .

		The more familiar poems are also used to furnish forth a conception of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's teaching about man and nature , especial attention being given to the great '' Ode '' and '' The Excursion . ''

		The poet is made his own interpreter , by means not only of the poems but also of the critical prefaces and letters , so that one is enabled to study him at first hand .

		While it can hardly be said that we have in this volume a distinctive contribution to
Wordsworth	PERSON	scholarship , we have nevertheless a sympathetic pre - sentation , from the point of view of the student of philosophy , revealing
Wordsworth	PERSON	as the poet of our common humanity , as one who has realized the joy that comes through suffering .

		TWO opposite The Druggie between paganism and tendencies idealism , a strife that some writers in literature .

		cnO ose to speak of as the conflict between Hellenism and Hebraism , serves as the main theme of `` Among Famous Books '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- , by
John Kelman	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	English authors are mainly chosen for treatment in illustration of these two con - trary tendencies , though the opening chapter is de - voted to the gods of
Greece	LOCATION	, and the third contrasts
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's `` Faust '' with
Marlowe	PERSON	's `` Dr. Faustus . ''

		Bunyan ,
Pepys	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, Pater , the late
Francis Thompson	PERSON	, and a number of living English writers , give matter for comment and discussion in the re - maining eight papers or lectures for as such they were originally prepared and delivered of this at - tractive volume .

		In his assertion that Pater `` does not force himself upon his readers , nor tempt even the most susceptible to imitate him , '' the author ignores the parodies and the imitations that `` Marius the Epicurean '' and other productions of the same pen have actually evoked ; but he well says that `` unless a man 's style is absolutely offensive , which Pater 's emphatically is not , it is a wise rule to accept it rather as a revelation of the man than as a chance for saying clever things . ''

		There is much excellent reading in Dr.
Kelman	PERSON	's book , and perhaps it is all the more enjoyable if one does not try too hard to separate the paganism from the idealism in the authors discussed .

		We are all partly pagans and partly idealists .

		.

		Timely and interesting is Mr.
Richard	PERSON	The Italian as Bagot > g little book on The Italians of To-day '' -LRB-
F. G.Browne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , written both to remove certain British prejudices against
Italy	LOCATION	's people in general , and more partic - ularly to refute the widely circulated calumnies upon the Italian army in its late conflict with
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		1913J THE DIAL 349 Mr.
Bagot	PERSON	has lived long in
Italy	LOCATION	, and has learned to know the people as few foreigners ever take the trouble to do .

		His earlier volume , '' My Italian Year , '' made this evident ; and his present work reit - erates things there said , and adds new ones .

		Begin - ning near the bottom , he describes first the peasant , then the artisan , after that the professional classes , and continues with chapters on `` Government and Aristocracy , '' `` Church and
State	ORGANIZATION	, '' and `` The Ital - ian Soldier . ''

		A short chapter on `` Modern Italian Literature '' calls attention to foreign ignorance of all but a very few present-day Italian authors , those few having enjoyed the advantage of wide advertise - ment without being necessarily the best or the most representative of their class .

		What Mr.
Bagot	PERSON	has to say on anti-Italian calumnies is uttered with warmth and in a persuasive manner .

		The proba - bility undoubtedly is that he is better informed than were the English and other newspapers that first printed these accounts of alleged discreditable pro- ceedings on the part of the Italian government and the Italian army .

		The book is highly readable and leaves an impression of fair-mindedness and first - hand knowledge .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
Alfred W. Benn	PERSON	's '' History of Modern Philos - ophy '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a manual of modest dimensions , written in the lucid and distinguished manner which we expect from the author .

		Mechanically , the book makes the fatal mistake of exchanging the portraits of
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	and
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, which has certainly made the latter philosopher turn in his grave .

		Messrs.
Hinds	PERSON	,
Noble , & Eldredge	ORGANIZATION	publish a volume which will be peculiarly acceptable to high-school stu - dents who are interested in debating .

		It is entitled Both Sides of 100 Public Questions Briefly Debated , '' and has been compiled by Messrs.
E D. Shurter	PERSON	and
C. C. Taylor	PERSON	.

		The subjects are all questions of the day , and the references , although adequate for high-school purposes , are not overwhelming in quantity .

		The
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	are publishing a series of '' Masterpieces of the English Drama , '' under the gen - eral editorship of Professor
Felix E. Schelling	PERSON	.

		Each volume includes four or five plays , and the following three have appeared :
Marlowe	PERSON	, by Professor
W. L. Phelps	PERSON	,
Webster	PERSON	and Tourneur , by Professor
Ashley H. Thorndike	PERSON	, and
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	, by Professor
Schelling	PERSON	.

		The collection bids fair to become an American '' Mermaid Series . '' ''

		Alphonsus Emperor of
Germany	LOCATION	'' is an Elizabethan play which was published in
1654	DATE	.

		Professor
Herford	PERSON	characterizes it as '' a crude and sanguinary travesty of an imperial election dispute in which the chief interest attaches to a wholly mythical love affair . ''

		The play is attributed , uncertainly , to
Chapman	PERSON	, whose name is on the title-page .

		Mr.
Herbert F. Schwarz	PERSON	has edited a facsimile reprint of the work , which is now published by
Messrs G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		The second series of '' Famous Speeches , '' selected and edited by Mr.
Herbert Paul	PERSON	, comes from Messrs. Little ,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The addresses included are representative specimens of modern and contemporary oratory , and reveal to the student of public speaking -LRB- for whom the collection is intended -RRB- the constantly widening of scope and subject matter in the eloquence of to-day , the comparative concentration and use of facts and reasons in modern addresses , as well as the gradual development of oratory in accordance with traditions and ideals of the past .

		The inexperienced author will find in Mr.
R. D. Blackman	PERSON	's `` Composition and Style '' -LRB-
Edinburgh	LOCATION	:
John Grant	PERSON	-RRB- a serviceable manual dealing with the use of correct English as well as with the general details of printing and publishing .

		Since the first edition appeared , several years ago , numerous handbooks similar in character have been issued from time to time ; but the clearness and explicitness with which it sets forth rules of best usage , with free use of illustration , will maintain for Mr.
Blackman	PERSON	's manual a permanent place among books with rival claims .

		In `` Childhoodin Art '' -LRB-
Chicago	LOCATION	: Altrua Art Library -RRB- , Mrs.
John B. Sherwood	PERSON	aims to summarize briefly a few of the best-known pictures of children , representing the work of artists since the time of the Renaissance to the present day .

		Numerous illustrations accompany her sympathetic descriptions , and convey in part the evanescent spirit of childhood which only a limited num - ber of the world 's great artists have caught successfully .

		The small volume also contains a list of over one hun - dred paintings of children , with the name of the artist and of the gallery where the painting may be found .

		In '' A Handbook of
Norse Mythology	ORGANIZATION	, '' Mr.
A. Clinton Crowell	PERSON	has made a translation from the Danish of
Karl Mortensen	PERSON	's popular handbook of the myths and sagas of the North , long in use for the study of
Norse	ORGANIZATION	mythology in the schools of all the Scandinavian coun - tries .

		The author traces in his introduction the general outlines of Norse mythology , contrastingits more sombre aspects with the brighter myths of the Greeks .

		The stories are told in a clear and vivid style , and a chapter on the hero sagas poetic representations of life mid - way between myth and history concludes the volume , which is published by
Thomas Y. Crowell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` The Family : An Historical and Social Study , '' by Dr.
Charles Franklin Thwing	PERSON	and
Carrie F. Butler Thwing	PERSON	, is reissued in revised and enlarged form by
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	,
Lee & Shepard Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Since
1885	DATE	, when the book was first published , the demand for it as a college text-book in sociology has steadily increased , carrying with it in recent years a parallel demand for bringing its figures and statistics down to date , as has been done in the present volume .

		Tested by several years of use , the soundness and permanency of its historical parts in particular are generally accepted ; the chapters devoted to sociological study have been rewritten in the light of the results of recent social investigations .

		Mr.
Le Roy Jeffers	PERSON	, of the
Circulation Department	ORGANIZATION	of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, has prepared a second and revised edition of his useful '' List of Economic Editions '' -LRB- of well-known books -RRB- , which the

		A more interesting volume of personal biography has rarely dropped into the midst of a jaded world , for it is not every day that the private lives of the members of

		Like the identity of the Man with the Iron Mask , it has always been regarded as one of the mysteries of history that defied solution .

		But at last the one woman in possession of the facts has spoken , and the cogent and dramatic account she gives an account as unshakable in its veracity as the Rock of
Gibraltar	LOCATION	itself leaves no doubt as to the reason for the Prince 's taking off .

		389 THE MEANEST OF TAXES .

		The tariff bill now under consideration by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	is , viewed as a whole , a rational embodiment of the pledges of the party which was given control of the administration for the express purpose of enacting such a measure , and , as such , offers cause for congratulation to those who understand the simple proposition that all forms of special privilege are undemocratic and inimical to the interests of the whole people .

		It makes a notable extension of the free list , and it reduces to reasonable proportions many rates of duty that have been swollen to outrageous figures by the gluttonous greed of the hogs that have been permitted to crowd about the tariff feeding-trough for many years past .

		But in the general chorus of approval that comes from the throats of all save the above-mentioned animals -LRB- whose grunts of dissatisfaction supply the har - mony with its basso ostinato -RRB- , there is one dis - cordant strain of disgust and indignation that deserves a hearing , because it voices the disap - pointment of all educated men at the discovery that the tax on knowledge is to remain as a disgrace to our statute-book .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	is so obviously and typically a representative of the scholarly class of our citizenship that it seems almost unbelievable that he should not have used his utmost influ - ence to secure the abolition of the import duty on books .

		When the measure at last found its way into print , we turned to it with the confi - dent expectation of finding that this obnoxious tax had been deleted , and found , to our amaze - ment , that it had merely been made the subject of a compromise that fifteen per cent had been substituted for the twenty-five per cent hitherto assessed .

		It is a case in which the principle is so much more important than the amount of the tax that we are unable to say `` for this relief , much thanks , '' and must continue to protest against the new rate , as we have always pro- tested against the old one , as an intolerable exaction , as an expression of a spirit that gives the lie to all our boast of encouraging education , or of caring for the higher interests of civiliza - tion .

		When even the tax on art is no longer left to shame us in our own eyes and in the eyes of the enlightened part of the world , the far more atrocious tax on learning is , it seems , to 364 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	be perpetuated .

		Our laws discriminate every - where , and quite properly , in favor of religious and mofral endeavor , in favor of the special claims of women and children to protection , in favor of charity and philanthropy , in favor of art and science and education , and here , in a violent contradiction of spirit , they still propose to discriminate against the cultivation of intel - ligence by putting an artificial difficulty in the way of the scholar who seeks to secure the pro- fessional tools of his trade .

		The physician , the clergyman , the engineer , the historian , the philologist , the poet , and all the others who constitute the class of our most desirable citi - zens must continue to be taxed by the national government upon the instruments necessary to their efficiency .

		It is surely a topsy-turvy civ - ilization in which such a thing is possible .

		The amount of the tax , it need hardly be urged , is not the question at issue .

		The real objection to the imposition is twofold , resting upon both theoretical and practical grounds .

		As a matter of principle , the tax is indefensible because it places a stigma upon forms of en - deavor that it is the duty of every civilized government to encourage .

		As a matter of practice , it makes it impossible for a scholar to send to
London	LOCATION	for a book that he needs , and have it brought to his house by the postman ; to obtain an English book that is dutiable is now a complicated enterprise that has to be care - fully planned out .

		It involves not only paying the few cents of the tax , but also the paying of various fees and a certain amount of vexatious correspondence .

		In the simplest case , when the victim is fortunate enough to live at a port of entry , it involves an interview with the collector of customs , and a possible altercation as to the value of the book which the postal authorities have delivered up for duty .

		What it means to a scholar who lives in some town far removed from a custom-house , we can only conjecture , never having had his experience , but it prob - ably means that he will go without the desired book rather than suffer the many annoyances attendant upon getting it .

		And all for what ?

		To the government , for an amount of revenue that is absolutely insignifi - cant , to say nothing of the moral cost at which it is secured , for an amount of revenue that is perhaps two per cent of that which the govern - ment renounces by putting sugar on the free list .

		To the American printer , for a remotely possible and minutely fractional reduction in the total of his type-setting .

		To the American publisher , for a problematical slight increase in the sale of the very few books that may be sufficiently similar to those desired from
London	LOCATION	to be pur - chased instead .

		And with every such sale , a burning indignation in the breast of the cus - tomer because he is forced to do with the makeshift .

		For it can not be too emphatically pointed out that the taxation of English books does not , except in very rare instances , protect American publishers in the sense of enlarging the sales of their own publications .

		One book does not , as a general rule , compete with another , and the scholar who is thwarted in getting what he wants is not very likely to substitute for it something which he wants much less , if at all .

		And yet , every argument that is ever advanced in favor of the taxation of English books is advanced as ostensibly in the interest of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, the typographical union , or the Amer - ican publisher .

		Besides these , there is only the chauvinistic plea that all foreign ideas and pro- ducts -LRB- especially in thought and art -RRB- are under suspicion as corrupting to our robust Amer - icanism .

		But these arguments and pleas , mis - erable as they are , trivial , unworthy , and narrow-minded , have for many years burdened our intellectual life with what we have called the meanest of taxes , and seem likely to be allowed to continue so to burden it , unless the outcry against the tax shall acquire sufficient volume to force its way into the pachydermatous minds of our national law-makers , and awaken some glimmering consciousness of the unintelli - gence of their present determination in this vital matter of their attitude toward education , and scholarship , and spiritual enlightenment .

		OPEN MINDS : A TEXT FROM WILLIAM JAMES .


William James	PERSON	's vigorous onslaughts on the closed systems of rationalism , together with his insistence on `` pragmatic openness of mind , '' will very likely be remembered when the substance of his philosophy if one may disengage it from his attitude shall have been forgotten .

		Like
Emerson	PERSON	, he will doubt - less be finally esteemed as a knight-errant of the human spirit , intent not on gathering his intellectual wealth within an imposing and impregnable fortress , but rather on freeing the aspirations of men and en - abling them to enjoy '' a healthy-minded buoyancy '' in the wide , open universe .

		In all his writings , I think there is nothing more typical of his attitude than this phrase : `` and thereupon to come to a full stop intellectually . ''

		No land could be so fair that one might wisely linger in it ; no reading of earth could be profitable if one read only a few chapters .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL , ' , 365 Movement , to
James	LOCATION	, is the first essential of mental life and movement without a terminus .

		It must be added , though hardly in detraction , that in preaching eloquently the value of open - mindedness ,
James	PERSON	was not so much a prophet of the next age as a typical voice of his own our own time .

		The open mind is particularly abundant rather than particularly rare to-day .

		Dogma has perhaps never been so unpopular ; written creeds are inter - preted with comfortable laxity , unwritten creeds are very fluid ; few men can support a panacea for a lifetime ; in the arts , in criticism , one will seldom detect standards .

		`` The bellyband of its universe , '' says
James	PERSON	of rationalism , `` must be tight '' ; but although a few of our philosophers may affect a tight bellyband when they dress up the universe , the age is for the most part shockingly negligie .

		We do not require that a man , in his acts and utter - ances , be consistent with his past ; instead , we merely expect him to look toward the future .

		No one is re - spected so heartily as the man with the open mind .

		Now , it would be absurd to regard open-minded - ness as intrinsically more desirable than thick - headedness .

		Pragmatism , if nothing else , would quickly lead us to that conclusion .

		As every virtue has its defect if we let it sprawl , so to speak , open - mindedness may mean nothing better than intellec - tual confusion .

		`` Our past apperceives and coOper - ates , '' writes Professor
James	PERSON	; `` and in the new equilibrium in which each step forward in the pro- cess of learning terminates , it happens relatively seldom that the new fact is added raw .

		More usually it is embedded cooked , as one might say , or stewed down in the sauce of the old . ''

		But to point out the exact stage of the process when the new knowledge is thoroughly cooked is extremely difficult ; and one suspects that , after all , a great deal is added raw or only slightly cooked .

		To be open-minded often implies , in this strangely confused , mirthful , aspiring twentieth century , that we are fervid in the causes of out-door sleeping , psychical research , woman 's suffrage , eugenics , the latest species of socialism , moving pictures in the church , perhaps even free love .

		If you shy at any one of these , and dash down the road to the old and tried pastures , you are a `` reactionary , '' a term of abuse which I venture to think no more opprobrious than
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	's `` Frenchman . ''

Speaking of Mather	ORGANIZATION	one might , by the way , raise the interesting question whether he was or was not open-minded in believing in witchcraft , that curious progenitor of psychical research . -RRB-

		But if you decide to be a `` pro- gressive '' and espouse the causes of the day , what shall you do in the event of their failing ?

		To-day you are open-minded if you believe in out-door sleeping ; but if the physicians tell us to-morrow , as they may be expected to do , when we are all sleeping under the stars , that out-door sleeping is unquestion - ably the cause of appendicitis , why then you will be open-minded if you buy an old-fashioned four-poster and sleep in your bedroom .

		Readiness to receive anything and everything into one 's mental storehouse we might call demo - cratic open-mindedness .

		Under this form of intel - lectual government all ideas enjoy sufferance , or if you will suffrage .

		In religion , the democratic open mind will declare that
Christ	LOCATION	was assuredly divine and that there is no reason why we should refuse to believe in miracles , even though the charming assertions of the higher criticism and of evolution are equally true ; in politics , it will accept radical forms of direct popular government and remind you that the idea of representative government must be retained in its purity ; in music , it will applaud the person who remarks that
Beethoven	PERSON	has never been improved upon , and at the same time it will main - tain that
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	has ushered in a new and glorious era of musical history ; in literature , it will grant the preeminence of Fielding and
Thackeray	PERSON	, on hearsay , perhaps , and rise to effervescent enthu - siasm over the novels of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	and Mr.
Wells	PERSON	; in painting , it will adore Titian and
Velasquez	PERSON	and think that the eccentricities of Post-Impressionism are sublime ; in the enchanting world of sports , it will assert that football is superior to any other sport save baseball , cricket , hockey , and a dozen others , that walking is the noblest form of recrea - tion but that an automobile tour is the `` greatest thing ever . ''

		It will embrace all things with appa - rently the same degree of fervor ; and if you suspect it of mental indigestion , will look so robust that you would be quite tactless if you voiced your suspicion .

		The democratic open mind is so optimistic and genial that it is immensely popular it is supremely adapted to the mood of society , having no rough edges , no prejudices , no reticences .

		Indeed , so desirable is the democratic open mind , from the social point of view , that it is often imitated by those who are temperamentally unfit for it .

		In such cases the result is generally uncomfortable to the imitator and to society .

		The sense of incon - gruity is as obvious as in cases of `` kittenish '' de - portment on the part of elephantine persons , or stylish dress indulged in by those whom the styles do not fit .

		Your imitator of the democratic open mind is always aware of the inconsistencies that his attitude toward life is based on , and they make him very unhappy .

		He '' Knows what he knows as if he knew it not , What he remembers seems to have forgot .

		His sole opinion , whatsoe'er befall , Centring at last in having none at all . ''

		He is not born to the part , and consequently totally lacks the magnificent impudence of the genuine democratic open mind .

		A much commoner creature than either of the above is the snobbish open mind .

		The snobbish open mind welcomes only what is unhackneyed , prizes only what has an indefeasible claim on nov - elty .

		Now , novelty may imply newness of more than one kind .

		In a period when the leaders of thought look to the past for inspiration and au - thority , novelty will mean what is very old may apply to Pre-Raphaelitism as well as to Post - 366 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	Impressionism .

		To-day , however , when the old is anathema , novelty has in strictness only one mean - ing what is so modern that it would have startled the old fogies .

		The snobbish open mind is primarily interested in what is recent , and will prefer contem - porary third-rate or fifth-rate excellence to the first - rate excellence of the past .

		It is in perpetual alarm lest the name or the cause that it celebrates should meet general recognition and thus lose the essential trait of novelty .

		A few years ago one could easily make a blue-book or a black list of the snobbish open minds by recording the membership of the
Browning Clubs	ORGANIZATION	.

		To-day
Browning	PERSON	has receded into the past , he has won a fairly definite and secure position , and the
Browning Clubs	ORGANIZATION	, alas , are becoming more and more '' respectable . ''

		Your snobbish open mind ignores him as it ignores
Donne	PERSON	, and bestows its affection on the performance of
M. Bergson	PERSON	and his fascinating trained bear , the 6lan vital , or on the scintillant heterodoxy and orthodoxy of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	and Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	.

		It admires
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	, though less emotionally than a few years ago , and is inclined to scorn
Bach	PERSON	and
Beethoven	PERSON	and even the more recondite
Brahms	PERSON	.

		Could
Bach	PERSON	have composed a `` L'Isle Joyeuse '' ?

		it does not occur to the snob - bish open mind that
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	could never compose a '' Das wohltemperirte Klavier . ''

		The sober , old - fashioned people who shudder at discord and refuse to grant that Debussy has '' form , '' are promptly re - minded that the heresy of one period is the orthodoxy of the next ; and if the old-fashioned people humbly suggest that not all heresy is finally orthodoxy , that some of it is merely forgotten , they are asked what they know about it , since the future alone can tell what will happen in the future .

		From a social point of view , the snobbish open mind is of course less desirable than the democratic .

		Since there are many people who unite the qualities of excellence and conservatism , the snob finds him - self engaged in incessant petty frays and now and again a pitched battle .

		Whereas the democratic open mind instinctively adopts the opinions that it encounters , the snobbish open mind is given to a fondness of '' contradiction for its own sweet sake , '' and is a little hurt if you agree with it .

		It has no love for flabby democracy ; if the topic of eugenics is broached , and if you emit a spark of enthusiasm , the snob has no opportunity to display his superiority .

		If , however , you hint at your disapproval , up goes the defiant chin , the eyes rain fire as from batteries , and verbal arguments pour into you like grape and canister .

		No quarter is given , the ammunition is inexhaustible , even the call to dinner may afford no refuge ; and if you do escape , how bourgeois you feel !

		One can hardly say that the snobbish open mind is desirable socially .

		It is vehemently pre - judiced , and may be termed open only in the sense that it welcomes every fad .

		These several types of open mind well nigh ex - haust the possibilities .

		Clearly , they are , as we have intimated , not preferable to the thick heads that oppose them and that help to make this world so delightfully diverse .

		But there is another type of the open mind , a type entirely admirable , more useful , indeed , than any kind of thick-headedness .

		It is not democratic does not espouse everything ; it is not snobbish does not choose the unusual on the assumption that the unusual is superior ; it is , rather , aristocratic , in a good sense , holding to that which is best .

		It is this type , I suppose , that
William James	PERSON	implied by his phrase `` pragmatic openness of mind , '' though for my part I suspect that pragmatism tends to be somewhat democratic .

		The following passage from
James	PERSON	's address at the
Emerson	LOCATION	centenary in
Concord	LOCATION	illustrates pretty clearly what I mean by the aristocratic open mind : '' Such a conviction that Divinity is everywhere may make of one an optimist of the sentimental type that refuses to speak ill of anything -LSB- this is our democratic type -RSB- .

		Emerson 's drastic perception of differences kept him at the opposite pole from this weakness ... Never was such a fastidious lover of significance and distinction , and never an eye so keen for their discovery .

		His optimism had nothing in common with that indiscriminate hurrahing for the
Universe	ORGANIZATION	with which
Walt Whitman	PERSON	has made us familiar . ''

		Whitman is an excellent example of the demo - cratic open mind , having as few prejudices as any human being is likely ever to have ; and
Emerson	PERSON	is an excellent example of the aristocratic open mind , not because he had many prejudices an open mind , by definition , can not have but because he had that love of significance and distinction that James de - scribed so well .

		Wherever
Emerson	PERSON	went , he went as a learner , believing that each man sees Truth from a different angle and might give him what he could not get unaided .

		He was ready to test the virtue of the most unpromising Transcendental whims , even when they sent him to his study break - fastless .

		Believing that work in the garden might be ennobling , he plied the spade at the risk , as his little son once remarked , of digging his leg .

		But having been open-minded enough to experiment , he was also open-minded enough to recognize that the experiments failed henceforth , like a wise man , he enjoyed his breakfast and did little work in the garden .

		Without accepting recklessly , he tried everything , believing that `` man was made for con - flict , not for rest ... The truest state of mind rested in becomes false . ''

		His greatness consists largely in his discriminating type of open mind , just as
Cardinal Newman	ORGANIZATION	's conspicuous limit consists in the fact that his mind , though it contained untold wealth , was deliberately kept shut .

		The sifting instinct that is essential in the aristocratic open mind is dependent on standards .

		Emerson 's standards were those of individualism , the unfolding of the self according to natural ten - dency .

		In
Arnold	LOCATION	, who had in some respects a more open mind than
Emerson	PERSON	, the standards were those of culture , of humanism the symmetrical development of man to his highest capacity , which involved a regard for institutional life that was absent in
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		Standards of some kind are
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 367 the primary requirement of aristocratic open - mindedness .

		To-day , unhappily , standards are excessively rare .

		Those who possess them are gen - erally thick-headed , and at best remind us of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's highly engaging prejudices .

		Abundant as the democratic and the snobbish open minds are , we have few aristocratic open minds .

		And we ur - gently need more of them .

		NORMAN FOEBSTER .

		CAS
UAL	ORGANIZATION	COMMENT .

		FOND MEMORIES OF BOOK-LAND , as it revealed itself to the eager eyes of unspoilt childhood , are cherished by all adults who have not been the victims of literary starvation in those hungry years from infancy to adolescence .

		A responsive chord will be struck in many a breast by Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	's account of the effect produced on his young imagi - nation by '' Uncle
Tom	PERSON	's Cabin . ''

		In '' A Small Boy and Others , '' reviewed elsewhere in this issue , he says : '' We lived and moved at that time , with great intensity , in Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's novel which , recalling my prompt and charmed acquaintance with it , I should perhaps substitute for The Initials , earlier mentioned here , as my first experiment in grown-up fiction .

		There was , however , I think , for that tri - umphant work no classified condition ; it was for no sort of reader as distinct from any other sort , save indeed for Northern as differing from Southern : it knew the large felicity of gathering in alike the small and the simple and the big and the wise , and had above all the extraordinary fortune of finding itself , for an immense number of people , much less a book than a state of vision , of feeling and of consciousness , in which they did n't sit and read and appraise and pass the time , but walked and talked and laughed and cried , and , in a manner of which Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	was the irresistible cause , generally conducted them - selves . ''

		How much of boyhood 's actual impressions , and how much of Mr.
James	PERSON	's later conception of what those impressions must have been , or ought to have been , is to be found in his interesting and always characteristic references to books read and things seen and persons met in those formative years , who can say ?

		THE LATE
EDWARD DOWDEN	PERSON	'S LITERARY ACHIEVEMENTS , in the way of number and quality of his published works , make an impressive showing when summed up in obituary notice of the lamented scholar and critic whose recent death leaves a sad gap in the ranks of the older English writers of solid attainments and recognized authority .

		His long term of service as Professor of English Literature at
Dublin University	ORGANIZATION	, where he was educated and where he received his appointment in
1867	DATE	, at the age of twenty-four , was diversified with the produc - tion of many critical studies for a larger public than that with which he came in contact as teacher and lecturer .

		His various writings on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	are among the best fruits of his scholarship and industry , as is also his elaborate biography of
Shelley	LOCATION	, even after all deductions have been made which the reader of
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	's famous onslaught on the book may feel inclined to make .


Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Southey	PERSON	were also among
Dowden	PERSON	's favorites , and so were
Browning	PERSON	and Montaigne ; and of them all he wrote with critical appreciation and in a manner acceptable to readers .

		His various collections of shorter essays , such as '' Transcripts and Studies , '' `` Studies in Literature , '' and '' New Studies in Literature , '' have brought him deserved fame as a sound literary critic and an engaging writer .

		Characteristic of
Dowden	PERSON	the bookman was the fact , recorded in '' Who 's Who , '' that his chief recreation was book-collecting .

		Born in
1843	DATE	-LRB- May 3 -RRB- , he had nearly completed his seventieth year when death overtook him .

		THE PUBLIC LIBRARY ON THE PRAIRIE is not yet , and for some time will not be , the most conspicuous feature of the landscape .

		In the
State of Iowa	LOCATION	, for example , where the
Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	is only about as old as the century , it is announced by the Secretary of that body , in her current biennial Report , that the number of free public libraries on the municipal tax basis has now reached one hun - dred and twelve , with one additional library main - tained by private endowment ; also , within the past year , two additional county-seat towns have voted in favor of the establishment and maintenance of public libraries , thus reducing the number of shire towns without libraries to fourteen .

		A striking contrast this , of course , to the condition of things in the thickly-settled
Eastern States	LOCATION	, where the town or village without some sort of library privileges is fast becoming the exception .

		But
Iowa	LOCATION	has made a good beginning and will achieve great results in time , though when it is remembered that there are in the
State	ORGANIZATION	not far from two hundred towns with a popu - lation of one thousand or more , of which little above one-half are yet provided with libraries to say nothing of the smaller settlements the task for the future will be acknowledged to be a big one .

		Travelling libraries , however , and local library asso - ciations are sowing the seed of future permanent libraries .

		An interesting fact to be noted in this connection is the liberality shown by Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	in helping on the movement ; either alone or , in a few instances , with other benefactors he has provided with buildings seventy-four of the one hundred and twelve public libraries in
Iowa	LOCATION	.

		HOW TO PRESERVE ONE 'S SELF-RESPECT , THOUGH A WRITER , is a problem of vital interest to compara - tively few , but to those few it is indeed something more than an academic question .

		A contemporary author of distinction has been heard to declare that he should be ashamed to have written a book that had sold to the extent of one hundred thousand copies .

		There is somewhere in
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	's poems a delightful character , a scholar , who `` might have writ a book but that his pride in the not writing was 368 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	more gratified '' the quotation may not be exact .


Charles Lamb	PERSON	, racking his brain for a daily half - dozen jokes for the newspaper press , and receiving a paltry sixpence apiece for his witticisms , and at about the same time writing for the '' Morning Post , '' '' where more than two-thirds of his materials are superciliously rejected , '' as Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	tells us , pre - sents a rather pathetic spectacle .

		In the '' Open Letters '' of the
April	DATE	'' Century '' many readers will have noted Mr.
Simeon Strunsky	PERSON	's shrewd com - ments on certain features of present-day journalism .

		In the form of a letter `` to a future graduate of the School of Journalism , '' he amusingly contrasts the methods of the writer for pay and the writer for something less expressible in terms of dollars and cents .

		To a supposed reporter of the latter class he says , in closing : `` You will have to work for a respectable newspaper and be a thirty-dollar man for some years to come .

		But , after all , is n't it true of every calling that you must pay back your em - ployer for the self-respect he permits you to retain ?

		... In general , you will be granted the luxury of so doing your work as to inflict a minimum of pain on the weak and the innocent ... And I imagine you will find the thirty-dollar job quite as profitable as the other kind , in the long run . ''

		Yes , there are destinies more unenviable than that of him who adopts the motto of the early
Edinburgh Reviewers	ORGANIZATION	and cultivates the Muse on a little oatmeal .

		THE DIGNITY OF THE LIBRARIAN 'S OFFICE Will be belittled by no librarian worthy of his high calling .

		Others may here and there be found who hold in too little esteem both that official himself and the position he occupies .

		Even our honored
Emerson	LOCATION	, no scoffer in general , allows himself something like a sneer at the profession in his assertion that the custody of books carries with it no guaranty of superior learning in the custodian .

		Evidently he had not read and pondered the words of that excel - lent bibliothecary ,
Jared Bean	PERSON	, who in his justly famous `` Old Librarian 's Almanack '' thus expresses himself : '' I am sensible that there will be some who will enquire as to what qualities should be possess 'd by him who stands thus as Guardian of the Books .

		These may think -LRB- if perchance the hasty and frivol - ous workings of their ill-taught minds may be so dignified as to call it thinking -RRB- that it matters little what the character of the Librarian be .

		Such as these can not too soon become aware of their error .

		For how can it be possible that a man can act as Warder of the accumulated record of the world 's wisdom , piety , learning , & experience , and hold the same in necessary reverence , if he be not a person of sober and Godly life , learn 'd , virtuous , chaste , moral , frugal , and temperate ? ''

		A worthy follower in the footsteps of Jared Bean is the head of the
Leavenworth Free Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, who , entering upon his present duties within the past year , so conceives of the true significance of his office that in the very opening sentence of his current Report , after proper salutation to the
Board of Directors	ORGANIZATION	, he declares : '' Without doubt the occurrence of greatest importance to the
Library	ORGANIZATION	in the course of the year has been the change of librarians . ''

		And the pages that succeed this remark carry conviction to the reader that under its new administration the Leaven - worth Library is growing in usefulness .

		Its cir - culation advances , its book-collection increases , its activities widen .

		THE INSISTENT DEMAND FOR ART IN THE THEATRE for the play with an idea behind it and originality in its accessories * continues to upset the complacency of the commercial managers and to put the thinking public , which is proving itself to be hopefully numerous in some quarters , in the mood for theatrical experiments by managers in the mood to try them .

		One of the most recent of these is the opening of the Princess Theatre in
New York	LOCATION	, where a clever and versatile repertory company , under the direction of Mr.
Holbrook Blinn	PERSON	, will devote its tal - ents to the production of short plays , such as have made the fame of the `` little theatres '' of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The capacity of the Princess is about the same as that of Mr.
Ames	PERSON	's Little Theatre ; and its decora - tive scheme , if not so original as Mr.
Ames	PERSON	's , is still unusual and very beautiful .

		The theatre 's policy of producing short plays of merit , hitherto relegated to the menial position of `` curtain-raisers '' -LRB- when they were fortunate enough to be produced at all -RRB- , is one to arouse enthusiasm in the hearts of drama-lovers imbued with the modern spirit .

		The opening bill , consisting of two comic skits , and one grimly , one gaily tragic piece , is novel and engrossing enough in material , and played with sufficient cleverness and versatility , to presage some measure of success , at least , for the experiment of the Princess Players .

		The Parisian flavor of the entertainment is unneces - sarily accentuated at present , but it is not essential to the idea ; and as the one-act playwrights discover the Princess and the Princess discovers them ,
New York	LOCATION	's first '' theatre a cote '' '' will , we hope , develop a flavor of its own , as clever and as modern as its Parisian counterparts , but saner and more thor - oughly artistic .

		m m .

		IMPROVIDENT POETS not only escape the serious censure of posterity for their unthrifty habits , but even have a way of winning added favor by reason of this very lack of worldly foresight .

		Poe 's ina - bility to extricate himself from his pecuniary straits endears him the more to his readers and admirers ;
Whittier	LOCATION	's
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	thrift gains our approval and esteem , but excites no warmer feeling .

		Shelley 's impulsive giving of his precarious income to
Godwin	PERSON	and others , followed by a compulsory avoidance of impatient creditors , seems quite in keeping with the poet temperament ;
Browning	PERSON	's sleek and pros - perous appearance moves the observer to question whether that can indeed be the author of `` The Ring and the Book . ''

		The late
Francis Thompson	PERSON	, who seems to be more and more coming into his own now that he is no longer among us to serve as fortune 's plaything , is said to have been so poor a
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 369 manager of his own business affairs that he was as likely as not to throw into the fire the checks received by him in payment for his poems .

		Another poet -LRB- probably less esteemed now as a poet than as an eccentric humorist and a delightful letter - writer -RRB- who could show now and then a splendid indiffer - ence to his own pecuniary interests , was
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	.

		On one occasion , after receiving a periodical payment of interest on a mortgage note from a debtor of long standing , he calmly tore up the bond of indebtedness in the man 's presence and told him the payments had gone on about long enough and the account might now be considered as squared .

		The
Woodbridge	PERSON	recluse 's habit of using
Bank of England	ORGANIZATION	notes as book-markers is a further illustration of his little regard for the sacredness of property -LRB- when it chanced to be his A REMINDER OF BALZAC , and of the terrors that his manuscript is said to have had for the composi - tor , is about to pass away in the demolition of his house in the
Rue Visconti	LOCATION	, or the
Rue Marais	PERSON	, as it was called in his time .

		The lengthening of the
Rue de Rennes	ORGANIZATION	, or other change in the topography of the left bank of the
Seine	LOCATION	, appears to be causing this removal of ancient
Paris	LOCATION	landmarks .

		The storied Passage du
Pont Neuf	PERSON	, familiar to readers of Zola 's '' The ` rese
Raquin	PERSON	, '' is already doomed , and now the old house in which Balzac established his printing office must go .

		And this recalls the ruinously ex - pensive method of literary composition adopted by the always debt-oppressed author of the `` Comedy of Human Life . ''

		His novels were practically writ - ten on a series of printed revises , '' Ce * sar Birotteau '' being , it is said , recomposed fifteen times in the twenty days during which it grew and repeatedly reshaped itself under his hand .

		A compositor ,
Champfleury	PERSON	has told us , `` did his hour of Balzac as a convict did his time in prison . ''

		A veritable fiend at cancellation and interlineation the novelist must have been considered by the luckless manipula - tor of the types .

		Probably Balzac never read -LRB- or if he read it he failed to heed it -RRB-
Chesterfield	LOCATION	's counsel to his son not to allow himself on any pretext the weakness and folly of crossing out a word and writ - ing another over it a sure sign of indecision and temperamental flabbiness , though those are not the
Earl	ORGANIZATION	's exact words .

		Balzac 's method was that which the careful Pater afterward made his own , without carrying it to such extremes .

		MR.
MORGAN	PERSON	'S LIBRARY , of which he never en - couraged the publication of any detailed description , has for those who are fond of rare books and costly manuscripts an interest and a charm intensified by something of myth and mystery .

		We know that that beautiful marble building adjoining his
New York	LOCATION	residence holds the most splendid private col - lection of incunabula and illuminated manuscripts and other literary treasures that can anywhere be found ; and it is also averred that , like Lorenzo the Magnificent , the late owner of this princely library not only possessed the taste and the means to acquire the best that was to be had in literature and art , but also was thoroughly familiar with his acquisitions and appreciated their value .

		A few of the choicest of these treasures may here be named : the '' Golden Gospels '' of
Henry the Eighth	ORGANIZATION	, the ``
Naples	LOCATION	Offices of
Giulio Clovio	PERSON	, '' and many other illuminated manu - scripts of priceless worth , Caxtons in considerable number , perfect Aldines and `` tall '' Elzevirs ,
Byron	PERSON	manuscripts ,
Blake	PERSON	's original drawings for the '' Book of Job , '' the originals of
Horace Walpole	PERSON	's letters , the manuscript of
Keats	PERSON	's `` Endymion , ''
Shelley	PERSON	's notebook , letters of
St. Francis de Sales	ORGANIZATION	and of other saints , the originals of many of
Burns	ORGANIZATION	's poems , manuscripts of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, Swift ,
Scott	PERSON	, including nine of the
Waverley Novels	ORGANIZATION	, and a great number of other masterpieces in the original manuscript ; also rare and costly bindings such as nowhere else are to be found .

		... A DRAMATIC MEETING OF EXTREMES IS to be found in the twentieth-century cinematographic presentation of the `` Odyssey , '' written or sung eight hundred years before Christ .

		Though the scenes and incidents thrown on the screen may not all be free from anachronisms and other errors , the general effect ought to awaken interest in the great epic and to win fqr it not a few new readers .

		The time and money required for the preparation of this elaborate production have been more worthily spent than is commonly the case in motion-picture dis - plays .

		Whatever the crudities of the presentation , it at least helps to familiarize the public with the name of Homer .

		A similar graphic introduction to the `` Iliad '' might be made both instructive and entertaining .

		Such incidents as the fetching of Briseis from the tent of Achilles , Ulysses rebuk - ing and smiting the impudent Thersites , Patroclus donning the armor of Achilles and driving the Trojans before him , his fatal encounter with
Hector	PERSON	, the combat between Hector and Achilles , and
Priam	PERSON	begging the body of his son for burial , would serve to outline the famous story of the wrath of the Greek chieftain and its momentous consequences .

		The people , especially the young people , insist on having their motion-pictures ; let them , then , have such as may incite them to the reading of good literature .

		... THE FULL NAMES OF WELL-KNOWN AUTHORS are often as little familiar to their readers as is the fur - ther side of the moon to astronomers .

		Not one in twenty of those who have read Oscar Wilde could give his baptismal names unabridged , Oscar Fin - gall
O'Flaherty Wills	ORGANIZATION	.

		Likewise few know that
Charles Lever	PERSON	's full name is
Charles James Lever	PERSON	, that
Victor Hugo	PERSON	is short for
Victor Marie Hugo	PERSON	-LRB- perhaps he had other names also -RRB- , that
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	was named
Thomas Woodrow	PERSON	, that
Charles Dickens	PERSON	received at the baptismal font the fuller designation of
Charles John Huffam	PERSON	, and so on .

		A few weeks ago there appeared in the
New York	LOCATION	'' Sun '' a communication from Mr.
William Henry Bishop	PERSON	in which he says that when he was consul 370 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	at
Genoa	LOCATION	he one day chanced to find in the official archives a letter written by the author of ''
Brace	PERSON	- bridge Hall '' and signed ``
George Washington Irving	PERSON	, '' but that , though he regarded the signature as good evidence of Irving 's having been christened in the fuller form thus indicated , he had been unable to confirm this assumption by other testimony .

		The biographers and the compilers of biographical dic - tionaries do indeed seem to be uninformed of this apparent suppression of his first name by Irving in his ordinary correspondence .

		But our researches in the matter have not been exhaustive .

		AN EVENT OF SIGNIFICANCE IN THE PUBLISHING WORLD was the recent quarter - centennial celebration , at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, of the
Jewish Publication Society of America	ORGANIZATION	, an organization that has its headquarters in the
Quaker City	LOCATION	and that has done much to prove to the world the high quality of Hebrew scholarship .

		It takes pardonable pride in its early recognition ` of Mr.
Israel Zangwill	PERSON	's merit as a writer , and in the fact that some of that author 's first works bear the
Society	ORGANIZATION	's imprint .

		Good English translations from ancient and modern Hebrew literature are among its noteworthy publications .

		That the Jew has a way of demonstrating his ability and zeal in what - ever he undertakes is generally recognized .

		In our public schools , the intellectual battle-ground of the youth of many nationalities , no class of pupils can be found of greater average quickness to learn and desire to learn than the children of the Ghetto ; and in our public libraries they are much in evidence as the most earnest and industrious and intelligent of readers .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		MR.
EZRA POUND	PERSON	AND `` POETRY . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Our national aphorism , `` Some things can be done as well as others , '' may be , as Mr.
John A. Hobson	PERSON	has pointed out , a great asset in material affairs , but when it is acted upon in matters of art its value grows doubtful .

		We have dramatic enthusiasts ignorant of the art of acting , amateur stage managers unable to manage , compilers of verse without judgment , editors who have never before edited , all seeking to uplift masses eager to learn , yet all placing stumbling-blocks , through their own lack of standards , in the way of those earnestly aspiring to the heights .

		Though no one can quarrel with literature in its highest form , nor with any periodical devoted to such a cause , one must regret that '' Poetry '' is being turned into a thing for laughter .

		No one need offer any par - ticular criticism of the earlier work of Mr.
Ezra Pound	PERSON	; it is as he prefers it .

		But with the practical identifica - tion of '' Poetry '' and Mr.
Pound	PERSON	one may pick a very pretty quarrel , since it involves not only a lowering of standards , but a defense of the thesis , unusual in '' A Magazine of Verse , '' that poor prose must be good poetry .

		Take this from the
April	DATE	number : '' O my fellow sufferers , songs of my youth , a lot of asses praise you because we are ` virile , ' we , you , I !

		We are 1 Red Bloods ' !

		Imagine it , my fellow sufferers our male - ness lifts us out of the ruck .

		Who 'd have foreseen it ?

		O my fellow sufferers , we went out under the trees , we were in especial bored with male stupidity .

		We went forth gathering delicate thoughts , our ' fantasikon ' 1 delighted to serve us .

		We were not exasperated with women , for the female is ductile .

		And now you hear what is said to us : We are com - pared to that sort of person who wanders about announcing his sex as if he had just discovered it .

		Let us leave this matter , my songs , and return to that which concerns us . ''

		Is this anything but prose ?

		and dull prose ?

		Is it interesting , except to psychopathologists and students of barbaric survivals in .

		the twentieth century ?

		Does it reveal a personality , or hint at work one would like to know better ? ''

		But , '' some of Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's admirers have answered , '' it has subtle rhythm . ''

		To which the obvious reply is that English poetry has no subtle rhythm , nor can it have until its ictus , the strongest and most insistent in the history of speech , becomes subtle .

		The technical problem of English verse is largely the variance of rhythm , but the variances , again , are seldom subtle .

		The subtler rhythms in English literature are in its prose ; and , it may be added , if subtlety implies difficulty of immediate discernment , the worse the prose the more subtle its rhythm .

		Take an instance from another source : '' When Narcissus died , The pool of his pleasure changed From a cup of sweet waters Into a cup of salt tears , And the Oreads came weeping Through the woodland That they might sing to the pool And give it comfort .

		`` And when they saw that the pool had changed From a cup of sweet waters Into a cup of salt tears , They loosened the green tresses of their hair , And cried to the pool , And said : '' ' We do not wonder that you should mourn In this manner for
Narcissus	ORGANIZATION	, So beautiful was he . ' ''

		* But was
Narcissus	ORGANIZATION	beautiful ? '

		Said the pool . '' '

		Who should know better than you ? '

		Answered the Oreads . '

		Us did he ever pass by , But you he sought for , And would lie down on your banks And look down at you , And in the mirror of your waters He would mirror his own beauty . '

		`` And the pool answered : ' But I loved Narcissus Because as he lay on my banks And looked down at me , In the mirror of his eyes I saw my own beauty Mirrored . ' ''

		This is not an unusually beautiful example of vers libre .

		On the contrary , it is Oscar Wilde 's '' The Dis - ciple , '' which its author called a '' poem in prose . ''

		And it is prose poetic prose assuredly , but prose .

		Wilde did not write it as it is written here , in what might be called Jerked English , any more than Mr.
Pound	PERSON	wrote the previous specimen with the lines run together .

		Wilde knew his to be prose and wrote it accordingly ; Mr.
Pound	PERSON	believed his to be poetry and so wrote it .

		Certainly '' The Disciple '' is the more poetic of the two .

		But whether a given literary composition is poetry or not , does not depend upon the manner in which the
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 371 type is arranged on the printed page .

		If this were so , the printer would be the poet , not the writer .

		When Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's various examples of what he considers poetry are printed as prose , they are prose .

		In con - trast with
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's in any form , they are prosy prose .

		Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's admirers insist , however , upon the essen - tial originality of his recent writings , and say that in destroying the conventions of rhyme and rhythm he is expanding the province of poetry .

		It is possible that , following the manner of Whitman , he is aiding in the fixation of a third form of literary expression , prose in form , poetic in content .

		But surely , after
Macpherson	PERSON	and Whitman , that is no claim to originality .

		One of Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's defenders has said in words what '' Poetry '' has been teaching by implication , that '' formal rhythm is not necessary to poetry . ''

		Such a statement involves complete confusion between two sig - nifications of the word poetry .

		We speak with pro- priety of a sermon , an essay , an oration , a novel , a prose drama , indeed of any work of art , as '' poetic , '' meaning thereby that it arouses in us emotions similar to those excited by poetry .

		But poetry , like every other Art or art , is concerned with form as well as substance .

		It is the metrical ar - rangement of words to express beauty ,
Poe	PERSON	's '' Music plus Idea , '' and formal rhythm is as essential to it as to its sisters by birth , Music and the Dance .

		To deny that is to deny poetry , alone among the Arts and arts , the possession of a technic , reducing it forthwith below the level of literary prose , which unquestionably has technic ; it will be recalled that
Walter Pater	PERSON	refused through life to write poetry because it confused this .

		And it is to deny the technic of ascertained metre unchallenged through thirty centuries .

		In this sense alone Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's work is original .

		The attitude of '' Poetry '' toward poetry is that of Mrs.
Mary Baker G. Eddy	PERSON	toward
Medical Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yet , if poetry have no technic and , left formless there - by , is at one with illiterary prose , why devote a maga - zine to it ?

		Every newspaper , programme , advertise - ment contains similar English and English quite without false pretence .

		As has been pointed out , technic qua technic possesses charm for the cultivated mind .

		It is hardly too much to say that nothing atechnical has survived in any Art .

		Reduced to its simplest terms technic is knowing how the experience of the ages manifesting itself in practice .

		Moreover , within the canons of the art there is perfect freedom ; without , the baldest enslavement to every passing fad and fancy as here .

		Remember that youth essaying his first poetic flights draws strength for his wings largely from the greater poets who precede him and leave him heir to their powers .

		Every beginner imitates , and one familiar with his predecessors has little trouble in naming the sources from which he chooses his forms of expression , if not his thoughts .

		It is not until he has outgrown this period of unconscious assimilation and attained his own manner that he is worthy the name of poet .

		For , as Mr.
Pound	PERSON	has observed , '' Any donkey can imitate a man 's manner . ''

		In the
April	DATE	number of '' Poetry '' there are a dozen examples of Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's work .

		Much the larger part of them are prose , like the one cited .

		The origins of all are evident .

		Whitman at his prosiest accounts for much , and in one Mr.
Pound	PERSON	insists that he and the older bard have one sap and one root .

		There are touches here and there of MM .


Maeterlinck	PERSON	and
Albert Mockel	PERSON	, and something of Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	.

		Nor should
Stephen Crane	PERSON	be forgotten .

		The last instance is Japanese in content , though without the beautiful definition of the Japanese form .

		In other words , Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's lines are derivations , experiments in the man - ner of a novice , searchings after individual expression without attainment .

		His roots are far back in the traditional past , inevitably .

		If one searches for originality of thought , it is not here .

		Whitman had something to say and said it ; Mr.
Pound	PERSON	is still occupied with youthful Bohemianism and impudence .

		His intense egoism , too intense to carry self-confidence with it , is apparent .

		The power of self - criticism implied in a sense of humor is lacking .

		A care for syntax has gone the way of other traditions .

		One of his efforts has the ring of Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	before a vice commission .

		Feeling for words and for form is slight .

		Imagination is in abeyance .

		The Song of Solomon fathers the most poetic of his work in style and substance .

		Thought is everywhere tenuous and capable of compression in statement , and the philosophy is uncertain .

		Some of the lines seem written for inde - cency 's sake , which is more than those contending for '' art for art 's sake '' ask for .

		Most objectionable is the familiar attitude of the charlatan , announcing that his is the only cure , and that those disagreeing with him are the real quacks .

		But Mr.
Pound	PERSON	may be left to the court of appeal the years will hale him before , if he survive .

		Many young men write verses , or wish to , and are impatient at the restraints which lack of technic imposes .

		If one of them lives to attain full poethood , the verses of his artistic adolescence meet with one of three fates : they are suppressed , they are completely rewritten , or they appear in his published works as juvenilia , itself an apology for their survival .

		The case is different with the magazine which has chosen to employ and exploit this young man .

		It has been able to do this consistently only by a supercilious dismissal of the great tradition of English poetry , using '' traditional '' as a term of contempt .

		And there is so much for it to do by a maintenance of the standards .

		We have seen the tradition expanded by men dead only yesterday ,
Swinburne	PERSON	and
William Vaughn Moody	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	has enlarged its boundaries by a little .

		The modern social feeling , the growing solidarity of women , the wonders of science are clamoring for poetic expres - sion .

		Though there be no great poets among us ,
John Churton Collins	PERSON	has pointed out that from their lesser brethren '' it is in some respects but a step to the work of the great poets of the next age . ''

		The editors of the usual magazines have their own standards , and many of the singers of the day know their best work to be at variance with these standards .

		It was hoped that '' Poetry '' would search out these poets and such poems , many of them of much significance and beauty .

		So far there has been little done in these directions .

		The quest has seemingly been for the bizarre , for the astonishing , for the novelty for novelty 's sake , even for the shocking .

		The paper of the magazine .

		has been poor , the type that of the newspapers , the cover and form inadequate to the dignity of the cause , the proof - reading heedless .

		The editor too seldom allows a num - ber to go out without containing her own verses , though these show a steady retrogression from a once high standard .

		Her own sense of self-criticism in abeyance , Mr.
Pound	PERSON	was bound to occur .

		372 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	Cbt MR. JAMES 'S MEMORIES or BOYHOOD .

		* As a work of art , which from its very authorship it could not fail to be , Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	's latest book , '' A Small Boy and Others , '' might be said to belong to the Im - pressionist school , with perhaps here and there , in the extraordinary elaboration of certain minor details , suggestions of Pre-Raphaelitism .

		Whether any touches of later schools , of Post - Impressionism , Cubism , Futurism , are to be discerned in its pages this question it might be unwise to answer too emphatically either in the affirmative or in the negative .

		At any rate , the work is a piece of exquisite artistry , with all the characteristics of its author 's style raised to their highest power .

		Impressions of childhood , veiled more or less darkly by the intervening years , form the substance -LRB- though that is too strong a term to apply to things so nebulous in their general outlines -RRB- of Mr.
James	PERSON	's twenty - nine autobio - graphic chapters .

		Starting avowedly with the purpose '' to place together some particulars of the early life of
William James	PERSON	and present him in his setting , his immediate native and domestic air , so that any future gathered me - morials of him might become the more intelli - gible and interesting , '' the writer soon found his own boyish figure so unavoidably present in the forefront of all those childhood scenes of half a century and more ago , that he gave over the attempt to restrict his reminiscent narrative to its first-chosen subject , considering it a sort of '' cold impiety '' to suppress even his own part in the juvenile drama now rendered sacred by the death of its senior performer .

		But any - thing like close companionship with that older brother seems to have been rendered impossible by the immense gap of sixteen months ' differ - ence in age ; so that the younger '' never for all the time of childhood and youth in the least caught up with him or overtook him . '' ''

		He was always round the corner and out of sight , coming back into view but at his hours of extremest ease .

		We were never in the same schoolroom , in the same game , scarce even in step together or in the same phase at tone same time ; when our phases overlapped , that is , it was only for a moment he was clean out before I had got well in .

		How far he had really at any moment dashed forward it is not for me now to attempt to say ; what comes to me is that I at least hung invet - erately and woefully back , and that this relation alike * A SMALL BOY AND OTHERS .

		By
Henry James	PERSON	.

Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		to our interests and to each other seemed proper and preappointed . ''

		Pathetic and comical is the picture later pre - sented of the smaller boy offering his company when it was not desired , and of the larger `` putting the question of our difference at rest , with the minimum of explanation , by the re - sponsible remark : ' / play with boys who curse and swear ! ''

		The rebuffed one had sadly to recognize that he did n't , that he could n't pre - tend to have come to that yet .

		Not unnaturally , he wonders now , hardly less than he wondered then , in just what company his brother 's privi - lege of profanity was exercised ; and he con - tinues , in delightfully self-revealing vein : '' It was n't that I might n't have been drawn to the boys in question , but that I simply was n't qualified .

		All boys , I rather found , were difficult to play with unless it was that they rather found me ; but who would have been so difficult as these ?

		They account but little , moreover , I make out , for W. J. 's eclipses ; so that I take refuge easily enough in the memory of my own pursuits , absorbing enough at times to have excluded other views . ''

		It is , then , with his own pursuits , his own mem - ories and impressions , that Mr.
James	PERSON	chiefly concerns himself in his chapters ; and with a few more glimpses of his boyhood world , as seen through his eyes , this review will have executed its pleasant task of introducing the book to the reader .

		Early in the volume the origin of its author 's partiality for
England	LOCATION	and things English is ingeniously and at some length traced .

		The parents had visited
London	LOCATION	with their two infant children , and there inoculated them with the virus , or dosed them with the `` poison , '' as the writer himself calls it , which rendered the younger boy , at least , thenceforward unrespon - sive to the call of patriotism .

		Moreover , a ma - ternal aunt , member at one time of the
James	PERSON	family circle , `` had imbibed betimes in
Europe	LOCATION	the seeds of a long nostalgia , '' and her memories , `` through some bright household habit , over - flowed at the breakfast table '' this breakfast table , by the way , having its place alternately in
New York	LOCATION	,
Albany	LOCATION	,
Fort Hamilton	LOCATION	, and
New Brighton	LOCATION	.

		It was home talk of this sort that created and strengthened the belief that `` En - glish life '' was the superlatively desirable life ; and furthermore , '' My father had subscribed for me to a small peri - odical of quarto form , covered in yellow and entitled The Charm , which shed on the question the softest lustre , but of which the appearances were sadly intermittent , or then struck me as being ; inasmuch as many of our visits to the Bookstore were to ask for the new number only to learn with painful frequency that the last con .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 373 signment from
London	LOCATION	had arrived without it .

		I feel again the pang of that disappointment as if through the want of what I needed most for going on ; the En - glish smell was exhaled by The Charm in a peculiar degree , and I see myself affected by the failure as by that of a vital tonic .

		It was not , at the same time , by a Charm the more or the less that my salvation was to to be , as it were , worked out , or my imagination at any rate duly convinced ; conviction was the result of the very air of home , so far as I most consciously imbibed it .

		This represented , no doubt , a failure to read into matters close at hand all the interest they were capable of yielding ; but I had taken the twist , had sipped the poison , as I say , and was to feel it to that end the most salutary cup . ''

		A migratory hotel life at home , varied with occasional sojourns abroad , brought the observ - ant and reflective lad into some sort of personal though quite distant and bashful contact with an occasional person of note , the recollection of whom heightens the charm of his narrative .

		From these recollections let us quote first a passage relating to certain vaguely - remembered school days at the `` Institution Vergnes , '' in lower Broadway . ''

		To a ' French school ' must have been earnestly imputed the virtue of keeping us in patience till easier days should come ; infinitely touching our parents ' view of that
New York	LOCATION	fetish of our young time , an ' acqui - sition of the languages ' an acquisition reinforcing those opportunities which we enjoyed at home , so far as they mustered , and at which I have briefly glanced .

		Charming and amusing to me indeed certain faint echoes , wavering images , of this superstition as it played about our path : ladies and gentlemen , dimly foreign , mere broken syllables of whose names come back to me , attending there to converse in tongues and then giving way to others through failures of persistence whether in pupils or preceptors I know not .

		There hovers even Count
Adam Gurowski	PERSON	, Polish , patriotic , exiled , tem - porarily famous , with the vision of his being invoked for facility and then relinquished for difficulty ; though I scarce guess on which of his battle-grounds he was so polyglot that he even had a rich command of
New Yorkese	LOCATION	. ''

		Recalling his juvenile impressions of current politics , the author says : '' The field was strictly covered , to my young eyes , I make out , by three classes , the busy , the tipsy , and
Daniel Webster	PERSON	.

		This last great man must have rep - resented for us a class in himself ; as if to be ` political ' was just to be
Daniel Webster	PERSON	in his proper person and with room left over for nobody else .

		That he should have filled the sky of public life from pole to pole , even to a childish consciousness not formed in
New England	LOCATION	, and for which that strenuous section was but a name in the geography-book , is probably indeed a sign of how large , in the general air , he comparatively loomed .

		The public scene was otherwise a blank to our young vision , I discern , till , later on , in
Paris	LOCATION	, I saw for at that unim - proved period we of the unfledged did n't suppose our - selves to meet '
Charles Sumner	PERSON	. ''

		Boyish memories of famous English artists and actors , as seen in their several perform - ances , on canvas and behind the foot-lights , fill one enjoyable chapter , in which the author blushes to acknowledge that '' the grand man - ner , the heroic and the classic , in
Haydon	LOCATION	, came home to us more warmly and more humanly than in the masters commended as ' old , ' who , at the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	, seemed to meet us so little half-way , to hold out the hand of fellow - ship or suggest something that we could do , or could at least want to . ''

		.

		From memories of the
London	LOCATION	stage at that time , the following is of interest : '' Our enjoyment of
Charles Kean	PERSON	's presentation of
Henry the Eighth	ORGANIZATION	figures to me as a momentous date in our lives : we did nothing for weeks afterwards but try to reproduce in water-colours Queen
Katherine	PERSON	's dream - vision of the beckoning , consoling angels , a radiant group let down from the skies by machinery then thought marvellous when indeed we were not parad - ing across our schoolroom stage as the portentous Cardinal and impressively alternating his last speech to
Cromwell	PERSON	with
Buckingham	ORGANIZATION	's , that is with Mr.
Ryder	PERSON	's , address on the way to the scaffold .

		... I was to have my impression of
Charles Kean	PERSON	renewed later on ten years later , in
America	LOCATION	without a rag of scenic rein - forcement ; when I was struck with the fact that no actor so little graced by nature probably ever went so far toward repairing it by a kind of cold rage of endeavour . ''

		We get a passing glimpse of
Thackeray	PERSON	, who , the author says , '' struck me , in the sunny light of the animated room , as enormously big and who , though he laid on my shoulder the hand of benevolence , bent on my native costume the spectacles of wonder . ''

		The `` native costume , '' of which the wonder-exciting portion consisted of a short and tight brass-buttoned jacket , is shown in the frontispiece portrait of the small
Henry	ORGANIZATION	standing with one hand resting on the shoulder of his father , who is seated .

		General
Winfield Scott	PERSON	is another whose personal ap - pearance photographed itself in heroic propor - tions on the young memory and imagination .

		`` We must have been for some moments face to face , '' he says , recalling a walk in Fifth Avenue with his father , when the veteran soldier emerged from a cross street , '' while from under the vast amplitude of a dark - blue military cloak with a big velvet collar and loosened silver clasp , which spread about him like a symbol of the tented field , he greeted my parent so clear is my sense of the time it took me to gape all the way up to where he towered aloft . ''

		Little , indeed , do we see of the boy
William James	PERSON	in all these vivid and engrossing pictures of the past ; and this is to be regretted .

		But there is hope that fuller memorials of him will appear in the collection of his letters to be pub - 374 THE DIAL , -LSB-
May 1	DATE	lished later .

		The '' small boy , '' however , who serves as the central figure of the book , is sketched before our eyes in such strokes as it is a marvel and , to lovers of Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	's books , a delight to follow .

		The whole is exe - cuted in that master 's most unmistakable man - ner ; and even the less ardent admirers of his style can not but feel the charm of the book as soon as they get fairly into the swing of its peculiar mode and method .

		It is a remarkable piece of autobiographic , writing .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		A DELIVERANCE ON THE DRAMA .

		* Can we by taking thought add a cubit to our stature ?

		Can the winds by lashing the waves raise the average level of the ocean a single inch ?

		But at least by effort and exercise we can keep ourselves supple and undiminished , and the agitations of the sea prevent it from stagnating .

		In this view all the recent discussion of the things of the theatre , the formation of drama leagues , the production of plays by small reper - tory companies and at half private theatres may work for good .

		There are two factors needed for the produc - tion of a powerful and significant drama .

		The first is the appearance of a great dramatist or group of dramatists .

		These are far more rare than great comets .

		Hardly more than a score all told can be numbered in the history of the world .

		The second factor is the rage or mania for dramatic representation sweeping through the general mind .

		This is similar in its quality and action to other great instincts or possessions which at different times have seized upon the world the instinct for building cathedrals , for picture painting , for music , or for novel writing and reading .

		When the two elements in the case come together , we get a drama which is worth while .

		When they do not cohere , lit - erary creators who are potentially great drama - tists ,
Scott	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	for example , turn to other forms of their art .

		Or the people at large cease to crave the profound and powerful mo - ments of the drama and use the theatre merely as a means of amusement .

		Perhaps by much talking to , the people may be headed off and compelled to take an interest in serious dramatic work , if only as a fashion , but creative power * THE FOUNDATIONS OF A NATIONAL DRAMA .

		can not be so compassed .

		We may call up spirits from the vasty deep , but will they come ?

		Few contemporaries have a better right to speak about the possibilities of reviving the drama than Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	, the distin - guished English playwright , whose `` Founda - tions of a National Drama '' is recently published .

		It is a collection of essays , addresses , and letters relating to the modern theatre and its produc - tions .

		As the book is so miscellaneous in form we can not do better than give Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's gen - eral summary of what he is arguing for , the things really needed by drama and stage .

		`` 1 .

		To distinguish and separate our drama from popular amusement .

		`` 2 .

		To found a national or repertory theatre where high and severe literary and artistic standards may be set . ''

		3 .

		To insure that a dramatist shall be recognized and rewarded when and in so far as he has painted life and character and not according to his ability to tickle and bemuse the populace . ''

		4 .

		To bring our acting drama into living relation with English literature : to win from critical opinion the avowal that the drama is the most live , the most subtle , the most difficult form of literature : to bring about a general habit of reading plays such as prevails in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		6 .

		To inform our drama with a broad , sane , and profound morality ; a morality equally apart from that practised amongst wax dolls and from that which allows the present sniggering , veiled indecencies of popular farce and musical comedy . ''

		6 .

		To give our players a wide and varied training in their art .

		`` 7 .

		To break down as far as possible the system of long runs . ''

		8 .

		To distinguish between the play that has failed because it has been inadequately interpreted and one that has failed on its own demerits . ''

		9 .

		To bring the drama in relation to other arts : to establish it as a fine art . ''

		Three of the points in this list seem to us of supreme importance : to get people to distinguish between real drama and `` anything to amuse '' ; to get them to accept plays as literature and to read them ; and the question of morality .

		There is another point which Mr.
Jones	PERSON	does not include in his summary , though he treats of it elsewhere in the book , and that is the issue be - tween the playwright arid the player , the strug - gle as to which is to dominate the theatre .

		Two nations ,
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, have adopted absolutely opposite methods in this matter .

		In
France	LOCATION	the play has always been the first con - sideration ; in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, the actor or actress .

		The result is plain enough , one would think .

		In
France	LOCATION	there has been a living and interesting drama for three centuries .

		The very best French men of letters have practiced as playwrights .

		In
England	LOCATION	there have only
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 375 been sporadic specimens of brilliant drama , and the great writers have written poetic plays for the study .

		Amusement is a necessity of the human mind , and Mr.
Jones	PERSON	admits that people will not pay to be bored . ''

		Legs and tomfoolery , '' he says , are necessary on the stage .

		The trouble which the serious playwright has to confront is this , his work has to bring in a large amount of money at once or it can not appear .

		His rivals in other serious kinds of literature may be able to wait ; he can not .

		He must succeed now , if at all .

		How many copies of the works of Dar - win ,
Schopenhauer	PERSON	,
Nietzsche	LOCATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, or
Keats	PERSON	were sold in the lifetime of those writers ?

		If any one of them had been compelled to get a return of from five to ten thousand dollars the first week one of their books was published , the book would never have been published at all .

		There are apparently only two ways in which the problem can be solved for the serious dramatist .

		He may throw enough amusement into his work to carry its profundity , or else national , patriotic , or reli - gious forces may come to his aid and establish theatres of a high standard .

		The question of bringing the drama into relation with literature is a question of getting people to read plays .

		Once a published play sells even a reasonable edition it will not be ignored .

		Why the habit of reading plays ever went out is a curious matter to consider .

		As late as the days of
Goldsmith	PERSON	and
Sheridan	PERSON	, a playwright after a successful first night could be sure of a large fee from a publisher for his work .

		And even a later generation , that of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Hazlitt	PERSON	, and Hunt , habitually read and discussed recent dramatic productions .

		It was the novel which eclipsed the play , as it did the poem .

		The last two forms of literature require some intellectual effort from the reader .

		In the novel everything is done for him , it is , one may say , predigested food .

		A good play , which is only one-fifth as long as the average novel , may contain as much mental nutrition , hence intellectual dyspepsia to those unaccustomed to such strong food .

		But as our great desire to - day is to save time , as the short story has largely displaced the long novel , the very brevity of the play ought to recommend it to readers .

		The greatest stumbling-block in the path of the drama , however , is the question of morality .

		The best way to meet it , is to ask how it is possible to frame a story of any kind without some threatened or actual fracture of a good law , custom , or habit of mankind .

		You can as little have an action without sin as a man with - out a shadow .

		Even Sunday-school tales have to project vices such as pride , gluttony , selfish - ness , and so forth .

		Even our tea-cup American novelists have to deal with infractions of social usage and taste .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	in his charming '' Lady of the Aroostook '' makes an awful tragedy out of a young girl crossing the ocean unchaperoned , though in the care of an elderly sea captain .

		If we are to have a drama at all we must let it deal with life in all its height , depth , and breadth .

		Possibly human beings would be better without any such knowledge of life , but to attain a really satisfactory state of ignorance and innocence we should have to abolish Bibles , books , newspapers , conversa - tions , law proceedings , in fact the whole organ - ization of the world .

		English and American theatre-goers are still in the stage of a country audience which identifies the man who plays the villain with his part and proceeds to throw bad eggs at him .

		There was an instance of this kind in the early career of
Henry Irving	PERSON	.

		He was inclined towards the gruesome , and what with playing `` The Bells '' and reciting '' The Dream of Eugene Aram '' he got on the nerves of some of the
London	LOCATION	critics , who suggested that an actor with such a penchant for murder must be himself a doubtful character .

		Irving brought suit against the worst of his libellers and received substantial damages .

		We do not say that the dramatist who deals with the most extreme exhibitions of passion , vice , sin , and criminality does so primarily with the idea of saving the souls of his auditors .

		He deals with them because in them reside the most tremen - dous effects of human nature , and every dra - matic instinct in him responds to their appeal .

		But in all probability they do much to save souls , as thunderstorms clear the air , as the spectacle of the drunken Helot frightened the Spartan youth into virtue .

		Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's book is rich in suggestive themes , and it is impossible to touch on all of them .

		Here and there we think he betrays a bias .

		For instance , he is pretty hard on the English dramatic writers preceding his own era .

		Now we are inclined to think that , admitting all charges of fustian and staginess , such produc - tions as '' Virginius , '' `` The Hunchback , '' '' Richelieu , '' '' Money , '' `` The Lady of
Lyons	PERSON	, '' '' Caste , '' '' Home , '' and `` Our Boys '' are good plays .

		They have an essential humanity in them , and certainly the breath of theatrical life .

		They have kept the boards down to a very recent date , and we think it is doubtful whether Mr. 376 THE DIAL -LSB-
Mayl Jones	PERSON	's generation of playwrights will furnish as many successes for posterity .

		Another in - sistence of Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's is his demand that play - wrights shall be thoroughly trained in the tech - nique of their art .

		What technique ?

		Greek ,
Shakespearean	ORGANIZATION	,
Sheridanic	LOCATION	,
Sardouesque	LOCATION	; the training of the
Lyceum	LOCATION	, the music halls , or the transpontine drama ?

		Apparently anything in monologue or dialogue can be put upon the stage and can succeed .

		It is probably well to have some connected story , but nobody has ever yet solved the mystery of the plot of '' The Black Crook . ''

		It is probably advisable not to split your play into innumerable scenes , but '' Peer Gynt '' has been presented with success .

		It is probably the right thing to tell your story by means of action rather than of narrative , but the great effects of the Greek theatre were got by narrative .

		There is absolutely no rule which a great dramatist can not violate , and which an audience will not ignore if it pleases them to do so .

		Many brilliant dramatic writers have won their first successes when they were too young to know what training was .

London	LOCATION	with '' The Old Bachelor '' and makes a hit .


Sheridan	PERSON	, at about the same age , goes up to

		answer .

		Had the verses about
Mary	PERSON	and the lamb been written in these latter days , we should have been obliged to refer to the well-known gregarious tendencies of the Ovidse , and a num - ber of other matters , to explain why the lamb loved Mary so .

		Dr.
Parmelee	PERSON	, having in mind the unity of the whole evolutionary process , be - gins his book with the proposition that `` psychi - cal and social phenomena should be reduced as far as possible to biological terms , just as vital phenomena should be reduced as far as possible to chemical and physical terms . ''

		He therefore discusses the physico-chemical basis of behavior in general , and then the anatomical and physio - logical basis , following the matter up through the different groups of animals , only reaching man at the latter end of the book .

		We are thus led to see in human behavior a complex and special type of that organic response to stimuli which has been observed all along the line , from the protozoan up ; but which has from time to time entered upon phases distinct enough to re - quire separate classification .

		We also see that this evolution has been conditioned by the evolu - tion of bodily structures , and in particular of the nervous system .

		It follows from all this that the sociologist or psychologist can not afford to consider man alone , since so much of what he must observe and describe has its roots in the distant past , long prior to the appearance of our species in the world .

		It must be admitted , then , that Dr.
Parmelee	PERSON	is entirely right in urging that biology and com - parative psychology are necessary for the correct understanding of human behavior , and is to be commended for the attempt to supply , in a clearly written and not too voluminous work , the more essential data for this purpose .

		On the other hand it seems to me that the book as a whole may be justly criticised , not so much for its own peculiar faults , as for the pedagog - ical spirit which it represents .

		The author seems to confuse classification with explanation .

		In classifying animals , it is useful and necessary to note that eagles and chickens alike are birds , and dwell upon the common characteristics which make them so ; it is essential to observe that birds , reptiles , and fishes alike are verte - brates , and so on ; but the true zoologist never forgets that these great categories are merely , as it were , the bindings of the great books of nature , the pages of which are so numerous and so diversely illustrated .

		It is necessary to be synthetic , but the tendency may go so far as to be vicious .

		This we see in our everyday affairs , where so much harm arises from our off-hand
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 377 classification of people as good and bad , honest and dishonest , stupid and clever , and so forth .

		What we need so much in practical life is the ability to see in each other , not examples of classes , but rather special and unique personal - ities , each to be treated on its own peculiar merits .

		In doing this we are indeed synthetic , in that we find a single personality in the mul - tiple phenomena afforded by the individual , but this is naive or intuitive synthesism , not that of the comparative psychologist or anatomist .

		Evolution has been so enormously complex , that were we in possession of all the data we could not comprehend them .

		On the other hand , the fundamental principles of biology , which give us a broad understanding of evolu - tionary processes , are relatively simple ; so simple , in fact , that no reasonably competent person should grow up without some knowledge of them .

		Teaching directed to this end ought to be wholly beneficial , but I believe that it is so only when care is taken not to implant in the minds of young people the thoroughly vicious idea that everything in man and nature is '' ex - plained '' by a few simple rules .

		Artificial , bogus simplification is perhaps the dominant error of modern science , as taught in the schools .

		It represents a necessary tendency carried much too far , and perhaps as a corrective to this we may find it desirable to introduce detailed tax - onomic studies , which will at any rate bring the student into contact with the '' number of things '' of which this world is so full .

		As an extreme example of the condition of mind possible to a `` reducer '' of biological phe - nomena , we may take ProfessorParmelee 's treat - ment of consciousness .

		In the following quota - tions I have italicized the significant words : '' For the reasons given above , we are justified in be - lieving that consciousness is objective if it exists at all , and that consequently it is possible to study it scienti - fically .

		What , then , is consciousness as an objective phenomenon , if it exists at all ?

		I have already suggested that it may be a form of behavior '' -LRB- pp. 313-314 -RRB- . ''

		We have seen that we have no tangible evidence of such a thing as consciousness '' -LRB- p. 319 -RRB- .

		The reader will have difficulty in believing that this is anything but a burlesque on a certain school of modern psychologists and physiolo - gists !

		The discussion of the theories of evolution , occupying the greater part of two chapters , seems rather inadequate and superficial , and raises the question whether the topics included under this head should not be treated in every case by a biologist .

		The easy way in which difficulties are smoothed over is shown by the following : '' As we have already seen , the gen - erating of the primordial protoplasm , similar to crystallization , takes place in large part as a result of the molecular forces inherent in the ele - ments which constitute organic matter . ''

		What will the student gather from this ?

		Literally , it is so meaningless that it is difficult to say whether it is accurate ; but it quite leaves out of account the fact that we know actually nothing of the genesis of the primordial protoplasm , and that the occurrence , whether explained by '' molecu - lar forces '' or otherwise , was perhaps the most tremendous event in the history of the world .

		THE WRITERS OF THE ENGLISH ROMANTIC PERIOD .

		* In referring to `` the modern vice of reviewing a book without giving a clear image of its con - tents , '' Professor Elton , of the
University of Liverpool	ORGANIZATION	, unintentionally sets up a standard that may well appal the reviewer of his two recent volumes .

		They contain together a total of 830 pages , and the number of words to the page is from four to five hundred .

		The author 's purpose is thus stated in his Preface : '' This work has been termed a survey and not a his - tory , though it contains matter for the historian , and his point of view has been kept in mind throughout in the arrangement of the theme .

		But the historical aspect is meant to be subordinate ; and the book is really a review , a direct criticism , of everything I can find in the literature of fifty years that speaks to me with any sound of living voice .

		As the motto on the title-page may indicate , it is a series of judgments upon works of art .

		I do not know what literature is unless it is an art .

		Life and ideas , society and manners , politics and affairs , must always be studied in order to understand that art and to judge of its productions .

		But on each of these productions our last word must be an answer to the questions , Is it well done ?

		Does it last ?

		What is it to me ?

		Even the further question , How does it arise ?

		is less ultimate and imperative .

		It is of course equally right and needful to study literature for the light which it may cast upon other things upon thought or ethics or national character ; but that is a different enterprise , not to be confounded with the present one , although the material may often be the same in the two cases . ''

		Though he confines himself to a survey , and stresses letters rather than thought , Professor Elton is right in saying that his work contains matter for the historian .

		To be sure he excludes formal treatment , not only of contemporary life , but of other interesting topics of scholarship , * A SURVEY OF ENGLISH LITERATURE , 1780-1830 .

		378 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	such as the mental relationships with
Germany	LOCATION	, and the indebtedness of romanticism to antiquity .

		He even resists the temptation to follow the side-trails that lead from individual men , such as the discrepancies between
Wordsworth	PERSON	's theory of education and that of
Rousseau	PERSON	, and
Cole	PERSON	- ridge 's '' plagiarisms '' from
Schelling	PERSON	and
A. W. Schlegel	PERSON	.

		But he fully understands that `` in this second English Renaissance , ... as in the first , there is not only a great and successful flowering of creative art ; ... many of the seeds are brought from other lands , or else are handed down alive , after a long residence in darkness , from the ancient world . ''

		And though he may not consider these cognate and germinat - ing forces en masse , he shows their main bear - ings in his treatment of the several authors .

		`` The Prelude , '' for example , is connected not only with the secular confession which sprang from the desire to expose one 's self , but also with the Puritanic or Protestant mania , which reveals itself in
Bunyan	PERSON	and even the more re - strained
Milton	PERSON	, for recording the history of the soul '' for the good of the world . ''

		In fact , there is nothing in the survey more praiseworthy than its absence of the provincial note , its easy readi - ness in linking the romantic writers with kindred or contrasting spirits of other races or times .

		Yet it is mainly concerned in making us see them as literary artists .

		It is little hampered by the furious squabble between `` classic '' and `` romantic , '' and is faithful to the motto from
Hazlitt	PERSON	: `` I have endeavored to feel what is good , and to give a reason for the faith that was in me , when necessary , and when in my power . ''

		That Professor Elton admits , though '' with some hesitation , '' summaries and studies of tendency , may be seen from such of his chap - ter titles as `` The End of the Classical Verse : Crabbe , '' `` The Novel of Manners and
Jane Austen	PERSON	, '' `` Prose of Doctrine : Scottish Phil - osophy , and
Burke	PERSON	, '' `` The Official Reviewers , '' '' Historians and Other Prose Writers . ''

		It may be seen especially in the initial and the closing chapter .

		Here forty pages are consumed in sketching the background and tracing the chief characteristics of the period .

		Because of the very generalizations which Professor Elton else - where tries to avoid , and because of the state - ment of his conception of the age as a whole , these chapters claim our attention .

		The roman - tic age is found to inherit three mental features from the period 1700-1780 : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the impulse of criticism , ... `` a thorough , hostile scrutiny of received opinions in metaphysical , moral , and social science , and in art '' ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the use of learn - ing and science for reconstructive effort ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the growing tendency of '' the shaping spirit of imagination '' to recover its higher uses .

		The last of these qualities dominates the new age . ''

		Poetry is in the ascendant , and nearly all the best prose is creative , and is doing the work of poetry .

		The imagination is working freely , and not , as it must in history or sociology , under the restrictions of fact ... This reunion of poetry and prose under the rule of the free imagination is the great mark of our literature from
1780	DATE	to
1830	DATE	. ''

		And the ultimate secret of this changed imagi - nation is `` the convalescence of the feeling for beauty . ''

		This manifests itself in three ways . ''

		First of all , the senses of the artist are regenerated ; this is at the bottom of everything .

		Secondly , his renewed perceptions of the face of living nature are attended by a vision of humanity , a new passion and humor , the expression of which is brought under the law of beauty .

		Thirdly , this new knowledge and self - knowledge are read in the light of new ideas ; philo - sophical conceptions and visions invade literary art , and are brought under its law . ''

		But before these new senses , new sympathies and passions , and new ideas could be brought under aesthetic restraint , the central problem of the new literature had to be solved the problem of diction .

		To be adequate , the lan - guage of the age had to be sensuous and con - crete ; it had , on some occasions , to regain its fitness for the lofty and heroic style ; and it had , at the other extreme , to press plainness to the lowest poetic limit .

		In spite of mistakes , all three of these necessary ends were attained .

		Nevertheless it is the study of individual writers upon which Professor Elton throws the emphasis .

		To '' give a clear image '' of the sub - stance of each separate study is out of the ques - tion .

		The substitution of an inquiry into general methods and values is imperative .

		We shall restrict ourselves to three things the author 's style , the scope of his investigations , and the Tightness of his conclusions .

		The style is clear , flexible , pleasing .

		It meets the exactions of long journeyman service .

		It rarely draws attention to itself , and is satis - fied to reflect ideas .

		Aptness of phrase is not lacking : '' everywhere in
Lockhart	LOCATION	we have the sense of something bigger than his set '' ;
Sydney Smith	PERSON	's '' usual tone is that of a man exposing stupidity to the stupid '' ; the '' Annals of the Parish '' has the effect '' of a piece of history seen through near-sighted eyes '' ; and some of
Scott	PERSON	's songs swing along '' with a galloping , abducting kind of tune , like ' Young Loch - invar . ' ''

		Yet this aptness is at the farthest possible remove from affectation .

		The power to condense as much a habit of mind as of
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 379 language is revealed again and again .

		Cow - per , we hear , '' was inspired by the love of
Milton	PERSON	and the love of simplicity , and his real feat is to have found a poetic language that reconciled these two affections . ''

		And once more : `` Of women ,
Landor	ORGANIZATION	,
Scott	PERSON	, Words - worth , and
Shelley	PERSON	always write like gentle - men ; while
Byron	PERSON	,
Moore	PERSON	, and
Keats	PERSON	can never wholly be trusted to do so . ''

		Another trait likewise inseparable from the thought behind it is the ability to make effective comparisons .

		Two examples must suffice .

		The first has to do with two sets of personages from the standpoint of the kind of conversations they engage in : ''
Meredith	PERSON	's make many wonderful strokes and dozens of false ones , but are so heady and high-spirited that they carry the game through and disarm criticism .

		Peacock , we feel , has scored out every word which he feels will not ring as sharply fifty years afterwards .

		Yet he does not write , like
Sheridan	PERSON	, up to a prepared joke ; he does not seem to know himself what is coming ; there is the true air of impromptu , only no misses are allowed . ''

		The second is self-explanatory : '' With
Milton	PERSON	we fly by the map , taking our bearings amidst the evenly-whirling spheres , and seeing hell and heaven at a measurable distance in a certain direction .

		With
Keats	PERSON	we fly like a bee , near the ground , from one cup of honey to another , and with long alightings .

		But with De Quincey we are in absolute space , which has no bearings , or firm earth , or north or south ; and yet it is peopled with human faces and memories and monu - ments themes to fix and control the imagination , which else would stray intolerably . ''

		A study of all the writers of the period strikes one as a pretty large order ; perhaps most readers would test its thoroughness by seeing what had been done with such minor figures as
Godwin	PERSON	,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, or the ''
Ettrick Shep	PERSON	- herd . ''

		The present reviewer makes such a touchstone of Gait .

		But Professor Elton does not stop with men like these ; he patiently ex - amines others yet humbler , even such as are not primarily literary at all .

		Numbers mean little ordinarily , but some idea of the amount of space devoted to out-of-the-way men , period - icals , and topics may not come amiss .

		A page is given to each of the following :
William Maginn	PERSON	,
Charles Lloyd	PERSON	,
Crabb Kobinson	PERSON	, and ``
Baron Munchausen	PERSON	. ''

		Half as much again falls to
Dugald Stewart	PERSON	and the researches in the ballad between
Percy	PERSON	and
Scott	PERSON	.

		The `` Retrospective Review , ''
Robert Eyres Landor	PERSON	, and
Hartley Coleridge	PERSON	are alloted two pages each .

		Scott 's narrative metres claim more than three pages , and
Praed	PERSON	is given four .

		It must not be supposed , however , that the author has extended himself in a kind of printer 's ink tour deforce .

		On the contrary he has had his say , without troubling himself about the space con - sumed , and without either halting or hastening .

		When it is perceived that the discussion of every individual , whether major or minor , leaves the impression of completeness , of being everything the author thinks necessary , 830 pages seem amazingly few .

		The present reviewer recalls but two persons who fail to receive proper re - cognition : surely Lord and
Lady Holland	LOCATION	were too inextricably interwoven with the literature of the time to be ignored .

		The method of studying individual men , instead of starting with hard and fast prin - ciples and commending or condemning as these are observed or violated , is justified upon two grounds .

		In the first place , the controversy between `` classic `` and `` romantic '' a contro - versy that can never terminate in the complete victory of either has blinded many critics to the actual achievements of the age .

		In the second place , '' there is no orchestra in roman - ticism '' ; it gives us , rather , `` many songs by no means in accord . ''

		It is necessary that the writers be studied separately , and it is necessary that each be approached with an open mind .

		Balance and Tightness of judgment , the power to detect the merits of the particular issue , is everything .

		And the importance of Professor Elton 's work rests upon the fact that he pos - sesses this discriminating tolerance .

		One may not agree with each separate conclusion , but one may be certain that no conclusion is reached in a hasty or partisan way .

		We are reassured in the opening chapter when , after stating that there are three types of poetry in the age that which `` is content to be very good , '' that `` whose aim is doctrine , '' and that which '' would have been different if questions had not been asked or answered , but ... are not asked or answered in the poem , '' the author declares that each type is good and that the '' aim and theme -LSB- of art -RSB- may be anything that will admit of its working under the law of beauty . ''

		It is in this spirit that he reviews the procession of figures , great and small , that march through the age .

		A closer examination of his method may be worth our while .

		Though not disturbed by the combats of literary schools , Professor EJton acknowledges no compulsion to keep his hands off when he wishes to touch debated points .

		He refutes , partly by reference to Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, the idea that melancholy was an exclusive or necessary attribute of romanticism .

		He pictures the affinities with liberating forces which underlay 380 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1 Jeffrey	DATE	's tirades against them .

		And he shows the '' downright and daylight genius '' of the Wizard of the North by quoting a passage
Waverley	ORGANIZATION	alone by the unknown lake that `` unites every element in
Scott	LOCATION	's notion of romance scenery , foreignness , literary mem - ories of ballad or lay , the sense of danger and wonder and solitude , and , last of all , the humorous return of
Scott	PERSON	upon his hero , or upon himself , as he comes out of his bath of romance and shakes himself , and recommences realist and Lowlander . ''

		Moreover , he is not afraid to acknowledge the shortcomings of the romantic writers .

		He points them out frankly .

		He finds
Byron	PERSON	's greatest weakness as an artist in his lack of the idea of saying a thing once for all .

		He sees the limitation involved in
Scott	LOCATION	's habit of extricating his heroes and heroines , of shrinking from the supreme subject of tragic art , `` the play of character in an inextricable position . ''

		He realizes that in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	'' the struggle is after all too simple , the circuit too narrow , '' and the artistry too unsure for him to attain preeminence either as a sage or as a poet .

		But along with the ability to make distinc - tions and to recognize faults , Professor Elton has the power to appreciate worth .

		Nor is this too ready to defer to conventional opinion : how many critics would dare to confess that to them personally
Byron	PERSON	is `` an inspiration and a liv - ing force '' ?

		This sympathetic understanding nowhere shows better than in the discussion of technical matters De Quincey 's prose rhythms ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	's inventions of poetic forms , the metre of ''
Christabel	PERSON	, '' and the art element in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	's autobiographical poems .

		It shows quite as well , however , in matters where person - ality enters
Scott	PERSON	's lyric gift , the revealing na - ture of Lamb 's and
Hazlitt	PERSON	's criticisms ,
Keats	PERSON	's conception of the relations between beauty and truth , the extraordinary progress shown in the last works of
Byron	LOCATION	and
Shelley	PERSON	.

		If Professor Elton does not startle us with novel conclusions , he opens new vistas of understanding and enjoy - ment , and we feel that even in his treatment of the less conspicuous writers he takes a whole - some pleasure in distilling out the soul of their goodness .

		It will be seen that this '' Survey of English Literature , 1780-1830 , '' is a notable produc - tion , indispensable to the student of one of the crowning eras of English letters .

		The mechani - cal features of the volumes are worthy of their substance .

		Well bound and clearly printed , they are more than usually free from the blemish of typographical errors .

		They contain ample notes , mainly given to bibliographies so distri - buted that only the chief authorities are men - tioned at first and those bearing on special topics are introduced as the need arises .

		They are also provided with a thoroughgoing index .

		A SUCCESSOR TO
BARTLETT	PERSON	AND DE VERB .

		* The task of compiling a dictionary of Ameri - canisms is beset with many difficulties .

		There is , first of all , the difficulty of deciding upon a satisfactory principle of selection , of determin - ing , for instance , whether slang shall be included , or negroisms , or recent importations from for - eign languages .

		There is the further difficulty of making sure that a word , apparently restricted in its use to the
United States	LOCATION	, is not also cur - rent elsewhere .

		And there is always the diffi - culty growing out of the circumstance that our language is constantly changing , in consequence of which no such compilation can possibly be complete .

		Our latest dictionary of Americanisms , `` An American Glossary , '' by Mr.
Richard H. Thorn	PERSON	- ton , of the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	bar , makes no preten - sions to completeness .

		It modestly proclaims itself to be a dictionary of '' certain American - isms only , those , that is , of recognized standing or of special interest '' ; and it anticipates harsh or unreasonable criticism on the ground of other shortcomings by confessing at the outset that it is not without faults and by inviting additions and corrections .

		A comparison of this new work with
Bartlett	PERSON	's `` Dictionary of Americanisms , '' the standard work on the subject for more than half a cen - tury , makes it clear at once that the earlier work records much the larger number of words .

		Bartlett records , by a rough estimate , about ten thousand words , whereas Mr.
Thornton	PERSON	takes account of only about three thousand .

		This disparity is traceable in part to the fact already noted , that Mr.
Thornton	PERSON	has not attempted to make an exhaustive collection ; but it is mainly due , we suspect , to the fact that
Bartlett	PERSON	included in his dictionary a large number of words that are not properly to be reckoned as Americanisms , words that are neither Amer - ican in origin nor peculiarly American in * AN AMERICAN GLOSSARY .

		Mr.
John S. Farmer	PERSON	's dictionary , '' Americanisms Old and New '' -LRB-
1889	DATE	-RRB- , exhibits the same fault .

		Mr.
Thornton	PERSON	, with the aid evidently of the Century and New English dic - tionaries , has striven to eliminate all superflu - ous items .

		At the same time , he has succeeded -LRB- here again with the aid of these dictionaries and of the Publications of the
American Dialect Society	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- in collecting a good many words that had been overlooked by his predecessors , a few , indeed , which , he holds , are now registered for the first time .

		Some idea of the number of new items that he has collected may be derived from a comparison with
Bartlett	PERSON	's dictionary for the letters A , M , and W. Under A , Mr.
Thornton	PERSON	lists 49 words not recorded by
Bart	PERSON	- lett ; under M , 91 ; and under W , 54 .

		The total number of entries made by
Bartlett	PERSON	under these letters is 681 , of which Mr.
Thornton	PERSON	rejects all save 108 .

		It would thus appear that the number of new items recorded by Mr.
Thornton	PERSON	is larger than the number brought over from
Bartlett	PERSON	.

		The chief excellence of these volumes is to be found , however , not in the number of fresh items that are recorded , nor in the omission of superfluous items , but in the abundance of the illustrative extracts .

		Of these there are , accord - ing to the compiler 's estimate , about 14,000 in all .

		Such material is obviously very valuable .

		It will not only prove extremely helpful to those who will consult these volumes for reference purposes , but it will also be of immense service to future lexicographers .

		Most of Mr.
Thornton	PERSON	's citations are drawn from
the first half of last century	DATE	, the writings of
John Neal	PERSON	,
Seba Smith	PERSON	,
R. M. Bird	PERSON	,
Ken	PERSON	- nedy ,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Longstreet	LOCATION	,
Baldwin	PERSON	,
Hooper	PERSON	, and
W. T. Thompson	PERSON	being prominent among those laid under contribution .

		Too few of the illustrations are , in our judgment , drawn from writers of the present generation .

		And the number of illustrations has not always been evenly proportioned to the importance or to the interest attaching to the words under which they are cited .

		Under the word bar -LRB- '' the liquor counter in a saloon '' -RRB- , to mention a conspicuous example , only one illustration is given , although the term must have been in general use in this sense for a century or more ; while the vulgar - ism bar -LRB- for '' bear '' -RRB- , which is seldom heard to-day , comes in for eighteen illustrations .

		Sim - ilarly the phrases back-handed , back taxes , and black eye , all in pretty common use to-day , receive but one illustration each , from the years
1842	DATE	,
1788	DATE	, and
1795	DATE	, respectively ; while balance -LRB- in the sense of '' remainder '' -RRB- is given twenty-nine illustrations , boost eighteen illus - trations , gouge forty illustrations , and Yankee a total of fifty-eight illustrations .

		In the case of words in common use to-day but not fully illustrated , more of comment as to their vogue would have been helpful ; and all provincialisms , colloquialisms , and vulgarisms might well have been designated as such .

		Fault may also be found , as was perhaps inevitable , with some of Mr.
Thornton	PERSON	's defini - tions .

		The word allow , for instance , in its provincial American use , means not only '' to be of the opinion that , to admit , '' but also -LRB- as two of the illustrations make plain -RRB- '' to declare . ''

		Backwoods is not exactly '' the forest prime - val . ''

		To bone up is not '' to bristle up , '' but -LRB- as
Bartlett	PERSON	has it -RRB- `` to apply one 's self closely . ''

		June bug is not '' any insect that appears in
June	DATE	'' ; it is the term applied in the North to a blundering , brownish beetle , but in the South -LRB- usually -RRB- to a green-backed beetle , which is of a quite different genus .

		Nubbin , which Mr.
Thornton	PERSON	defines as '' an imperfect or spoiled ear of corn , '' is more precisely '' a small ear of corn . ''

		And to shuck corn is not '' to pull it from the stalk , '' but '' to remove it from the husks '' -LRB- or shucks -RRB- .

		To skunk an opponent is not merely `` to beat him thoroughly , '' but `` to win all the points , to whitewash him . ''

		A water - haul is not , as we know it , `` a cheat , a swindle '' ; and it originated , we believe , not , as Mr.
Thornton	PERSON	suggests , in a fraud practiced by cer - tain government contractors in hauling by water while charging for '' land-carriage , '' but in sein - ing .

		The definition `` lady-bird '' for lady-bug will be ambiguous to most Americans ; as will also '' communicate '' for commune .

		Other de - finitions that are unsatisfactory for one reason or another are those appearing under ashcake , backing and filling -LRB- is the phrase properly accounted an Americanism ? -RRB-

		, chunk -LRB- first entry -RRB- ,
Cumberland Presbyterian	LOCATION	, dipper ,
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	shore , like all-possessed , phoebe , poke -LRB- second entry -RRB- , rooter , rush -LRB- first entry -RRB- , and stand pat .

		Clevis , mentioned in the preface as one of a number of words that survive in
America	LOCATION	but that have not taken root , is well-known sometimes with the pronunciation clivis or clivy in rural districts of the South , all the way from
Virginia	LOCATION	to
Texas	LOCATION	; and three other phrases , doated wood , hard favoured , and het -LRB- for `` heated '' -RRB- , mentioned in the same list , are not infrequently heard to-day in some parts of the South .

		The same holds , also , for the phrase let on , in the sense of `` make believe , '' 382 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	which Mr.
Thornton	PERSON	states he is not familiar with .

		The pronunciation crick , for creek , it may be added , is not universal in
America	LOCATION	.

		It is to be regretted , finally , that Mr.
Thorn	PERSON	- ton did not enter more fully into matters of derivation and word-development .

		The phrase `` on historical principles , '' in the sub-title of his work , would seem to imply that a good deal had been made of these matters ; but although we do have an etymology here and there , the compilation is , aside from this , historical only in so far as the illustrative extracts are dated and arranged chronologically .

		Occasional bibli - ographical references mainly from '' Notes and Queries '' tend somewhat to offset this defi - ciency .

		In his preface , Mr.

		Slang even col - lege slang has been largely excluded , in virtue of its ephemeral nature ; and vulgarisms receive but small space .

		Considerable space , however , is devoted to nicknames and kindred appellations popularly assigned to notable persons and places and to political and religious movements , a class of words in which American speech would seem to be peculiarly rich .

		Two BOOKS ox THE SHORT STORY .

		* The psychologists are like the armies of the French Revolution .

		They propose to remake the world , if not by persuasion , then by force .

		A few years ago they came to the aid of the advertiser , and the effect upon the high cost of living has astonished us all .

		Now it is the short story .

		This invasion , as it is mani - fested in Professor
Walter B. Pitkin	PERSON	's book , '' The Art and the Business of Story Writing , '' is not unwelcome .

		To deny the importance of technique in the short story is to confess ignorance of the form ; and as technique in the short story is chiefly concerned with the means of securing a certain effect , and as that effect must be made upon a reader 's mind , psychology is evidently needed to explain the processes .

		STUDYING THE SHORT STORY .

		By
J. Berg Esenwein	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Hinds	PERSON	,
Noble & Eldredge	ORGANIZATION	.

		This book contains the first thorough analysis of the means by which character , setting , and plot produce the results for which the contem - porary editor is most willing to exchange his check .

		Professor Pitkin is as dogmatic as he is vivacious ; in his certainty that the effect desired can be accurately defined he allows himself unlimited prejudices against all story methods which do not conform to his conception of narrative efficiency .

		And yet , since no one before has tried to get to the bottom of our short-story technique , it is unjust to abuse him for a single-minded pursuance of a critical method based upon premises which , if narrow , are sound .

		Indeed this is a valuable book .

		Its analyses are keen ; its comments sometimes illu - minating ; and it should help the writer , even when it angers him .

		Nevertheless the book is narrow , and a little depressing .

		The writer is frank in his purpose to teach craftmanship rather than art ; and in this he does not limit his usefulness , for both artist and commercial writer must learn tech - nique , and need good books to help them .

		But though one applauds the usefulness of the pro- ject , Professor
Pitkin	PERSON	's book shares a weakness common to every work of this description which has appeared in English .

		He is obsessed by the mechanics of short-story writing .

		In the tumult over `` effect , '' `` thematic development , '' and '' integration , '' that imaginative interpreta - tion of life which is the raison d'etre of fiction is but a feeble whisper , seldom heard and soon forgotten .

		It has no emphasis , and so assumes no importance in the whole .

		And thus , not - withstanding its admirable practicability , Pro- fessor
Pitkin	PERSON	's text is an impulse towards virtuosity rather than art .

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	speaks of '' wheels and pulleys necessary to the effect , but in themselves noth - ing , '' with an indirect reference to contemporary drama which might be aptly applied to the com - mercialized short story .

		But Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	is an extremist , though on the side of genius rather than mediocrity .

		Still , good evidence of the false emphasis of Professor
Pitkin	PERSON	's book is to be found in the impression at closing it that any trivial idea if properly handled may make a great story , a feeling , we believe , which the author was far from wishing to inspire .

		And good evidence of the narrowness of his psycho - logically developed criticism springs to sight when one notes that , for example ,
Tolstoi	PERSON	's '' Master and Man '' violates some of the most cardinal principles with conspicuous success .

		This book is useful , practical , and , for the
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 383 current American story , sound .

		^ Esthetically it is narrow , and perhaps a little blind ; and its emphasis is entirely upon skilful mediocrity .

		Skilful mediocrity is perhaps as far as one can go in teaching the short story ; but it is an ideal only for that large and useful class who make a business , and a good one , of feeding the American imagination with stories that are not too humorous , or too subtle , or too satirical , or too intense in short , not too good for the average among a million subscribers .

		For the new profession of short-story making , Mr.
Pitkin	PERSON	's book is best adapted ; and indeed if he had called it '' The Business of Commercial Short Story Writing : With Suggestions for Literary Workers , '' we should have little to offer by way of criticism .

		Mr.
Esenwein	PERSON	's book is a brief encyclopaedia of the short story , containing some well-selected examples garnished with abundant quoted criti - cisms , and a critical and biographical sketch for each .

		With this book the student of a given story has his critical apparatus at hand when he begins to read .

		The scheme of printing on a half-page with space for annotations and com - ment is ingenious and probably useful .

		But Mr.
Esenwein	PERSON	's own annotations should have been pruned .

		They are somewhat uncritical , and occasionally irrelevant .

		Their position , however , like guideposts pointing to a mountain view , is undeniably effective .

		BRIEFS o * r NEW BOOKS .

		A woman 's The meandering red line running journey through northwest and north from
Haiphong	LOCATION	wetter *
China	LOCATION	.

		to
Tachienlu	LOCATION	, on the eastern border of Thibet , thence northeast to
Chengtu	LOCATION	, the capital of S/echuen province , and eastward , down the
Yangtse River	LOCATION	to
Hangkow	LOCATION	, whence it turns again north to Peking and thence northwest across the desert of
Gobi	ORGANIZATION	to Verchneudinsk in
Siberia	LOCATION	, this line across the map of eastern
Asia	LOCATION	marks the long lonely journey of an extraordinarily plucky woman .

		And yet Miss
Elizabeth Kendall	PERSON	discusses her jour - ney in `` A Wayfarer in
China	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- as if it were little more than the pleasure jaunt of an ordinary tourist .

		A teacher of history by profession and instinctively a wanderer and a student of races ,
Miss Kendall	PERSON	desired to see
China	LOCATION	as nearly as pos - sible unaffected by treaty-port influences .

		She , therefore , got into western
China	LOCATION	by the most direct route , and moved north through the two great south - western provinces of
Yunnan	LOCATION	and
Szechuen	PERSON	.

		This first portion of her journey as far as
Chengtu	PERSON	was the most unusual until she reached
Kalgan	PERSON	in the extreme north of
China	LOCATION	proper , and undertook to cross the desert of
Gobi	ORGANIZATION	in an American buggy .

		The whole story of her experiences is very enter - taining .

		The absence of dangerous adventures with the rough element of the population of western
China	LOCATION	will surprise most readers .

		Certain it is that no Chinese woman could travel across the
United States	LOCATION	alone and report to her Chinese readers that she had met with impolite treatment only once , and then in a mild form .

		Miss
Kendall	PERSON	found her chair - bearers and baggage coolies cheerful , willing , and obliging .

		They extended to her many thoughtful courtesies , plucking wild flowers for her by the wayside , insisting upon the best accommodations for her at the inns , carrying her little Scotch terrier whenever his short legs gave out .

		The uniform friendliness between traveller and coolies speaks as loudly for the good temper of the American woman as for the good nature of the burden-bearers .

		Miss
Kendall	PERSON	has many complimentary things to say of the Chinese people , and her judgment of the work of the missionaries is decidedly favorable .

		One receives from her bird 's - eye survey of the western Chinese at home a fresh impression of those sub - stantial race virtues which the friends of
China	LOCATION	rely upon to insure the Republic a long and honorable career .

		The force of this impression is not at all lessened by the rapidity with which
Miss Kendall	PERSON	accomplished her long journey by chair , ship , pony , and buggy ; for she brought to the observation of country and people trained and mature powers , and she shows unusual self-possession , intelligence , and sympathy .

		Sociological To most readers history means a interpretations record of political developments , an of history .

		account that notes especially the activities and policies of rulers , cabinets , and legis - latures .

		There are , however , a number of special types , such as literary , economic , and military his - tory .

		Recently the sociologist has begun to write history from his own particular point of view , and we now also have what claims to be sociological history .

		Mr.
J. M. Robertson	PERSON	, a well-known En - glish critic , is the author of a new work entitled `` The Evolution of States '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , which he offers as an illustration of the sociological type of history .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's effort has been to find and discuss the great social forces that have directed and determined the careers of the more important states .

		These are , he believes , to a large extent economic , though he admits that racial differences and the strife of ideas have also affected the course of events .

		His work is , therefore , essentially an interpretation ; a historian in the accepted sense of the word , Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	can not claim to be .

		He has made no study of first-hand materials : he takes the conclu - sions of men who have searched the sources , and from these he attempts to construct his system of interpretation .

		Where authorities disagree , he ap - pears to select the opinion that appeals to him or that best suits his purpose ; any effort to test the 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	correctness of this by documentary investigation is not apparent .

		The author believes that he has found a principle `` which may safely be brought to bear on the study of practical politics , because it is an axiom alike of inorganic physics and of biology ... This is the simple principle that all energy divides osten - sibly into forces of attraction and repulsion . ''

		His - tory is , therefore , the outcome of constant grouping and constant strife , strife between classes , between religions , and between nations .

		It is a dangerous procedure to apply a single principle to the entire course of history , and of this truth Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's '' Evolution of States '' provides an excellent illus - tration .

		His theory appears to fit the facts at every point , but it is a carefully selected group of facts .

		And back of the '' principle '' lie the questions : what led to the formation of the contending groups ?

		what in each case was the fundamental cause of the strife ?

		To these his `` laws of socio-political development '' do not give sufficient answers .

		The work , never - theless , has its value : it shows that the author has thought deeply on social questions in their wider aspects ; and his views are always interesting and often rational and plausible .

		A little more than one - third of the book is devoted to ancient history , to the political , economic , and cultural forces of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Another third is given to the Italian republics and the lesser European states ; the re - mainder is devoted to English history down to the eighteenth century .

		Of the greater European states ,
Austria	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	, there is no separate discussion .

		Of particular interest are the author 's views as to the needs of modern democ - racies : '' To flourish they must have peace ; they must sooner or later practice a scientific and humane restraint of population ... ; they must check in - equality , which is the fountain of domestic dispeace ; and they must maintain a progressive and scientific culture . ''

		These conditions he finds generally want - ing except , perhaps , in the Scandinavian countries , which with '' continued peaceful evolution in the direction first of democratic federation and further of socialization of wealth ... may reach and keep the front rank of civilization , '' A near mew of Mr '
Harry A. Franck	PERSON	has earned
Panama	LOCATION	and the the reputation of '' a born story-teller Panamanian .

		an -LRB- J a j , orn tramp . ''

		His latest book , '' Zone Policeman 88 : A Close Range Study of the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal and its Workers '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is just such a rollicking account of new and eagerly - desired experiences as the late
George Borup	PERSON	gave to an appreciative circle of readers in his North - Polar narrative of two years ago .

		One book takes us to the frigid zone , the other to the tropics ; but there is in each the same remarkable command of apt and expressive slang , the same zestful welcome of every fresh experience , the same Yankee adapta - bility to whatever of unexpected and nerve-testing the day 's work may have in store .

		For about six months , apparently , Mr.
Franck	PERSON	was on the pay-roll of the
Isthmian Canal Commission	ORGANIZATION	, first as census - taker , then as '' plain-clothes '' man on the police force , thus enjoying the best of facilities for seeing things in the Zone from the inside .

		He remarks on an early page that '' the Zone is no easy dwelling-place for the non-employee .

		Our worthy Uncle of the chin whiskers makes it quite plain that , while he may tolerate the mere visitor , he does not care to have him hanging around ; makes it so plain , in fact , that a few weeks of sight-seeing on the Zone implies an adamantine financial backing . ''

		It was his command of Spanish that first procured the author his position among the servants of our chin-whiskered Uncle , and inciden - tally his colloquial readiness in a number of other tongues helped him out in his varied experiences among the polyglot population of the Zone .

		Here is a passage humorously descriptive of his duties as a government detective : `` A box billed from
New York	LOCATION	to
Peru	LOCATION	had been broken open on
Balboa	LOCATION	dock and one bottle of cognac stolen .

		Unfortu - nately the matter was turned over to me so long after the perpetration of the dastardly crime that the possible culprits among the dock hands had wholly recovered from the probable consumption of the evidence .

		But I succeeded in gathering material for a splendid type-written report of all I had not been able to unearth , to file away among other price - less headquarters ' archives . ''

		The book is lavishly illustrated from photographs , and both pictures and reading matter are full of entertainment and infor - mation .

		_ In * he first issue ?

		f THE DlAL published exactly thirty-three years a g O ?

		there appeared from the pen of its editor an article on the poetry of Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	, occasioned by the appearance of his work in an American edition .

		This volume of '' Vignettes in Rhyme and Other Verses , '' with its dedication to Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	and its introduction by Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, found wide and immediate favor ; but we are glad to believe that nowhere was it given more cordial welcome than in the pages of THE DIAL .

		A new edition , the ninth , of Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	's `` Collected Poems '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- has just reached us at this appro - priate time .

		To the `` Vignettes in Rhyme '' is now added the later product of nearly a third of a cen - tury , yet the bulk of the volume is not great .

		Our facile versifiers of to-day often publish as much in a year or two as Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	has produced in a life - time , and with a corresponding difference in qual - ity .

		Of the additional group of twenty-seven pieces published for the first time in this ninth edition , none are new in the sense of having been recently written .

		Indeed , save for a few occasional verses , Mr.
Dob	PERSON	- son 's muse has been quiescent these past five years .

		At three score and ten , the singing time is over , and even so mellow-hearted a poet as Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	is '' Not ill-content to stand aside , To yield to minstrels fitter His singing-robes , his singing-pride , His fancies sweet and bitter . ''

		But alas !

		what younger minstrel of to-day is capable of wearing those robes with equal grace and honor ?

		Mr.Dobson 's verse in a new edition .

		1913 -RSB- 385 The ability to produce , as well as to enjoy , the sim - pler sort of poetry , wherein delicacy and tenderness of fancy are wedded to refinement and lucidity of form , seems to be fast dying out .

		Yet nevertheless it will probably be long before
Austin Dobson	PERSON	fails of his fit audience of `` thinking hearts , '' however few , whose feeling toward his poetry will always be akin to that which he has suggested in his lines on the thirteenth century missal , ' Then a book was still a Book , Where a wistful man might look , Finding something through the whole , Beating like a human soul . ''

		An American traveller in
India	LOCATION	.

		`` Who wants more books on
India	LOCATION	? ''

		With this rather daring challenge Mr.
M. M. Shoemaker	PERSON	opens his `` foreword '' to `` Indian Pages and Pictures '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- , and the reviewer has regretfully concluded that the attractive looking volume does not furnish a satisfactory answer to the rhetorical question .

		Of course
India	LOCATION	is always interesting , even when it is described superficially by a hurried traveller ; and no harm is done by a sketchy treatment of selected parts , unless the work is taken seriously by the author or the untravelled reader .

		But our present writer formally declares that he has tried `` to omit all with which the readers at home are so well acquainted , '' and ostentatiously passes over the
Taj Mahal	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yet he records all sorts of well-known things , and describes Fatehpur-Sikri and Akbar 's tomb in such a way as to make it frankly clear that he covered them both in the same day , which must have been a pretty strenuous effort in appreciation , even for one of our most active countrymen .

		Nor is it easy to see why page after page should be filled with the petty incidental annoyances of travel and shopping , or why the poor old `` P. & O. '' voyages should be rehashed to the extent of two chapters .

		Furthermore , the public surely has a right to expect that even a '' travel-and-place '' book should be well written , with the material decently organized , and with some attention to relevance .

		It is very discon - certing to have an attack on the Parsi disposal of the dead interjected into a peaceful chapter on `` Akbar 's Town of Victory . ''

		However , it is a pleasure to report that the reader will find many interesting chapters in the four hundred and sixty-seven pages of this volume .

		By far the most attractive are those dealing with the parts of the peninsula in which Mr.
Shoemaker	PERSON	and his party moved more leisurely .

		In the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	and
Kashmir	LOCATION	he had glorious possibilities , and he offers enjoyable read - ing under such captions as `` The Khyber Pass , '' '' Life on a ' Bed of Roses , ' '' '' The Vale of
Kashmir	LOCATION	, '' and `` Magnificent Shalimar . ''

		If he had been will - ing to take this part of his material , work it over carefully , and present it in a smaller volume , he would have deserved our gratitude .

		As it is , one can only say that our traveller has added a unit to the large number of readable but negligible books on
India	LOCATION	.

		The illustrations are strikingly good .

		The beaver , intellectually the most g ^ ed of rodents , if not indeed of all animal-kind , has a notable book devoted to his accomplishments and habits in Mr.
Enos A. Mills	PERSON	's finely-illustrated and thoroughly interesting volume entitled `` In Beaver World '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		For twenty-seven years Mr.
Mills	PERSON	has been a student of beaver life in all parts of
North America	LOCATION	where the animal was to be found , in all seasons of the year , and in conditions that allowed the most intimate and prolonged observation of the marvellous dam-builder and wood-cutter .

		`` Beaver have been my neighbors since I was a boy , '' he says .

		`` At any time during the past twenty-five years I could go from my cabin on the slope of Long 's Peak ,
Colorado	LOCATION	, to a number of colonies within fifteen min - utes ... Sixty-four days in succession I visited these colonies , three of them twice daily . ''

		Such close study has brought its reward in the discovery of certain beaver habits or accomplishments unre - corded by other naturalists .

		For example , this ob - server has on a few occasions seen the beaver sup - plement his ordinary carrying capacity by an adroit use of the curiously-flattened tail , which can be drawn between the hind legs and pressed against the belly in such a way as to hold a lump of mud or a small bundle of sticks .

		The beaver is man 's friend , the first of conservationists in point of time , a strict vegetarian , easily domesticated , and an agreeable and interesting pet when thus tamed and cared for .

		Few readers of Mr.
Mills	PERSON	's account of beaver habits and beaver industries can fail to agree with him in ascribing something very like reason to this remark - able rodent .

		Indeed , no less an authority than Mr.
Romanes	PERSON	, whom Mr.
Mills	PERSON	quotes , finds himself forced to grant that the beaver shows the possession both of `` faculties undoubtedly instinctive '' and of `` faculties no less undoubtedly intelligent . ''

		A bibli - ography of beaver literature in English , inconsider - able in quantity as yet , is appended by Mr.
Mills	PERSON	to his book , which itself will rank among the foremost works on the subject .

		That
Ruskin	PERSON	was one of the most kind and helpful and encouraging of men to anyone of earnest purpose who sought his personal counsel , is a fact of which , as time goes on , we are constantly receiving new proofs .

		The latest witness is provided in the beautiful quarto volume called `` Homes and Haunts of Ruskin '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Sir
Edward T. Cook	PERSON	, the editor and biographer of
Ruskin	LOCATION	, has supplied the letter-press ; but , as he explains in his preface , the book really owes its origin to the choice illustrations twenty-eight in color and sixteen in black and white , reproduced from drawings by
Miss E. M. B. Warren	PERSON	.

		When still a very young girl ,
Miss Warren	PERSON	had the benefit of art lessons , encouragement , and commissions from
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		After his death , she conceived the happy and pious idea of making an artistic pilgrimage in
Ruskin	LOCATION	's footsteps to the places where he had lived or which he had loved .

		Although
Ruskin	PERSON	did not travel In the footsteps of

May 1	DATE	widely , he knew a few places thoroughly .

		He was , by adoption , a child of the
Lake Country	ORGANIZATION	, as he himself puts it , `` a Cumberland-built soul '' ; as a child , he had two well-loved homes in
Scotland	LOCATION	; a year in which he did not see the mountains of
Switzer	PERSON	- land or of Savoy was considered i : ill-spent ; he had the artist 's eye for the pleasant lands of provincial
France	LOCATION	; and as for
Italy	LOCATION	, especially
Venice	LOCATION	, he may almost be said to have Discovered it to the modern world .

		Although attracted to
Venice	LOCATION	, in the first instance , by love of
Byron	PERSON	, his Venetian studies soon opened his eyes to the fact that
Byron	PERSON	's view of
Venice	LOCATION	was melodramatic and by no means accurate .

		The significance of art , and especially of architecture , as an historical document was what governed his own work and has made him the vade mecum of all visitors to
Venice	LOCATION	since .

		But , at the last , the first love conquered , he heard and obeyed the call of his own Lake Country .

		At Brantwood , on the shore of
Coniston Lake	ORGANIZATION	, he spent the
last thirty years	DATE	of his life ; in the churchyard , on the opposite shore , he rests , as he had wished it , `` beneath the crags of
Coniston	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		All of these places and many more are delightfully pictured by Miss
Warren	PERSON	and described by Sir
Edward Cook	PERSON	, in the present volume .

		A more fascinating book for
Ruskin	PERSON	lovers would be difficult to imagine .

		The horrors Mr '
Francis McCullagh	PERSON	, English war of a recent correspondent with the Italian army inglorious war .

		in
Tripoli	LOCATION	, and author of ``
Italy	LOCATION	's War for a Desert '' -LRB-
F. G. Browne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is no admirer of the Italian as a soldier .

		`` The Italian soldier is a poltroon , '' he roundly asserts . ''

		When not a poltroon he is an Anarchist or a mutineer . ''

		Mr.
McCullagh	PERSON	's book , `` dedicated to my colleagues and fellow-correspondents , British , German ,
Austro	PERSON	- Hungarian , Russian , and French , who were not afraid to tell the truth , '' is an emphatically anti-Italian ac - count of the late conflict between
Italy	LOCATION	and
Turkey	LOCATION	, illustrated and enforced by things seen and heard which certainly do not redound to the glory of those who undertook the `` pirate-raid , '' as
Hamilcar Cipriani	PERSON	himself designated the Tripolitan expedi - tion .

		Both the bone of contention between the two disputants was of little worth to
Italy	LOCATION	, the author declares , and the manner of its snatching from its ancient possessor was disgraceful and , in some of its details , unspeakably revolting .

		Incidents in plenty are supplied to prove the inhumanity of the invad - ing army but is war ever other than inhumane ?

		and the upholders of
Italy	LOCATION	's policy and practice in the whole affair will find themselves hard pushed to make out a good case for the defence .

		More than once is Mr.
Richard Bagot	PERSON	especially , whose recent book on `` The Italians of Today '' contains a warm word in deprecation of just such assaults as Mr.
McCullagh	PERSON	delivers , called to account for his alleged refusal to admit the truth .

		There are two sides to every question , of course , and readers of ``
Italy	LOCATION	's War for a Desert '' will do well to read also Mr.
Bagot	PERSON	and other writers of pro-Italian sympathies , although at best the sanguinary struggle for the possession of
Tripoli	LOCATION	can never be made to appear as anything but a deplorable mistake .

		Many illustrations from photographs , mute witnesses to the truth of Mr.
McCullagh	PERSON	's careful narrative , are to be found in the book .

		In the presence of momentous prob - lems > 8 '' ch as ' he Freedom f the Will or the Immortality of the Soul , shall mankind trust its intuition rather than its reason ?

		On ultimate analysis , does the tremen - dously expedient , the hypothesis of God , for ex - ample , prove to be the same as the actually true ?

		Is there any final relation between the `` will to believe '' and objective reality ?

		Can a belief whose falsity is recognized by keener intellects be justi - fiably and helpfully propagated among men and women of less enlightenment ?

		These and kindred questions are the subjects of discussion in ''

		Pragmatism '' in philosophy , `` Modernism '' and `` Anthropological Apologetics '' in religion , and the `` Syndicalist Myth '' in social morals are passed in searching review and con - demned in all their ramifications as phases of `` Ob - scurantism , '' theoretical or applied .

		Unquestionably many readers will lay the book aside as only another clever expression of agnosticism or materialistic realism .

		To others , and the present reviewer among them , these two volumes must seem to contain not only criticisms that are generally sound but also many suggestions that are constructively helpful .

		By thoughtful readers of either class the work will be pronounced the product of a pen that has achieved an admirable style , of a personality that is keenly alive to human problems , and of a ` cultivated mind that has an enviable knowledge of art and general literature , as well as of philosophic thought from the layman 's point of view .

		One will seldom take equal pleasure in reading five hundred controversial pages on similar themes .

		The volumes are pleasing in exterior form , with their simple binding and legible type ; but one notices an unpardonable number of slips in the proofreading , particularly in the quota - tions from French authors .

Toronto	LOCATION	:
William Briggs	PERSON	-RRB- .

		`` The thesis is herein maintained , '' he explains in his preface , `` that the public library in
Ontario	LOCATION	is historically and logically a part of the educational system of the Province '' a proposition not very difficult to prove , surely .

		In the author 's prelimin - ary historical sketch of the public-library movement in the world at large and in his own part of it in particular , the fewness of libraries in
Canada	LOCATION	outside of
Ontario	LOCATION	is brought to the reader 's attention .

		In fact , the public-library movement in
Canada	LOCATION	has until very recently confined itself to this more favored province , beyond whose borders there are probably not twenty-five Canadian free libraries .

		Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's second chapter discusses the purposes of the public library , then he considers its `` general activities , '' its `` special activities in relation to education , '' and finally some essentials to its success .

		Views and plans of a few recent library buildings , five in
Ontario	LOCATION	and one in

		Although , as in so much of library literature , there is in the book , perhaps necessarily and properly , a certain tendency to prove the obvi - ous and elucidate the self-evident , it is a handy little manual and conveys some information not too famil - iar to library workers on this side of the Canadian boundary .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Dr.
Herbert H. Gowen	PERSON	's `` Outline History of
China	LOCATION	'' -LCB-
Sherman	PERSON	,
French & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- probably covers the thousands of years of Chinese history as satisfactorily as the task could be accomplished in less than two hundred pages .

		It is to be questioned , however , whether the object for which the book was written could be attained in less than twice the space allowed .

		The author desired to interest American readers in the history of
China	LOCATION	prior to the modern period of European influence , but the limitation of space forces him to reduce his account dur - ing one half of that earlier period to a mere thread of dynasties and rulers .

		The latter half is more entertain - ing , and the writer could have added much to the respect of Americans for
China	LOCATION	had he enlarged his scope .

		Dr.
Henry Osborn Taylor	PERSON	's important and exhaustive work on '' Ancient Ideals , '' described in its sub-title as '' a study of intellectual and spiritual growth from early times to the establishment of Christianity , '' is now reissued in a second edition -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Originally published
seven years ago	DATE	, the work was reviewed in our issue of
June 16 , 1897	DATE	.

		Save for a few verbal changes , no revision has been attempted in this new edition , as the author feels that this '' might have impaired the equal temper and conviction which seem to me to give the book unity . ''

		Among the authentic collections of poems of the Civil War is a Southern piece written just after the close of the great struggle , entitled `` The Land Where We Were Dreaming . ''

		Its author was then a young Virginian , afterwards Judge
Daniel B. Lucas	PERSON	, whose recent death is commemorated by the publication -LRB-
Richard G. Badger	PERSON	-RRB- of a volume of his poems under the title of the one just named , which is the most famous and significant of his pieces .

		The volume is supplied with an apprecia - tive Introduction by Professor
Charles W. Kent	PERSON	of the
University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	; and some interesting Notes by the poet 's daughter ,
Miss Virginia Lucas	PERSON	, attest the filial devotion to which the appearance of the volume is doubtless due .

		Mrs.
Mary Ridpath-Mann	PERSON	, who claims her father 's love of history as an inheritance , has written a pleasant little account of four '' Royal Women '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- in support of her claim .

		The four women dealt with are
Queen Elizabeth , Mary Queen of Scots	ORGANIZATION	,
Marie Antoin	PERSON	- ette , and the Empress
Josephine	PERSON	.

		Each is treated very simply and very briefly , with no attempt to tell more of the life than is necessary in order to give a vivid picture of the personality .

		The book is so attractively written that it might be read with pleasure and profit even by those - if there were any such who had previously known nothing of these romantic lives .

		It owes its charm largely to the fact that the author has visited almost every locality mentioned , at least as far as
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	are concerned .

		The volume is illustrated with about fifty reproductions of paintings , photographs , etc. .

		In their volume of `` Representative Essays in Modern Thought '' -LRB-
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Messrs.
Harrison Ross Steeves	PERSON	and
Frank Humphrey Ristine	PERSON	have brought together nineteen more or less classic approaches to the most important phases of modern thought , ranging in point of time from Mill 's '' Of the Liberty of Thought and Discussion '' to Dr.
Charles Fletcher Dole	PERSON	's `` Truth and Immortality . ''

		In some instances both sides of a moot question are presented in opposing essays , as in the case of
W. K. Clifford	PERSON	's '' The Ethics of Belief '' and
William James	PERSON	's '' The Will to Believe , '' and in
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's '' Sweetness and Light '' and Huxley 's '' Science and Culture . ''

		The purpose of the compilers has been to provide a basis for composition which would '' serve the purpose of not merely developing a formal accuracy in writing , but of expanding the student 's ideas and increasing the number of his points of contact with vital questions . ''

		But a great many readers outside the classroom should welcome a volume which embraces so much material of the first importance , gathered from such scattered sources .

		388 THE DIAL , -LSB-

		A new refutation of '' The Baconian Heresy '' has been made by Mr.
J. M. Robertson	PERSON	in a volume to be published at once by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	'' No
Baconian	PERSON	can ever raise his head again after reading this book , '' assert the publishers , who are evidently not familiar with the
Baconian	ORGANIZATION	's peculiar psychology .

		In addition to the selection from
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	's cor - respondence now being made by Mr.
Arnold Haultain	PERSON	, we a.re also to have before long a volume of personal reminiscences by Mr.
Haultain	PERSON	to be entitled ''

		These reminiscences will deal with the
last twenty years of	DATE
Goldwin Smith	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		Quite the best thing in the '' The English Review '' for

		A second volume of collected essays by
William Graham Sumner	PERSON	is announced by the

		A complete bibliography will be appended to the work .

		As in the case of `` War and Other Essays , '' Professor
Albert G. Keller	PERSON	will act as editor .

		The Countess
Marie Larisch	PERSON	's forthcoming autobio - graphy , while somewhat in the nature of a chronique scandaleuse , is likely to prove of considerable legitimate interest .

		The author is a niece of the late Empress Elizabeth of
Austria	LOCATION	, being the daughter of
Duke Lud	ORGANIZATION	- wig of
Bavaria	LOCATION	, the favorite brother of the
Empress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	will publish the book immediately in an English translation entitled '' My Past . ''


Clarence Walter Ayer	PERSON	, librarian of the
Cambridge	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library since
1904	DATE	, died suddenly at his home on the
morning	TIME	of
April 12	DATE	.

		Teaching , library work , and music had been his chief interests since his graduation from
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1885	DATE	.

		A prof essorship of English at
Western Reserve University	ORGANIZATION	from
1892	DATE	to
1894	DATE	, the care of the reference department of the Har -
vard University Library	ORGANIZATION	for the following four years , and after that the post of librarian at the
Brockton	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library until
1904	DATE	, were the principal positions filled by him before assuming the duties which he was still discharging at the time of his death .

		Born at
Haverhill	LOCATION	in
1862	DATE	, he was cut off in the prime of his powers .


Lester F. Ward	PERSON	, one of the most widely known of American writers on scientific subjects , died
April 18	DATE	in
Washington	LOCATION	.

		He was born in
1841	DATE	, at
Joliet	LOCATION	, 111 .

		After serving in the Civil War , and graduating from
Colum	PERSON	- bian -LRB- now
George Washington -RRB- University	ORGANIZATION	, he went into government work first in the
Treasury Depart	ORGANIZATION	- ment , then with the geological survey .

		His published works include the following : `` Guide to Flora of Wash - ington and Vicinity , '' '' Dynamic Sociology , '' '' Sketch of Palffiobotany , '' '' Synopsis of the Flora of the
Laramie Group	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' Types of the
Laramie Flora	LOCATION	, '' '' Geographical Distribution of Fossil Plants , '' '' Psychic Factors of
Civ	LOCATION	- ilization , '' '' Psychological Basis of Social Economics , '' '' Political Ethics of Spencer , '' '' Principles of Sociol - ogy ? '' ''

		Outlines of Sociology , '' '' Sociology and Eco - nomics , '' and '' Pure Sociology . ''

		To the lay reader , the most interesting feature of '' The Hibbert Journal '' for
April	DATE	is Mr.
John Gals	PERSON	- worthy 's suggestive discussion of '' The New Spirit in the Drama . ''

		This new spirit is Sincerity `` fidelity to mood , to impression , to self . ''

		There is the usual strong array in this issue of articles on religious and philosophical subjects .

		We note in Mr.
John A. Hob	PERSON	- son 's essay , '' How Is Wealth to Be Valued ? ''

		an instance of misquotation good -LRB- or bad -RRB- enough to de - serve recording .

		Evidently wishing to quote
Brown	PERSON	- ing 's lines , '' Oh , the little more , and how much it is !

		And the little less , and what worlds away ! ''

		Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	gives us this poetic gem : '' A little more , and what a difference !

		A little less , and oh !

		what worlds apart ! ''

		The latest of several new periodicals devoted to the interests of poetry is '' Poetry and Drama , '' a quarterly edited by Mr.
Harold Monro	PERSON	and published from his Poetry Bookshop in
London	LOCATION	.

		The first issue , just put forth , makes an imposing appearance , and presents an interesting list of articles , reviews , and verse .

		Like its English contemporary , '' The Poetry Review , '' Mr.
Monro	PERSON	's venture aims more at discussion of poetry than the presentation of original verse .

		This plan
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 389 seems to us likelier to advance the interests of the muse than such exploitation of mediocre bards as has so far found too large a place in the poetry magazines pub - lished in this country .

		Unlike our own ventures , also , the two English reviews are dignified and handsome in appearance , as well as impeccable typographically .

		They deserve the cordial support of American poetry - lovers .

		News reaches us as we go to press of the death , on
April 27	DATE	, of
Andrew Sloan Draper	PERSON	, first commissioner of education in
New York State	LOCATION	, and for ten years -LRB- 1894-1904 -RRB- president of the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was born at
Waterford	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, in
1848	DATE	, gradu - ating from the old
Albany	LOCATION	academy and
Albany Law school of Union University	ORGANIZATION	.

		During his practice of law , lasting fifteen years , he served as member of the state legislature .

		In
1885	DATE	he was appointed member of the court of commissioners for the
Alabama	LOCATION	claims , and on conclusion of the commission 's work became state super - intendent of public instruction .

		This post he held for six years , then became superintendent of public instruc - tion in
Cleveland	LOCATION	, which position he left in
1894	DATE	to go to the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	.

		The highest educational post
New York City	LOCATION	had to offer him after the unification of the boroughs he declined after election , leaving
Illinois	LOCATION	only to take the work as the head of the
New York	LOCATION	state schools .

		For more than ten years he had been a mem - ber of the board of
United States Indian Commissioners	ORGANIZATION	.

		Besides numerous published addresses , he was the au - thor of `` The Rescue of
Cuba	LOCATION	'' and `` American Edu - cation . ''

FEANCIS FISHER BROWNE	PERSON	, founder of THE DIAL , and its Editor from the first issue -LRB-
May	DATE	, 1880 -RRB- to the present , died at
Santa Barbara	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	, on
May 11	DATE	, after a long illness .

		A sketch of his life and work , with a supplemental reproduction of a recent portrait , will be given in our next issue .

		THE PUBLISHER AND THE READER .

		Book publishers naturally wish to sell their books , and , as a rule , we believe that they wish to publish the best books that can be sold at a reasonable profit .

		They have not yet , for the most part , sunk to the level of those newspaper publishers who avow no higher aim than that of providing `` what the public wants , '' or what a mean conception of its tastes makes them think it wants .

		Even in their case , we fancy that the wish , rather than any exhibition of the public 's real desire , is father to the thought .

		A book publisher is doubtless glad when his list is found to contain a best-seller , but deep down in his consciousness there is a feeling of disgust at the public taste which has thus singled out a work which he knows to be vastly inferior to many others on his list .

		And his satisfaction in the pecuniary returns from the sale of this rubbish lies not so much in the dollars that it supplies as in the knowledge that these dollars will enable him to keep on publishing his other and better books , even at a loss .

		Many are the publishers who have undertaken costly ventures based upon the intrinsic merit of the works alone , and meaning at the best returns so slow and scanty as to make their publication a long uncertainty , if not a certain final deficit .

		Such a publisher neither repines nor grumbles ; he simply casts about for enough popular stuff of the kind that sells to keep his business afloat , and permit him to continue his indulgence in the luxury of doing a real intellectual service to that part of the public which can appreciate it .

		Mr.
George P. Brett	PERSON	, in some notes on pub - lishing recently contributed to `` The Atlantic Monthly , '' informs us that , whereas in
1901	DATE	402 THE DIAJL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	eight thousand volumes were produced in this country , the number became thirteen thousand in
1910	DATE	, and seems to be steadily increasing .

		This is not surprising , in view of our increasing population , but it is surprising to learn that the book trade is not appreciably greater in volume than it was ten years ago .

		The book-reading public seems to be '' a more or less constant one in point of numbers , '' not appearing to `` grow in proportion to the general growth of the popu - lation , '' and especially '' its growth is not nearly commensurate with the growth of the population in education and wealth , with the accompanying increase in leisure and general culture . ''

		If this is so , the publisher is an object of pity , for the gross amount of his sales must be applied to a fifty per cent increase of his costs .

		The author is in similar case , because he must now write three books to earn the royalties that formerly accrued from two .

		Yet neither publisher nor author is discouraged to the point of giving up , and the fecundity of the latter continues to be amazing .

		Of his output , '' The printed part , though far too large , is less Than that which yet unprinted waits the press , '' for Mr.
Brett	PERSON	informs us that `` the number of books that appear in print is usually only about two per cent of the total number of manuscripts submitted to the publishers for examination . ''

		This must mean , we fancy , what one publishing house does with works offered it , not taking into account the fact that the rejected ninety-eight per cent go the rounds until many of them at last grope their way to the daylight .

		One who knows what traps are baited for unwary ama - teur authors , and what incredible stuff actually conies to an imprint , is loath to believe that there still remains a submerged forty-nine fiftieths of all the `` literature '' that gets as far as the manuscript or type - written stage .

		Obviously , the publishers as a class have their choice between two courses of action .

		Either they should cut down the number of their books until they publish no more of them than the stationary reading public will buy in quantities assuring a reasonable profit , or they must con - trive means to enlarge that public .

		It is cap - able of indefinite enlargement , if only one knew how to set about the task .

		The essential prob - lem is that of the distribution of books , and to this Mr.
Brett	PERSON	mainly directs his attention .

		Of course , there is advertising , but few publishers seem to have learned how to advertise with dis - crimination and effectively .

		The hit-or-miss methods now in vogue do not accomplish the desired purpose , and the waste resulting from advertisements in the wrong places is enormous .

		Contracts are made with hundreds of news - papers which exert no appreciable influence over the public that desires to read books ; and these advertisements , although cheap in terms of money , are dear in relation to the returns from them . ''

		My eyes have become trained , '' says Mr.
Brett	PERSON	, '' until I think I can say that I never see the advertisements in my morning newspaper .

		Perhaps this is a peculiarity of mine , but I suspect it is becoming general with the public . ''

		Of course , advertising in the better class of magazines , and in the journals largely devoted to literature , is another matter ; they make a special appeal to the book-buying public , and their advertisements of books are a part of their reading contents which every subscriber would miss were it not generously furnished .

		The writer deplores the fact that good books are no longer helped on their way , as they formerly were , by being made the subjects of general conversation .

		Once , `` there were , in considerable numbers , among the general public , book-lovers whose chief delight consisted in the discovery of the new author and the new book of merit .

		The discoverer would tell all his friends of his find , to the great advantage of the publisher and author .

		Many a dinner-table in these days was made pleasant by such book - ish talk .

		It is , alas , very rare to-day .

		The late
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	, the last time the writer saw him in
New York	LOCATION	, remarked that he had not heard a book mentioned at a dinner-table for several years . ''

		The last statement is ex - tremely significant , and means a noteworthy decline in the intellectual interests of society , for it will hardly be urged that the subjects of the conversations that formerly had to do with books have anything like the same stimulating intellectual quality .

		Automobiles and airships and athletics are not exactly the themes that en - courage readers of the sort we wish to multiply .

		The conditions of our feverish modern life do not tend to produce serious readers , and it is a wonder that the number of them remains even stationary .

		There are too many distractions , especially for the young , who regard sitting down with a book as extremely `` slow . ''

		More - over , the reading matter that is brought to their attention consists mostly of snippets , and what reading habits they form are hardly worth ac - quiring .

		The picture supplants the printed page , and the faculty for serious reading becomes atrophied . ''

		The kinematograph is one of the most powerful energies yet devised for the de - bauchery of our common stock of imagination , ''
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 403 says `` The
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' and it is probable that this evil more than counterbalances the educational benefits that the prevalence of the moving-picture bestows .

		The illustrated sec - tions of the newspaper catch the child 's atten - tion , and keep it from the dull columns of print that might contribute to his fund of knowledge and his power of thought .

		The popular maga - zine is for him first a picture-book , next a story book , and last of all an agency for the cultiva - tion of his mind .

		The degenerative process begins in the home at a very early age the age in which our more fortunate elders were reading the Hollo books and the injury has become almost irreparable before the parents realize that the plague has fastened itself upon their offspring .

		There is little hope of recon - stituting a reading public like that of the last generation when neither the home nor the school does its duty by the young in guarding their minds from the sources of infection .

		Mr.
Brett	PERSON	has not much to offer in the way of constructive suggestions .

		He thinks that books ought to be published at lower prices , and blames their authors for refusing to accept re - duced rates of royalty .

		Here his logic is clearly at fault , for there is no reason why a fifty-cent book should not bear the same rate as a two - dollar one .

		Suppose the experiment be made of republishing a book in a cheap edition at one - fourth of the original price , is there any suffi - cient reason why the same ten or twenty per cent of the lower price should not be ear-marked as the author 's share and allowed for in the estimates of cost ?

		Classified card-catalogues of the reading public , as prepared by many pub - lishers here and abroad , are recommended as a means of calling the attention of individuals to the works in which they are likely to be inter - ested .

		This is undoubtedly better than indis - criminate advertising , and we may expect it to come more and more into use .

		The postal authorities now discriminate against books in two ways , in favor of magazines and miscellan - eous merchandise , and this is an evil that surely ought to be remedied .

		Perhaps the most im - portant thing that the publishers should work for is the rehabilitation of the book store , which is rapidly becoming extinct .

		But the funda - mental thing is to educate the public to realize that a house without books is an unfurnished house , and that a household of children who do not see books read and hear them familiarly discussed every day is a household that is neg - lectful of its paramount duty to itself and to the rising generation .

		A REPUBLIC OF BOOKS * The average man , the man who does not read anything but newspapers , thinks of books as the sealed packets of an exotic intelligence , which it will not do him much good to open .

		He knows nothing of the fine salt-reek in the pages of
Hakluyt	LOCATION	, or the hearty strain of the ballad-book , '' It fell about the Lammas tide When the moor-men win their hay . ''

		But by this neglect he leaves unused his sixth sense , that which quickens all the others , that which can add rooms to his house and a region to his brain .

		If over-night he has been in
Nantucket	LOCATION	with the American Farmer , De Crevecceur , or walk - ing the
Edinburgh Canongate	ORGANIZATION	with Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	, he has a fresh vista to his street when he turns out in the
morning	TIME	.

		In this faith , some six or seven years ago , we set out to build our new republic a Library-in - Being , that should have in view throughout the play of literature upon life .

		It did not signify where we began , so long as we took for the begin - ning a handful of live books , authors who had stood the racket of time and the changes of fashion .

		Once chosen , their elective affinities would do the rest .

		We pitched , as it happened , first on
Boswell	PERSON	, since his Doctor
Johnson	PERSON	is not only a man , but a whole tract of human nature , with
London	LOCATION	and Fleet Street for a background , and the
Big Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	for a sign .

		A better inductor to the commonwealth than Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	could hardly be desired .

		As we read his biography , he starts up in the book , more alive than most of us who think we live .

		One
Monday	DATE
morning	TIME	, to be exact
October 4 , 1779	DATE	,
Boswell	PERSON	relates how he went to see the Doctor before he was yet out of bed .

		`` He sent for me to his bedside , '' says
Boswell	PERSON	, and seemed `` as pleased as if he had been in the gaiety of youth , and called out briskly , ` Frank , go and get coffee and let us breakfast in splendour ! ' ''

		A few days later and a little discussion of the Art of Coaxing a Fire leads to a piece of folk-lore , and to the aphorism , `` Be as wise as you can . ''

		This is from the life , and human nature is re-kindled in the page .

		Another page , and Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	recommends to
Boswell	PERSON	a
Greek Lexicon	ORGANIZATION	, a translation of the first book of the Iliad , and
Hesiod	ORGANIZATION	.

		In fact , while he was a great viveur , a man who lived for life , and never book - ish in the dull way , he loved a cordial writer , said '' the chief glory of every people arises from its au - thors , '' and waxed eloquent over the life and death of words , `` some budding , some falling away . ''

		We did not wish , however , to construct a Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	Academy of Letters , nor a
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	group in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		We tried to keep in mind the sort of young man who once wrote confidentially to say that '' his specialty was the universe . ''

		So we went * This article , written by the editor of `` Everyman 's Library , '' is a statement of the editorial plan and purpose of that enterprise .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	on boldly , knitting up antiquity with our new time , and adding
Athens	LOCATION	to
Boston	LOCATION	, and
Emerson	LOCATION	to my
Lord Verulam	LOCATION	, and in our second relay contrived even to make near neighbors of that most engaging book of wit and wisdom , `` The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table , '' and
Plato	PERSON	's `` Republic . ''

		From the last-named work we took a parable , that of the transcendent thirst , the desire in the soul for something more than meat or drink .

		There are authors who create this thirst , and if biography is specially good for the purpose , so is fiction .

		Your real novel is an admirable incentive : familiar his - tory itself , it leads to history .

		We soon had Balzac on the list , opening the great human comedy as he conceived it with his
Peau de Chagrin	ORGANIZATION	, which is the fable of Everyman 's strife with death and time ; just as Everyman looks for his own plight of memory and age in
Rip Van Winkle	LOCATION	or in
Colonel Newcome	LOCATION	.

		Balzac holds a master-key to the treasury of the republic .

		What did he say in the confession of faith that opens his encyclopaedia of human nature ?

		`` I attach to common everyday facts and acts of mere individual lives , and to their causes and prin - ciples , the importance which historians have hitherto ascribed to the events of public national life . ''

		He expanded this idea in constructing his history .

		He wished , in fact , to construct a republic all of his own making .

		`` My work , '' said he proudly , `` has its geography , as it has its genealogy and its families , its places and things , its heraldry , its nobles and commoners , workmen and peasants , senators and dandies ; its army , too , in short a whole world of its own . ''

		What Balzac tried to do in his single discharge , it ought to be possible to carry out , we thought , in the wider circles of human interest .

		Take
Pepys	PERSON	's Diary , for instance .

		There is a book that is centrif - ugal : you do not get far in its pages without being infected by the gossip 's curiosity .

		What of the plays he went to ? ''

		Bartholomew 's Fair , '' by
Ben Jonson	PERSON	, which he saw more than once ; or
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	's `` Philaster , '' or
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's `` Twelfth Night . ''

		Pepys , though living under
Charles II.	PERSON	, and aware of
Nell Gwynn	PERSON	, did very well as a citizen of the lit - erary commonwealth .

		And it was easy , while the theatres were in demand , to move from English to Greek drama .

		^ Eschylus ,
Sophocles	LOCATION	,
Euripides	LOCATION	, had followed as a matter of course , and we presently found it necessary to put Ibsen by
Euripides	LOCATION	.

		We would have followed Aristophanes with
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, and
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	with
Synge	PERSON	, but for re - strictions of copyright , against which the free spirits that are in books mutiny in vain .

		But we were able to map out other town-lands with some completeness .

		We could have
Grote	PERSON	's ``
Greece	LOCATION	, '' and
Finlay	PERSON	's , to eke out our spiritual
Athens	LOCATION	.

		We could build around
Gibbon	PERSON	's `` Rome '' with
Sismondi	PERSON	's `` Italian Repub - lics , '' and
Macchiavelli	PERSON	could have his vital supple - ment and counterblast in
Mazzini	LOCATION	.

		As the scheme developed , it became clear that the value of the structural idea on which it was ultimately to rest had not been exaggerated .

		Our silent republicans were in their way very effective .

		They made their colony in every quarter of the known world .

		They seemed of themselves to make their own groups and installations , as if to reaffirm
Emerson	PERSON	's theory of a new dynamic quality of mind that travelled by day and night , moving in concentric circles .

		By their law of interfusion , the spirit in each great author found out its congenial spirit in another , and the acquisition of truth and .

		reality in any one quarter was proved `` so much good to the commonwealth of souls . ''

		The one portion of the commonalty which we feared the average man was most likely to neglect was that of Philosophy .

		Everyman finds something alarming in the idea of
Plato	LOCATION	, something disturbing in the mere notion of taking up a book by
Rene * Descartes	PERSON	.

		Yet who that lights on an account of the life
Descartes	PERSON	spent as a soldier in the Low Countries camp life with a mixture of fighting and high thinking is satisfied to pause there ?

		A page of military strategy , leading on to a question of the structure of the stars and the divine proportions of the human body , may serve to kindle curiosity ; and then the reader , if he have any intellectual spunk , will be bound to explore the '' Meditations '' and the '' Discourse on Method '' for himself .

		In
1619	DATE	, the author of those works joined the army of
Maximilian	PERSON	on the
Danube	LOCATION	, and there , he tells us , he passed the greatest day of his life , '' being full of enthusiasm and having discovered the basis of true science . ''

		That is a personal revelation to draw the spirit of a Descartes close to those other free spirits , books and men , on whose effect the fortune of the literary state , invisible and spiritual , rests .

		From Descartes it is an inevitable step that takes one to a volume of
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	, or to a Bishop
Berkeley	LOCATION	who saw the external world as dependent for its very exist - ence upon the ideal .

		To compare
Berkeley	LOCATION	's '' New Theory of Vision '' with the pages in which Rene ''
Descartes	PERSON	discussed the ideas of corporeal and incor - poreal substance and the ideas of place and space is to arrive at a new sensation of the world by which man is environed , and the modes by which he is con - ditioned .

		On this base of relative authors , with what may be called Literary Architecture , or something akin to it , we reared our expanding walls .

		To go to
Rome	LOCATION	in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's ``
Julius Caesar	PERSON	, '' or to
Paris	LOCATION	in
Balzac	LOCATION	's '' Ce * sar Birotteau , '' to take up the '' Little Flowers '' of St.
Francis	PERSON	, or the Speeches of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, was clue enough , we believed , to bring any man and every man within the structural lines .

		And once within them he was lost , or saved .

		The silent republicans had him at their mercy .

		He must submit to their law , and become wise as
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, multiple as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, impulsive as
Burns	PERSON	, in spite of himself .

		This conspiracy against the literary diffidence of the huge public was associated very closely with the two main ideas that lay behind the whole scheme : One , that Everyman -LRB- the typical sensual `` Modern Man '' of Whitman 's poem -RRB- should be able to turn to
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 405 the Library for his congenial or predestinate Book and find it there .

		The other , that every Book should have its correlatives , and its copesmate , in the struc - ture .

		This may seem to breathe an air of trans - cendentalism ; but in fact it is only another way of applying the democratic idea in the literary arena .

		We consulted the crowd , and believed in the instincts and the appetite of men and women for sheer intel - ligence .

		Let them touch the live circuit anywhere , and the spark must do its work .

		They might turn , hoping only for sensation and the breath of Russian anarchy , to a novel like
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	's `` Virgin Soil '' or Dostoieff sky 's `` Crime and Punishment . ''

		That would do the business .

		A single
Dumas	PERSON	book would serve to open , although with something of melo - drama , the tremendous roll of the French Revolu - tion , and so involve the unsuspecting reader in
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and then in
TeufelsdrOckh	ORGANIZATION	and in
Goethe	LOCATION	.

		A speech of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's might be the key to
Grote	PERSON	and the spent democracy of
Greece	LOCATION	; and an essay of
Lowell	LOCATION	's induct the Elizabethans , and they in turn the theatre of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, and the Ibsenites and new Pittites .

		The live book and the play of literature upon life , we held by these ; and it almost seems now that our belief in our
Academe	LOCATION	or Republic is and will be assured .

		ERNEST RHYS .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		ONE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GREAT POET , but who yielded to the force of circumstances and the influence of environment and became a distinguished prose-writer instead , has since his death been made the subject of warmest eulogy for his poetic gifts , and has called forth expressions of regret that he had not devoted himself entirely to that department of literature in which he was qualified to excel .

		Mr.
J. B. Yeats	PERSON	, recalling his own student days at
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	,
Dublin	LOCATION	, says in a letter to the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' : '' It seems but yesterday that I was an anxious student in
T. C. D.	LOCATION	, where the two Dowdens -LSB-
Edward	ORGANIZATION	and
John	PERSON	-RSB- shone the brightest stars in the undergraduate sky .

		Have all our hopes been fulfilled ?


Edward Dowden	PERSON	has written prose classics .

		He has given us but one small volume of poetry , yet all his love went out to that slender book .

		He once told me that when he wrote poetry he did it secretly and could not do it otherwise .

		For in the
Ireland	LOCATION	that he knew , men did this kind of good deed by stealth .

		It is so no longer .

		Thanks to the Irish literary movement , modern
Nationalist Ireland	LOCATION	, from which he shrank and which shrank from him , is now a land of poets .

		The orators are out of commission . ''

		From the same authority we learn that as a student
Dowden	PERSON	had `` a certain girlish distinction and purity , '' that he continued to the end `` an extremely handsome man , '' that `` he looked the poet and primarily was the poet , '' and that '' in any other age than that of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	, and in any country not wholly given to oratory , as was then the case with
Ireland	LOCATION	,
Dowden	PERSON	would have written poetry and left prose to others . ''

		But the silent , self-contained scholar and dreamer '' allowed himself to become a speaker from political platforms .

		To see his distinguished figure among the politicians was to me a dreadful sight . ''

		Further , it was his close application to his books in college , and his brilliant success in all competitive examina - tions , that stunted the poet in him .

		Also , he mar - ried early , and too much domesticity may have clipped the wings of song .

		Finally , as we are told , ``
George Eliot	PERSON	, whose admirer he was , completed the mischief .

		This woman author , with her chilly east wind of science and agnosticism , was a wintry frost to all of us , in those far-away days . ''

		Still , when all is said , poets are born and not made or unmade ; and no power on earth can suppress the divine frenzy in a man when it once gets possession of him .

		... THE HATED NEOLOGISM , like the poor , is always with us , even though the neologism of one genera - tion may become the archaism of the following .

		A spoken language is a living thing and stoutly refuses to become fixed , which is fortunate ; but nearly everyone has enough of the conservative in his nature to resent at first the ousting of a good old word by a saucy ^ ipstart of yesterday , or the wanton ascription of a new meaning to an old word when the language is already well supplied with accepted terms to express the desired meaning .

		For ex - ample , many who are not yet old will recall the introduction into our daily speech of the verb `` conserve '' in the sense of to husband or econo - mize etymologically correct enough , but striking the ear at first as an unnecessary or somewhat pedantic substitution .

		By this time , of course , we have heard so much about conservation and conser - vationists that we are reconciled to the word and its derivatives .

		A much more recent and less war - rantable innovation is the use of '' consistently '' for `` constantly , '' or , in plain Anglo-Saxon , `` always . ''

		The other day there appeared , editorially , in one of the three newspapers recognized as foremost of Amer - ican journals the following sentence referring to the late movement toward arming ocean liners : '' It is to be said that
England	LOCATION	has consistently opposed such transformation at sea , but was unable to get its view adopted at the second Hague peace confer - ence in
1907	DATE	. ''

		Was there in the writer 's mind any notion of consistency or inconsistency in En - gland 's opposition ?

		Possibly , but the probability is that the adverb is simply journalese for `` always . ''

		Another instance , of even less ambiguity , occurs in Mr.
Noel Buxton	PERSON	's late book entitled `` With the Bulgarian Staff . ''

		Speaking of
Bulgaria	LOCATION	's secrecy in preparing for war , and of her conveying of false impressions concerning her military strength , the author says : `` It was consistently announced that the Bulgarian army , which , on a peace footing , numbered some 60,000 , could be increased in war to 300,000 . ''

		In reality this announcement was 406 THE DIA1 , -LSB-
May 16	DATE	inconsistent with the actual facts , for the total mus - ter numbered 430,000 .

		What the writer meant , then , was `` constantly , '' or , better , `` repeatedly , '' or perhaps '' persistently , '' or '' insistently , '' but surely not `` consistently . ''

		By what perversity or incon - sistency was he led to choose just the wrong adverb when the right one lay so ready to his hand ?

		A STEP FORWARD IN LIBRARY LEGISLATION is about to be taken by
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, the first State to establish a public library commission .

		At present writing a bill is before the legislature , and is likely to have become law before this is printed , for the appointment of an agent to assist libraries in their work with immigrants .

		Mr.
Charles F. D. Belden	PERSON	,
State Librarian	ORGANIZATION	and President of the
Massachusetts Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, is the moving spirit in this enterprise , which of course has the hearty sup - port of the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	as a whole and as individuals .

		During the past
winter	DATE	that body has concerned itself especially with the work of libraries among the foreign-born classes , and the need has been increas - ingly felt of a special agent or officer to give his or her time and study to the questions connected with such work .

		`` Provision should also be made , '' urges Mr.
Belden	PERSON	, `` for occasional assistance from com - petent representatives of the non - English-speaking races in different localities for lectures and addresses , and for other incidental expenses . ''

		The bill pro- vides that the `` foreign agent , '' as the proposed officer seems to be called for brevity 's sake , shall be appointed by the
Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, with the con - sent of the Governor , for a term not exceeding five years , and that an annual appropriation not exceed - ing five hundred dollars shall be made to meet the incidental expenses connected with the agent 's work .

		Like the commissioners , the agent will receive for his services a reward not reckoned in dollars and cents .

		The consciousness of having helped to fit for citizenship some hundreds or thousands of our alien population will be better than gold from
Uphaz	LOCATION	or silver from
Tarshish	LOCATION	.

		THE SINCERITY OF THE NEW DRAMA , about which Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	discourses understandingly and en - joyably in the
April	DATE	`` Hibbert Journal , '' is regarded by him as its characteristic and all-important feature , though not the feature most likely to secure imme - diate commercial success . ''

		Not till the heavens fall will the majority of the Public demand sincerity , '' he feels bound to admit .

		Conventional clap-trap and mock heroics we all know to be what appeals most unfailingly to the gallery , and indeed , as a general rule , to the balcony , the orchestra chairs , and the boxes .

		`` The Greater Public will by preference take the lowest article in art that is offered to it , '' he re - marks , with a Ruskin-like despair at the degeneracy of the people 's taste ; but he still believes that `` if a better article be substituted , the Greater Public very soon enjoys it every bit as much as the article re - placed , and so on up to a point that we need not fear we shall ever reach .

		But from this it is not to be inferred that ` new dramatists ' are consciously trying to supply the Public with a better article .

		Not those who are sincere , anyway .

		Oh , no !

		A man could not write anything sincere with the eleva - tion of the Public as incentive .

		If he tried he would be as lost as ever were the Pharisees making broad their phylacteries .

		He can only express himself sincerely by not considering the Public at all . ''

		Then follows a variation of the well-known advice of Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	to the writer , and afterward this hopeful view of the `` new '' dramatist 's future : `` Novelists , it is true , even if they have not been taken too seriously by the people of these islands , have for a long time past respected themselves ; but the calling of a dramatist till quite of late has been but an invertebrate and spiritless concern .

		Whipped by the Censor , exploited by the actor , dragooned and slashed by the manager , ignored by the Public , who never even bothered to inquire the names of those who supplied it with digestives it was a slave 's job .

		Thanks to a little sincerity , it is not now a slave 's job , and will not again , I think , be - come one in this country . ''

		A new safeguard of the self-respecting dramatist is found in the increas - ing vogue of plays , '' sincere '' plays , as literature .

		Not merely the closet drama , but the stage drama is being read , is taking rank as literature , because the authors are learning to be faithful to themselves in other words , to be sincere .

		EDITORSHIP AS A PROPAEDEUTIC TO AMBASSADOR - SHIP receives no stinted commendation from the editor of `` The Forum , '' who , in commenting on Mr.
Page	PERSON	's recent appointment as ambassador to
England	LOCATION	, says : '' He could have had no better train - ing for his new duties than is afforded by the edi - torial chair of one of the greater periodicals ; and after the diplomacy that is sometimes necessary in such a position he will find his work in
London	LOCATION	superlatively easy . ''

		In recent times this particular post has been held by a number of able men of edi - torial training .

		Lowell occupied the editorial chair of `` The Atlantic Monthly '' from
1857	DATE	to
1862	DATE	, and was joint editor with
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	of `` The North American Review '' from
1863	DATE	to
1867	DATE	.

		Mr.
Hay	PERSON	, besides serving as editorial writer on the
New York	LOCATION	'' Tribune , '' assumed the duties of editor - in-chief during
Whitelaw Reid	PERSON	's absence in
Europe	LOCATION	in
1881	DATE	.

		Mr.
Reid	PERSON	himself had large editorial ex - perience , beginning with the
Xenia	LOCATION	`` News , '' which he conducted in 1858-59 , and ending with the great metropolitan journal which he edited and owned in later life .

		Mr.
Page	PERSON	's editorship of the `` Atlantic '' from
1896	DATE	to
1899	DATE	was preceded by five year 's ex - perience as editor of `` The Forum '' -LRB- whose present editor errs in placing Mr.
Page	PERSON	's
Boston	LOCATION	labors be - fore 1891 -RRB- and followed by a dozen years ' superin - tendence of `` The World 's Work . ''

		Certainly the editor of any successful newspaper or periodical has to make himself a master of the suaviter in modo and the fortiter in re if he is to achieve the best results .

		Having done that , it may well be that the
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 407 more or less ornamental functions of a foreign am - bassadorship become to him a thing of little diffi - culty , even if not , as the '' Forum '' editor expresses it , '' superlatively easy . ''

		THE COURAGE OF ONE 'S LITERARY LIKES AND DISLIKES is an admirable thing .

		For this we value
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	, and the more because his pre - ferences and prejudices generally commend them - selves as well-grounded , as based on the eternal veri - ties , so far as we have learned to know those verities .

		It is true that personal preference is often an unsafe criterion , and most of us hesitate to trust it implicitly .

		No such weakness , however , is discernible in Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's summary dismissal of Professor
Bergson	PERSON	in his -LRB- Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's -RRB- recent delightful volume , `` Among my Books . ''

		The eminent French - man might feel hurt were it not that
Plato	PERSON	is dis - missed with equal curtness in the same sentence ; and to be ejected through the same door with the author of `` The Republic '' is honor enough for one man .

		In this distinguished company also a third name -LRB- no one would guess whose -RRB- is included .

		The English critic 's words are as follows : '' I care for
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's metaphysics as little as I care for the rhap - sodical gammon of Professor
Bergson	PERSON	or Miss
Marie Corelli	PERSON	who used to be so sorry for poor Satan . ''

		In fairness it should be added that Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	pays proper tribute to
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's literary charm , credit - ing him with '' the most exquisite prose style ever devised by the genius of man . ''

		Another passage from the same book may well be cited in this con - nection .

		After expressing a preference for
Cole	PERSON	- ridge ,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, among modern poets , the writer says : '' I see all the beauty of
Keats	PERSON	, of
Swinburne	LOCATION	,
Rossetti	PERSON	, and others whom it is the fashion to praise , I think , in needless superlatives ; but for my own enjoyment I require sustained and original Thought , and not merely melodious phrase and luscious images .

		Thoughts , ideas , appeals to mind or action , are the essence of poetry as of all other kinds of composi - tion .

		And sweet songs about nothing in particular do not long hold me .

		Again , they who offer Thoughts without music should write in prose , not in verse . ''

		THE RAILROAD SERVING THE LIBRARY , and also lending itself to the larger purposes of educational enlightenment , is an edifying sight .

		From the
Minnesota Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	's monthly '' Library Notes and News '' we take the following : `` Results from the traveling libraries placed on the Educational train which toured the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	part of the state
Nov.	DATE	5-20 are shown in the following statement .

		Of the forty-five towns visited seven already had traveling libraries twenty - five libra - ries were placed at stations along the route , and ten more at adjoining towns .

		Nine towns have , as yet , no libraries .

		In some instances more than one library was placed at the same shipping point , but serving totally different communities .

		According to this count a total of forty-seven stations were added to the traveling library map . ''

		On another page of the same issue it is reported that a large increase in the demand for reference books for temporary use , in various parts of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, bears evidence to the need of a parcel post that shall carry such books to and fro at the same rate that it now carries other packages .

		More and more the wonder grows that books should ever have been excluded from the benefits of the parcel post or , rather , it would grow were it not so well known that the collective stupidity of any legislative body always greatly exceeds the sum of the individual stupidities of its constituent members .

		The whole is sometimes greater than the sum of all its parts .

		THE UNSOPHISTICATED LITERARY GENIUS , in all the sublimity of his unsophistication , has never been better portrayed than by Mr.
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	, twenty years ago , in his book , '' Mere Literature , '' a collection of essays now republished in a limited edition that is pretty sure to find a ready sale .

		In the essay on `` The Author Himself '' occurs the de - scription we have in mind : `` The man thrown early upon his own resources , and already become a con - queror of success before being thrown with the literary talkers ; the man grown to giant 's stature in some rural library , and become exercised there in a giant 's prerogative before ever he has been laughingly told , to his heart 's confusion , of scores of other giants dead and forgotten long ago ; the man grounded in hope and settled in conviction ere he has discovered how many hopes time has seen buried , how many convic - tions cruelly given the lie direct by fate ; the man who has carried his youth into middle age before going into the chill atmosphere of blase sentiment ; the quiet , stern man who has cultivated literature on a little oatmeal before thrusting himself upon the great world as a prophet and seer ; the man who pro- nounces new eloquence in the rich dialect in which he was bred ; the man come up to the capital from the provinces these are the men who people the world 's mind with new creations and give to the so - phisticated learned of the next generation new names to conjure with . ''

		A LIBRARIAN 'S VALEDICTORY closes the forty - eighth annual report of the
Detroit Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Henry M. Utley	PERSON	, appointed Librarian in
1885	DATE	, and since
last November	DATE	holding the honored posi - tion of Librarian Emeritus , thus expresses himself in looking back over his quarter-century and more of distinguished service in
Detroit	LOCATION	: '' In closing my final report , I may be indulged in a passing refer - ence to the Library 's wonderful growth and develop - ment in the
last quarter	DATE	of a century .

		This marked and unexpected change in the institution and the character of its work amounts to a revolution .

		No one then could have foreseen its nature and extent .

		This was not merely an expansion along previously well-defined lines : it was radical and fundamental in its quality and characteristics .

		This change in 408 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	the significance of librarianship is unquestionably due to the influence of the
American Library Asso	ORGANIZATION	- ciation , which was organized during the
Centennial Exposition	ORGANIZATION	in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	in
1876	DATE	.

		That Exposi - tion was responsible for many changes in American life and thought , marking the beginning of an era .

		Nowhere is this more distinctly seen than in the library field . ''

		Recalling his intercourse with the leading early members of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	many of them now no longer with us he says : '' These men were the incarnation of the modern library spirit .

		To be associated with them was in itself a liberal education . ''

		ALERTNESS TO READERS ' NEEDS is plainly discern - ible in certain innovations introduced at the
Los Angeles Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two attractive lists of '' Books on Domestic Science '' and '' Books on the Building Trades , '' the latter critically annotated , and each bearing an appropriate pictorial design on the cover , are issued by the Library , and contain a goodly showing of its literature on these subjects .

		Efficient methods of distribution are used to place these lists in the hands of those most likely to profit by them , even the grocer 's delivery wagon being pressed into service to awaken the people to a con - sciousness of things worth knowing .

		Not long ago it was suggested in these columns that motion pic - tures might advantageously be used in familiarizing the public with the free library 's existence and activities ; and now there comes to us the following announcement from Los Angeles : '' We are using the motion picture slide method , and find that it reaches a large circle of people who do not other - wise seem to be informed of the library 's existence .

		We have out about fifteen slides in various theatres , the proprietors of which are cooperating with us by showing these without any expense to the library . ''

		If the inhabitants of
Los Angeles	LOCATION	do not henceforth make the best and fullest use of their library , they will show themselves quite undeserving of a library .

		A PREMIUM ON CLASSICAL SCHOLARSHIP IS Vir - tually what the new rules governing admission to
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	amount to .

		Fewer '' units '' of preparatory work will be required of those who qualify them - selves in both Latin and Greek than of other appli - cants ; and thus , apparently , it is hoped to encourage the study of
Virgil	PERSON	and Homer and
Cicero	PERSON	and Demosthenes .

		Not the worthiest incentive this to the cultivation of the classics ; but the difficulties of Greek and Latin , as compared with those of German and French and the rudiments of science , are cer - tainly such as to justify the concession made to those who choose the old-time rigors rather than the latter - day '' soft '' studies of college preparation .

		It may well be more difficult , even now , to enter college on fifteen and one-half '' units , '' including Latin and Greek , than to fill up the sixteen and one-half required of the non-Grecians .

		But , after all , exter - nal stimuli to the study of any literature , whether ancient or modern , will never go far toward inspir - ing a love for that literature as all will admit who pause to look back on whatever of compulsion was brought to bear on their own youthful inclination concerning the literature of their own tongue .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		A FREQUENT MISUSE OF THE COMMA .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Of all the marks of punctuation , the comma , it is said , has the least power ; and yet its misuse may cause no end of trouble and misunderstandings , even lawsuits .

		For example : quoting the opinions of three authors named , a writer gave only two bibliographic references .

		Of course the query at once arose whether -LRB- 1 -RRB- two of the authors were coworkers in one essay or report ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- if so , which two ?

		Or -LRB- 3 -RRB- were there three articles , one by each of the three authors , the bibliographic reference to one having by mistake been omitted ?

		The publication of the paper was thus delayed for several days , a number of letters between three cities were required , and a deal of bother and expense followed before the matter was finally and correctly understood .

		The correction of the misuse or nonuse of a comma was necessary to avoid a far greater expense and bother , at some later time , as well as to give an author his proper place and honor .

		Because , omitting the important matter of bibliographic references , it is clear that Sea ,
Pond	LOCATION	and Soil conveys a different significance from Soil ,
Pond	LOCATION	and Sea , while a third variant is Sea ,
Pond	LOCATION	, and Soil . ''

		Philosophers such as
Bergson	PERSON	and
James	PERSON	, and
Schafer	PERSON	and
Henderson	PERSON	, '' means one thing , while other placings of commas would suggest de - cidedly different meanings .

		When Dean
Alford	PERSON	said , '' The great enemies to understanding anything in our language are the commas '' was he not a teacher of indiscrimination ?

		His killing of a thousand of these '' enemies '' in the Greek text of the New Testament may have been both '' war '' and '' magnificent , '' but fortunately our English translation was left unattacked .

		In illustration of such differences in the uses of the comma let me quote from
John Wilson	PERSON	's '' Treatise on English Punctuation . ''

		The first edition was published in
1826	DATE	, the third in
1855	DATE	, and the twenty-sixth in
1871	DATE	.

		In
America	LOCATION	, therefore , the proper use of the comma has had sufficient authority , vogue , and time to become fixed .


Wilson	PERSON	says : `` In a series of words , all of the same part of speech , a comma is inserted between each particular , '' and some of the illustrations given are these : Industry , honesty , and temperance are essential .

		A brave , pious , and patriotic prince .

		Happy is the man who honors , obeys , loves , or serves his Creator . ''

		Some punctuators , '' adds
Wilson	PERSON	, '' omit the comma between the last two particulars , when united by either of the conjunctions and , or , nor .

		But the propriety of using the comma will perhaps be obvious to anyone who examines the nature of such sentences : for the last two words of a series are not more closely connected in sense and construction with each other than with the preced - ing words ; as Infancy , childhood , youth , manhood , and age are different stages in human life . ''

		-LRB- There follow certain explanations , examples , and exceptions , which need not be copied here . -RRB-

		In other words , the last and ,
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 409 or or , or nor may not at one time serve both for the omitted comma and the conjunction .

		The '' Manual of Style '' of the
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
December , 1912	DATE	-RRB- disposes of the matter in the same way .

		The `` Style Book '' of the
Government Printing Office	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	has nothing in regard to the question .


Orcutt	PERSON	's `` The Writer 's Desk Book '' fails to notice that besides and , nor and or also require the comma before the last of a succession of three or more words .

		Despite the usual assent to this rule by most author - ities treating of the rules of punctuation , there is an astonishing lack of this correct and indicated usage on almost every page of American and English books , mag - azines , newspapers , etc. .

		One may hardly say that either the rule , or its opposite , is more frequently illustrated by our best American printers and writers ; nor may one be very dogmatic as to the preponderant habit of the contrasted Americans and English .

		I have collected hundreds of illustrative instances , and , glancing over them , it would seem that , while all are sinners , as a rule the best authors of
England	LOCATION	-LRB- or their printers and proof - readers -RRB- have more frequently adopted the right and discriminating use of the comma than have we Americans .

		But , for instance , quoting the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	'' Rules for Compositors , '' the '' Encyclopaedia
Britan	LOCATION	- nica '' says : `` The comma separates clauses , phrases and participles , '' thus inexcusably omitting the comma after phrases .

		In our own ``
Webster	PERSON	's
New Interna	LOCATION	- tional , '' under `` Comma , '' we read : `` to set off words , phrases , and clauses that are independent , parenthetical , or appositional , '' thus happily and twice illustrating the proper rule in its own definition .

		It also quotes : '' the virtues of faith , hope , and charity . ''

		It need not be added that this commended use of the comma is that constantly exemplified in our New Testament .

		And yet so general has been the American lapse in '' punctiliousness '' that one of
America	LOCATION	's great scholars , a producer , during fifty years , of exquisite literary masterpieces , was a thoroughgoing stickler for the omission of the comma before '' and '' '' or '' and '' nor , '' connecting the last two links in a sequence of three or more ; or all the links in a series of greater length , or where each individual link consists of several words .

		And this , although he thus mistakenly gave his readers and pupils to understand that '' the last two words of such a series are more closely connected in sense and construc - tion with each other than with the preceding words . ''


Atlantic City	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	,
May 5 , 1913	DATE	.

		IN DEFENSE OF `` POETRY . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Your correspondent 's sweeping indictment of '' Poetry '' and all its works , in your last issue , almost leaves me no ground to stand on .

		However , I still find room enough to question Mr.
Wallace Rice	PERSON	's right to the tripod . ''

		The editors who have never before edited '' are less to be dreaded than those who have edited too much .

		Mr.
Rice	PERSON	has edited so many anthologies among them , '' The Little Book of Brides , '' The Little Book of Kisses , '' '' The Little Book of Sports , '' that the keen edge of his judgment as an authority on poetry is some - what worn . ''

		English poetry has no subtle rhythm , '' he drones , apparently quite unconscious that this state - ment is a declaration of ineligibility to the office of critic of poetry .

		It is as if some critic of painting , con - genitally color-blind , should announce that there is no difference between green and blue .

		Mr.
Rice	PERSON	then gets on safer ground .

		Poetry , like every other Art or art , he solemnly asserts , is con - cerned with form as well as substance ; it is the metrical arrangement of words to express beauty .

		To deny this is to deny poetry the possession of a technic , to deny the technic of ascertained metre unchallenged through thirty centuries .

		No , we do n't deny that '' poetry is concerned with form as well as substance '' all that we deny is Mr.
Rice	PERSON	's competence to discern form .

		We do n't '' deny poetry the possession of a technic , '' though we are compelled to deny his narrow conception of poetic technic .

		We hardly know what he may mean by '' the technic of ascertained metre unchallenged through thirty centuries , '' as he can hardly be familiar with all the languages of the earth since ancient
Egypt	LOCATION	, or with the vast history of human quarrels on the sub - ject of poetic technic since first the devil said , '' Is it Art ? ''

		Indeed , we doubt if he knows as much on the subject as Mr.
Pound	PERSON	, who has devoted some years to an exhaustive study of metrical forms and variations on the poetry of eleven languages .

		We have no intention of defending Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's poetry .

		Quite competently it defends itself ; as Mr.
Rice	PERSON	says , he '' may be left to the court of appeal the years will hale him before , if he survives . ''

		Meantime , as the years are long in coming , '' Poetry '' will not be able , either in his case or those of other adventurously modern poets , to sit on the fence of tradition until the verdict of time is pronounced .

		That would be the safe course , doubtless ; we commend it to those who always think that the last word has been said . ''

		And there is so much for it -LSB- that is , the magazine -RSB- to do by a maintenance of the standards ! ''

		AN INADVERTENT CRITICISM OF
NEW HAMPSHIRE	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I wish to call your attention to an error in the review of the
Russell Sage Foundation Publication	ORGANIZATION	entitled '' A
Comparative Study of Public School Systems	ORGANIZATION	in the Forty-eight States , '' in your issue of
February 1	DATE	.

		In commenting on the table showing the amount of money paid annually for schools for each hundred dollars ' worth of wealth in the state , your reviewer has evidently read the abbreviation `` N. M. '' incorrectly , which has led him to make a very unjust criticism of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	.

		Even if the statement were correct , the writer of the article should have recognized that this table taken by itself is of little value .

		A very wealthy state with few children might be paying out a small percentage of its wealth for schools , and at the same time be paying a large amount per pupil .

		The latter consideration is of course the important one .

		EARLY SCENES ix A GJREAT AVAR DRAMA .

		* The tyranny of timeliness constrains both book-publishers and newspaper-proprietors to get their printed product to market while the topics to which it refers are still in the bloom of their first freshness .

		The six volumes named in the subjoined footnote are with one exception written by journalists war correspondents whose eagerness to score what in their own dia - lect is known as a `` scoop '' sometimes exceeded their caution in the avoidance of error .

		It is still too early to undertake to point out just where each of these enterprising and capable writers , viewing necessarily but a restricted portion of the great war scene , has gone astray ; but certain striking instances of mutual contra - diction in two or more of the narratives can be cited as sufficient proof that their every detail should not be accepted as gospel truth .

		We know , too , that unusual obstacles were placed in the path of the war correspondent by both Balkan and Turkish authorities , so that he was treated more like a prisoner of war than like a peaceful gatherer of news , and what information he did obtain may well have been mixed with error for which he was hardly responsible .

		Moreover , as is well enough known , modern military tactics , with modern smokeless powder and artillery of long and accurate range , tend to make a latter-day battlefield something very different from the thrilling spectacle of waving banners and clashing arms with which we pic - ture to ourselves a Crecy or a
Bannockburn	LOCATION	.

		A British officer confirms what Lieutenant
Wagner	PERSON	says of `` the emptiness of the battle - field '' by his statement that though he served through nearly the whole of the Boer War , he never , in all the battles in which he fought , actually caught sight of the enemy , nor ever * WiTH THE VICTORIOUS BULGARIANS .

		saw even a puff of smoke to indicate the enemy 's position .

		When the men asked what they should aim at , they were likely to be told to aim at the sky-line , on the off chance of hitting a Boer on the crest of some distant ridge .

		Is there cause for surprise , then , that no single war correspondent at the front can furnish a complete and correct account of military move - ments ?

		But while the books here brought to the reader 's attention are largely based on such imperfect information as is obtainable by the journalist , and are issued with all possible celer - ity , one exception is to be noted in the modest volume prepared by Mr.
Noel Buxtou	PERSON	, who went to the East as agent of the Balkan War Relief Fund , and afterward , with evident deliberation and care , put into writing the more noteworthy of his impressions and of the facts gleaned by him in the advantageous position of one attached to the
Bulgarian General Staff	ORGANIZATION	.

		In addition to his present work , `` With the Bulgarian Staff , '' two chapters of which have already appeared in `` The Contemporary Review '' and `` The Nine - teenth Century , '' Mr.
Buxton	PERSON	has published a book on ``
Europe	LOCATION	and the Turks , '' which shows at least his intelligent interest in Balkan affairs in their political aspects .

		From the later work , which makes the reader acquainted with Bul - garian character and Bulgarian patriotism , we quote a passage referring to the Bulgarian commander-in-chief . ''

		There is a massive quality about SavofiP which denes description : the head large ; the figure not dispropor - tionate , and yet a short man ; genial , yet apart , with an air of large condescension ; potentially social , but pre - occupied : a man to inspire confidence .

		He reminded me of nothing so much as that rare type of Englishman , born a squire but by nature a leader of men , occupied with great affairs , but when at home joining the crowd of commonplace people , shooting or hunting or golfing , without claiming special regard . ''

		Lieutenant
Hermenegild Wagner	PERSON	, special correspondent of the
Vienna	LOCATION	`` Reichspost '' and the
London	LOCATION	`` Daily Mail , '' gives to the public a book of considerable size and pretensions , well illustrated and provided with maps , and full of interesting and often instructive matter .

		The first half of `` With the Victorious Bulgarians '' sketches the events leading up to the war and introduces the Bulgarians to the reader ; the second half relates the author 's exploits as an exceedingly alert war correspondent , and gives as many details concerning the progress of the campaign as could have been expected from any one pen at that time .

		Indeed , somewhat less of fulness and variety in the author 's report might
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 411 have inspired greater confidence in his accuracy .

		But of this there will be a word to say later .

		His splendid confidence in himself , valuable in his hazardous and difficult undertaking , shows itself especially in his concluding chapter , '' My Experiences as a War Correspondent , '' in the course of which he says : `` The secret of my successful activity as a war corre - spondent one result of which is that in various ways I have had to experience the hostility of some of my less successful colleagues is , I confess , to be sought in the circumstance that I was able to bring to bear upon my task more certain guarantees of success than any of my competitors could command .

		Above all , I was a perfect master of the Bulgarian language .

		The son of an engineer , I grew up among the
Balkans	LOCATION	, and as a boy learned to speak Bulgarian ,
Servian	ORGANIZATION	, and Bosnian .

		Though a native of
Vienna	LOCATION	, I thus obtained such a knowledge of the ways and thoughts of the southern Slavs as one can not acquire from any books , or any amount of study in later life . ''

		Mr.
Cyril Campbell	PERSON	witnessed some incidents in the autumn campaign as special correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	`` Times , '' and his book , `` The Balkan War Drama , '' is a part of the fruit of his journalistic labors at and near the front , especially with the Servian forces .

		Its chapters on the political crisis in
Servia	LOCATION	and the early military movements of the Servians are especially informing .


Bulgaria	LOCATION	's part in the tremendous struggle also receives attention .

		Noteworthy is the fact that while most of the accounts of the war lay emphasis on the alleged Turkish atroci - ties , Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	all but denies that there were any such atrocities .

		Toward the end of his book he says : '' That the Turks have committed atrocities in the past is undeniable ; that atrocities have been committed in this war is equally undeniable , and that the Turks have taken part in some of these atrocities is possible .

		But it must be remembered that so far there is no direct proof .

		At the moment when the talk of atrocities and massacres of innocent people by retreating Turks was at its height , during the second week of the war , the following telegram reached
Belgrade	LOCATION	from the Servian front , after having passed and obtained the sanction of the official censor : ` The further progress is made , the more certain it is that the atrocities are due to the Arnauts and not to the Turks . '

		The Arnauts know nothing of
Berne	LOCATION	or
Geneva Conventions	ORGANIZATION	, and wage war in their own sweet fashion . ''

		Already in this book , which seems to have left its author 's hands
last November	DATE	, there are prophecies of the contentions among the allies which were sure to follow close upon the attain - ment of their purpose in the clash with their common foe .

		In `` The Balkan War , '' by Mr.
Philip Gibbs	PERSON	.

		special correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	'' Graphic '' with the Bulgarian army , and Mr.
Bernard Grant	PERSON	, special correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily Mirror '' with the Turkish army , is presented a well-proportioned account of opera - tions on both sides , as comprehensive and trust - worthy as it could be made in the very heat of the actions which it describes .

		But it modestly and wisely disclaims finality , and confesses the insuperable obstacles which its authors had to contend against in their quest for information .

		It also makes clear that the war drama is not all acted out on the battlefield , that '' it is a drama of innumerable small acts of courage , of fear , of hardship , of misery , of horror , of despair , when death itself , so enormous a tragedy in ordin - ary life , becomes a commonplace familiar thing , so that living men hardly turn their heads to glance at those who fall dead ; when death , so terrible in days of peace , is indeed , to many men , a welcome gift , ending the sufferings that are unendurable '' and that it is a drama of much else besides .

		No early book of the war has in so small a compass more of what the reader wishes to know .

		Its illustrations are many and good , its map useful though small .

		A view of the war from the Turkish side only is furnished by Mr.
Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett	PERSON	, special correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily Telegraph , '' aided by his brother , Mr.
Seabury Ashmead-Bartlett	PERSON	. ''

		With the Turks in
Thrace	LOCATION	'' is a generous octavo , well printed and illustrated , and probably the fullest and best of the few accounts of the great conflict written by those correspondents who were fortunate enough to get within the Turkish lines before the Moslem forces were scattered like chaff by the onrushing Balkan troops .

		The book abounds in informa - tion unfamiliar to most readers , and in more or less exciting incident .

		More than once Lieu - tenant
Wagner	PERSON	's accuracy as a reporter is im - pugned , and instances , some of them if not all corrected in his book , are cited to show that his zeal occasionally outstripped his knowledge ; but in the circumstances he is perhaps not beyond pardon .

		In contrast with the impressions of Turkish cruelty toward defenceless Christians which both Lieutenant
Wagner	PERSON	and other writers give us , the following concerning the reputedly ferocious Redifs is of interest : '' Poor , gentle and kind-eyed , courteous Anatolian Redifs !

		You were starving and disorganized , and yet we marched with you all the way from
Lule Burgas	LOCATION	to
Chataldja	LOCATION	, rather more than 140 miles , without a pass - port or any other paper to show who we were , and with a cartload of equipment and stores , and none of you ventured to molest us .

		We were Christians , and
King Ferdinand	ORGANIZATION	had proclaimed a Holy War , and yet one of you offered to share his last crust of bread with us , 412 THE D1AJL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	because we gave him a drink of water .

		Nor did we see you massacre and ill-treat Christians or mutilate their women-folk , although , when you were starving , they used to shut their doors in your faces and refuse to give you of the food which they possessed in plenty .

		Their flocks also you left untouched in your extremity , and their chickens and their corn .

		Few European armies would have behaved in such a gentle and forbearing manner as you .

		Few races could show such a spirit of tolerance . ''

		A spirited account of personal adventure with the Turkish forces , up to the armistice of Dec - ember 3 , comes from the pen of that experienced war correspondent , Major
Lionel James	PERSON	, who , in the service of the
London	LOCATION	`` Times , '' was one of the few of his craft to witness the great bat - tle of
Lule Burgas	LOCATION	and to learn the real causes of the Turkish defeat .

		As a corrective to such glowing reports of uninterrupted Bulgarian victories as too easily obtained circulation from sources subject to Bulgarian censorship , his book , `` With the Conquered Turk , '' will sup - ply a real want .

		Photographs and drawings and maps help to make vivid and also more clearly intelligible his interesting narrative , which deserves far more extended notice than is here accorded to its merits .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		A SCIENTIST 'S HOPE FOR HUMANITY .

		* Among all the phenomena of this revolu - tionary era of ours , nothing is more striking than the ever-increasing significance of science as a factor in the upward struggle of humanity .

		At a time when idealism , worn with the futile striving of centuries , had almost begun to despair , she finds within her hands a sturdier staff than any she has yet leaned upon ; at a time when the voices of faith had all but deserted her , she catches a clearer and more heartening word than any that has before reached her ear .

		Her old enemy has taken on the guise of a savior .

		Science , the despised and the rejected , is laying the solid foundations beneath her tottering dream-towers , and is giv - ing her at last a definite hope for the future .

		To any who are skeptical of this '' serene evangel of science , '' as it has just been happily termed , f we earnestly commend the reading of two books Mr.
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	's `` The Task * SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL , PROGRESS .

		By
Alfred Russel Wallace	PERSON	,
O.M.	LOCATION	, D.C.L.
New York	LOCATION	:
Cassell & Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		t By Dr.
F. B. R. Hellems	PERSON	, whose article under this title in the
May	DATE	'' Forum '' is the most thoughtful and significant magazine contribution of the month .

		of Social Hygiene '' and Dr.
Alfred Kussel Wallace	PERSON	's `` Social Environment and Moral Progress . ''

		The former work was discussed at length in these pages
several months ago	DATE	.

		Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	's volume , just published , is of even greater importance .

		The author 's position as co-discoverer with
Darwin	PERSON	of one of the most momentous theories in the history of thought , his venerable age , his wide scientific knowledge and deep philosophic insight , lend to his utter - ances an authority such as could be claimed by no other living writer .

		On the occasion of his ninetieth birthday , celebrated recently , Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	startled his journalistic interviewers by the statement that there has been no perceptible advance in mo - rality throughout the entire historical period of mankind , that the present social structure is radically defective from top to bottom , and the present social environment the worst in history .

		There are many who would like to dismiss this indictment as the fatuous wail of a superannu - ated pessimist ; but to do so would be merely to demonstrate one 's own fatuity .

		From such a source , it constitutes a challenge to civilization that demands the closest and most impartial examination .

		In the book now published , Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	outlines the historical and scientific data upon which are based his conclusions as to the past , as well as his hope for the future .

		In the first section of his volume , after estab - lishing definitions of such terms as morality , moral progress , character , etc. , the author de - votes several chapters to suggestive historical evidences which have led him to conclude that '' There has been no definite advance of morality from age to age , and that even the lowest races , at each period , possessed the same intellectual and moral nature as the higher .

		The manifestations of this essentially human nature in habits and conduct were often very diverse , in accordance with diversities of the social and moral environment .

		This is quite in accord - ance with the now well-established doctrine that the essential character of man , intellectual , emotional , and moral , is inherent in him from birth ; that it is subject to great variation from individual to individual , and that its manifestations in conduct can be modified in a very high degree by the influence of public opinion and systematic teaching .

		These latter changes , however , are not hereditary , and it follows that no definite advance in morals can occur in any race unless there is some selective or segregative agency at work . ''

		What this required selective agent is , and how it will automatically come into action when society is sufficiently purged to give it play , we are told later on .

		The five chapters which conclude this Histor - ical section are given over to a specific arraign -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 413 ment of existing social and economic conditions .

		It is in substance just such an impeachment as the Marxians have been hurling at our heads for decades ; yet rarely has even the most devout Marxian attained to Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	's vigor and thoroughness of denunciation .

		Social devel - opment during the nineteenth century is thus summarized : `` We see a continuous advance of man 's power to utilize the forces of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, to an extent which surpasses everything he had been able to do during all the preced - ing centuries of his recorded history . ''

		We also see that the result of this vast economic revolution has been almost wholly evil . ''

		We see that this hundredfold increase of wealth , amply sufficient to provide necessaries , comforts , and all beneficial refinement and luxuries for our whole population , has been distributed with such gross injus - tice that the actual condition of those who produce all this wealth has become worse and worse , no efficient arrangements having been made that from the overflow - ing abundance produced all should receive the mere essentials of a healthy and happy existence . ''

		We have seen huge cities grow up , every one of them with their overcrowded , insanitary slums , where men , women , and children die prematurely as surely as though a body of secret poisoners were constantly at work to destroy them . ''

		We see thousands of girls compelled by starvation to work in such an empoisoned environment as to produce horribly painful and disfiguring disease , which is often fatal in early youth , or in what ought to have been , and what might have been , the period of maximum enjoyment of their womanhood .

		And to this very day no efficient steps have been taken to abolish these conditions . ''

		We see millions still struggling in vain for a suffici - ency of the bare necessaries of life -LRB- which in their misery is all they ask -RRB- , often culminating in actual starvation , or in suicide , to which they are driven by the dread of starvation .

		Yet our Governments , selected from among the most educated , the most talented , the wealthiest of the country , with absolute power to make what laws and regulations they please , and an overflowing fund of accumulated wealth to draw upon , do nothing , although more people die annually of want than are killed in a great war , and more children than could be slaughtered by many Herods . ''

		And while all this goes on in the depths , where ' Pale anguish keeps the heavy gate , And the Warder is Despair ' a little higher up , among the middle-men distributors of the necessaries and luxuries of life , bribery , adultera - tion and various forms of petty dishonesty are rampant . ''

		And higher yet , among the great Capitalists , the merchant Princes , the Captains of industry , we find hard taskmasters who drive down wages below the level of bare subsistence , and who support a more gigantic and widespread system of gambling than the world has ever seen .

		`` And , finally , our administration of what we call ' Justice ' -LRB- and of which we are so proud because our judges can not be bribed -RRB- is utterly unjust , because it is based on a system of money fees at every step ; because it is so cumbrous and full of technicalities as to need the employment of attorneys and counsel at great cost , and because all petty offences are punishable by fine or imprisonment , which makes poverty itself a crime while it allows those with money to go practically free . ''

		Taking account of these various groups of undoubted facts , many of which are so gross , so terrible , that they can not be overstated , it is not too much to say that our whole system of society is rotten from top to bottom , and the Social Environment as a whole , in relation to our possibilities and our claims , is the worst that the world has ever seen , '' As an editorial in the `` Call '' or the `` Clarion , '' all this might be dismissed with the old phrases sweet in the mouth of privilege and selfishness .

		But as the deliberate utterance of the foremost living scientist of our day , it is rather more difficult to dispose of .

		The second part of Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	's volume is labelled '' Theoretical , '' and deals almost wholly with the workings of the evolutionary law , in particular reference to social progress .

		We are shown how natural selection , which through the ages has moulded the infinitely varied animal forms into harmony with their environment , is in the main nullified or neutralized in its effect on the human organism by man 's reasoning faculties .

		Thus it is that the higher nature of man , both intellectual and moral , has remained practically stationary throughout history , owing to the lack of a selective agency adequate to increase it .

		Such an agency is available in sexual selection , which if given free scope in a normal social environment would `` elevate the race to whatever degree of civilization and well - being it is capable of reaching in earth-life . ''

		Sexual selection will be the prerogative of woman , and therefore woman 's position '' in the not distant future will be far higher and more important than any which has been claimed for or by her in the past . '' ''

		While she will be conceded full political and social rights on an equality with man , she will be placed in a position of responsibility and power which will render her his superior , since the future moral progress of the race will so largely depend upon her free choice in mar - riage .

		As time goes on , and she acquires more and more economic independence , that alone will give her an effective choice which she has never had before .

		But this choice will be further strengthened by the fact that , with ever-increasing approach to equality of opportunity for every child born in our country , that terrible excess of male deaths , in boyhood and early manhood especially due to various preventable causes , will disappear , and change the present majority of women to a majority of men .

		This will lead to a greater rivalry for wives , and will give to women the power of rejecting all the lower types of character among their suitors .

		`` It will be their special duty so to mould public opinion , through home training and social influence , as to render the women of the future the regenerators of the entire human race . ''

		The old '' biological argument '' so often used against the suffragists will be a weapon not altogether safe to handle after this !

		414 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	But sexual selection can never become oper - ative until we have cleansed the Augean stables of our present social organization .

		The root - causes of evil must be attacked and vanquished , cooperation must be substituted for competi - tion , and economic brotherhood for economic antagonism ; we must see to it that private monopoly of land and capital , as well as private inheritance of wealth , is done away with .

		All remedies for existing conditions , Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	concludes , may be condensed into one general proposition : '' That it is the first duty -LRB- in importance -RRB- of a civ - ilized Government to organize the labor of the whole community for the equal good of all ; but it is also their first duty -LRB- in time -RRB- to take immediate steps to abolish death by starvation and by preventable disease due to insanitary dwellings and dangerous employments , while carefully elaborating the permanent remedy for want in the midst of wealth . ''

		And his final word to the reader is this : '' The well-established laws of evolution as they really apply to mankind are all favorable to the ad - vance of true civilization and of morality .

		Our existing competitive and antagonistic social system alone neu - tralizes their beneficent operation .

		That system must therefore be radically changed into one of brotherly cooperation and coordination for the equal good of all .

		To succeed we must make this principle our guide and our pole-star in all social legislation . ''

		Any summary of such a far-reaching argu - ment , in space so scant as this , must of necessity be almost hopelessly inadequate .

		But perhaps we have faintly suggested something of the book 's unique significance in correlating the seemingly diverse paths of biological and eco - nomic progress , in lending the sanction of science to the struggle for freedom which mil - lions of men and women are carrying forward throughout the world .

		It comes with an au - thority too high to be impugned ; it conveys a message of too grave import to be ignored .

		Not to read and earnestly ponder such a message is little short of a sin against the future .


WALDO R. BROWNE	PERSON	.

		GREEK ARCHITECTURAL REFINEMENTS .

		* That the Greek architects should have rested content with so limited a number of forms , repeating not only the dispositions but even the most minute details of their temples sub - stantially unchanged from generation to gen - eration , can not fail to be a frequent source of astonishment .

		The conviction deepens with * GREEK REFINEMENTS .

		Studies in
Temperamental Architecture	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
William Henry Goodyear	PERSON	,
M.A. Illus	PERSON	- trated .

		New Haven :
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		study , however j that these limitations were self - imposed , and went far to make possible a su - preme perfection and subtlety of design which could scarcely have been attained had not the full attention of the artist been freed from the cruder problems of invention and construction .

		That the Greeks ' rejection of the arch , for instance , was not the result of ignorance , the walls of
Pergamon	LOCATION	and Assos abundantly testify .

		Though the hostility of tradition to the arch and objections to it on the ground of impermanence must be given full weight , allowance must also be made for a wish to adhere , in architecture as in life , to a simple well-understood type , through which alone the eternal desire for the good might hope to approach its consummation .

		To what plastic modifications of the appar - ently rigid temple-forms the search for infinite perfection in the finite could lead in the course of centuries , Mr.
William H. Goodyear	PERSON	's `` Greek Refinements '' now thoroughly elucidates to the general public for the first time .

		The gradual refinement of the proportions in successive periods , the subtle swelling of the columns , have long been given their true value even in ele - mentary manuals .

		The curvature of the hori - zontal lines , the inclination of the verticals , and the systematic variations in the diameter and spacing of the columns , however , although their existence has been generally acknowledged since the publication of
Penrose	ORGANIZATION	's exact measurements of the Parthenon in
1851	DATE	, have been subject to long controversy , and to popular misinterpreta - tion that has even found its way into some care - ful works .

		The recent discovery , finally , of intentional irregularities in the plans of a num - ber of classic temples analogous to those more readily to be observed in mediaeval buildings has still awaited a general appreciation .

		Mr.
Goodyear	PERSON	assumes the concurring belief of the reader in the original existence of all these subtleties , and dismisses the continued skepticism of
Josef Durm	PERSON	with a rehearsal of two of the more forcible arguments for authenticity , and citations from
Penrose	LOCATION	and from
Koldewey	LOCATION	and
Puchstein	LOCATION	.

		Although
Durm	PERSON	's contentions as to the poor preservation of the monuments at
Athens	LOCATION	, at
Segesta	LOCATION	, and at
Corinth	LOCATION	, the pos - sible effect of earthquakes , and so on , are met here only by counter assertion , the weight both of evidence and of opinion in favor of the intentional character of the departures from mechanical regularity is very great .

		The various theories that the curvature of the horizontal lines was adopted to correct certain optical illusions are readily shown to be untenable 1913J THE DIAL by means of more recent evidence of curves pre - cisely contrary in effect to the curves on which the theories were based .

		Especially the current superstition that the lines were curved up in the centre in order to counteract an optical effect of sagging is attacked from all points , not only as contradicted by lines curved inward in the centre , which produce this very impression , but as devoid of any competent optical authority , and , for the lines above the eye , as contrary to the actual effect on the retina .

		The ground is thus cleared for the presentation of the only explanation acceptable where the phenomena discovered are so various , '' that the classic hor - izontal curvatures were temperamental refine - ments inspired by the sentiment of beauty and artistic preference . ''

		This conclusion is fortified by quotations at length from a variety of authors , architects , archaeologists , and historians of art , testifying to the superior artistic value of the curves in comparison with straight lines , and to the effect of '' breathing life '' with which they endow the structures .

		That this alone suffices to account for their origin will be easily believed by artists , to whom dislike of the rigid - ity and formalism of straight lines is readily intelligible .

		It is conceded that some of the devices result in an increase of the apparent size of the build - ing .

		The lack of any features in the Greek Doric order which would indicate the true size , indeed , doubtless has a similar effect .

		Those familiar with the architect 's method of approach to his problem , however , will agree that it is unlikely that this would have been the first pur - pose and real aim of the designer .

		The adop - tion of the entasis , almost universally recognized as aesthetic in purpose , offers a far more vital analogy .

		A further extension of such aesthetic purpose is made , which will meet with less general ac - quiescence .

		The departures from equality in apparently corresponding dimensions , found especially in the early temples of
Magna Graecia	ORGANIZATION	, are also ascribed to artistic preference .

		There can be no doubt that some of these variations were not accidental , for instance the fre - quently greater thickness of the columns on the two fronts of temples , in comparison with those on the sides .

		That such inequalities were intended as refinements , and not enforcedly adopted in the effort to secure some relation desirable for other reasons , may perhaps still be questioned .

		Modern designers are frequently forced to introduce similar variations into their work on other than aesthetic grounds .

		On the other hand , the demonstration of unsystematic variations far exceeding the conceivable margin of mason 's error shows that the Greek architects were indifferent to exact mathematical equality of dimensions , and lends color to the belief that , as in so many mediaeval structures , `` the tolera - tion of asymmetry was an expression of the same artistic spirit which devised the definitely planned refinements . ''

		The value of the book , confessedly but a prologue to the author 's projected work on mediaeval refinements , lies chiefly in its sum - mary of the present state of our knowledge of the Greek buildings , and in its assemblage and discussion of widely scattered opinions con - cerning them .

		The measurements which Mr.
Goodyear	PERSON	himself has made have previously been published elsewhere .

		Here for the first time , however , are published many of the im - portant photographs taken by the
Brooklyn Institute Museum	ORGANIZATION	surveys .

		Moreover , the effort here made to ascribe irregularities of dimension to positive artistic preference is the first which has been attempted for classic buildings .

		The arguments are not in all cases so cogent that other considerations might not be urged which might supplement or qualify the theories advanced .

		One may suggest , for instance , that by the curvatures , inclinations , and modulated distances , the symmetry of the temple front is made far more powerful and organic .

		Instead of being a uniform row of columns , capable of curtailment or of indefinite extension , the facade is given a beginning , a middle , and an end an object surely as desir - able as to give life to individual lines .

		One is somewhat inclined to take exception to the extension of the meaning of `` refinements '' to include every sort of departure from regularity , and of the use of `` asymmetry '' to designate de - partures which may operate actually to accentu - ate the correspondence of opposite halves , which the word symmetry most frequently denotes .

		There is some looseness , also , in the language used to describe psychological experiences .

		To say of a truly horizontal line , in a manner often paralleled throughout the book , `` It is only the mental knowledge that the line is really straight and horizontal which interferes with the per - ception that the line is really seen as a curve , '' contradicts the essential directness of our im - pressions and the inseparableness of the effects on eye and brain .

		One must confess , nevertheless , that although the division into chapters is a logical one , it severs a number of subjects very intimately related , and necessitates much repeti - tion and turning back and forth .

		Certain defects of style to be found in Mr.
Goodyear	PERSON	's other writings recur here also .

		But it is ungrateful to cavil at defects in a work which is a welcome contribution to the somewhat meagre literature of American architectural research .

		Members of the professional circle , as they become convinced of the validity of Mr.
Good	PERSON	- year 's ideas , are inclined to believe that it is his attitude and not theirs which has changed .

		A re - examination of his earlier publications , however , leaves little warrant for this belief , and it seems more probable that long cultivation has now pre - pared the ground for the seed which formerly fell among stones .

		It would not be surprising if the more recently discovered refinements , once acknowledged , should ultimately find their way into current design like those earlier recog - nized .

		Mr.
Goodyear	PERSON	would then have added one more illustration of the effective reaction of archaeology on a living art .

		ROMANTICISM ix THE HJGHT OF DUALISM .

		* '' ... He only who knoweth whither he saileth , knoweth also what wind is good and a fair wind for him . ''

		Mr.
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	's latest volume of '' Shelburne Essays '' is not akin to the collec - tions of genial and mildly edifying essays on up-to-date literature that are pouring from the presses .

		To turn from the usual book of the day to this volume is to turn from triviality and impetuosity to reflection and poise and spiritual solemnity , three qualities as rare as they are desirable .

		Here one will find the '' still fh ten - sity '' that has almost always characterized the best literary criticism .

		In the preface the author indicates briefly his conception of criticism : '' There is a kind of criticism that limits itself to looking at the thing in itself , or at the parts of a thing as they successively strike the mind .

		This is properly the way of sympathy , and those who choose this way are right in saying that it is absurd or merely ill - tempered to dwell on what is ugly in a work of art , or false , or incomplete .

		But there is a place also for another kind of criticism , which is not so much directed * THE DRIFT OF ROMANTICISM .

		to the individual thing as to its relation with other things , and to its place as cause or effect in a whole group of tendencies ... The highest criticism would contrive to balance these methods in such manner that neither the occasional merits of a work nor its general influence would be unduly subordinated . ''

		Ordinarily , as in the essays on
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	and
Cardinal Newman	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
More	PERSON	maintains this balance admirably ; elsewhere , as in the essay on Pater , the emphasis is on the relation of the man and his work with a widespread and , in the author 's view , deplorable tendency , `` the romantic movement , beneath all its show of expansion and vitality , seems to me at its heart ... a drift toward disintegration and disease . ''

		Through a study of '' the morbid egotism of a Beckford , '' '' the religious defalcation of a New - man , '' `` the sestheticism of a Pater , '' `` the dregs of naturalistic pantheism in a
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	, '' and '' the impotent revolt from humanitarian sympathy of a Nietzsche , '' the drift of roman - ticism is gradually defined and related with diverse aspects of life .

		Sensible as he is to the beauty that not infrequently shines on the troubled countenance of romanticism , Mr.
More	PERSON	hints that this beauty is not necessarily the expression of essential romanticism , but rather of traits of humanity that are ever resurgent .

		The discussion of the nature of romanticism is mostly implicit , but partly explicit , by means of long excursions away from the immediate subject .

		In sum Mr.
More	PERSON	's view is as follows : The human spirit , instead of living in conscious - ness of its dual constitution , of the one and the many , has set aside the higher term and allowed itself to be merged in the flux .

		Instead of responding to the '' central peace subsisting at the heart Of endless agitation , '' it has revelled in the delights and tortures of the flux itself .

		In the classical conception , the highest intuition is above the reason , and is therefore above the flux ; the intuition of the romanticist , on the other hand , is below the reason , and is of the flux is , indeed , merely an aggravation of the natural expansiveness of our thronging desires .

		Whereas classical phil - osophy looked to the infinite , the absolute , for the restraint of the desires , romantic philosophy , rejecting all restraint , puts its faith in the limit - less , in the unhindered activity of desire .

		Ro - manticism , then , has no inherent stability , and is given over to empty revery , to purposeless - ness , to a nostalgia of the soul .

		It leads to in - ternal conflict , disillusion , despair , exhaustion .

		A second child of naturalism , growing up with romanticism , is science .

		Mr.
More distin	PERSON	-
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 417 guishes three types : first , positive science , `` that trained observation which brings the vision of order out of chaos '' ; second , hypothetical sci - ence , which deals with hypotheses that are in the realm of positive science ; and third , philo - sophical science , dealing with hypotheses outside the realm of positive science , and endeavoring `` to formulate a philosophy of life out of scien - tific law and hypothesis . ''

		Of the three , the first two are legitimate and valuable ; but the third , philosophical science , is illegitimate and perni - cious .

		The union of romanticism and science is effected by the philosophy of the elan vital , which leads to a disintegrating optimism of which there are many signs in this country to-day .

		We have done the book an unintentional dis - service if our rather facile summary gives the impression that the application of dualism to romanticism is mechanically performed .

		Nor are the fundamental ideas new in Mr.
More	PERSON	's work .

		The romantic substitution of the limit - less for the infinite was discussed at some length in the essay on `` Thoreau 's Journals , '' in the fifth series of the `` Shelburne Essays '' ; the philosophy of change in `` The Quest '' -LRB- third series -RRB- and in `` Victorian Literature '' -LRB- seventh series -RRB- ; and the dualistic point of view under - lies all of the essays , particularly the group of `` Studies in Religious Dualism '' -LRB- sixth series -RRB- .

		Indeed , the concluding part of the present vol - ume , some fifty pages of aphoristic statements entitled `` Definitions of Dualism , '' is a concen - trated expression of the definite view of life that pervades all of Mr.
More	PERSON	's writings .

		As a re - sult , the essays have the ring of entire assurance , an assurance modified by the author 's modest manner and his desire to acknowledge excel - lence wherever it may exist .

		With Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	, whose Johnsonian `` good-humored growl '' has attracted a larger number of desirable readers than it has re - pelled , Mr.
More	PERSON	is one of the three or four critics who are to-day influencing the thought of the more reflective part of our unreflective democracy .

		His latest book , concerned as it is with the spiritual and intellectual discords of the century from which we have just emerged , should be read by everyone who has the problems of the age at heart and do we not assume , to-day , that we are each of us respon - sible for the universe ?

		One of the encourag - ing signs of the times is the eager hearing , not always faddish , given to such men as
M. Maeter	PERSON	- linck ,
M. Bergson	PERSON	, and Professor
Eucken	PERSON	, who seem to us authentic because they are modern .

		Quite as modern as these men is the renewed interest in the classics manifested in
Paris	LOCATION	and
Berlin	LOCATION	, and less distinctly in this country .

		The classic spirit , the dualistic philosophy , have a perennial vitality , and it is hardly safe to assume that we have assimilated them in the evolution of civilization and will turn to them no more , for in large degree man is master of his evolution and may turn to the past when the need and the desire possess him .

		Ancient
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	have much to tell
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	; specifically , what Plato would think of the romantic movement is pretty well indicated in these essays by Mr.

		GERMANY AND THE GERMAN EMPEROR .

		* The development of modern
Germany	LOCATION	is a subject of perennial attractiveness for both German and non-German writers .

		The most recent of the many attempts which have been made by men of foreign antecedents to interpret the spirit and the results of German evolution is that of
M. Henri Lichtenberger	PERSON	, mattre de conferences at the Sorbonne and a critic of well-established reputation .

		The portion of Ger - man history covered by
M. Lichtenberger	PERSON	's book -LRB- published originally in French and now brought out in English translation -RRB- is that which falls between the era of
Napoleon	PERSON	and our own day ; and the sub - jects to which attention is given comprise princi - pally the rise of capitalism , the transformation of agriculture and industry , the struggle for liberty and unity , the growth of foreign and home policy , the conflicts of religion , and the development and achievements of art .

		The drier and more familiar facts of economic and political growth are subordi - nated to the unfolding of the ideals which underlie religion , philosophy , and art , and fortunately the writer is distinctly at his best in the presentation of this more intensively treated portion of his subject .

		The well-read student of German affairs will find here little that is really new .

		Indeed the author modestly enough disclaims originality , and avows that he has had no object other than that of placing before French readers in systematic order the results attained by the researches of
Lamprecht	LOCATION	,
Sombart	LOCATION	,
Treitschke	PERSON	, and a score of other investigators , both German and French , within the broad domain of German social phenomena .

		418 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	sents a marshalling of well-mastered fact , played upon by a faculty for facile and candid interpreta - tion which not even the specialist in the field can hope invariably to attain .

		The objective attitude which is assumed at the outset is well sustained throughout , and the quality of fairness pervades the discussion of not only international policies in which
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	are alike concerned , but the clash of political principles , of social ideals , and of religious opinions .

		The dominating force of the
Germany	LOCATION	of modern times is discovered in
Nietzsche	LOCATION	's free and boundless `` will to power , '' representing the completest pos - sible severance from the medieval attitude of obedi - ence to tradition and authority .

		At the same time , there is declared to be to-day , in the domains of religion and -LCB- esthetics at least , a reaction from ration - alism and materialism toward mysticism and ideal - ism .

		This interlacing of rationalism and idealism remains , indeed , the supreme paradox of the German world to-day . ''

		Of all the nations of
Europe	LOCATION	, '' it is affirmed , '' the German people is one of those among whom scientific reason and organizing will have dis - played the most extraordinary prowess and modern subjectivism has blossomed most luxuriantly .

		But it is also one among whom the ' religious ' spirit , respect for tradition and authority , has retained the greatest strength . ''

		In the preparation of the book for English read - ers the translator might well have employed a few foot-notes to bring the text up to date .

		The repeated assertion that socialism suffered a decided set-back '' in the last election '' should then have been accom - panied by some mention of the remarkable socialist triumph at the elections of
1912	DATE	; and the reader would not be left to reconcile for himself the glori - fication of the Von der
Golz	PERSON	reform of the Turkish army with the events of the past year in the south - east of
Europe	LOCATION	, or the seeming triumphant sway of
Herr Dernburg	ORGANIZATION	in the
German Colonial Office	ORGANIZATION	with the recent enforced retirement of that official and the repudiation of his policies .

		A writer of somewhat cynical disposition some time ago defined European politics as '' the science of misunderstanding . ''

		The characterization may be fantastic , but that it is not wholly lacking in aptness is evidenced by the succession of crises , dis - avowals , and '' explanations '' with which the history of international affairs is to-day , perhaps more than ever , filled .

		Diplomats and parliamentary leaders fail habitually to interpret aright the motives and purposes of States other than their own ; and mis - understanding , savoring as it may of deliberate mis - construction , not infrequently leads to the very verge of war .

		Misunderstanding may hardly have been reduced to a science .

		But that there is a great deal of it , and that it is responsible for many unpleasant things that happen , among nations as well as among individuals , no one will undertake to dispute .

		In the gigantic enigma of international politics to-day the supreme factor of uncertainty is Ger - many , and , in
Germany	LOCATION	, the
Kaiser	LOCATION	.

		At every recurring period of unusual tension , as at the time of the South African war , at that of the Moroccan episode of
1905	DATE	, or during the present Balkan con - flict , the most instant query of the European world relates to the intentions of the
Berlin Government	ORGANIZATION	; and even the intervals of comparative quiet are pro- lific in discussion of the subject , more particularly , of course , in
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Within the past twelvemonth there have appeared , in En - glish alone , and in addition to magazine articles and brochures by the score , no fewer than three books whose purpose is to define the position of the German Empire in the world of to-day , and , more specifically , to explain the influence , present and prospective , of the Emperor
William II	PERSON	.

		Of the three the volume by Mr.
Ferris	PERSON	is most ambitious in scope , though perhaps not so in aim ; for Mr.
Fried	PERSON	endeavors to prove that the
Kaiser	PERSON	is at all times and of necessity attached to the cause of peace , while Mr.
Willis	PERSON	essays the no less consider - able task of demonstrating that the Emperor and his counsellors not only expect war shortly but are con - cerned only to avert its approach until all shall be in readiness .

		Beginning with an illuminating sur - vey of the historical geography of the portions of
Europe	LOCATION	comprised within the present Empire , Mr.
Ferris	PERSON	devotes three chapters to a sketch of German social and political development to the nineteenth century , with an excellent review of the triumphs of German genius in philosophy , literature , and music , after which are surveyed at much greater length the history of the country since the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
Vienna	LOCATION	and the conditions , political , social , and economic , which lend it distinction at the present time .

		Assuming that the new German Empire is '' the most perplexing quantity in the modern world , '' the author sets out to give `` an interpretation of the German life of to-day by the aid of the Germanic past . ''

		He must be credited not only with the cour - age to undertake a task of unusual difficulty , but with the skill to accomplish it in a manner worthy of commendation .

		Of historical facts he gives few , if any , that are new .

		But the interpretation of the physical , personal , and social forces which inter - played in the earlier stages of German development is usually sound , and the description of German polity and achievement within our own generation is exceptionally clear , well-informed , and convincing .

		A detailed characterization of the personality of the
Kaiser	PERSON	is summed up in the following lucid manner : `` The Emperor is a true
Teuton	PERSON	in his idealism , his senti - mentality , his strenuous devotion to duty as he sees it , and his kindly anxiety to model the nation on the old-time patriarchal household .

		But he is only too evidently out of harmony with much of his surroundings ; and in himself there is plainly visible a conflict between old and new ele - ments , between an obstinate blood-inheritance and a quick sensitiveness to certain aspects of modern life .

		The main body of the people does not wish to be patriarchical ; it wants more liberty , not less .

		He himself wishes to provide schools and universities , factories , farms , and fleets with the latest scientific equipment ; but whoever looks with scientific eye upon absentee landlords , the Prussian electoral system , or
1913	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 419 divine-right monarchy , is in his eyes a dangerous enemy of an inspired order .

		He makes friends of the Krupps and
Ballins	PERSON	, the captains of competitive industrialism , and yet imagines that the pre-industrial organization of society can be maintained ... He wishes his people and every other people to enjoy the blessings of peace ; but it is the precarious and expensive peace of the feudal retainer whose armour became heavier year by year until at length the whole medi - aeval structure broke down .

		He is desperately in earnest in his religion ; but if the
Kaiser	PERSON	's singular combination of Protestant and Catholic orthodoxies be right , how can the opposition of the two churches be maintained , and why should one of them be by law established ? ''

		From the disaster lurking in these inconsistencies the Emperor has been saved , in Mr.
Perris	PERSON	's judg - ment , not by the intellectual power required to reconcile the divergent impulses whence they
spring	DATE	, but rather by a certain pliancy which enables him to give way ere the rising democratic temper breaks bounds .

		Of the divine mission of the
House of Hohenzollern	ORGANIZATION	never a doubt is entertained by the Emperor himself , but the average German does not view the claim very seriously .

		Says Mr.
Perris	PERSON	: '' Except in the early years of the reign , and in a few short intervals since , the
Kaiser	PERSON	has enjoyed a measure of popularity remarkable in the political circumstances .

		Had he been made of harder stuff , or been regarded , in his own words , as ' the instrument of God , ' there might have been more obedience , but there would have been less affection .

		In his heart , if not openly , the educated German contem - plates the pretension to divine right as a Londoner contem - plates the
Lord Mayor	ORGANIZATION	's coach .

		It is a harmless vanity of the Prussian royal family .

		If Bavarians or Saxons recognize any divine right , it is that of their own royal families ... The question , however , is felt to be of small importance in everyday life .

		Sometimes the
Kaiser	PERSON	speaks wisely , some - times otherwisely .

		But always he is a very human being , and , at least , the ablest , most energetic and the most inter - esting sovereign of the time .

		Much can be pardoned for his virtues and his patriotism . ''

		In Mr.
Fried	PERSON	's little volume an attempt is made to demonstrate from the Emperor 's words and acts that the concept of a European rapprochement is much less foreign to the
Wilhelmsstrasse	PERSON	than is frequently supposed , that the spirit of the age has produced in the
Kaiser	PERSON	a distinct change of heart with respect to the desirability of peace , and , finally , that the proposed `` peace alliance '' among the nations does not involve , as is so widely sus - pected , any sort of confederation in a political sense .

		Mr.
Fried	PERSON	is a German , the editor of one of the more influential periodicals of the Empire , and an ardent exponent of the present-day peace move - ment .

		The book under review won for him last year a Nobel prize .

		In it there is little argument for peace , or , directly , for the disarmament of nations .

		The desirability of these things is assumed , and the major portion of the volume is devoted to an exposition of the process by which the
Emperor William II	ORGANIZATION	.

		has been brought , step by step , to the position of a real pacivist , restrained from meas - uring up to the full possibilities of his pivotal position only by the aristocratic and reactionary forces by which he is surrounded .

		When , in
1888	DATE	, the youthful
Potsdam	LOCATION	officer mounted the throne of the Hohenzollerns and , turning first of all to the army , cried '' I and the army belong to one another , are born for one another , and will steadfastly hold together , come peace or storm , as God wills it , '' the world understood that
Germany	LOCATION	had fallen under the dominion of a war lord whose ambition was likely to spell carnage and conquest .

		In
June	DATE	of the present year , however , the Emperor
William	PERSON	will have completed a quarter of a century on the German throne without having ever witnessed a battle ; and within this prolonged period his country has been engaged in no war worthy of the name .

		The Emperor has , indeed , in the words of Mr.
Fried	PERSON	, '' composed music , delivered speeches , written poetry , painted pictures , done a little yachting , and studied sculpture and theology ; he has , in short , done every - thing except wage war . ''

		On the contrary , he has declared '' I only wish that
Europe	LOCATION	's peace lay in my hands .

		I should cer - tainly take care it should never be disturbed . ''

		He has discoursed frequently and forcefully upon the possibilities of a peaceful federation of the European states .

		And within the past three or four years he has accorded frank endorsement to views regarding the growing impracticability of war almost identical with those so masterfully expounded more than a decade ago by the Russian state councillor
Johann von Bloch	PERSON	.

		The Emperor clings still to the theory si vis pacem para bellum .

		He believes that war may be avoided only , in the last analysis , by exert - ing to the utmost the defensive forces of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		He certainly does not want war .

		No one understands better than he the ruinous effects upon industry and trade which war must entail .

		He is beginning to sympathize with the idea that armaments should be maintained for the defense of the community of States , rather than for use against these States .

		All that remains , as Mr.
Fried	PERSON	views the situation , is for the Emperor , whose every move in such matters is watched by the Powers generally , to shake off the restraining influences of the militarists and court reactionaries , and to give expression to his own im - pulses by coming out squarely for international con - federation in the interest of perpetual peace and of armament retrenchment .

		The opportunity , in Mr.
Fried	PERSON	's opinion , is one which comes but seldom , even to monarchs .

		From the optimism of Mr.
Fried	PERSON	to the pessimism of Mr.
Willis	PERSON	is a far cry .

		Mr.
Willis	PERSON	was during sixteen years a member of the Australian parlia - ment , and he has written somewhat extensively upon political and social topics .

		He displays , however , a cocksureness of opinion , a propensity to look upon the darker side of things , not to mention an occa - sional slovenliness of expression , by which his work is rendered of but second-rate importance .

		In the present volume he contends that while
Germany	LOCATION	wants many things , the acquisition of which would seriously embarrass her rivals , the chief of her de - sires is colonial dominion in portions of the world -LRB-
South America	LOCATION	is especially emphasized -RRB- where German-speaking people may settle in large num - bers and yet retain their German nationality .

		It is 420 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	assumed that
Germany	LOCATION	is working relentlessly and stealthily toward this end , and that if the German Government desires peace , it is only to gain time and to make surer the eventual defeat of
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and perhaps the
United States	LOCATION	.

		`` Every day , and every hour of the day , '' it is alleged , '' the black German clouds of war are growing darker , gathering more force , and obscuring , little by little almost imperceptibly , it may be , to some the rays of the sun of peace from this country -LSB-
England	LOCATION	-RSB- and
France	LOCATION	and perhaps from the civilized world . ''

		The '' terrible tension '' concerning what
Germany	LOCATION	wants , we are assured , can not go on interminably .

		If the strain be not relieved it will reach the breaking - point ; that is to say , war will ensue .

		And the relief can not long be delayed .

		The possibility that an adjustment may be attained through diplomacy is admitted , but the impression which one gathers from Mr.
Willis	PERSON	's chapters is that war is very much more probable .

		The '' German menace '' is portrayed as a blight not merely upon outside nations but upon
Germany	LOCATION	herself .

		For the German people there is high praise ; the fault of the existing situation is attached exclusively , or almost so , to the `` Great Sphinx , '' i.e. , the Emperor , and the `` peace-destroying military cliques '' who are declared to rule the Em - pire and to determine its destiny .

		The book is by no means as intemperate as some other attacks upon German public polity which have emanated from English sources .

		But it certainly will not contribute to that spirit of international comity which it would seem to be the most solemn obligation of writers of both
England	LOCATION	arid
Germany	LOCATION	to promote .

		There is something paradoxical in von aZ life .

		th f .

		U8e of the essa y to ex P r .

		ess the spirit of youth .

		The energies and enthusiasms of that spirit are too turbulent to be contained in so reflective a form of literary art .

		But in his sober and thoughtful book of essays , '' Youth and Life '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Randolph S. Bourne	PERSON	, a
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	graduate student , has attempted some - thing of a philosophic interpretation of youth .

		His temperament and training have led him to dwell upon the higher and more permanent aspects of youthfulness , those which ought to be preserved throughout life .

		Chief of these is the na'ivetS of intellectual outlook which means absolute truthful - ness , a spiritualized scientific conscience .

		The mo - ment we substitute policy for this clearness of vision we violate our intellectual integrity .

		Youthfulness means , therefore , a continual warring of reason against tradition , a conflict of two generations . ''

		Old men cherish a fond delusion that there is something mystically valuable in mere quantity of experience .

		Now the fact is , of course , that it is the young people who have all the really valuable experience .

		It is they who have constantly to face new situations , to react constantly to new aspects of life , who are getting the whole beauty and terror and cruelty of the world in its fresh and undiluted purity . ''

		To sustain it , this wisdom of youth needs an enthusiastic idealism and a tremendous capacity for resistance and sacrifice .

		The pressures of society are all in favor of tradition .

		And so , '' few men remain quite true to themselves .

		As their youthful ideals come into contact with the harshnesses of life , the brightest succumb and go to the wall ... Youth rules the world , but only when it is no longer young .

		It is a tarnished , travestied youth that is in the saddle in the person of middle age .

		Old age lives in the delusion that it has improved and rationalized its youthful ideas by experience and stored-up wisdom , when all it has done is to damage them more or less usually more .

		And the tragedy of life is that the world is run by these damaged ideals .

		... It is the young only who are actually contemporaneous ; they interpret what they see freshly and without pre - judice ; their vision is always the truest , and their interpretation always the justest . ''

		As an essayist , Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	has dared erase `` Whim '' from his lintel .

		But his style , although restrained , abounds in illuminating epigram and characteristic touches of charm .

		It is a book of much promise , which marks the arrival of an essayist who can deal with the larger themes with something like finality .

		The collected The lif e of Jonn Q uinc y
Adams	PERSON	, sixth writings of
John President	PERSON	of the
United States	LOCATION	, was
Quincv Adams	PERSON	.

		one o f tne f u ii e8 t lived by any Amer - ican .

		Yet to write a biography of
Adams	ORGANIZATION	is a task that has been attempted by few American his - torians .

		The reasons for this apparent inattention are doubtless many .

		The subject may have been deemed unattractive .

		Hardly any man was more unpopular .

		In
Adams	PERSON	's case there seems to have developed no later growth of interest , such as in recent years has brought more justice to
James K. Polk	PERSON	.

		But a deeper explanation , we suspect , lies in the fact that
Adams	PERSON	was the prince of American autobiographers .

		The voluminous `` Memoirs '' which , under the editorship of
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, the President 's son , was published in 1874-7 -LRB- though the work is relatively rare and known to few besides special students of American history -RRB- , constitutes one of the most absorbing documents in the sources of American political history ; and it would seem that the autobiography has awed the biographer .

		Another reason is that but little of the correspond - ence of
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	has heretofore been available .

		A few letters have been printed , some , for example , in a bulletin of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and some in the `` American Historical Review . ''

		It is with expectancy and interest , therefore , that one welcomes the first volume of a definitive edition of
Adams	ORGANIZATION	's complete '' Writings '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This initial volume begins with a letter written by
Adams	PERSON	in his twelfth year , as he was about to return with his father from the latter 's
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 421 mission to
France	LOCATION	, and closes with letters written in the first part of
1786	DATE	, when the writer , though commissioned minister to
Portugal	LOCATION	, was still at
The Hague	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the period included between these dates ,
Adams	PERSON	writes of his boyhood travels on the conti - nent and in
England	LOCATION	, of his life at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	, of his law studies in
Newburyport	LOCATION	, and of the early days of his practice in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		We follow him in his entrance into politics , and into the beginnings of that diplomatic service which filled so much of his youth .

		Indeed , by far the larger number of the letters are those which in his official capacity and as a dutiful son he wrote during his extended stay in
Holland	LOCATION	.

		The precocity of the writer is abun - dantly manifested throughout the letters and the early political essays here reprinted .

		One senses a touch of priggishness , perhaps , in some of the boy - ish letters ; but such an impression is forgotten in admiration of the capacity and the poise of the writer .

		Occasionally there is a glint of humor , a quality not often revealed in the `` Memoirs . ''

		The historical value of the collection is great , both for the keen observations on European politics and for the penetrating comments on American affairs .

		That the collection is edited by Mr.
Worthington C. Ford	PERSON	is a sufficient assurance of the adequacy of the editorial comment .

		The notes , always succinct , are rich in explanatory enlightenment where this is needed .

		One additional help to the student , which we should have been glad to see in the first volume , is perhaps only deferred to the last : this is a general note on the Adams papers .

		A bibliography of the published writings of
Adams	ORGANIZATION	is promised by Mr.

		This would supplant the notes in
Winsor	LOCATION	, and would round out the information which the individual student may occasionally have picked up .

		A list of the letters by
Adams	PERSON	already in print , and some hint as to the extent and character of the letters to

		u An English Cathedral Journey '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- appeared originally in `` The Chautauquan '' magazine ; and now appeals to the wider audience known as the general public .

		It is a compact little volume , not too big for the pocket ; and contains the story of
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	and eight cathedrals
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	,
Rochester	LOCATION	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
Durham	LOCATION	,
Ely	PERSON	,
Salis	PERSON	- bury ,
Lichfield	LOCATION	, and
York	LOCATION	.

		This is a fair represen - tation of the thirty-seven cathedrals of
England	LOCATION	and
Wales	LOCATION	; but the intrinsic interest would have been heightened by substituting for
Rochester	LOCATION	, say ,
Gloucester	LOCATION	, where the Perpendicular style origin - ated .

		This would have recognized the western group of cathedrals , and would have preserved the geographical balance .

		If neighborhood was to be considered , Winchester might have been added to
Salisbury	LOCATION	, and
Peterborough	LOCATION	to
Ely	PERSON	, without unduly thickening the book .

		As it is , the traveller will often be forced to dive into another pocket for his Baedeker or other stand-by .

		Still , our `` vish there vos more , '' on the principle announced by Mr.
Samuel Weller	PERSON	, is based on our enjoyment of what there is .

		Miss
Kimball	PERSON	writes with honest and well - informed enthusiasm , is posted on periods and styles , does not forget historic associations , and tempers technicalities to the capacity of the aver - age intelligent traveller .

		The practical value of the book is increased by some useful addenda in the shape of measurements of the nine churches , a sur - vey of the architectural periods , a bibliography , a glossary of architectural and ecclesiastical terms , and the indispensable index .

		The illustrations are abundant , and some of them especially interesting , as being taken from unusual points of view ; e. g. , the triforium of
Durham	LOCATION	, the cloister garth of
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	from the northwest , and
York	LOCATION	's chapter - house .

		On page 286 , `` Rochester '' should read '' Salisbury '' ; on page 289 , '' chapel-of-ease '' would seem to belong to the ecclesiastical , rather than to the architectural part of the glossary ; and the definition of `` tympanum , '' on page 293 , speaks rather confusingly of the `` space between the hori - zontal opening of a doorway and the arch above . ''

Nogi	PERSON	's staff at Port

Moukden	LOCATION	, it was given to gain some acquaintance with the great commander as he was in moments of relaxation and in the circle of his friends . ''

		Nogi : A Man against the Back - ground of a Great War '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- presents in a few brief pen-strokes the picture of that heroic figure as seen from day to day during the harrowing suspense of the long siege and in the succeeding months of the war , notably at the moment when the bitterly disappointing terms of the
Portsmouth	LOCATION	treaty became known to the Japanese soldiers at the front .

		The quietness , simplicity , and modesty of the hero of Port
Arthur	PERSON	are shown to have been all that one would have expected and desired in so truly great a man ; but the inherited instinct of command and the power to enforce obedience were ever present . ''

		To his men and to his officers he was always kind and conciliatory , but never under any circumstances familiar .

		When he spoke to them , he spoke curtly and they acted instantly .

		A moment 's delay on their part and one sharp look , like the flash of a smould - ering flame , would bring them to their feet in an instant with blood surging up beneath their skins . ''

		His heroic endurance of the loss of his two sons and of countless dear friends in that fearfully costly war , his kindheartedness so seemingly in contrast with the orders he issued that sent thousands and tens of thou - sands to certain death in the assaults on Port
Arthur	PERSON	, his complete indifference to the honors showered upon him by a grateful and admiring nation when victory had perched on his banners all this and 422 THE DIAL -LSB-

Washburn	PERSON	's pages , with a final chapter devoted to the tragically impressive circumstances of the hero 's death .

		Por - traits of
Nogi	PERSON	and other appropriate illustrations abound .

		Though the oriental mind is held to be a closed book to the Westerner , the author has suc - ceeded in presenting a very real and human and attractive character , as well as a noble one , in this brief sketch of a great Japanese military com - mander .

		A handbook He is .

		a bold Pphet who would ven - of
Mexico	LOCATION	and ture , in the midst of the disturbed
Central America	LOCATION	, conditions which have prevailed in
Mexico	LOCATION	since the enforced retirement of
Porfirio Diaz	PERSON	, to predict what the future has in store for that distressed country .

		And judging from its title , Mr.
Joseph King Goodrich	PERSON	's `` The Coming Mexico '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- would seem to be thus prophetic .

		In the first sentence of his preface , however , the author disclaims any such intention ; and it is well that he does , for within a few days after his book appeared the `` unexpected happened . ''

		The government , upon which the more hopeful observers of recent conditions relied , was overthrown ; the President and Vice-President were assassinated , and
Mexico	LOCATION	became as reactionary as in the days of
Santa Ana	LOCATION	or of
Miramon	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Goodrich	PERSON	's book is , on the other hand , an interesting survey of the country -LRB- includ - ing the Central American States -RRB- , and is fuller and more thorough than any other book on that fascinat - ing subject that has recently appeared .

		In its chap - ters on mountaineering , the seaports , and attractions for the tourist , sportsman , and health seekers , it presents information not to be found elsewhere , accompanied by illustrations especially attractive because of their freshness .

		The author 's first ac - quaintance with
Mexico	LOCATION	was made in
1866	DATE	, but the book is based upon recent visits .

		In his historical references Mr.
Goodrich	PERSON	is committed to views of the civilization and form of government prevailing among the primitive races which have been aban - doned by students since the time of
Lewis	PERSON	H. Mor - gan and
Bandelier	LOCATION	; and his two references to the so-called '' Pastry War '' are hopelessly irreconcilable , and neither of them is accurate .

		But in other and more important respects , the book is exceedingly helpful to a thorough knowledge of
Mexico	LOCATION	and
Central America	LOCATION	.

		Early English To the six splendidly-illustrated folio domestic volumes of '' Gardens Old and New '' architecture .

		and < ; In English Homes , '' published by `` Country Life '' of
London	LOCATION	, is now added a supplementary and uniform volume dealing with `` English Homes of the Early Renaissance '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- .

		Mr.
H. Avray Tipping	PERSON	is the editor of this , as of the other volumes in the series ; and the numerous fine photographs are from Mr.
Charles Latham	PERSON	's negatives .

		The work deals with the ex - terior characteristics of the country homes planned and erected in
England	LOCATION	during the century between the close of the reign of
Henry VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		and the out - break of the Civil War in
1642	DATE	.

		Tracing the gradual evolution of the Elizabethan home from the time that the early Renaissance style , `` a classic veneer upon a Gothic framework , '' was in vogue , it reveals insistently the fact that features of medisevalism were slow in disappearing , despite the best efforts at innovation on the part of
John Shute	PERSON	in the six - teenth century or of
Inigo Jones	PERSON	a hundred years later .

		The most radical changes were effected in diminishing the size of the hall -LRB- which to the me - diaeval Englishman was practically his house -RRB- , the elimination of the winding form of staircase , an increased attention to adequate and serviceable fenestration , an over-emphasis of furniture and decorative objects which led to considering the walls and ceiling as mere backgrounds instead of works of art in themselves , as well as minor details .

		Many of the homes described have been chosen for their historic interest ; others , because of their present ownership .

		`` Batemans , '' a Jacobean house in
East Sussex	LOCATION	and now in the possession of Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	, is only one instance of an unspoiled survival from a romantic past , thanks to the artistic percep - tion of the owner , who has not adopted the modern `` improving '' spirit , where reparations have been necessary .


Wooton Lodge	ORGANIZATION	,
Shaw House	ORGANIZATION	in
Berk	PERSON	- shire ,
Borwick Hall	PERSON	, and
Shipton Hall	ORGANIZATION	in
Shropshire	LOCATION	are typical examples of magnificent centres around which much that is of significant historic interest has been grouped .

		However , to gain a clear insight into the style known as
Early Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	, a study of all of the forty-three places dealt with in this vol - ume is essential .

		And the reader will be well repaid ; for , added to the wealth of architectural lore here offered , are interesting bits from the life-stories of the notable men and women who lived within these walls and an abundance of those curious village tradi - tions with which all history is intimately connected .

		From the pen of one who has the '' travel-fever in his blood , and whose style shows something of the art of the born word-painter , there comes a rambling tale of world-wide wandering , under the fanciful title of `` The Shadow Show '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Mr.
J. H. Curie	PERSON	, the author of the book , says of himself on an early page , '' To-day , at forty , I have seen the world from end to end , '' and indeed his travel-record includes every continent and some of the islands .

		One of eleven children , he enjoyed the advantages of being , in a manner , crowded out of the home nest at fourteen years of age , and has been intermittently `` on the go '' ever since .

		South African mining seems to have been his chief business interest , the study of mankind , from
China	LOCATION	to
Peru	LOCATION	, his favorite amusement .

		Taking part in the
Jameson	PERSON	fiasco and coming in contact with
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	, he be - came so impressed with the latter 's commanding qualities as to find no one worthy of naming in the same breath with him except General
Porfirio Diaz	PERSON	.

		Knowing the world well , Mr.
Curie	PERSON	has also become well acquainted with himself ; he knows his own
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAJL 423 strength , and presumably also his weakness .

		`` I feel I was born to manage a great mine , '' he tells us .

		`` The qualities were there financial , execu - tive , administrative though I did not use them .

		With natives , too , I could do anything .

		... I knew just how mines were developing all over the world how this one was improving , this declining , and that other being forced for stock - jobbing .

		My knowl - edge of the personnel of the mining world was unique . ''

		But the demon of restlessness made a globe-trotter of the potential mining magnate ; and so we have from his hand these entertaining chap - ters of travel and of passing comment on the foibles of his fellow-beings , instead of certain unneeded additions to the world 's stock of precious metals .

		There is an assurance and dash in his manner that reconcile us even to the philosophizing and the moralizing that naturally
spring	DATE	from so wide and varied a knowledge of the world .

		`` I have led a glorious life , '' is his opening sentence , and it gives the keynote to the book .

		A philosophy Philosophy of history , in these days of reiigous of grubbing that we call research history .

		an -LRB- j stupidity of expression that we call scientific accuracy , is a lost art .

		It requires imagination , and those endowed with imagination have tended to become stock-brokers or journalists rather than historians .

		In the case of Dr.
E. Noel Reichardt	PERSON	's '' The Significance of Ancient Religions in Relation to Human Evolution and Brain Develop - ment '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , the writer is a physician .

		What he offers is a very pretty imaginative treatment of the history of religions from a point of view that brings into focus `` a very solid and extensive array of historical facts .

		From that point of view , the evolu - tionary movement in humanity is seen to be a suc - cession of rhythmical Racial movements .

		In each movement a single wave of energy operates simul - taneously on large numbers of human beings through - out a long series of generations , and endows the whole mass with the specific unity of a Race .

		The vital impetus rises to a certain point of intensity , and then ebbs away and becomes extinct ; as if it were itself the expression of the life of a living organism . ''

		History so conceived becomes a drama of which the protagonist is a `` germ-plasm '' or a `` generic wave , '' whose behavior constitutes the successive acts that we call Egyptian , Babylonian ,
Persian	LOCATION	,
Hindoo	PERSON	, Jewish , and so on down to
Protes	LOCATION	- tant religion .

		The crest of the wave is the Jewish religion , its trough contemporary protestantism .

		With the changes in its own phases there go con - comitant changes in the structure of the brain , and each religion represents the deposit of an additional and higher layer of cells in the brain .

		Confutation would be easy , but thankless .

		One does not confute a picture or a sonata ; one likes or dislikes .

		No more does one confute a philosophy of history .

		It may be fantastic , mythological , unverifiable ; but it does , at least , see religious life steadily and see it whole .

		It combines learning with articulate vision ; and if the vision is somewhat Post-Impressionistic , it is none the less a higher and better thing than the inarticulate messes that are turned out of our labor - atories of historical research as historical `` truth . ''

		Science and the human mind .

		The ability to survey in brief com - pass and yet maintain a significant perspective of a vast and complex domain is sufficiently unusual to direct attention to a successful example in the works of Mr. and Mrs.
William C. D. Whetham	PERSON	and to their latest contribu - tion , `` Science and the Human Mind '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		These readable pages give a vital sense of the reality of scientific thought in the ancient world ; its subsequent suppression and reconstruction in mediaeval and renaissance times , and its growth and final dominance in modern eras .

		Much of the story is distinctly philosophical , but philosophical in the truer sense of an interpretation not apart from , but intimately related to , the advances of knowledge within the natural sciences .

		The largest service of this volume lies in its adaptability to the needs of such public library readers as retain the spontaneous interest of the student .

		A text is apt to suffer from too didactic methods , and from lack of connection with interpretation of real problems and situations .

		The present volume not only sustains this important interest , but gives it a new meaning under the racial concept .

		It sets forth the larger contributions of Civilization in terms of the racial spirit and its dominance .

		It thus occupies the ground between philosophy and science , and unites their problems in a common view-point .

		Mr. and Mrs.
Whetham	PERSON	are favorably known as the authors of a considerable series of popularizations of the best type , concerned with the modern problems of heredity , eugenics , and the applications of scientific ideas to practical problems .

		Their larger venture reflects the same admirable qualities as characterize the more special - ized volumes .

		How one man A book to Send * ? ''

		city-dweller found his way countryward after his long winter of back to nature , confinement and impure air , electric lights by day and night , and artificiality of countless sorts at all times , is Mr.
Truman A. De Weese	PERSON	's prose pastoral , `` The Bend in the Road , and How a Man of the City Found It '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Like Mrs.
Henry Wade Rogers	PERSON	's `` Journal of a Country Woman , '' which made its welcome appearance a little while ago , the book points the way to vacation rest and reinvigoration of the most wholesome kind .

		As a change of occupation and interests , the care of a small farm not too remote from the city certainly possesses almost ideal advantages .

		The finding and reclaiming of a ten-acre abandoned farm on a pictur - esque hilltop , rich in the potential delights of rosy - cheeked apples and purple grapes , was Mr.
De Weese	PERSON	's way of discovering `` the bend in the road . ''

		But a much smaller patch of ground , '' an acre with nothing on it except soil that will grow things , '' is enough to furnish healthful recreation to the jaded city man . ''

		If he can get three acres , or five acres , 424 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	with a nice old house and barn on it , so much the better .

		He will be surprised to find how easy it is to get a little haven of joy like this where his soul can expand and his lungs wash themselves out with the pure ozone of the country , when once he starts out to find it .

		Like the author of that noteworthy book , `` New Lives for Old , '' Mr.
De Weese	PERSON	enjoys the advantage of having a wife who is heart and soul with him in his bucolic enterprise , also a boy to work and play at his side ; and the hired man is another important member of the household .

		The book savors of reality and wholesomeness , and is well illustrated with drawings and photo-engravings .

		In its optimistic tone it goes so far as to assert that `` there are signs that the human tide that has been surging toward the cities has reached its ebb '' which would be almost too good to be true .

Elizabeth Wallace	PERSON	's gracefully and tenderly written and beau - tifully illustrated volume , `` Mark Twain and the Happy Island '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		Mr.
Albert Bigelow Paine	PERSON	's memorable picture of the humorist in this quiet retreat is filled in with sundry significant and characteristic details by
Miss Wallace	PERSON	's deft hand , showing especially the white-haired , white-clad man in his relations with children , the `` Angel-fish '' of that choice little society he founded and fostered in the last years of his life .

		Both with pen and with camera
Miss Wallace	PERSON	has presented to view the most winning side of her kind-hearted friend .

		His friend and benefactor , the late
Henry H. Rogers	PERSON	, is also effectively included in the picture .

		A few letters from
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	to the writer , proving the closeness of their intimacy , are added , and a short introduction by his trusted biographer and literary executor opens the book .

		In Mr.
Paine	PERSON	's words , `` the world will be the better and

H. T. Montague Bell	PERSON	and
H. G. W. Woodhead	PERSON	, and read '' The Republic of
China	LOCATION	'' as the title of the first chapter .

		For the rest , the work is an invaluable compendium of statistics and other facts relating to what was so re - cently known as the
Middle Kingdom	LOCATION	.

		There is a large folding map .

		The volume is published by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` The Chronology of Modern
India	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Edinburgh	LOCATION	:
John Grant	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
James Burgess	PERSON	, enumerates briefly the important events connected with the history of
India	LOCATION	for four hundred years from the close of the fifteenth century ,
1494	DATE	A.D. , to
1894	DATE	.

		With its material collected from the most trustworthy historical sources accessible , it forms a useful supplement to the manual of
India	LOCATION	's earlier history prepared by
Miss C. Mabel Duff	PERSON	, and published in
1899	DATE	.

		Where irregularities in the spelling of proper names occur , the form here repre - sented corresponds with that in use in the most recent gazetteers and maps prepared by the Indian government .

		A fairly complete index helps to make the volume a practical reference work for the general reader or for the student of Indian affairs .

		A second edition of Professor
T. R. Glover	PERSON	's admir - able book on Virgil -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will be warmly wel - comed by all lovers of the humanities .

		For his revision the author has profited by the bitter reviews of the orig - inal work , and the net result is a thoroughly creditable and readable treatise as a detail of interest to readers for whom a reasonable price does not detract from the value of a good book .

		We would mention that the 350 generous pages can now be purchased for
two dollars	MONEY	.

		Miss
Margaret E. Tabor	PERSON	's little handbook , `` The Saints in Art '' -LRB-
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , now in a second and corrected edition , is a convenient guide for the visitor to picture galleries and churches who finds the descriptions in the ordinary tourist 's handbook insuffi - cient .

		There are accounts of the important saints , explanations of their attributes or symbols , and legend * connected with them .

		The alphabetical arrangement and the conciseness of treatment make the volume valu - able for easy reference .

		A useful digest of business information , '' What to Read on Business , '' containing classified and annotated reading lists for the use of the business man , has been published by the
Business Book Bureau of New York	ORGANIZATION	.

		The books and magazine articles listed are principally such as have been published within the
last five years	DATE	, and the concise descriptions of their contents , prices , etc. , make the little volume a convenient handbook for the active business man who desires easy access to summaries of the best that has been published in his field .

		Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	's discourse on '' The Discovery of the Future , '' deli vered recently at the Royal Institution , is published in tasteful book-form by Mr.
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	.

		The discourse , thoroughly characteristic of its author , opens wide visions of coming development in the universe of life and mind , and predicts an increasing capability on man 's part to penetrate the veil that hides the future , just as he has trained and augmented his power to pierce the gloom that shrouds the past .

		But '' the knowledge of the future we hope to gain will be general and not individual ; it will be no sort of knowledge that will either hamper us in the exercise of our individual free will or relieve us of our personal responsibility . ''

		From the startling possibility , or even probability , that man is not the highest product of evolution , but only repre - sents one step in an ascending series , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	does not shrink .

		The Trustees of the American-Scandinavian Founda - tion have decided upon a plan of work which promises to be of great importance in the cultural relations of
America	LOCATION	and
Scandinavia	LOCATION	.

		The steadily increasing interest in
Northern	LOCATION	life has created a demand for standard translations of Scandinavian literature , suitable for colleges and universities and for public and private libraries .

		Beginning in
1914	DATE	, the
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	will issue a series of Scandinavian Classics in uniform size and binding .

		The volumes will be chosen by a committee of scholars with special knowledge of the field , and will be rendered into English by competent translators .

		The committee plan to make the series broadly representative of Scandinavian literature and to include some of the best books of popular interest along with works that may meet the requirements of students .

		The list at present contains the
Eddas	LOCATION	,
Holberg	PERSON	's comedies ,
Bjiirnson	PERSON	's plays , lyrics , and letters , the works of Tegne `` r ,
Rune	PERSON	- berg ,
Drachmann	PERSON	, and
Herman Bang	PERSON	, as well as of several living writers , still quite unknown to American readers .

		It is possible that the first book of the series will be three of
Holberg	ORGANIZATION	's comedies .

		The
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	has also under consideration the publication of a series of learned monographs on Scandinavian subjects .

		An English version of '' Danmarks Heltedigtning , '' by Dr.
Axel Olrik	PERSON	, will possibly begin this series .

		A volume of '' Essays on Chaucer , '' by Professor

		Wordsworth .

		Something less than three weeks ago there died in

		His death has occa - sioned little comment outside the circle of those who in one way or another came in direct con - tact with his personality .

		Like all sensitive and finely-grained natures , he made no claims for himself , preferring rather to work obscurely for high ends than to gain popularity at the slightest cost of lowered standards .

		He belonged distinc - tively to the older editorial school , the genial and scholarly and urbane type which , as long as Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and Mr.
Alden	PERSON	are with us , can not yet be termed extinct .

		Such men make little noise in the world , and are seldom widely known in their own day ; but posterity has a habit of finding them out .

		It can not be doubted that in the rolls of the future the name of him who has just left us will be found with that small but shining company of whom
Curtis	PERSON	and
Norton	PERSON	and

America	LOCATION	.


Francis Fisher Browne	PERSON	was born at
South Halifax	LOCATION	,
Vermont	LOCATION	, on
December 1 , 1843	DATE	.

		His parentage , on both sides , was of the purest
New England	LOCATION	stock .

		His line ran back to Puritan days , and his forebears followed the fortunes of
Washington	LOCATION	in the Revolution .

		The blood of ``
John Brown	PERSON	of
Osawatomie	LOCATION	'' flowed in his veins , and on both his paternal and maternal sides he inherited a love of personal freedom and a literary tendency which dominated his life .

		His father ,
William Goldsmith Brown	PERSON	, 438 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	was a poet of unusual gifts , the author of two poems which are very widely known `` A Hundred Years to Come '' and '' Mother , Home , and Heaven '' ; and his uncle , the Rev.
Nathan Brown	PERSON	, was a linguist of world-wide reputation and one of that intrepid band of
New England	LOCATION	missionaries who carried the word in a practical way to the farthest corners of the earth .

		It was
Nathan Brown	PERSON	who first -LRB- in
1874	DATE	-RRB- gave the Japanese their versions of the New Testament and our grand old English hymns , the transla - tions being his own , set up and printed by his own hand at his little press in
Yokohama	LOCATION	.

		Early in Mr.
Browne	PERSON	's childhood , the family moved to
Western Massachusetts	LOCATION	, where the boy went to school and learned the printing trade in his father 's newspaper office at
Chicopee	LOCATION	.

		As a lad of eighteen , he left the high school in answer to the government 's call for volunteers , serving for a year with the
46th Massachusetts Regiment	ORGANIZATION	in
North Carolina	LOCATION	and with the
Army of the Potomac	ORGANIZATION	.

		When the regiment was discharged , in
1863	DATE	, he decided to take up the study of law .

		Removing to
Rochester	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	, he entered a law office in that city ; and a year or two later began a brief course in the law department of the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was unable to continue in college , however , and returned to
Rochester	LOCATION	to follow his trade .

		Here , in
1867	DATE	, he was married to
Susan Seaman Brooks	PERSON	, who , with nine children -LRB- six sons and three daughters -RRB- , survives him .

		A strong hereditary tendency toward litera - ture had already asserted itself , and immediately after his marriage he came to
Chicago	LOCATION	with the definite intention of engaging in literary work .

		It was assuredly arid and stony soil that he chose as a field for his labors .

		The gigantic young city even now after immeasurable cul - tural advances a byword for materialism in the mouths of many was at that time a veritable hotbed of philistinism .

		Zeal in commercial activity was its only rule of action , pride in commercial success its only ideal .

		The hope of establishing in such an environment any suc - cessful appeal in behalf of culture and the spirit must have seemed forlorn indeed ; yet he was not deterred .

		Casting about for an opening he soon discovered that the only journalistic pre - tender in the field of his ambitions was '' The Western Monthly , '' a newly-established peri - odical which , though crude and floundering , yet held some elements of promise .

		Becoming asso - ciated with this venture , he at once began to impart a new and dignified character to its pages , as well as new energy to its business management .

		.

		With the fuller establishment of his control he rechristened the magazine , the word '' Lakeside , '' now so familiar and widely - used in
Chicago	LOCATION	, being first employed in the new title , '' The Lakeside Monthly . ''

		The best writers throughout the West were gradually enlisted as contributors ; and it was not long before the magazine was receiving from nearly every quarter outside of
Chicago	LOCATION	itself the most flattering recognition .

		But along with this in - creasing prestige came a series of extraneous set - backs and calamities .

		In
1870	DATE	afire destroyed the magazine 's printing-office , with its subscrip - tion list and entire current edition .

		Publication was at once resumed , however , after the lapse of a single issue only .

		Then a year later came the historic fire of
1871	DATE	, in which the whole of
Chicago	LOCATION	's business section was consumed , and with it every visible asset of the magazine .

		But the intellectual force behind it was unsubdued ; and after a brief delay the magazine once more arose from the ashes .

		The financial panic of
two years later	DATE	, which swept out of existence so many enterprises far more firmly based , was weathered by the indomitable resolution of a man determined upon success .

		But these defi - nite catastrophes were of less significance , as affecting the periodical 's destiny , than were cer - tain constant and more subtle discouragements that now began to gather strength .

		Without means himself , even for a comfortable liveli - hood , its proprietor had continually to appeal for support from men to whom his own ideal - istic aims and purposes meant little or nothing .

		The financial backing of the enterprise was in consequence always upon a slender and precari - ous basis .

		Worst of all , ill-health a heritage of army days aggravated by the constant toil and anxiety of ten years began to gain the upper hand .

		At a time when the magazine was practically self-sustaining and its prospects brighter than they ever had been in the past , a complete physical break-down made its suspen - sion imperative .

		Thus came to an end '' The Lakeside Monthly , '' from that day to this the most creditable and distinguished magazine ever published west of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	seaboard .

		The six years immediately following , from
1874	DATE	to
1880	DATE	, were largely spent in a search for health .

		During part of this time , however , Mr.
Browne	PERSON	acted as literary editor of `` The Alliance '' -LRB- then a prominent and influential weekly journal -RRB- , and as special editorial writer for some of the leading
Chicago	LOCATION	newspapers .

		But his mind was preoccupied with plans for a new periodical this time a journal of literary
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 439 criticism , modelled somewhat after such English publications as '' The Athenaeum '' and '' The Academy . ''

		In the furtherance of this bold conception he was able to interest the publishing firm of
Jansen , McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	; and under their imprint , in
May , 1880	DATE	, appeared the first issue of THE DIAL , `` a monthly review and index of current literature . ''

		At about the same time he became literary adviser to the publishing department of the house , and for twelve years thereafter toiled unremittingly at his double task - work , conducting not only the editorial but also in large measure the business affairs of THE DIAL -LRB- to every number of which for several years his pen was the chief con - tributor -RRB- , besides reading and revising book manuscripts , consulting with authors , and com - ing intimately in contact with those myriad details that go to make up the publishing business .

		But THE DIAL was then , as always , his chief concern ; and it was his constant wish to devote his entire time to its interests .

		He realized , too , with increasing force , the disad - vantages to an independent literary journal of association with a book publishing house .

		Thus it was that , in
1892	DATE	, negotiations were completed whereby he acquired
Messrs. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's interest in the periodical .

		It was enlarged in scope , and made a semi-monthly ; and from that time to the present has appeared uninter - ruptedly under his guidance and his control .

		Besides his writings in THE DIAL and other organs of publicity , Mr.
Browne	PERSON	is the author of a small volume of poems , `` Volunteer Grain '' -LRB- 1895 -RRB- , and of `` The Everyday Life of Abraham Lincoln '' -LRB- 1886 -RRB- .

		He also compiled and edited several anthologies , `` Bugle Echoes , '' a col - lection of Civil War poems -LRB- 1886 -RRB- ; `` Golden Poems by British and American Authors '' -LRB- 1881 -RRB- ; `` The Golden Treasury of Poetry and Prose '' -LRB- 1883 -RRB- ; and seven volumes of `` Laurel - Crowned Verse '' -LRB- 1891-2 -RRB- .

		The preparation of the `` Lincoln '' and the compilation of `` Bugle Echoes '' involved the carrying on of a personal correspondence that would appall the stoutest heart even in these days of the typewriter and other mechanical aids ; but it was all done with his single pen , without the aid even of an amanuensis .

		His anthologies and compilations , though undertaken almost of necessity to eke out the scantiest of incomes , were carried through with a minute care and painstaking fidelity such as seldom go into work of this sort .

		His revamping of the publications of his firm amounted in many instances to practical authorship ; and a noteworthy instance of this was the tremendous task , carried on in the midst of his daily literary and business labors , of rewriting from a crude word-for-word English rendering the six volumes of
Topelius	ORGANIZATION	's `` The Surgeon 's Stories . ''

		He rewrote , in similar fash - ion , a translation of
Holger Drachmann	PERSON	's ''
Poul og Virginie	PERSON	under
Nordlig Bredde	PERSON	, '' published as ``
Paul	PERSON	and
Virginia	LOCATION	of a Northern Zone . ''

		He had just completed a thorough revision of his `` Everyday Life of Lincoln '' at the time of his death which occurred in
Santa Barbara	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	, on
May 11	DATE	.

		He was one of the small group of men who , in
1874	DATE	, founded the
Chicago Literary Club	ORGANIZATION	; and for a number of years past he has been an honor - ary member of that organization , as well as of the
Caxton Club	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- and the
Twilight Club	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Pasadena	LOCATION	,
Calif.	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		During the
summer of 1893	DATE	he served as Chairman of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	on the
Congress of Authors	ORGANIZATION	of the World 's
Congress Auxiliary of the Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such are the principal facts in the life of
Francis F. Browne	PERSON	.

		They reveal even to the most casual interpreter a career of strenuous and unwavering endeavor in the interests of culture .

		But their full significance can only be grasped by those who realize the conditions and environment in which that life-work has been carried forward .

		Ill-health and poverty and sudden catastrophes were the least formidable of the forces against which he contended for little less than half a century .

		More powerfully deterrent than all these combined was the spirit of the time and the place of his labors the all-pervading materialism to which intellectual concerns were chiefly clap-trap and high purposes moonshine .

		In
Boston	LOCATION	or
Philadelphia	LOCATION	or
New York	LOCATION	, he could scarcely have failed to achieve the highest journalistic honors in a decade or so ; in
Chicago	LOCATION	his name is even now known only to comparatively few .

		But the harshness of the conditions only enhances the glory of the achievement .

		In
Chicago	LOCATION	he established and conducted for several years the one literary magazine comparable to the best that the
East	LOCATION	has produced ; in
Chicago	LOCATION	he established and conducted for a third of a century the foremost American journal of literary criticism the only journal of its class that has survived in any section of the country .

		We would not imply that he has accomplished these things single-handed ; his immediate help - ers have been able and devoted , and in later years he has not lacked practical support from some of those who have the cultural interests of 440 THE DIAL -LSB-
June	DATE	1
Chicago	LOCATION	most at heart .

		But he has been always the captain and standard-bearer of his own forlorn hopes ; upon him has fallen the brunt of the battle , and with him must rest chief honors for whatever of victory has been attained .

		Of the man 's personality , it would be futile to attempt any complete delineation here .

		Happily the task is made in large part superfluous by the portrait which is contained in this issue as a sup - plement .

		One need not be a student of human nature to read in this face the essential character - istics of the man , the kindliness and sincerity and fearlessness , the mingled strains of gentle - ness and strength , of idealism and practicality , of frankness and reserve , of tolerance and pride .

		Dowered with that best of all inheritances , the
New England	LOCATION	conscience and ideals , he held faithful to these through fifty years of struggle and discouragement , of ill-health and poverty .

		The `` gradual furnace of the world '' tempered and refined but never crumbled his spirit .

		It is amazing how even those with whom he came most casually in contact felt and retained the impress of his powerful personality .

		Those who knew him intimately invariably loved him .

		Poor as he always was in material things , he was rich beyond most in all that ministers to the spirit in friendships , the love of nature , the appreciation of literature , kinship with little children and with the humble of earth .

		His feeling for poetry was of a sort that now seems almost extinct in the world .

		Few have ever possessed such stores of it in memory ; few could recite it so well .

		With all the best of English and American verse he was thoroughly famil - iar ; but his favorites
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	,
Burns	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	, and
Tennyson	PERSON	he knew literally `` by heart . ''

		For Arnold the one poet , as he used to say , who never told untruths he had probably the strongest affection .

		In - deed , his character and habits of thought were in many ways closely akin to
Arnold 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		He had the same love of the normal , the sane , the democratic ; the same abhorrence for the fan - tastic , the far-fetched , the esoteric . ''

		The won - der and bloom of the world '' moved him as powerfully as they did Arnold ; crudity and rawness and ugliness , whether spiritual or mate - rial , revolted him no less strongly .

		His was the same `` sad lucidity of soul , '' and no less deter - minedly than Arnold he '' Wrought to erase from its depth Mist , and illusion , and fear . ''

		But along with this underlying seriousness went a vein of the purest humor .

		There were not many things that he loved better than a hearty laugh with a friend ; there were not many situa - tions so tense that he could not relieve them by an apt anecdote or a witty analogy .

		Herein he resembled Lincoln as strongly mentally as he did in physical appearance .

		Simplicity , sincerity , courage , persistency , these were the predominant notes in his char - acter .

		Almost equally marked , however , was a certain faculty of analytical insight which enabled him to realize at a glance , as it were , the true bearings and relationships of things , to arrive almost intuitively at the essential truth of a situation or a problem .

		This , in the ordinary concerns of life , seemed only a sort of inspired commonsense .

		But in the larger field of public affairs it amounted to an instinctive passion for justice which placed him constantly with the minority , but seldom led him astray .

		When four innocent men were legally sacrificed in
Chicago	LOCATION	to a public stampede of fear and revenge , he did all that one man could do to prevent the wrong .

		When the American press was hounding Governor
Altgeld	LOCATION	to death , he pre - pared for one of the English reviews a detailed vindication of the man and his official acts , which , flouted as it was at the time of its ap - pearance , now squares in nearly every statement with the generally accepted estimates .

		The sophistries by which our newspapers sought to justify the needless war with
Spain	LOCATION	did not blind him for a moment ; our misguided policy in
the Philippines	LOCATION	moved him to ceaseless protests from the first .

		These are but a few of many instances .

		Scarcely one of his judgments on the political events of his time has not since been verified ; scarcely one of his prophecies has failed of fulfilment .

		He was not one of those who could be silent when injustice was at work ; nor did he ever wait for his own thought to be echoed back to him by the crowd before speaking his mind .

		If the professional career of this man is to be fairly understood and appreciated , something must be said here of his chosen work with direct reference to its processes rather than its results .

		These processes are in the main occult to the general public .

		There are many popular con - ceptions of an editor 's duties , ranging from that of a numerous class who take him to be the person who addresses the wrappers in which they receive their paper , to that of a still more numerous class who picture him as one immersed in the tranquil absorption of literature varied by occasional intervals of composition .

		The reality is as far removed from the one as from the other of these innocent conceits .

		The edi -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 441 torial life is in actuality an endless round of correspondence and consultation , of proof-sheets and manuscript , of revision and recasting and recreating , of eternal vigilance for the present and ceaseless thought for the future , of tact and foresight and intuition in many vary ing relations .

		But it is a life by no means devoid of satisfac - tions and compensations .

		There is the joy of discovering latent talent , of encouraging and directing the efforts of young writers ; there are the enduring friendships that grow up out of the associations formed .

		Of the wearing , thankless drudgery of this life no one ever had more full or bitter experience than the editor of `` The Lakeside '' and THE DIAL ; but of its compensations , such as those we have named , he had also as full a share as any .

		A lover of the countryside , loathing turmoil and discord , caring beyond all else for peace and the cultured amenities of life , his lot was cast in the noisiest and least spiritual of all great cities .

		With the temperament of a poet and re - cluse , he was called upon to grapple incessantly with the sternest practicalities .

		Ill-health dogged him remorselessly , from the time he left the army to the day of his death .

		Poverty walked always at his elbow .

		Yet none of these circumstances ever gained the upper hand of his will , or ever turned him from his purposes .

		Through a long and troubled life , he never struck sail to a fear , either from without or from within .

		We have come to the end .

		Much that should be said has been omitted , and all that is said should have been set down more forcefully and eloquently .

		But with the sense of irreparable loss still fresh upon us , it is difficult to write as we would .

		Perhaps the portrait , and the tributes of his friends which follow , will fill the gaps and repair the weaknesses of this sketch .

		The simple essence of it all , for us , is that we have lost our leader , and know not how to go on with the fight .

		But it is impossible to feel that his spirit has been wholly withdrawn , that his far-seeing judgment and dauntless will are no longer to direct our efforts .

		The inspiration of that life will surely continue to support us in carrying forward the work which he began , though he himself be no longer a visible presence . ''

		O strong soul , by what shore Tarriest thou now ?

		For that force , Surely , has not been left vain !

		Somewhere , surely , afar , In the sounding labour-house vast Of being , is practised that strength , Zealous , beneficent , firm ! ''

		FROM THOSE WHO KNEW HIM .

		We are glad to share with our readers a few of the many tributes to the memory of
FRANCIS FISHER BROWNE	PERSON	that have reached us during the past two weeks .

		The short unsigned paragraphs are in nearly every case extracts from letters received from contributors to THE DIAL .

		Great causes moved him early , as the child And sire of poets moves .

		Seeking not fame , But liberty for others , bright the flame He lit , a lad , at War 's fierce torch and wild .

		This fadeless faith was his , kept undefiled Unto the end , its loveliness his aim Through all discouragement .

		Whatever came , His soul was his to spend , though fools reviled .

		And nobly was it spent !

		The stripling boy A soldier battling for the eternal right , Detesting war , yet glad in such a fight : The fearless man , in all good finding joy : He leaves an undimmed memory of light , Friendship , and justice ,
Time	ORGANIZATION	shall not destroy .

		WALLACE RICE .

		`` His memory is a precious possession to us all .

		Such men belong to the ` saving remnant ' of which Arnold wrote so eloquently ; they help save us from the vulgar and the unworthy .


Francis Browne	PERSON	never went with the great crowd either in politics or literature or religion .

		His keen sense of the real values in life kept him apart from the loud and scrambling multitude , and made him an inspiration to all persons of fine and heroic ideals .

		THE DIAL , which he founded and conducted so long , has been a distinct force in our higher civilization .

		He had one gift which I have never known equalled , and which probably was not possessed in the same manner by any other person of his time , I mean his prodigious capacity to absorb and repeat the best lyric poetry .

		His mind was a veritable anthology of all the best short poems in English and American literature .

		He did not have to memorize a poem as most of us do in order to retain it : he got it by a kind of spontaneous absorption , and it apparently required no effort of memory for him to recall it , it had become a part of the vital current of his life .

		I verily believe that without any apparent effort he could recite the greater part of the poetry contained in his selection called ` Golden Poems . ' ''

		And this wonderful capacity to retain the poetry of other people did not stand in the way of his pro- ducing many fine poems of his own .

		His father before him was a poet , and the sacred fire gained rather than lost in the keeping of the son .

		But I can not do justice to his many rare gifts in this hasty letter .

		I have lost a dear friend , and every person who cherishes a high and worthy ideal has lost a friend also . ''

		JOHN
BURROUGHS	LOCATION	.

		442 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	`` None of his friends was more truly and proudly his friend than I , or could have valued him more for those spiritual , intellectual , and moral qualities which in their peculiar concord rendered him unique in his time and place . ''


W. D. HOWELLS	PERSON	.

		`` As one who enjoyed his intimate friendship for thirty years , and was during that period in almost daily association with him , it seemed to me that the most striking characteristic of Mr.
Browne	PERSON	was his independence of judgment .

		This was displayed in matters of personal and public , no less than in those of literary , concern .

		I remember that once in the early days of our friendship we were speaking of a man conspicuous in public and social affairs the sort of man who sees that his name is kept well in the public eye , and who is regarded as a pillar of society when Mr.
Browne	PERSON	, a twinkle in his eye , asked me : ' Do you know that old seed ? '

		It sounded irreverent , and I was almost shocked for the moment , but I soon realized that it was precisely the estimate that had long been lurking in my own consciousness , and that I had never had the courage to express .

		From that time on , I acquired the habit of judging men , not by their repute , but by what was disclosed to my own discernment .

		It was his life-long habit thus to appraise character with his own eyes , and to reduce the artificially magnified personality to the scale of normal humanity .

		The popular author , the rhetorical clergyman , and the noisy politician , all underwent this searching scrutiny , and were considerably deflated in consequence .

		Concerning one of the latter class , who has since become much noisier than was even then to be anticipated , he said
just twenty years ago	DATE	, when asked for an opinion : ' I have long considered him a pest . '

		It was said with such deliberate finality that there could be nothing to add , but it left his hearers rather aghast , because it ran so utterly counter to the popular estimate .

		In his views upon public affairs in which a moral issue was involved , he was intransigeant , knowing that ` one with God is a majority , ' and holding , with
Ibsen	PERSON	, that majorities of the numerical kind are nearly always wrong when they pronounce upon the heated themes of current politics .

		Among the sub - jects which roused him to the hottest indignation were the outrage of the protective tariff , the shameful refusal of the Federal government to grant copyright to English authors , the selection of Blaine to be the standard-bearer of ` the party of moral ideas , ' the truculent Venezuelan message of President
Cleve	PERSON	- land , the wicked war with
Spain	LOCATION	, the subversion of our most cherished national principles in the sub - jugation of the Filipinos , and the brutal disregard of our national honor shown by the exemption clause of the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal act .

		Thus he was ranged among the free traders , was active in the work of the
Copyright League	ORGANIZATION	, became a despised mugwump in
1884	DATE	, and an anti-imperialistic ' traitor ' in
1898	DATE	.

		When the national protest against our Philippine policy was crystallized in the
Central Music Hall	ORGANIZATION	mass meeting in
Chicago	LOCATION	, Mr.
Browne	PERSON	was one of the leading spirits in the demonstration , and he was one of the most forceful members of the
Indianapolis	LOCATION	Convention held in
1900	DATE	to urge the cause of Filipino independence .

		I was working side by side with him in all these matters , and know how firmly they held possession of his mind and conscience , and how unswervingly he kept his moral rudder true through all these stormy years . '' ''

		I have never known another man who so inspired me to great thoughts and true living in combination .

		It seemed of him as of Chaucer 's good parson ` first he wrought and afterward he taught . '

		My visits to the office of THE DIAL through many years , and the many letters not long but to the point that he wrote me , concerning books or on abstract topics , have led me to know ' a Brahmin of the Brahmins ' a man made in the mould of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, whom for so long he so much resembled , yet having some of the finer and more delicate lines of personality more fully carved .

		I feel that a great light has gone from my own personal pathway , but even more that
Chicago	LOCATION	and the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	, and in truth the whole nation , have lost one of the truest and noblest preachers of truth and righteous - ness . ''

		`` He was the noblest man I have ever known , the bravest and most humanely human ... Ever back of his relentless eye for injustice and charlatanry , there was a Jovian knowledge of the impermanence of all evil , and the assured , though sorrowfully de - layed , triumph of the only eternal things .

		Love and Truth and Beauty ... He was , though his modesty and lack of assumption kept it from most ,
Chicago	LOCATION	's leading citizen the man who , when the real history of the time is written , will be known for what he was , a Pharos in a sea of gloom through a long formative generation . '' ''

		He seemed to me the ideal of a type of American scholar that we most need .

		His genial and yet re - served urbanity , his quiet forcefulness , above all , the pure , strong character that seemed to shine through him and illuminate his work , have had their influence upon the group of men whom he gathered about him , and upon American letters in the larger sense .

		Locally , he has done more , I believe , than any other man in
Chicago	LOCATION	to take away the reproach of our city 's rampant commer - cialism , and to bring about an appreciation of the better things of life .

		THE DIAL has been a veri - table beacon light . ''

		`` It is hard to realize how much we shall find lacking in life now that he is gone .

		... It was he that advised the collection of my scattered sheets and to publish my first book , and it was he that gave me courage to go on when I was doubtful about doing so .

		... There must be a great many who feel as I do that the world is richer and fuller for having known him and for having had the wonderful ad - vantage of his wise and calm judgment . ''

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 443 `` Among all the men I have ever known I can recall no one more open-minded or having clearer vision , no one more inflexible in adherence to all that is good , more truly appreciative of everything fine and uplifting .

		But beyond all these qualities was the charm of his personality .

		He was a man one could not know well without loving .

		There is no one whose friendship I valued more highly , and for me the world will be a less desirable place without him . '' ''

		Such a passing means much even to those who never saw his face or heard his voice , but who had come to rest upon his sound scholarship and critical judgment , and who loved the strong and beautiful use he made of the English language , whose purity he so zealously guarded . ''

		`` It was never my privilege to meet him , but his kindly and helpful letters , his encouragement at a time when encouragement was precious to me : these I shall never forget . '' ''

		I never met him but once , and then only for a half hour ; but from my twenty years ' association with him in THE DIAL , I had come to have a feel - ing of personal affection as well as high respect for him .

		Strength and gentleness must have been blended in him as they are in few men .

		And I believe that few men in
America	LOCATION	in recent times have done a more important work a work , indeed , considering the circumstances , almost incredible .

		How many in this country have tried to establish a journal of pure criticism and he alone suc - ceeded ! ''

		`` My acquaintance with him was virtually re - stricted to a fifteen-minute chat in his office two years ago ; but even in those brief minutes I was greatly impressed with his large sympathy and a mellow wisdom that did not seem quite of the twentieth century . ''

		`` He was a man of a sort the world has too few of .

		What he did for sound literature in founding THE DIAL is incalculable in this Philistine Age .

		It is his monument . '' ''

		Though the fates seem to have decreed that we should not see each other face to face , I have a deep sense of the loss of a personal friend .

		I have a number of letters from him , each having its per - sonal touch , as though written to someone to whom he was related by something far more than a mere professional tie .

		And THE DIAL , as it has come to me , has always made me feel that it bore a personal message . '' ''

		To anyone who had the privilege of knowing him , even as slightly as I did , his death means a very real loss .

		He will always be remembered not only as the father of THE DIAL , but as a man of rare scholarship and charm . '' ''

		I feel glad and honored to have known him , even if only by correspondence .

		From the first -LRB- which is now seventeen years ago or more -RRB- I was impressed with his high ideals in his chosen vocation , his delightful and always kindly humor , his unfailing patience and courtesy with the shortcomings of young contributors , and his mastery of terse and aptly ex - pressive English .

		More than once I have noted with admiration the deft editorial correction in my own manuscript ... His loss will be felt as a personal bereavement by more than can be counted . ''

		`` I esteem it a great privilege to have been permitted to cooperate with him even in a slight manner .

		The brief notes which he has sent me from time to time I shall cherish .

		He served a noble and beautiful ideal .

		Such a life is a sugges - tion to take courage . '' ''

		I am impressed by the value to a hurried age of his steadfast and true adherence to a purpose .

		In an environment in which slowness is a ban , and time reduced to a monetary standard , a Dial point - ing to the permanent values in which true progress is recorded and reflected is the most serviceable of public regulations . ''

		`` He has , through THE DIAL , done more than anyone else to keep me alive and out of a rut . ''

		`` Ever since I have known him , he has seemed to me to be
Sidney	PERSON	's pattern of a gentleman one of ` high-erected thoughts seated in the heart of courtesy . '

		His loyalty to reason and conscience , unabated valiancy , and gentle humor have made his friends and the world richer during many years . '' ''

		While my acquaintance with him was compara - tively slight , he inspired me as he did everyone with the greatest respect for his wide sympathies , his high tone , and unfailing poise .

		It was a great achieve - ment to establish the purest literary journal in this country , and to do it in the camp of the Philistines . ''

		`` I have long thought of him as standing with Mr.
Alden	PERSON	, the last representatives of a long line of scholars and gentlemen of that elder , perhaps finer , day . ''

		`` More truly than
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	, he was the ` last leaf of that magnificent cluster . '' ''

		He did so much necessary and important work that no one else seemed able to do , that we can hardly hope to find another like him .

		All men are unique in some measure ; but he , standing out in the history of the intellectual life of our time , will I think appear especially and peculiarly so . ''

		`` This is rather a moment in which to rejoice that for so long we had that fine spirit with us and that he was spared to fulfil his unique function in the upbuilding of our culture .

		A history of Amer - ican literature that does not accord him recognition will be incomplete . '' ''

		An honored friend , a great force for good life and literature , a true and noble man , has entered into the higher life .

		He won a high place in Amer - ican life by his exquisite taste , his sound judgment , his gracious spirit , and his untiring devotion to the best that is written . ''

		444 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE INTELLECTUAL APPEAL IN LITERATURE meets , of course , with far less ready response , the world over , than the sensational , or the sentimental , or the erotic , or many another of a considerable remove from the appeal of the highest order ; hut it is far from being a negligible factor among the qualities that yearly cause so many thousands of books to find purchasers and readers .

		Mr.
R. A. Scott-James	PERSON	, in a scholarly dissertation on `` Popu - larity in Literature , '' published in the
May	DATE	`` North American Review , '' divides the reading public into five classes , but without claiming that these classes are exhaustive or mutually exclusive .

		They con - sist , `` firstly , of those , whose love of sensation is satisfied by violent incident ; and secondly , of those who are especially susceptible to the sentimental appeal .

		To a third class belong those who take pleasure in the agitations of sex feeling ; and to a fourth , those whose sense of humor is tickled by the sallies of the literary clown .

		The fifth class a very large one consists of those who are of a habit of mind to be excited by sensations which can be associated with religion and morality . ''

		Then he adds : '' It is useless to name as a sixth class those who are moved by intellectual ideas , for so small a class is not the objective of the popular author . ''

		This is too pessimistic a view of the reading public 's literary tastes .

		Unquestionably Eugene Sue and Mrs.
Southworth	PERSON	and
Josh Billings	PERSON	have had more readers than
Friedrich Hegel	PERSON	and
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	and
Walter Pater	PERSON	; but if Mr.
Scott	PERSON	-
James	PERSON	's sixth class is as inconsiderable as he avers , how account for the large circulation attained by such authors as , for instance ,
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	and , in his historical writings ,
John Fiske	PERSON	, not to mention
Ruskin	PERSON	in a somewhat earlier time , and
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	in one .

		still more remote ?

		This cultured sixth class is far enough from being of vast dimen - sions , but signs are not wanting that its size is respectable and is increasing .

		A BOOK-TESTING LABORATORY , properly organized and equipped and operated , would be of as great use in its way as is the laboratory for testing the strength or purity of materials used in the industries and arts .

		Such an institution , to be known as a Bureau of Re - view , will some day be established in the interests of book-buyers , and especially of those buyers for the people , the public libraries , if Mr.
George Iles	PERSON	's recent address before the
New York State Library School	ORGANIZATION	evokes the response it deserves .

		The details of his plan are to be found in full in the pamphlet report of his discourse now obtainable from
Albany	LOCATION	, and only one or two important points can here be touched upon .

		Means are considered by which prompt and authori - tative verdicts on current publications could be ob - tained by the proposed bureau for the guidance of librarians and others interested . ''

		In promoting the buying as well as the borrowing of books , '' Mr. lies remarks , '' public libraries are cultivating a field which will steadily broaden year by year . ''

		Ad - mission is frankly made of the significant fact that even expert critics not infrequently differ diamet - rically in their estimates of a book 's value ; and the question is considered whether the most trustworthy guide to the would-be purchaser might not take the form of a colorless statement of the book 's plan and method and contents , with neither laudatory nor condemnatory addition .

		The value of this projected
Bureau of Review	ORGANIZATION	in discouraging the publication of worthless books and in encouraging that of useful books is of course apparent .

		Already , as Mr. lies observes , the cornerstone to such an edifice as he proposes has been laid in the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	's annual annotated booklist of about fifteen hundred titles .

		How soon the structure will be completed remains to be seen .

		READINGS FROM THE BOOK OF NATURE are not every day so attractively presented as in Mr.
Truman A. De Weese	PERSON	's book for the
summer	DATE	, `` The Bend in the Road , '' recently noticed in more formal manner by us .

		Mr.
De Weese	PERSON	, we are told , learned the printer 's trade in earlier life and then interested himself in journalism , and it may have been confinement to the close quarters and exacting duties of the printing office and the editorial chair that has made him in later years so ardent a lover of the spacious joys of out-door life in the country .

		In the following passage there speaks the delight of the city man escaping from the city 's din and the city 's newspapers .

		`` He learns to love the silences of Nature .

		After listening to the hum of bees and the sweet music of the waving corn he begins to realize the emptiness and dullness of much of the human chatter that fills city homes and city clubs with noise .

		In the country he has time to read and think and plan .

		He has the time and the mood for introspection .

		He gets a chance to sound the depths of his own being .

		He does n't read a newspaper while he tosses a breakfast of coffee and rolls into his tired stomach .

		He has a quickening sense of the uselessness of the piffle with which newspapers are filled , and he acquires a genuine pity for the poor devils who have nothing else to read .

		After reading in the book of Nature all week he can go out under the quiet , restful shade of an apple tree on
Sunday	DATE	and read a printed book that is really worth while . ''

		The author 's chapters entitled `` A Sermon in Apple Trees , '' `` Why I Love an Apple Tree , '' and `` Pastoral Pictures '' are especially good .

		THE EXPECTED COMPLETION OF THE OXFORD DICTIONARY , and with it the rest from his labors of the veteran lexicographer who has already devoted more than thirty years to his task , is now set with some confidence by Sir
James Murray	PERSON	himself at four years hence .

		`` I have got to the stage , '' he is reported as saying , `` when I can estimate the end .

		In all probability the dictionary will be finished on
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 445 my eightieth birthday , four years from now .

		My colleagues , Dr.
Bradley	PERSON	and Dr.
Craigie	PERSON	, are busy with 'S , ' and I have penetrated into the
second half of ` T	DATE	, ' which I expect to complete in two years .

		By that time the three of us will be at liberty for the last six letters of the alphabet . ''

		Expected at first to fill eight large volumes , the work has , espe - cially in its latter portions , developed an unforeseen bulkiness which even ten volumes can scarcely be found capable of compassing .

		The error of calcu - lation is attributed largely to the fact that existing dictionaries , used as a basis for the estimate , reveal a tendency to hurry and scamp their work toward the end , probably from a natural weariness in the workers and an equally natural impatience in the publishers .

		But in the Oxford undertaking no such childish haste will be tolerated .

		The lexicographer - in-chief pays deserved tribute to his American collab - orators , and among them he mentions especially the librarians of the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	and of the
Boston Athenaeum	LOCATION	, who have been zealous and diligent in looking up and copying desired pas - sages in American books not accessible in
England	LOCATION	.

		THE PROBLEM OF THE UNSOLD BOOK , the book that cumbers the shelves of the retail dealer until at last it goes to the `` remainder '' counter or the `` second-hand '' stall , where it begs for purchase at an inglorious reduction of price , and is perhaps finally disposed of at a tenth part of its original reputed value , is one that Mr.
William H. Arnold	PERSON	, speaking at the recent conference of the
American Booksellers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	, suggests might be solved by allowing the retailer to return to the publisher or jobber any copies of a work left on his hands after one year from the time of purchase , a credit check for ninety per cent of the purchase price to be given him in exchange .

		No goods are more uncertain as to selling qualities than books , and the most unex - pected surpluses and shortages are a part of the daily experience of a bookseller in the handling of his stock .

		It is argued that this proposed plan would tend to discourage the now too-abundant issue of works of questionable excellence , and losses from over-production would be diminished .

		To make up for any loss to the publisher occasioned by this re - demption of unsold copies , Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	suggests an increased wholesale price , with a consequent slight increase in the retail price ; and he feels assured that the innovation , by removing the dread of unsold stock , would infuse fresh life into the bookselling business .

		No formal action on the proposal was taken , but it seems not unlikely that this seedcorn of suggestion may yield fruit in the near future .

		LITERATURE AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR LIFE is of little worth , as Miss
Corinne Bacon	PERSON	, efficient head of the
Drexel Institute Library School	ORGANIZATION	,
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia , wittily and convincingly pointed out in her recent address delivered before the
Pennsylvania Library Club	ORGANIZATION	and now published in `` The Library Journal . ''

		After citing the late lively tilt between Mr.
Dana	PERSON	and THE DIAL over the `` great-books superstition , '' she declares her willingness to go even further than the
Newark	LOCATION	librarian on the highway of heresy and ask why it is necessarily a good thing for one to read at all . ''

		Is there anything sacrosanct about print ?

		Why is it a virtue to read ?

		It takes more intelligence to make a dress , to cook and serve a dinner which is both nourishing and appetizing , or to make a piece of arts and crafts fur - niture , than it does to read many a book .

		Would not some of us be more genuine , more original , if we dealt more with first-hand things than with second - hand thoughts ?

		At the best , books are but a substi - tute for life . ''

		Unquestionably ; and
Miss Bacon	ORGANIZATION	does well to warn us , both in apt phrase of her own and in pertinent quotation from Mr.
Harold Gorst	PERSON	, of the danger of thinking with other people 's brains .

		But though literature without life would be chosen by no sensible person in preference to life without literature , the necessity of choice between these awful alternatives is forced upon very few of us , and we shall therefore continue to enjoy both life and literature in company with
Miss Bacon	ORGANIZATION	and others of the elect for whom existence is so immeasurably enriched by the best things that have been thought and said by men and women in the past .

		RECENT PRISON POETRY is enriched with a con - tribution from the son of the author of `` The Scarlet Letter , '' who is at present an involuntary guest of the government at
Atlanta	LOCATION	.

		As editor , pro tern. , of the prison paper , he has accepted from himself and published the following touching lines : '' In the cell over mine at night A step goes to and fro ; From barred door to iron wall , From wall to door I hear it go , Four paces heavy and slow , In the heart of the sleeping jail ; And the goad that drives I know . ''

		I never saw his face nor heard him speak ; He may be Dutchman ,
Dago	LOCATION	,
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	, Greek ; But tl : e language of that prison 'd step Too well I know ; Unknown brother of remorseless bars , Pent IE your cage from earth and sky and stars , The hunger for lost life that goads you so I also know . ''

		Is this an intentional or an accidental echo of Mr.
Arturo Giovannitti	PERSON	's prison verses entitled `` The Walker , '' penned in the seclusion of the jail at
Lawrence	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, and already quoted in part by us ?

		Two significant lines of the Italo-American poet 's `` jerked English '' -LRB- to borrow Mr.
Wallace Rice	PERSON	's expressive term -RRB- run thus : '' I hear footsteps over my head all night .

		They come one eternity in four paces and they go one eternity in four paces , and between the coming and the going there is Silence and Night and the Infinite . ''

		Like causes have been known to produce like effects , and the
Atlanta	LOCATION	poem may be wholly original ; but if not , it is none the less rather , all the more interesting .

		446 THE DIAL -LSB- J une THE SPACIOUS DOMAIN OF LIBRARY SCIENCE has seldom had the fact of its amplitude more strikingly illustrated than in the programme of the late joint meeting of the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	Library Clab , the
Berkshire Library Club	ORGANIZATION	, and the Western
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts
Library Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		Assembling at
Williamstown	LOCATION	under the auspices of the college which there has its seat , the librarians of the
Bay State	ORGANIZATION	were for three days -LRB- May 22-24 -RRB- stimulated and refreshed by such speakers as President
Harry A. Garfield	PERSON	, who made the address of welcome ; Mr.
John A. Lowe	PERSON	, the college librarian , who appropriately considered the relation of public libraries to college libraries ; Pro- fessor
Carroll Lewis Maxcy	PERSON	, who spoke on
Artemus Ward	ORGANIZATION	; Mr.
John Foster Carr	PERSON	-LRB- author of the useful `` Guide to the United States for Immigrants '' -RRB- , who treated the subject , `` What the Library Can Do for Our Foreign-born '' ;
Miss J. Maud Campbell	PERSON	, who told '' What the Foreigner has Done for One Library '' ; Mr.
William B. Clarke	PERSON	, the
Boston	LOCATION	pub - lisher , whose topic was `` The Business of Book - selling '' ; Mr.
Harlan H. Ballard	PERSON	, who discussed '' Cooperation in Library Work '' ; Miss
Mafred N. Rice	PERSON	, who gave an illustrated talk on story-telling ; and
Miss Zaidee Brown	PERSON	, agent of the
State Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, whose remarks concerned themselves with '' Librarians , Trustees , and the Field Agent , '' and who also conducted a round-table session for questions and answers .

		Miss Ruby
Tillinghast	PERSON	's book-mending demonstration should not pass un - mentioned , nor Mr.
Charles R. Green	PERSON	's roll-call of libraries , evoking two-minute responses on '' The Most Interesting Thing Done in our Library the Past Year . ''

		Mountain excursions , to the top of
Greylock	ORGANIZATION	and over
Hoosac Mountain	LOCATION	, were among the less strictly intellectual exercises planned for the occasion .

		* THE LITERARY REMAINS OF
HENRY REED	PERSON	, pro- fessor of rhetoric and English literature at the Uni - versity of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	from
1834	DATE	to
1854	DATE	, have just been given to the library of that institution , and are considered a valuable gift by reason of Professor
Reed	PERSON	's eminence in his department of learning and the interesting nature of the manuscripts that he left behind him , which include many unpublished lectures and other autograph matter of importance .

		Reed 's activity in introducing
Wordsworth	PERSON	to Amer - ican readers in an American edition for which he wrote a preface gives significance to the poet 's letter included among the papers now made accessible to the scholarly public .

		Other interesting letters and an unpublished lecture on
Walter Scott	PERSON	are named as of peculiar value .

		English literature students are familiar with
Reed	ORGANIZATION	's published `` Lectures on English Literature from Chaucer to
Tennyson	PERSON	, '' his `` Lectures on English History and Tragic Poetry as Illustrated by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, '' and his `` Lectures on the British Poets . ''

		As editor he was responsible for many use - ful works , including especially the American reprint of Lord
Mahon	PERSON	's `` History of
England	LOCATION	, ''
Thomas Arnold	PERSON	's `` Lectures on Modern History , '' and
Gra	ORGANIZATION	- ham 's `` English Synonyms . ''

		But his literary in - dustry , both as author and editor , was too great to receive due tribute here .

		Some still living will re - call the tragic circumstances of his untimely death how he sailed for
England	LOCATION	on the ill-fated `` Arctic , '' which was lost at sea
September 27 , 1854	DATE	.

		MlSAPPRECIATION OF HUMOROUS LITERATURE has been carried to great lengths on the part of long-faced and literal-minded critics , as illustrated by some of the solemnly adverse judgments pro- nounced on Mark Twain 's '' Innocents Abroad '' at the first appearance of that jocund work .

		But prob - ably few have attained to that degree of immunity from the attacks of humor that was reached by the scholarly and dignified
Charles Sumner	PERSON	.

		When
Longfellow	LOCATION	, as Mr.
Henry Cabot	PERSON	Lodge tells us in the
June	DATE	instalment of his early reminiscences now appearing in '' Scribner 's Magazine , '' presented
Sumner	PERSON	with a copy of `` The Biglow Papers , '' fresh from the press , that eminent statesman seems to have applied himself to
Lowell	PERSON	's rollicking verse in much the same state of mind as one would bring to bear on
Milton	PERSON	's '' Paradise Lost '' or Klopstock 's '' Messiah . ''

		As Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	tells the story , '' it was a rainy afternoon and Mr.
Longfellow	PERSON	was obliged to go out , leaving Sumner stretched on the sofa read - ing
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's volume .

		When he returned he asked Sumner how he liked the poems , and Sumner re - plied : ' They are admirable , very good indeed , but why does he spell his words so badly ? '


Longfellow	PERSON	said that he attempted to explain that the poems were purposely written in the
New England	LOCATION	dialect , but Sumner could not understand . ''

		And yet Sum - ner was as much a
New Englander	LOCATION	as
Lowell	LOCATION	or
Longfellow	LOCATION	.

		BOOKS , BOILERS , AND BUNKERS , as we read in the current annual report of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, are getting mixed together in a distressing promis - cuity in the stately building that for eighteen years has been the pride of
Copley Square	LOCATION	.

		Erected a comparatively short time ago at a cost of more than
two million dollars	MONEY	, and expected to meet the demands made upon its space for at least one generation , the structure is already so pressed for stack-room that even the cellar , where no sane librarian would by choice store any of the books committed to his keep - ing , has been used to catch a part of the overflow from the stacks , and branches have been forced to give storage to some of the less actively circulating volumes .

		All this makes for confusion and vexation and several other sorts of harm .

		Will our library building committees ever learn the supreme necessity of providing ample space for book-stacks ?

		The homely
New England	LOCATION	rule about sweetening rhubarb pies -LRB- put in sugar till you 're scared , and then add as much more -RRB- would apply , mutatis mutandis , in designing the stack-room of a public library . ''

		Build ye more stately mansions , '' is the lesson taught not only by the chambered nautilus , but by the congested public library .


1913	DATE	-RSB- 447 A LITTLE INSTANCE OF TIME 'S REVENGES has been recalled in connection with the recent marriage of a daughter of the late
John Fiske	PERSON	.

		In the days of his own courtship , and while he was still an under - graduate at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	,
Fiske	PERSON	became known too well known for the harmony of his own relations with the college faculty as an enthusiastic
Darwin	PERSON	- ian ; and at the very time when he was writing his early article on Buckle for magazine publication , with the young lady of his choice much in his mind to lighten his labor -LRB- as he afterward assured her when he sent her a copy of the lucubration -RRB- , he had the misfortune to be caught reading in church instead of listening to the sermon , and was summoned before the faculty to face not only this charge , but also the accumulated evidences of his conversion to
Darwin	PERSON	- ism .

		He was let off , however , with an admonition and a threat of summary expulsion if he did not in future refrain from airing his too-advanced views .

		The humor of the situation appears when it is borne in mind that those very views , which afterward con - tributed so large a part to his reputation as a writer , were the ones he was called back to
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	to expound under its auspices less than ten years after he had almost suffered expulsion for holding them .

		A LITEKAKY WORKER LITTLE KNOWN TO FAME , but possessed of accomplishments and abilities far above the ordinary , died
May 13	DATE	at
Plainfield	LOCATION	,
N. J. William Henry Larrabee	PERSON	, author of '' How the World Was Made , '' '' Earthquakes and Volcanoes , '' '' Edu - cation through the Agency of Religious Organiza - tion , '' and other books , was born at
Alfred	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, in
1829	DATE	, and was graduated in
1845	DATE	from De
Pauw University	ORGANIZATION	, before it had ceased to be called
Asbury University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Like so many other men of letters , he was a lawyer by profession but never practiced , choosing the more congenial field of literature and scholarship and editorship .

		School-teaching , farm - management , and newspaper work preceded his editorial connection with '' The Popular Science Monthly , '' which he served as translator and assist - ant editor up to
1900	DATE	.

		Many encyclopaedia articles came from his busy pen , and his useful activities included also a term of service as trustee of the
Plainfield Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is said to have had a mastery of seventeen languages , and he was a great traveller .

		... THE INCREASING VOGUE OF
BROWNING	PERSON	seems to receive striking proof in the extraordinary price paid in
London	LOCATION	recently for an early and rare edition of the poet 's youthful production , `` Pauline , '' a poem filling but eight pages in the
Cambridge Edition of Browning	LOCATION	, and probably read about as seldom as any piece of his that could be named .

		A sum equiv - alent to twenty-four hundred dollars in our money is said to have changed hands when this early speci - men of
Browning	PERSON	's art was offered for sale .

		At about the same time a packet of five hundred or more of the
Browning	PERSON	love-letters , of which so much has of late been written and said , passed under the auc - tioneer 's hammer in
London	LOCATION	, and elicited bids that started at six hundred pounds and then rose by suc - cessive steps of fifty to six thousand five hundred and fifty pounds , or nearly
thirty-three thousand dollars	MONEY	.

		The outcry of outraged sentiment over the public sale of these letters , even though the letters themselves virtually became public property when they were published years ago , is not unnatural .

		Pounds sterling in exchange for the heartbeats of two poet-lovers !

		`` To what base uses we may re - turn , Horatio ! ''

		... THE AUTHORS ' LEAGUE OF
AMERICA	LOCATION	now takes its place beside the Authors ' Society of
England	LOCATION	and La Soctite des
Gens de Lettres of France	ORGANIZATION	.

		HAUPTMANN 'S `` ATLANTIS ' NOBEL PRIZE .

		AND THE -LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The extraordinary distinction given
Gerhart Haupt	PERSON	- mann 's novel '' Atlantis '' by the conference upon the author of the Nobel prize for the greatest idealistic work of literature of the year
1912	DATE	warrants more searching examination than the shrinking or perfunctory comment it has in most cases received on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	. ''

		Atlantis '' is the story of the foundering of a Hamburg-American liner in mid-ocean , as chief back - ground for three months out of the life of a German doctor , aged thirty-one , who leaves his wife in an insane asylum and his three young children in the guardianship of his parents , in order to pursue across the sea a danseuse of sixteen .

		They are rescued from the waves and reach
New York	LOCATION	, where he yields a few days to his passion and compels her to yield .

		Later he meets a woman art student , who gives him good advice and nurses him through a spell of typhoid .

		His insane wife having meanwhile opportunely died , he marries the art student in mid-ocean on the return voyage to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Off-hand one is inclined to say that one would not care to make the closer acquaintance of such a person as this hero , even when introduced by the author of '' Die Weber '' and '' Die versunkene Glocke , '' the fore - most contemporary German dramatist ^ But since the
Stockholm Academy	ORGANIZATION	has given
Frederick von Kamma	PERSON	- cher such a good letter of introduction and we are 448 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	likely to meet him iu society , it is important to know more about him and to be able to take one 's position regarding him and his friends .

		He was aware that he had reached a crisis in his life . ''

		He was not one of those who enter upon this crisis unconsciously .

		... It seemed to him that he had worked hitherto with other people 's bands , according to other people 's wills , guided rather than guiding ... ' Now I will walk with my own feet , look with my own eyes , think my own thoughts , and act from the plenary power of my own will . '

		...
Frederick	PERSON	had been dis - illusioned in his deep-seated altruism , which until now had completely dominated him . ''

		It would be better for our judgment of
Frederick	PERSON	if his friend the author had not made these declarations regarding him .

		If we could believe that he were the helpless bee ensnared by the irresistible fascination of the gallows-spider , the dancer Ingigerd , we might have some pity for him , though we must needs regard him as very weak .

		But having been assured that he was determined to take every step of his own will and he is thirty-one there is no excuse for him .

		As to his deep-seated altruism , the only act cited in evidence is the remission to an old friend dying of consumption of a debt of
$ 750	MONEY	, while the running away from his insane wife and his three children does not comport with a Philistine idea of altruism .

		Again , the author describes the traits of his hero : `` Though
Frederick	PERSON	had never been ill , there were times when he showed symptoms of a peculiar passionateness .

		His friends knew that when all went well he was a dor - mant volcano ; that when things did not go well he was a volcano spitting fire and smoke .

		To all appearances equally removed from effeminacy and brutality , he was subject nevertheless to attacks of both .

		Now and then a dithyrambic rapture came over him , especially when there was wine in his blood ; he would pace about , and if it were daytime , might address a pathetic , sonorous invocation to the sun , or at night , to the constellations , particularly to the chaste Cassiopeia . ''

		Frederick had first seen Ingigerd in
Berlin	LOCATION	in a sym - bolic dance called ''
Mara	PERSON	, or the Spider 's Web . ''

		He had attended this performance nineteen times , enough , one would say , to indicate his lack of judgment and self-control , and enough to make him a monomaniac , if it does not prove him to have been one already .

		The dance is plainly intended to symbolize the relation of Frederick to Ingigerd , she being the spider and he the bee .

		In fact , however , the relation is more like that of hawk to hare , with
Frederick	PERSON	in the former role .

		Although she is surrounded by a coterie of admirers , Ingigerd promptly suspects
Frederick	PERSON	's purpose in com - ing aboard .

		Before the ship is three days out he has made himself a subject for ribald jest in the smoking - room .

		In
Mara	PERSON	's presence he is alternately burning with lust and frothing with wrath at himself for being attached to so slight a thing .

		She , in turn , has felt '' that his propinquity was by no means lacking in dan - ger for herself . ''

		Nevertheless , at their first personal conference she tells him of her past `` in a series of con - fidences of such shocking content as to be worthy of a
Lais	PERSON	or a Phryne , '' and Frederick '' found himself con - fronting the knowledge of a childhood so outrageous as to be worse than anything he had met with in his experi - ences as a physician . ''

		This disturbed him so that he could not sleep , but did not prevent his exchanging fiery glances with a Russian Jewess the next morning , as he accompanied the ship 's doctor on a tour of the steerage .

		That evening , the Jewess , having applied to the doctor for professional treatment , is turned over to
Frederick	PERSON	, who honors his love for Ingigerd and dishonors his pro- fession by committing fornication with the helpless and ignorant girl .

		Whereupon , ''
Frederick	PERSON	went on deck , where the exalted impression of the starry heavens shin - ing over the infinite expanse of the ocean , purified him , as it were . '' ''

		He was neither by
Nature	ORGANIZATION	nor by habit a
Don Juan	PERSON	and it astonished him that the unusual and surprising adventure seemed to him the most natural thing in the world . ''

		Probably this is one of the pas - sages which gave the
Stockholm	LOCATION	Academy the impres - sion of towering idealism .

		The descriptions of
Frederick	PERSON	's fellow-passengers are in many cases clever , though they give a sombre impression of humanity , if this shipload were to pass for an average .

		Practically all the men who interest the author , save the captain and a few of the officers , are erotomaniacs their relations with the other sex dominated by physical appetite which seems to know nothing of the restraints of civilization but is con - strained only by the limits of opportunity .

		There is
Achleitner	PERSON	, the
Vienna	LOCATION	architect , who has come on board for the same reason as
Frederick ; Stoss	PERSON	, the armless marksman , who admits having '' fallen under suspicion with Ingigerd '' ;
Fuellenberg	ORGANIZATION	, a
Berlin	LOCATION	ac - quaintance of
Frederick	PERSON	, who the first day out acts as masseur to an English woman who `` has a husband in
London	LOCATION	and probably another in
New York	LOCATION	'' ;
Hahlstroem	LOCATION	, Ingigerd 's father , who is exploiting her grace and willing to exploit her virtue , if she has any ; Ingigerd herself , who says she '' would rather be dis - reputable ten times over and live as she please '' ;
Frau Liebling	PERSON	, leaving her husband behind so that they may be divorced ;
Toussaint	PERSON	the sculptor , and
Fleischmann	PERSON	the painter , both mediocre , conceited , and mercenary ;
Wilke	PERSON	a steerage passenger , an old friend of
Frederick	PERSON	's , represented as a wild beast , but really much more of a man than
Frederick	PERSON	; a languishing Creole Canadian , with an attendant Yankee jackanapes who builds bonfires of matches on the saloon table until the captain interferes .

		Verily an aggregation of idealists !

		When the ship is in danger
Frederick	PERSON	can not believe that God will cut off the lives of so many peo - ple ; but so far as
Hauptmann	PERSON	's report of them goes , the Lord had the same reason for action as in the case of Sodom and Gomorrah .

		The most successful and most nearly plausible and truthful parts of the book are the descriptions of the storm and of the foundering of the `` Roland . ''

		A German reviewer has said that a correct title for `` Atlantis '' would be : '' Experiences on a Transatlantic Steamer , with a Description of a Shipwreck . ''


Haupt	PERSON	- mann 's power as a reporter is undeniable , and examples are unnecessary .

		It is not the realist
Hauptmann	PERSON	we are taking note of , but the representative of supreme idealism .

		Two-thirds of the book are devoted to the sea trip , while the remaining one hundred pages are occupied with
Frederick	PERSON	's adventures in
New York City	LOCATION	and in
Meriden	LOCATION	, where he has the typhoid attack .

		On landing ,
Frederick	PERSON	and Ingigerd with him , for her father was among the lost and
Frederick	PERSON	has assumed a sort of protectorate over her , are con - ducted by a former student of
Frederick	PERSON	's to a Bohemian club-house , where late the following morning he finds himself alone with Ingigerd . ''

		In that moment Fred - erick comprehended the passionate speech of his body and sanctioned its demands .

		... In the seductive
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 449 silence of the morning in this unfamiliar house it sud - denly assumed an elemental , indomitable force ... At last the time had come to extinguish the fires tor - menting him , in one wild , greedy draught .

		With the hoarse cry of a wild beast he threw himself deep into the slowly , slowly cooling and liberating waves of love . ''

		Within thirty-six hours from this idealistic episode
Frederick	PERSON	has experienced '' a storm of desire for self - purification , '' has assured Ingigerd that '' the sight of her had given renewed value to life , '' has bathed in the waves again , has met
Eva Burns	PERSON	, to whom at their second meeting he confides his unhappy domestic his - tory , including disagreements which he and his wife had had over the question of having children , and also his relations with Ingigerd , and has determined to enter the art studio where
Eva	PERSON	is working .

		After a week of what he calls struggles , seeing Ingigerd every day and talking of idealistic art life with
Eva	PERSON	,
Fred	PERSON	- erick decides to complete the weaning from
Ingigerd which Eva	ORGANIZATION	has begun by running away , just as
Gabriel Schilling	PERSON	did in
Hauptmann	LOCATION	's drama .

		At
Meriden	LOCATION	,
Eva Burns	PERSON	visits him , on her own initiative , it seems , arriving just in time to take care of him in the typhoid attack .

		On his recovery she goes back to
New York	LOCATION	without having done more than laugh at
Frederick	PERSON	's shy question whether '' we five he , she , and his three children could end their lives in peace in a little studio near
Florence	LOCATION	. ''

		But before sailing for
England	LOCATION	, where she is called by business affairs , she goes out to
Meriden	LOCATION	again , takes a long walk with
Frederick	PERSON	and brings him back happy , '' to their own surprise these two human beings had been penetrated by a new ele - ment and a new life . ''

		When , after
Frederick	PERSON	's recovery from typhoid , his friend Dr.
Schmidt	PERSON	remarked , '' A forced cure , a violent eruption and revolution has purged your body of all poisons and putrid matter , '' it was doubtless intended to symbolize a similar purification of soul through the in - fluence of
Eva Burns	PERSON	.

		Believe it who can .

		I do not like to betray doubts of the ultimate redemption of any human soul ; but I must say that the cure seems to me sudden .

		I should say that it would take a century or two .

		The powerful and truthful portrayal of a bad char - acter may justly be undertaken by a great artist , although it is unfortunate to make a weak or bad person the centre of interest in a novel that is to appeal to the general reading public .

		But the portrayal of
Frederick von Kammacher	PERSON	can not be called either powerful or truthful .

		He is weak at the beginning and weak he remains .

		His religious reflections , as , for instance , that God will surely not think of destroying so large a number of talented people as are on the '' Roland , '' are childish .

		His conception of art is anything but idealistic .

		His shifts from lust to lofty sentiment are impossible in their suddenness .

		His supposed conversion to nobler aims is absolutely unconvincing .

		No sane judge of human na - ture would trust the welfare of a woman in his hands .

		Neurotic , erotic , with a mind full of foul memories and an evil habitude established , he can promise nothing but hell for poor
Eva Burns	PERSON	.

		But she goeth to her death as the fool goeth .


Gerhart Hauptmann	PERSON	in '' Atlantis '' has entered into the shady realm of the worst of French naturalism , as did Sudermann in `` Das hohe Lied , '' but with much less art and much less justification .

		Sudermann 's book por - trays the downfall of a poor middle-class girl and the almost insuperable difficulty of recovery ; a portrayal that reveals the lure of sin and the constraint of poverty for the girl but not with any lure for the reader .


Haupt	PERSON	- mann portrays the selfishness , the weakness , the lust of a vacillating character , and would fain have us believe that this character is revolutionized by admiration for a new face and a self-reliant bearing .

		The author of '' Die versunkene Glocke '' might have won the Nobel prize .

		It is an affront to clean art and clean morals to award it to the author of '' Atlantis . ''

		EX LIBRA ET LIBRIS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It is pleasant , after undertaking the disagreeable duty of adverse criticism , to have the need for it attested by numerous expressions of approval , such as I have re - ceived , but even more to find the person criticized in substantial agreement with my strictures ; not only is the justice of the attack thereby bespoken , but in an even greater degree the open-mindedness and mag - nanimity of the one censured .

		I have little but praise , therefore , for the answer of the editor of '' Poetry '' to my observations on her conduct of that magazine .

		Granting , as my fellow-compiler suggests , that
Miss Monroe	PERSON	is not interested in the topics of our '' Little Book of Brides '' and '' Little Book of Kisses , '' I can still heartily agree with her that these , and the sixty other books of verse which I have edited or compiled , covering as they do the entire field of English verse from Chaucer to Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	, unfit me for the enjoyment of Mr. Pound 's '' form '' and '' technic , '' as recently exhibited .

		Though I do not see why , if the rhythms of English poetry so obvious to me are still subtle and difficult of discernment to her , I am thereby rendered ineligible to the office of critic of Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's Jerked English , I feel certain that the difficulty is rather one of definitions than of actual diversity of opinion .

		Perhaps it is as well to remember that
Milton	PERSON	said of poetry , in com - paring it with logic , that it is '' less subtile and fine , but more simple , sensuous , and passionate . ''

		Miss
Monroe	PERSON	lets her subtlety carry her back to
Egypt	LOCATION	rather than the
fall of Troy	DATE	when thirty centuries is mentioned as the duration of metrical tradition , and in my statement that this tradition has remained unchal - lenged I am glad to submit to correction .

		There have been challengers of the need for formal rhythm in poetry in recent years , just as there are still those who challenge the old Greek conception that the world is a sphere ; I should have written `` has not been success - fully challenged . ''

		I heartily concur with
Miss Monroe	PERSON	's statement , made for the second time in reply to an attack , to the effect that the existence of Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's erratic lines is their only justification ; and thank her for the proof she ad - duces of this in the information that they are the result of his study of metrical forms and variations in eleven languages '' metrical '' having , of course , only one meaning , that of formal rhythm .

		And I must thank her , too , for confirming my impres - sion that '' Poetry '' had done little or nothing to advance the cause for which it was supposedly founded .

		She brings forward seven poems to that end which it has published in as many months .

		Eliminating from these the metrical rubbish of Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	, the prose of Mr.
Tagore	PERSON	and Mr.
Pound	PERSON	, and the lines of Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	, which are much the least poetic of his yet printed , it 450 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	leaves three poems to which she may point with pride as the result of more than half a year of earnest endeavor .

		My other observations upon the conduct of the maga - zine , she , like my approving friends and correspondents , appears to take as self-evidently true .

		Such admissions as these , tacit and expressed , give us all the greatest hope for the future .

		In conclusion may I say that , if hereafter Miss
Monroe	PERSON	will write the poetry for Mr. Pound , and Mr. Pound the prose for
Miss Monroe	PERSON	, I believe the last possibility of disagreement will be removed .

		`` POETRY BY THE POUND . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Mr.
Rice	PERSON	opened the discussion of poetry by the pound in the May-day edition of THE DIAL with rather heavy artillery .

		Miss
Monroe	PERSON	responds with the strangely limited argument that Mr.
Rice	PERSON	is not an eligible critic of poetry because he once edited such dainty trifles as `` The Little Book of Kisses . ''

		Mr.
Rice	PERSON	seems to me to have rather the better of the argument with his quotation from
Oscar Wilde	ORGANIZATION	.

		Merely on the score of dainty trifles , the pretty little magazine about which all this contro - versy rages satisfies the preciosity of its slight public quite as completely as any little books of kisses might satisfy the blushes of the boudoir .

		After all , each of us can challenge the other 's critical faculty until the herd returns to the milking-shed , and each will probably remain '' of the same opinion still . ''

		The knowledge of what is good and what is bad in poetry is simply a matter of a critic 's being born with or with - out taste .

		He must also believe in his own taste , for certainly no one else in this chaotic century is going to believe in it .

		By which token I unshakenly affirm that
Lindsay	PERSON	's `` General Booth '' is the only poem of distinc - tion -LRB- and it is of very great distinction -RRB- among all those to which Miss
Monroe	PERSON	refers Mr.
Rice	PERSON	.

		I contend that this poem is as excellent as the recent `` Contemporania '' of Mr. Pound are poor .

		Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's final jape has been too much for most of the admirers of the three really good poems which he once wrote .

		He now seems to delight in placing himself in the cheapest of categories .

		For it is the easiest thing in the world to be what the world calls `` sensational , '' and to impose upon the world 's lack of artistic perception .

		The world will be only too ready to swallow you whole , Mr. Pound .

		But you really can not expect any serious artist to swallow you whole .

		You really can not expect any really serious artist to keep a straight face , or to laugh with you .

		A man who has made an exhaustive study of metrical forms and variations on the poetry of eleven languages but we recall
Swinburne	PERSON	's admitting his ignorance of prosody , and we wonder whether there may not be a difference between one 's knowledge of what prosody is -LRB- even the new prosody -RRB- and of what constitutes real poetry .

		Of course Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	unfortunately wrote with a mis - taken adherence to formal rhythms and with the idea that the technic of poetry meant more than a mere pedantry or an idle formlessness ; yet Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	achieved some very pretty effects , perhaps as pretty as any that come from our modern steam calliopes .

		Of course it is all a matter of taste .

		Some prefer the cal - liope .

		And others are prejudiced in favor of the violin .

		Mr. Pound should not be so ashamed of his earlier work .

		In his first frenzy he struck out `` The Ballad of the Goodly Fere , '' the Ballad for Gloom , '' and the poem about the white stag , Fame ; also he sang
Villon	PERSON	and the Gibbet rather well , and wrote some lines to his old fencing master which showed promise .

		But `` Since that time unto this season I have had nor rhyme nor reason '' for thinking the same of any other poetry by Mr. Pound .

		Is there no way of preventing youth from banging itself in its own ego ? ''

		How may a man be a popular poet and yet save his soul and his art ? ''

		reads a very recent editorial in the little magazine '' Poetry . ''

		We might add '' How may a man be a Modern poet and yet save his sense of taste and his sense of humor ? ''

		POPULARITY OF THE GERMAN CLASSICS IN THE GERMAN THEATRES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		One of the interesting questions in the minds of the German literary public is that of the relative popular - ity of the classics and the popular drama on the stage of the present day .

		This question is answered in the Deutscher Buhnenspielplan-Register , just published -LRB-
1913	DATE	-RRB- in
Berlin	LOCATION	by
Oesterheld & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, for the theatrical season of 1911-12 .

		As compared with the preceding year , the vogue of Anzengruber and
Hebbel	PERSON	-LRB- as yet almost unknown in
America	LOCATION	-RRB- rose , on the whole .

		The latter 's ''
Maria Magdalena	PERSON	'' dropped from 76 to 64 performances throughout
Germany	LOCATION	, while '' Gyges und sein Ring '' rose from 42 to 70 and ''
Judith	PERSON	'' from 78 to 96 .

		Only one section of
Grillparzer	ORGANIZATION	's Argonautic trilogy , `` Medea , '' is frequently played ; it rose from 50 to 61 .

		Kleist owes his huge increase to the one hundredth anniversary of his suicide : every play shows a rise ; `` Amphitryon '' from 19 to 25 , `` Die Her - mannsschlacht '' from 26 to 44 , ''
Robert Guiscard	PERSON	'' from 4 to 59 , '' Penthesilea '' from 1 to 140 -LRB- ! -RRB-

		, `` Kathchen von Heilbronn '' from 105 to 174 , `` Der
Prinz	PERSON	von Homburg '' from 106 to 215 , and '' Der zerbrochene Krug '' -LRB- the most popular -RRB- from 61 to 302 .

		In
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's case we meet with the following pecu - liar phenomenon : the greater works -LRB- '' Faust '' and '' Iphigenie '' -RRB- show a decline , whereas lesser and almost unknown works are gaining ground .

		`` Die Mitschul - digen '' rose from 10 to 32 , `` Die Laune des Verliebten '' from 7 to 64 performances .

		Goethe 's ''
Jery	PERSON	und Bately '' and the ''
Urfaust	PERSON	'' had never been played before this season .

		Lessing 's less prominent plays are also being dug out again ; `` Der junge Gelehrte '' and '' Miss
Sara Sampson	PERSON	'' are again finding favor .

		His ''
Emilia Galotti	PERSON	'' held its own at 60 perform - ances for the season , while ''
Nathan	PERSON	der Weise '' rose from 127 to 165 .

		Shakespeare held his ground ; he had
1044	DATE	performances as against 1042 the year be - fore .

		`` Henry VI. , '' `` The Tempest , '' and `` Timon of
Athens	LOCATION	'' had not .

		a single performance .

		His most popular plays were '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' -LRB- 147 -RRB- and `` Othello '' -LRB- 142 -RRB- .

		Schiller remains the king of the German theatre , although he shows a decrease in the total number of performances , dropping from
1584	DATE	to
1420	DATE	. ''

		Fiesco '' is still the least popular , and '' Wilhelm Tell '' the most popular , of the longer plays -LRB- the latter had 329 performances -RRB- .

		There is competi - tion among the classics , but on the whole they are not losing .

		In total number of performances , the classic side of the German repertory is still gaining .

		A LIVELY VIEW OF
Vic TORI	PERSON	AK LITERATURE .

		* In THE DIAL recently we had occasion to deplore a certain deadness which seems inherent in Histories of English Literature .

		But we are now offered a study of a special epoch of that literature which is certainly lively enough .

		The difference between Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's book and Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's is marked .

		It is the differ - ence between an
Eden Musee	ORGANIZATION	and the
Moving Pictures	ORGANIZATION	.

		In one there is a collection of fig - ures , lifelike indeed , but motionless and made of wax ; in the other , an image of the hurly burly of life , of life indeed accentuated and accelerated , rushing here and there , upset and upsetting and marching straight forward out of the picture .

		The difference is in part a matter of style .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's prose , at its best , has an old-world charm of leisured and ordered composition .

		His lights are not spread all over his canvas , but gleam out amid shadows or are tangled in quiet retirements .

		Quietness is the last thing one would associate with Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	.

		His world is a-crackle with fireworks , with a pin - wheel profusion of sparks .

		But what chiefly separates the two writers is their attitude towards literature itself .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	has a vision though we confess he did not succeed in getting it into his History of that verbal shell of things which age by age de - taches itself from material existence and hangs over or rolls on by the side of the changing real world , eternal and unchanged .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	views literature as one of the activities of life , like law-making or the manufacture of hard - ware or the boiling of soaps .

		At the bottom his method is that of
Taine	PERSON	, though perhaps the milieu is more and the men less with him than even with the French critic .

		There can be little doubt which of these two kinds of criticism affords the best opportunity for striking and pungent comment .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	attaches his literary machines to the great belt which runs all the other work of the age .

		If in the consequent whir and din we miss the ultimate perfections , the permanent results of literature , we are at least reassured that literature is a real factor in everyday life .

		Taking it for what it professes to be , a * THK VICTORIAN AGE IN LITERATURE .

G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	.

		`` Home University Library . ''


New York	LOCATION	:
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		study of the interrelation of literature , thought , and action in the Victorian Age , the book is good and sound ; which perhaps may only mean that it agrees in the main with our own precon - ceptions .

		We do not , indeed , think its views are especially original .

		It has been pointed out before that the Victorian literature was essen - tially a middle-class one .

		The descent from the great individualities , the tremendous tumult , of the Georgian epoch to the domesticities and the mild doubts of the Victorian time has always been evident .

		The
Titanomachia of Burns	ORGANIZATION	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and
Cole	PERSON	- ridge subsided into entire rest or into a somewhat insignificant and sordid scramble .

		However , Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	brings out this part of his theme with telling effect , one of his shrewdest remarks being that whereas
France	LOCATION	worked out its revolution with gunpowder ,
England	LOCATION	more economically went through its ebullition with words .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	is at his best in dealing with the Victorian prophets , the Voices from whose confused clamor arose the plain song of the age .

		On the one side were the apostles of rationalism and common sense ,
Bentham	PERSON	, Mill ,
Macaulay	PERSON	, and a little later the scientists who wrought out the theories of evolution ; while on the other side were the professors of unselfishness and soul-life ,
Newman	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, E , uskin , and
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		In this regard he shows that
Dickens	PERSON	was the greatest force of them all , really the very heart of the age .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	has , we believe , devoted a separate book to
Dickens	LOCATION	, so he may be pardoned for considering him here mainly as a reformer , a teacher of justice and happiness .

		In his chapter on the novelists , Mr.
Chester	PERSON	- ton does give a slight excursus on
Dickens	PERSON	as a creative artist .

		Rather protesting against the stock comparison of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	with
Thackeray	PERSON	, he does compare them with the result that the latter becomes a little ghost-like .

		The difference between them of course is this , that the world created by
Dickens	PERSON	is imaginatively true , while the world seen by
Thackeray	PERSON	is only actually true .

		Mr.
Percy Fitzgerald	PERSON	once gave a long list of the characters and situations imitated and borrowed by
Thackeray	PERSON	from his rival .

		It was as though the exuberance and buoyancy of the other distressed him , and he went over the lat - ter 's copy like a careful schoolmaster to reduce the swelling and irresponsible imaginations and make everything square with fact .

		This recen - sion is good and valuable in itself , but there is more vitality in the original .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	brings out the fact that the 452 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	novel is peculiarly woman 's sphere in art .

		It is only when men are something more than novel - ists , like
Scott	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	, that they can beat the sisterhood in this field .

		After Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's somewhat Mohock dealings with
George Eliot	PERSON	, Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's treatment of her is a model of discretion and consideration .

		He is kindly and just and accurate , too , in his delineations of Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	, Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	, and
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	; but when he comes to the greatest of them all ,
Emily Bronte	PERSON	, he falls flat and shames his worshippers , if he has any .

		He thinks that
Emily	PERSON	was a great figure but not a great artist , and that it is only
Charlotte	LOCATION	who enters
Victo	PERSON	- rian literature .

		Now an artist is never a great figure unless reputation is justified by work .

		A hollow sham rarely lasts long enough to pay for the trouble of building it up .

		The lofty praise of
Dobell	ORGANIZATION	,
James Smetham	PERSON	,
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Swinburne	PERSON	, and
Miss Sinclair	PERSON	is ample warrant against there being any hollowness in
Emily Bronte	PERSON	's fame .

		There is .

		we believe , a somewhat similar mis - calculation in Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's dealings with
Meredith	PERSON	and
Hardy	ORGANIZATION	.

		We should not care ourselves to hold a brief before the forty-two assessors of the dead for either of these novel - ists , but we think their comparative merits are just the reverse of what Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	decides .

		It seems to us that
Meredith	PERSON	's crabbed and eccentric style is a sign of an inward creative confusion , while Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's luminous and sufficiently sensuous prose is an assurance of a certain profundity and perfection in the beings he projects .

		But
Meredith	PERSON	is a comedian , Hardy a tragedian ; and Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's gay and lively spirit leans to the former .

		Our author does not shine in his treatment of the Victorian poets , the reason probably being that archangels or butterflies -LRB- you may take your choice of either appellation -RRB- do not go well attached to machinery .

		Gray said that the language of poetry was never the language of the age .

		We may go further and assert that the most poetical part of the spirit of poetry has nothing to do with temporary aims or move - ments .

		Poets may put themselves in the van of movement , they may lead forlorn hopes , but the best they can do is to express the univer - sally human .

		Dates soon wear out in works destined for immortality .

		There is very little difference in a good love-song whether it is signed by
Kalidasa	LOCATION	,
Hafiz	LOCATION	, or Burns .

		A great tragedy is at home in any age or any part of the world .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's last chapter is entitled `` The Break-up of the Compromise , '' and shows the end of the era and reveals its commonplace conventions shattered by the emergence of new forces .

		Chief of these forces were the aesthetic movement led by
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	, the socialistic movement captained by Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	and Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, the adventure propaganda promulgated by
Stevenson	PERSON	, and the impressionistic pro- gramme with which Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	is best asso - ciated .

		All these factors in modern life and figures in modern art are discussed by Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	in a fair and lucid way .

		But we venture to suggest that he has missed out some of the most potent ideas that are working in the modern mind and getting expression in liter - ature .

		There is first the woman question , which he ignores .

		We do not mean the feminist struggle for votes , but the more important fact of a total reversal of man 's traditional feeling towards woman , the chivalric attitude , in short .

		From the time of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and Petrarch there had grown up , outside of
France	LOCATION	which was always skep - tical on the subject , an idea of womanhood as something high and holy , spiritual and pure , as something calculated to lift the race to the heights .

		Schopenhauer it was who knocked the angel theory of woman on the head and set loose the modern idea of her as more animal than man .

		This conception is certainly deeply inwoven in recent English literature , yet Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	makes no account of it .

		Another large conception which has had a great influence on late writers is
Nietzscheism	LOCATION	, the cult of the superman .

		This dogma or doc - trine or delusion or devastation , however you may choose to accept it , is the antithesis of socialism , and as Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	evidently has leanings towards this latter evangel it probably did not suit his book to discuss a philosophy which is dark and mysterious , which draws war and destruction in its train , and which is ram - pant on the continent .

		The third thought factor which Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	may be accused of for - getting is the new vitalistic movement in meta - physics and religion heralded by
Bergson	PERSON	and
Eucken	ORGANIZATION	.

		This , however , practically had no effect on even the latest Victorian literature .

		Taken as a whole , Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	has given us an entertaining and , within its limits , a convincing book .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 453 RECORDS OF A GREAT MUSICIAN .

		* There has not appeared for a long time a work of such commanding interest and importance to the music-lover as
Grace E. Hadow	ORGANIZATION	's rendering into English of
Berthold Litzmann	PERSON	's exhaustive and authoritative biography of
Clara Schumann	ORGANIZATION	.

		The biographer was an intimate friend of the
Schumann	PERSON	family ; he was a neighbor of and grew up with the
Schumann	PERSON	children ; he had access to the large accumulation of family documentary material ; he was fitted by native endowment , by genuine devotion , and by his life 's occupation , to perform adequately and successfully the labor of love which he accepted only after considerable conscientious hesitation .

		The translation also could not have been placed in more satisfactory hands than in those of Grace and
William H. Hadow	PERSON	, who have done so much for music in their various excellent publications .

		The story has in it all the elements of a ro - mance , the struggles of the youthful prodigy and rising artist , the early successes of a great talent , the jealous care of a father filled with the ardor of a lofty if somewhat rigid idealism , the young lover bearing within him the promise of a reconstitution of the great art to which both were devoted , the years of a married life which opened to man and wife new fields of achieve - ment of which they had no preconception , the tragedy of death and separation , the consum - mation finally of a career in music to which few parallels can be found .

		The whole is minutely and characteristically told in these volumes , which never waver in their interest and enthu - siasm .

		Clara Wieck was born , as she herself says , at
Leipsic	LOCATION	,
September 13 , 1819	DATE	, in the house '' Zur hohen Lilie '' in the new Neurnarkt .

		In
1824	DATE	, when she was five years old , her mother obtained a divorce , and the child was left in the sole charge of her father , a stern and relentless taskmaster , who yet had the deepest regard for his daughter 's highest interests , who recognized at once her precocious abilities , and made her a pianist of the first importance .


Friedrich Wieck	PERSON	was a great teacher , and while not a creative musician or a proficient executant , he nevertheless had the real artist 's insight and inspiration , and was gifted with the superb capacity of transferring his knowledge and * CLARA SCHUMANN .

		enthusiasm to his pupils , and of arousing in them a spirit of achievement far greater than his own From her earliest years
Clara Wieck	ORGANIZATION	kept a diary .

		This , with a constant interchange of letters between herself and the great and im - portant everywhere , made a wealth of material rarely accessible to the biographer .

		Father Wieck himself began the diary when the child was yet too young to make entries .

		Some of the father 's interpolations were by no means flatter - ing to the diarist , and were doubtless intended as wholesome injunctions to the young girl .

		Her success as a player both in private and public soon became marked , and her reputation began to spread .

		When she was nine years old she made a successful appearance at the Leipsic Gewandhaus .

		In her tenth year she met
Paganini	PERSON	, who praised her playing and gave her great encouragement .

		As she herself says : '' I had to play to him on a wretched old piano with black keys which had been left behind by a student ; I played my Polonaise in E b , which he liked very much , and he told my father that I had a vocation for art , because I had feeling .

		He at once gave us permission to attend all his rehearsals , which we did . ''

		We may also insert here an account from the diary of a visit made to Goethe in
Weimar	LOCATION	. ''

		On
October 1 , 1831	DATE	, at 12 o'clock we had an audi - ence with the 83 year-old minister , His Excellency von Goethe .

		We found him reading and the servant took us in without further announcement , as he made an appointment with us the day before for this hour .

		He received us very kindly ; Clara had to sit by him on the sofa .

		Soon after his daughter-in-law came in with her two very clever looking children of 10 and 12 .

		Clara was asked to play and as the piano stool was too low Goethe himself fetched a cushion from the anteroom and arranged it for her .

		She played
Herz	PERSON	's La Violetta .

		While she was playing more visitors arrived and she then played
Herz	PERSON	's Bravura Variations , Op. 20 .

		Goethe estimated these compositions and
Clara	ORGANIZATION	's playing very justly , spoke of the pieces as bright , French and piquant , and admired
Clara	ORGANIZATION	's intelligent rendering . ''

		Goethe also said of the young girl : '' Clara 's interpretation makes one forget the composer , '' and he sent her a bronze medal of himself with a paper containing the inscription : '' In kindly remembrance of
Oct. 9 , 1831	DATE	,
Weimar	LOCATION	.


J.W. Goethe	PERSON	. ''

		In this manner the development of the great player proceeded ; but the event was now to occur which introduced into her life its chief in - fluence , and which gave character to her whole subsequent career .

		Every stage of her progress is illustrated in the biography by constant cita - tions from the diary or letters , and the connect - ing links of narrative shine with a full under - standing of the musical history of the time .

		With 454 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	the coming of
Robert Schumann	PERSON	, the curtain rose on a new advance of German music , indeed of all music ; and the romantic phase came in due succession to the classicism out of whose loins it sprang .


Robert Schumann	PERSON	, some nine years older than
Clara	LOCATION	, lived in the same house with the Wiecks .

		He had been a law student , but it soon became clear to him that law was not to be his avocation , and that music claimed him as a devotee .

		His mother was by no means ready to permit the change , and wrote to Fried - rich Wieck for advice .

		The latter gave this in a long letter which is even to-day wholesome and convincing reading .

		When this letter was put into
Robert Schumann	PERSON	's hands , he arrived at a decision without delay , and at once enrolled himself as a pupil of the distinguished teacher .

		The subsequent attachment of the young people , the unexpected but vehement objections of
Clara	LOCATION	's father , the years of trial and waiting , the marriage at last in spite of every obstacle , all this may be read here as part of the romance which constituted the life of the great romanti - cists .

		The sixteen years of
Clara Schumann	PERSON	's married life were the most important part of her earthly pilgrimage .

		The intimate associa - tion with one of the great musicians of all time stimulated her intelligence and invigorated her power of expression .

		She was introduced into regions of thought and aspiration whither her father with all his skill and assiduity could not .

		lead her .

		If for a time she found herself thrown somewhat into the shade by the great achieve - ments of the husband , and if the care of an increasing family withdrew her from the public exercise of her art , yet the results appeared later in deepened insight , greater command of the executant 's resources , subtler appreciation of the noblest in music , and enlarged skill in orig - inal composition .

		It was a union like that of the Brownings , and the heights which the Schumanns ascended were not less filled with echoes from the heavens .

		Clara Schumann needed , above all , intellectual awakening and guidance , and these arrived now in no stinted measure .

		Throughout the letters and diaries are expressions of the debt which she owed to
Robert Schumann	PERSON	.

		In one of the letters she speaks as follows : `` I am extremely glad that you are composing so much , and a symphony too ?

		Ah !

		Robert , that is too good !

		So you were offended with me for calling you a second
Jean Paul	PERSON	and
Beethoven ?	ORGANIZATION

		You shall not hear it again .

		You are quite right , it is not nice to make such comparisons . ''

		It is quite evident , however , what she really thought .

		The Schumanns were leaders in the trans - formation which took place in music after the era of Beethoven .

		They were important pro- moters of the
Romantic School	ORGANIZATION	, however this may be defined and delimited , but nevertheless thfey were distinctly of the conservatives .

		They stood with
Schubert	ORGANIZATION	,
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	,
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	, and
Brahms	PERSON	; with the Revolutionists , the new Enthusiasts ,
Berlioz	ORGANIZATION	, and Liszt and
Wagner	PERSON	, they had little sympathy .

		They welcomed the advances made by
Brahms	PERSON	, and after
Robert Schumann	PERSON	's death , Clara found in the works of Brahms the inspiration which her husband 's writings had given her during his lifetime .

		Indeed , the remarkable friendship between the younger musician and the pianist gives a chief interest to the latter pages of the biography .

		During these years
Brahms	PERSON	the composer ,
Joachim	PERSON	the violinist , and
Clara Schumann	PERSON	the pianist , upheld the great musical traditions throughout
Europe	LOCATION	, and constantly directed the rising innovators back to the illuminations of
Bach	LOCATION	and
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	and
Mozart	PERSON	.


Robert Schumann	PERSON	died in
1856	DATE	.

		Then fol - lowed in some sense the great years of this woman 's career .

		There was a large family to support and there were musical battles to be won .

		The widowed artist set herself to the task .

		She now went on her great concert tours , and every country in
Europe	LOCATION	listened to the message which her mature art brought .

		It was a message of finished performance , it was a mes - sage of sincerity and nobility , it was a message which emphasized the highest aspects of music .

		She was assisted in this effort by
Joachim	PERSON	, an idealist like herself , and they both hailed
Johannes Brahms	PERSON	as the master whose creations were in the direct line of succession with the music that meant most to mankind .

		The ex - periences of
Clara Schumann	PERSON	were as wide as the world of music : kings and queens paid her homage ; all the great of her time poets , novelists , painters gave her recognition and fellowship .

		Notable are the friendships with
Jenny Lind	PERSON	,
Grillparzer	PERSON	, and
Wilhelmine Schroder-Devrient	PERSON	, to the latter of whom
Clara Schumann	PERSON	wrote a candid letter of advice when she proposed to return to the stage after her voice had failed .

		The diary is full of vivid and striking reminiscences .

		Probably no pianist ever had a more significant destiny .


Allgeyer	PERSON	, who began the biography which
Litzmann	ORGANIZATION	completed after the death of his predecessor , says of her : '' In whatever character , in whatever relationship to the world at large
Clara Schumann	PERSON	shows herself in her correspondence , whether as daughter , sister , friend ,
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 455 betrothed , wife , mother , artist , colleague , or teacher , everywhere and always it is the absolute humanity com - bined with the fathomless depths of a pure woman 's soul which attracts and touches us ... After what has been said , the ` prominent position held by
Clara Schumann	PERSON	in the musical life of our day needs no explanation . ''

		The translation is well done ; it shows com - plete understanding of the original and reads like an English book .

		There are , however , some sad misprints .

		The work contains a num - ber of portraits , and each volume is furnished with a copious and valuable index .

		VIXCENT VAN GOGH : POST - IMPRESSKXNIST .

		* The air is so full at present of utterances con - cerning Futurists , Cubists , Neo-Impressionists , and Post-Impressionists , that it seems wrong to add anything to the dust .

		Still we believe that it will not add to the confusion , and may even have a clarifying effect , to introduce into the public mind , if possible , a few facts and ideas concerning
Vincent Van Gogh	PERSON	, some of whose correspondence has been recently edited by Mr.
Anthony M. Ludovici	PERSON	.

		It may perhaps be something like putting a piece of fish skin into boiling coffee , or a raw egg ; or indeed it may be more like the dash of cold water which some people think as good as anything else .

		A read - ing of these letters will certainly do something to clear away the extravagances which now cloud the public mind .

		They were written long since , and so are free from present aberrations .

		Nowadays you will rarely have a conversation with anybody concerning Post-Impressionist Art without some mention of
DuChamps	ORGANIZATION	's `` Nude Descending the Stair '' ; you will rarely see pictures representing the latest ideas in painting , or in this case sculpture , which do not have among them that long-legged lady by Lembruch .

		You will rarely , in other words , hear any direct discussion of the real principles of these matters , any discussion which is not confused by all sorts of current facts and ideas on art which have happened to get themselves connected with the subject .

		But really it is better to think simply in regard to these things , if possible ; and one has opportunity to think simply in reading these letters of
Van Gogh	LOCATION	, for he does not seem to have been of a very compli - cated nature , and it does not seem very hard to understand the principles that guided his life .

		* THE LETTERS OF A POST-IMPRESSIONIST .

		Being the
Familiar Correspondence of Vincent Van Gogh	ORGANIZATION	.

		Translated byA.M .

		Ludovici .

		Illustrated .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		People will open this book with all sorts of ideas in mind .

		Some who are pretty well in - formed will be glad to see in this convenient form letters which they may have already read in the original , or may have heard of .

		Others will think it a good opportunity to get at some - thing more or less definite concerning latest eccentricities in painting .

		Many , I imagine , will open the book with some little wonder as to who Van Gogh was .

		On this matter , I shall offer a remark which I find in a current periodical : `` The trinity of modern painting is composed of
Cezanne	ORGANIZATION	,
Gauguin	LOCATION	, and
Van Gogh	LOCATION	.

		It is they who have initiated the great and far-reaching movement which bids fair to change the com - plexion of latter-day pictorial expression .

		They are the real pathfinders , the veritable heralds of all that has come after , and in their footsteps , walk , with every show of humility , the men of the present . ''

		That certainly is definite enough .

		If there is anybody who after reading that does not wish to know more about
Van Gogh	PERSON	, he must certainly have very little interest in the art of the future , or very little confidence in the au - thority which I cite .


Vincent Van Gogh	PERSON	, `` to whom the present generation of ultra modern progressives has turned for inspiration and aes - thetic renewal , '' was a painter of the
last century	DATE	, who worked for a few years in
Holland	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	and died in the year
1890	DATE	.

		He had by that time painted a considerable number of pic - tures , over five hundred , I believe , although he had worked but eight or ten years .

		For a considerable time he remained practically un - known , or known only to a very few .

		It was not until fifteen or twenty years after his death that even his name began to be at all familiar , and even now it is not easy to get much accurate information concerning him or his works .

		There are several of his pictures in the
International Exhibition of Modern	ORGANIZATION	Art , notably one entitled ' ' Bal Aries , ' ' which people may remember .

		This picture is not an especially characteristic one , but it seems to be that which has made the most impression on the public .

		It is best to turn to a reading of these `` Let - ters of a Post-Impressionist '' with the simple desire of finding out something of
Van Gogh	ORGANIZATION	himself , and without much notion of all the things which have been lately said about him and about modern movements in painting .

		Whatever may be said now concerning
Van Gogh	PERSON	, he undoubtedly was a man who lived rather a simple , direct , straightforward kind of life , unconfused by the ideas of other people or by movements which included other artists .

		He 456 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	was evidently an original person , not one of a school .

		He seems to have known little of the great Impressionists , except what he picked up from their pictures .

		There is in these letters very little mention of any of the men who in the eighties were gradually coming to prominence and recognition .

		Undoubtedly Van Gogh found much with which to sympathize in the paintings of Manet ,
Monet	ORGANIZATION	,
Rafaelli	PERSON	, and
Degas	LOCATION	, as well as others , but he does not seem to have had any more to do with them personally than he did with the great painters of the past .

		Neither did he apparently have as much interest in their paintings as he did in those of
Delacroix	LOCATION	, for example , or Rembrandt and the other Dutch - men , particularly , let us say , in Vermeer of
Delft	LOCATION	, '' that incomparable sphinx whose extraor - dinary sound technic which people so ardently long to find to-day , was never to be surpassed . ''

		Neither was he particularly acquainted with those who have been called Neo-Impressionists , except Seurat .

		He did not even live in close connection with those whose names are commonly associated with him .

		He had seen few of the pictures of
Cezanne	ORGANIZATION	, and his letters have very little mention of him .

		He was more closely thrown with
Gauguin	PERSON	, for whom he felt a close and fundamental sympathy and who undoubtedly was a powerful influence in his later life .

		He does in one case speak to
Bernard	LOCATION	about '' work - ing away with me and
Gauguin	PERSON	. ''

		He is now called a Post-Impressionist , but it does not appear that he ever called himself so , or that anybody ever used the name in his life-time .

		It is a name that has been applied since his death , to designate a number of those who came after the great Impressionists , who had something of their spirit , or who struck out for themselves in paths which since their time have been followed by many who have gone much farther than the forerunners went themselves .

		There are several reasons why people inter - ested in art should read these letters .

		They are , for one thing , quite an unusual production , the intimate personal talk of one who whether he were a great painter or not was certainly a great critic of art .

		They are , further , a fairly representative expression of a definite theory of art .

		But they are also -LRB- and it is in this respect , I take it , that they are most important -RRB- a real means of learning about something in the world of art at present which otherwise we should have small chance of knowing .

		The art world , says Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	mildly , is not without its arch humbugs .

		That is certainly so .

		There have always been humbugs and arch humbugs in the world of art .

		To-day there is a more favorable atmosphere for them than ever before .

		This is the hey-dey of advertising , which means the day of opportunity for the sophist in every walk of life , the man who believes that the great thing in the world is talk and not fact .

		This is the great day of popular art , in which there are hundreds and thousands of people earnestly desirous of knowing about the beautiful things of the world and so offering an opportunity to all sorts of pretentious and pretended virtuosi , cognoscenti , dilettanti , critics , and connoisseurs .

		It is a day of great wealth and luxury , in which there are many who desire beauty of surround - ings without regard to cost .

		Under these con - ditions there is great probability of people coming to the front in the world of art by means of impudence , calculation , obtrusive stu - piosity , foolishness , or -LRB- as has been suggested -RRB- insanity ; and whatever has the possibility of being made to pay will undoubtedly be presented as being the greatest thing in the world .

		In other words it is hard for us to get the truth in regard to modern art .

		The day of the great painters is for the moment over .

		The day of the advertisers , the popular magazines , the journalists , the promoters , the puffers , the art dealers , has come in .

		It requires the clearest mind , the finest taste , the widest opportunities to remain unperturbed in the whirl ; no one need be ashamed of losing his head now and then .

		But in these letters of
Van Gogh	LOCATION	we have the natural and uncolored utterance of one of these men who is now at the centre of the cyclonic duststorm .

		We may regret the bard - ships and the obscurity of
Van Gogh	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		But now that it is all over , it has its advantage , for it gives his work the stamp of sincerity .

		These letters were written for his brother and his most intimate friend .

		He could have had no idea that they would ever come before the public ; he could have had no thought of advertising charlatanry or puffery .

		He simply expressed himself in these letters that no one but his brother would read as he had expressed himself in his pictures that no one would buy .

		But whereas it is difficult for the average man to understand what he had to say through the medium of painting , it is not hard to under - stand what he said in the universal medium of words .

		So if we really desire to know , if not what
Van Gogh	PERSON	was , at least what he wanted to be , we may find out here .

		I shall not anticipate the pleasure of the reader in turning to this volume .

		I will merely note one or two things that seem to me signi -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 457 ficant .

		The first is that Van Gogh considered himself as the painter of Humanity , not the painter of an ultra-refined , super-sensitive de - cadent civilization , but an almost primitive painter of Man ,
Life Vitality	ORGANIZATION	.

		But over against this fine ideal and breadth of view we must put the unfortunate fact that Van Gogh could not paint the figure very well .

		Although he certainly had astonishing facility for one who had never toiled and labored at the technique of his art , he does not seem to have been able to paint anything very well , and the figure is not the easiest thing to paint .

		In land - scape or still life one may vary more or less from the facts to humor one 's inabilities or vague - nesses , but with the figure it is much harder ; one has to make it pretty nearly the way it is or ought to be , if one is painting out of one 's head , as
Van Gogh	LOCATION	sometimes had to .

		Other - wise it will look funny .

		Van Gogh himself did not feel that he painted very well ; he knew that he could draw , for he had practiced for many years , but he was rather surprised to find that he could paint .

		As to his method of painting , something might be said , although he himself remarked that he really did not know how he painted , that he was glad he had never learned to paint , that he observed no system .

		Yet he had , of course , something of a theory of painting , gained partly from practice , but more it would seem from a study of the masters whom he recognized later .

		His study of pictures gave him certain funda - mental ideas , but he added to it much technical practice .

		He never studied in any art school , nor indeed , save for a few months with Mauve , with any older artist .

		Yet he practiced much .

		`` Before I began to paint I made such a long and careful study of drawing and perspective that I can now sketch a thing as I see it . ''

		He certainly believed that art required long and untiring industry , observation , work .

		So he worked from nature that in time he might do something from imagination .

		Yet this working `` from imagination '' never seduced him from actual work from nature , `` an enchanted land , '' he says ; `` for the present I shall not crack my brains over it . ''

		In general he needed models .

		`` I do not mean that I never turn my back boldly upon nature ... but I am fright - ened to death of losing accuracy of form .

		Perhaps later on , after ten years of study , I shall try . ''

		This need of models led him to paint land - scape more than anything else , for nature always offers one something beautiful free of fee , while people as a rule charge when they pose . ''

		I have painted seven studies of corn ; unfortunately quite against my will , they are only landscapes . ''

		Like most innovators in art he was strong for nature . ''

		What am I but a friend of nature , '' says he ; `` I have learned my trade in
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's workshop . ''

		And it was that he might paint Man .

		`` Who is going to paint Man as
Claude Monet	PERSON	painted landscape ? ''

		he asks ; and as was most natural , at first he thought much of the peasant life all around him , the life that
Israels	PERSON	had painted , and in
France	LOCATION	especially Millet and
Lhermitte	PERSON	.

		He wanted to paint Humanity .

		He wanted to get at life .

		Like many other men not wholly nor - mal , he admired and delighted in health .

		Like
Nietzsche	PERSON	, he admired the physical strength and power and poise which was lacking in himself .

		He was no whiner , but one can readily see his lack of the normal health that he would have delighted in .

		He did not live a normal life , perhaps he could not ; once toward the end of the month when he was very anxious to buy five picture frames he had to live on bread and coffee for a week , and doubtless there were many more such things .

		Yet , if one can judge from this book ,
Van Gogh	LOCATION	was really more inspired by art than by nature : he lived an artistic life and said him - self that in the midst of such a life '' there arises again and again the yearning for real life , which remains an unrealizable ideal . ''

		And it seems to me pretty clear that
Van Gogh	PERSON	's painting was more the product of the painting of the past than of the life about him .

		That is a judgment which it would be absurd to pronounce abso - lutely before one had the chance to study his pictures -LRB- as I have not -RRB- ; but from reading his letters one gets the idea that the influence of other painters upon
Van Gogh	LOCATION	was strong .

		He was perhaps not particularly influenced by con - temporaries ; as has been said , he had little to do with Impressionists or Neo-Impressiomsts except to accept a good many of their results as anyone accepts the commonplace truths of life .

		But he owed much to the old Dutch masters , if not so much in technique -LRB- save with
Vander Meer of Delft	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- at least in conception of the aim and purpose of art .

		Rembrandt and
Franz Hals	PERSON	and their broad painting of humanity fascinated him .

		The latter , it will be remembered , was particularly the favorite of the eighties , not only for his general temper , but for various technical reasons .

		Van Gogh had the sense to see that the '' square touch '' cult of
Franz Hals	PERSON	amounted to little compared with 458 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	his big view of life .

		He runs over his subjects `` soldier pictures , officers , banquets , portraits of magistrates ... a drunken toper , a beautiful Bohemian courtesan ... tramps , musicians , and a fat cook . '' ''

		We can not do anything else , '' says he ; '' but all this is worthy of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's Paradise . ''

		It is perhaps not worth questioning whether life in general led
Van Gogh	LOCATION	to appreciate
Franz Hals	PERSON	, or
Franz Hals	PERSON	led him to appreciate life in general .

		So much for the question of subject matter .

		I am led to think much the same thing in re - gard to questions of technique .

		Van Gogh was in the main a colorist .

		`` Color on color means something , '' was his view .

		`` I know that we are now engaged in the problem of color '' ; '' things present themselves to me in colors which formerly I never used to see , '' and other such utterances show his preoccupation .

		And it was for such reason it would appear that he was so interested in the pictures of
Delacroix	LOCATION	.

		It would seem at first view as though there could be very little connection between this great Romanticist and a painter of the time of
Van Gogh	LOCATION	.

		But there is no one but Rembrandt of whom he speaks more and with more interest .

		`` Armed with an almost complete mastery of Rembrandt , '' he says , '' I discovered that
Delacroix	PERSON	obtained his effects by means of his color , and Rembrandt by means of his values ; but they are worthy of each other . ''

		And in the same spirit he says that his work -LRB- so far as color is concerned -RRB- '' is certainly much more under the suggestion of
Delacroix	PERSON	' painting '' than of the Impressionists .

		If now we ask what is the influence of
Delacroix	LOCATION	in this cardinal point of color , I can not say what would be the answer from a study of
Van Gogh	LOCATION	's works .

		But if his letters give us a good idea of his practice , the answer would be that it is expressed largely in combinations of lemon yellow and prussian blue .

		He notes
Delacroix	PERSON	's pas - sion for this combination , saying that he created really magnificent things thereby .

		And it is to be noted , then , that no combination is more commonly in his own mind .

		In telling how he would paint a portrait which should reveal in the painting all the love he had for the man , he makes a combination of yellow and blue -LRB- so that the portrait looks like a star suspended in ether upon a rich blue background -RRB- , he plans to deco - rate his studio with sunflowers -LRB- it was in
' 88	DATE	-RRB- against a blue background , his view of Aries is of meadows full of dandelions with a ditch full of irises , he notes a picture by Puvis de Chavannes , a man in a blue room reading a yellow book .

		At the same time he makes a still life composi - tion blue enamelled coffee-pot , etc. , with oranges and lemons , `` a symphony in blue tones , ani - mated by a scale of yellow ranging to orange , '' he sees pale sunsets -LRB- with glorious golden suns -RRB- which make the ground appear quite blue ; in fact , he theorizes , `` there is no blue without yellow and orange , and when you paint blue , paint yellow and orange as well . ''

		So without the benefit of a comparison of the works of
Delacroix	PERSON	and the five hundred pictures of
Van Gogh	LOCATION	, one gathers from his letters that the influence of the elder painter suggested to him certain moods of seeing nature which more and more dominated his work .

		He was a sincere worker , doing what he did for its own sake , without hope of other reward than comes from work well done .

		He believed himself an innovator .

		He believed in an art of the future which ought to be so beautiful that it was worth making sacrifices for .

		He believed that the art of the future would have a new theory of color as of drawing .

		He believed that he and his friends would triumph in the end , even though he doubted if they would live to see their triumph .

		If what has been said about him appears to have little connection with what is now called `` futurist , '' I can not help it .

		I have thought it better to show what were the actual ideas of one said to be a beginner of the modern movement , than to try to view his work in the light of what has come to pass .

		DlSCUSSIOXS OF THE TRUST PROBLEM .

		* Considering the prominence of the trust problem in this country the scarcity of satisfac - tory books on the subject is surprising .

		Until within about a year , scarcely any serious and scholarly attempt at a general discussion of the problem in book form had appeared for nearly a decade .

		Fortunately , however , this does not mean that the decade has brought no appreciable progress in arriving at a clearer understanding of the question and a more general consensus of opinion as to the best method of procedure in dealing with the problem .

		In the first place , considerable advance has been made in disentangling the trust problem , which deals with the question of monopoly price and trust methods of competition , from the cor - poration problem , which is concerned with the * THE CONTROL , OF TRUSTS .

		INDUSTRIAL COMBINATIONS AND TRUSTS .

		Edited by
William S. Stevens	PERSON	, Ph.D. .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAJL 459 question how we can devise a form of corpo - rate organization which will meet the needs of modern large scale industry , and at the same time maintain proper relations between , and safeguard the respective interests of , creditors , company officials , and the various groups of investors .

		There is still much to be done in making this distinction clear to those engaged in formulating our laws .

		Secondly , there has come to be a fairly general recognition of the fact that there is no one cause which can be held responsible for the growth of our industrial combinations , but that they are due to a great variety of factors , certain of which lead to un - desirable forms of growth ; the obvious conclu - sion being that the proper method of procedure is to strike at the root of the evil by doing away with the causes leading to these undesirable results .

		A third point , upon which , however , there is much less general agreement , is that the trusts have many economic characteristics common to the public service companies , where monopoly is admitted to be desirable ; the corol - lary being that they ought to be regulated in much the same way .

		While the aiithors of the two books considered in this review would not accept all of these conclusions , yet the influence of the general trend of current discussion thus outlined is clearly evident in their volumes .

		The first edition of
Clark	PERSON	's `` The Control of Trusts '' appeared in
1901	DATE	; but the present re - vision is substantially a new book , being more than twice the size of the former and now writ - ten in collaboration with the author 's son .

		In it the authors have made no attempt to describe trust methods or to give an historical account of the trust movement , but have limited them - selves to discussing the solution of the problem .

		The general position taken on this point is well summarized as follows : '' Most of the measures proposed for the regulation of trusts fall into one or the other of two classes , of which the first consists of those which would merely destroy monopoly and make competition free , while the other includes measures that would relinquish such attempts , surrender to the principle of monopoly and protect the public by regulating prices through official bodies .

		This plan means trying to do in industry what we have partially succeeded in doing in transportation . '' ''

		This book advocates a third course ; namely , regu - lating competition .

		It would cut off entirely an abnor - mal type of it by forbidding and repressing the cut-throat operations by which the trusts often crush their rivals .

		Further , it would remove the special inducement to such measures and thus create a condition in which competi - tion of a tolerant kind would rule business life . ''

		This policy is advocated in the belief that the checks on progress , which the authors claim come with monopoly , are much more serious than the high prices resulting therefrom ; that it is possible to destroy the trusts , and that so doing will most accelerate technical progress , the welfare of the laborer , and the growth of the world 's wealth .

		The underlying assumption of the volume is thus a belief in the efficacy of competition .

		The authors are careful to explain , however , that this does not mean absolutely unrestrained competition laissezfaire but a form of reg - ulated competition which will prohibit certain undesirable methods of rivalry .

		It is in this connection that we find the most important modification of the views expressed in the first edition ; and the reason is a very suggestive one .

		Originally it was stated that potential competi - tion , if given free play , was sufficient to control the trusts ; but now it is explained that the experience of the last decade has compelled an abandonment of this view , since it has shown that '' the potentiality of unfair attacks by the trusts tended to destroy the potentiality of competition . ''

		Hence the conclusion that the methods of competition used by the trusts must be regulated .

		The specific legislation required to carry out this plan of reform naturally involves a variety of measures calculated both to stimulate and to regulate competition .

		The protective tariff should not be abolished , but kept at a level such as will enable the independent domestic producer of fair efficiency to compete on reasonable terms with the foreign producer and yet not be crushed out by the domestic trust .

		Certain reforms must be made in our corporation laws , such as the abolition of the holding company and the securing of greater publicity .

		Railroad discriminations and favors must be abolished , and waterways kept free from railroad domi - nance .

		Our patent laws must be revised , and such unfair methods of competition as local price-cutting and factor agreements must be prevented .

		All these measures involve diffi - culties which the authors frankly recognize and freely discuss , while concluding that they will permit that degree of consolidation which is required to give efficiency and at the same time avoid the deadening effects of monopoly and the consequent necessity for price regulation .

		The general method of procedure here out - lined would undoubtedly meet the approval of the majority of economists , and is in line with the general trend of recent writings on the subject , as suggested above .

		Even among those who doubt the adequacy of the reforms , most 460 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	will agree that some such measures at least should be the first step in our plans to control the trusts .

		To the mind of the reviewer , the question whether these measures will prove sufficient is the most serious one to be raised .

		For example , they afford no means whatever for regulating a trust based on control of a natural resource .

		Moreover , it is assumed that there is no industry outside of public utilities where regulated monopoly can be more desir - able than competition .

		Doubtless there are not many such in any case , but can we fairly assume that there are none when we see that , so far as economic characteristics are concerned , it is im - possible to draw any hard and fast line between public utilities and industrial combinations ?

		To some the wisdom of the tariff policy advocated by the authors will also appear open to ques - tion .

		If the purpose of competition be to secure progress and low prices , why resort to a tariff for the sake of protecting the independent domestic producer against the domestic trust , when to do so necessitates maintaining a higher level of prices and hindering the importation of the cheaper foreign product ?

		Minor points of criticism aside , however , the general plan of regulated competition is certainly to be com - mended to the thoughtful consideration of the public .

		Whether in the long run it will prove adequate to cope with the problem is open to doubt .

		Perhaps another decade 's experience will give us the answer .

		At any rate , this will be a step in the right direction .

		The volume edited by Dr.
William S. Stevens	PERSON	is a collection of selected readings or `` case material '' on the question of trusts , though the title gives no indication of this fact .

		The selec - tions have been chosen almost entirely from court proceedings or from legislative and con - gressional investigations , the testimony in the recent hearings having been heavily drawn upon .

		Brief introductory notes head each chapter .

		The value of such a volume depends chiefly on the character of the selections chosen , and it may at once be said that in general this task has been well performed .

		The selections in - clude many things not easily obtainable else - where ; they are up-to-date , fairly broad in scope , and avoid the common mistake of con - fusing the trust problem and the corporation problem .

		A considerable amount of unimport - ant material scattered through the selections could have been excluded without loss , and the omission of anything bearing on the connection between the tariff or the railroads and the trusts is to be regretted .

		The introductory notes , also , could have been expanded to great advantage .

		The editor expresses the hope that the book will be of service to both the college student and the general reader .

		Its value to the former will at once be evident , for it is distinctly su - perior to anything now available in its field , and will undoubtedly find widespread use among our colleges .

		Its value for the general reader is not so clear .

		The claim that a group of selec - tions will give an unbiassed view rests on the assumption that there is no bias in making the selections , and in this case the claim seems justi - fied by the results .

		Yet one is compelled to doubt whether a reader not already fairly famil - iar with the subject would appreciate the signifi - cance of the testimony and legal documents here set forth , or could obtain from them the least conception of the fundamental forces in the evolution of industrial society which are respon - sible for the whole movement towards industrial combinations .

		If read along with , or after , some general account of the trust problem , this volume would prove instructive , but by itself it is not adapted to the wants of the general reader .

		INCOHERENT STUDIES ix PLAY - STRUCTURE .

		* A series of talks on the drama should not be thrown together and called a critical work ; nor should so badly written a book as Miss Hunt 's be given the endorsement of the

		We might indeed pass over split infinitives , as well as relative and demonstrative pronouns ruthlessly deprived of antecedents ; we might even tolerate paragraph - ing that knows no law but the caprice of the writer , or connive at mixed metaphors as exhi - biting a cheerful idiosyncrasy on the part of the author of their being .

		But when we come across such flagrant violation of good English as `` passed a very sensible remark , '' `` keep off of , '' `` romantistic , '' `` comedic , '' '' novelistic , '' `` ideaed , '' `` chiefest , '' `` soliloquial , '' `` zestful , '' `` relucts , '' `` a la

Elizabeth R. Hunt	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 461 that the theory of the realist , which bases his art on the taking of notes , etc. , '' then we regret that the critic did not first learn to write English before undertaking to write about plays .

		Nor is the arrangement of the material more satisfactory than the expression of the ideas .

		The first six chapters , comprising an introductory one on drama study and five on the structure of the play , are followed by three on separate types of play , the catastrophic play , the play of the day , and the comedy of manners .

		So far so good .

		But this continuity is broken by four chapters dealing successively with the unities , the soliloquy , realism , and dramatic literature , which have no organic relation to one another or to what precedes or follows .

		The interrupted discussion of the kinds of plays is now , however , resumed with a treatment of the purpose play , the pieced-out play , and the static play , only to be again broken in upon by two chapters on acting scenery and British and American En - glish , and to be finally taken up in a chapter on the play for children .

		Nevertheless the book should be in many ways useful to the layman who would know more of the drama than he can learn from newspaper notices of current theatrical productions .

		Espe - cially useful are the chapters dealing with the structure of the play and the several types of drama presented on the modern stage .

		Less satisfactory is the discussion of dramatic conven - tions and principles .

		The unities are dismissed after a perfunctory consideration of the unity of action in `` The Servant in the
House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		In the treatment of the soliloquy we are told that we learn about a character by `` indirect vision , '' that is , `` as he is reflected in the minds -LSB- sic -RSB- of every other person on the stage '' ; as if that were sufficient , or as if the soliloquy were an en - tirely discarded convention .

		How much should we learn of Hamlet or lago by indirect vision or what takes the place in the modern drama of this self-revelation given in the soliloquy of the Shakespearean play ?

		Must the inscrutable character , whom indirect vision fails to reveal , disappear from the stage , or must the audience remain in the dark along with the other char - acters in the play ?

		This chapter does not say .

		A chapter on realism would necessarily attract the attention of anyone distracted by the jarring cries of realist and romanticist ; here he might hope for a solution he could understand , or at least a presentation of the problem which would help to determine his own judgment .

		But what does he learn ?

		As a sort of topic sentence he sees the properly italicized legend , like an advertisement of a prosperous tailoring estab - lishment , `` The realist knows how . ''

		For , first , `` he respects human beings and real life with a profound feeling of the creative artist for his material '' and `` he is content to study his material with the sole aim of understanding it . ''

		Again , `` his deeply artistic regard for human nature forces him to base his art on observation on the more or less literal taking of notes and on that alone . ''

		`` The realist 's art , then , begins by exteriorizing and ends with a revela - tion of the innermost nature . ''

		All of which sounds very familiar , and is true of all high art whether modern or ancient , realistic or romantic .

		When Miss Hunt comes to the romanticist and she does so with a manifest bias against him she is not so clear .

		His philosophy of art , she says , '' seems to be based on a curious combination of experience and imagination , '' according to which the artist gets inside his char - acters and feels with them ; in other words , the romanticist is purely subjective and his char - acters move only as he directs .

		On the other hand , the characters of the realist `` get out of his control so that they fairly make things hap - pen . ''

		It is unfortunate that Miss Hunt did not see fit to illustrate her point here by citing ro - mantic writers and their works to the bar , though she did summon several realists .

		Who are these romantic writers whose creatures are mere pup - pets , the products of imagination and sympathy ?

		Are they
Browning	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	and all who have failed in the drama ?

		Is Shakespeare a realist , along with
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	?

		For surely he is not a romanticist according to the definition .

		The seeker for knowledge would like to know .

		We defy anyone to gather what is meant by dramatic literature from the chapter headed '' What Is Dramatic Literature ? ''

		Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	's two plays , `` The Admirable Crichton '' and '' What Every Woman Knows , '' are chosen as types , and one of the features especially com - mended as literature ?

		is the pantomimic scenes !

		At the end of a chapter we still ask the question .

		One of the plays discussed under the head of `` The Play for Children '' is
Rostand	PERSON	's '' Chantecler '' !

		Such critical acumen leads one back to the words quoted , on the wrapper of the volume , from the remarks of `` a Professor in the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	'' that `` what is most needed is a book on play building that is safe and sound . ''

		These words still hold true , Miss Hunt and her publishers to the contrary not - withstanding .

		* The author of `` A Man 's World '' has given us , in `` Comrade
Yetta	PERSON	, '' a second realistic and deeply sympathetic study of the stratum of human life which is best known to the social settlements and the police courts the life of the proletariat struggling for the means of a decent human existence .

		Comrade
Yetta	PERSON	is a Jewish girl , who has imbibed idealism from her father 's teachings , and who , when thrown on the world by his death , finds the sweat-shop the only means of livelihood open to her .

		How she escapes from the hell of this existence , how she is tempted and just escapes from falling , and how she becomes an important factor in the trade-union activities of the
East Side	LOCATION	and a helpful worker in the socialist cause , are told with vivid truth in the pages of this transcript of actual life which we hesitate to call a novel .

		Fully to appreciate this work of Mr.
Edwards	PERSON	, one must share its bias , for it presents only one aspect of the terrible problem of poverty .

		It takes for granted , as beyond any possible argument , the justi - fiability of strikes , and picketing , and the organi - zation of underpaid labor .

		It is frankly committed to the socialist theory of society , and makes an elo - quent plea for the socialist remedies .

		Conceding this bias , it is a deeply moving human story , incisive in its characterizations , and comparatively free from the maudlin sentiment with which many writers who have the author 's viewpoint beslobber their work .

		Implicit in every line is a caustic criticism of the social order such as only one who has seen it eye to eye could have written .

		Mr.
Edwards	PERSON	achieves his effects by sympathetic portrayal rather than by pumped-up rhetoric , and therein is the secret of his power .

		eighteen .

		The moral seems to be that a man should not let his love be so much younger than himself , and that such an ill-assorted union is sure to bring disaster .

		It certainly does prove disastrous in the present case , but mainly because the girl is capricious beyond the average of her sex , and also because she shrinks from the normal obligations of wifehood .

		If it were merely that a young lover appears upon the scene , awakening her undeveloped nature , we should have a replica of the situation that has formed the theme of a thousand novels , and should find our sym - pathies enlisted on behalf of the paramount claims of triumphant and arrogant youth , with perhaps a tear of pity for the sorrow of the lover of advanced age .

		But in this case , the girl takes time to know her own mind before committing herself to marriage , and then acts in a way that completely alienates our sympathies .

		She avoids maternity by criminal means , and Mr.
Kauffman	PERSON	, as we know , does not mince matters when he deals with subjects that demand a decent reticence .

		It is a tragedy , no doubt , but a tragedy not resulting , as the author would have us think , from the situation , but rather from the undisciplined character of the young woman .

		So it seems to us well , on the whole , that in the end she fails to accomplish her selfish purpose , and is forced to continue in what is at least the semblance of the relation which society has sanctioned .

		Mr.
Booth Tarkington	PERSON	should have found for his latest novel some title having a less innocent conno - tation than '' The Flirt . ''

		This word suggests the playfulness of comedy , whereas the woman whom it here designates is a person of such hardened selfishness and instinctive depravity that her conduct takes toll of human lives , having its outcome not in sentimental sorrows but in tragedy .

		We are not prepared for this in the beginning , for
Cora Madison	PERSON	first attracts us by her exhibition of the amusing wiles of the coquette , and it is only later that her meanness and wickedness are disclosed .

		The thirteen - year-old brother whom she calls the Pest is an affliction that she fully deserves , and if his ingenuity for malicious mischief had taken her for its sole victim , we should feel almost kindly toward him .

		The Madisons live in a small inland town , and
Cora	ORGANIZATION	is adored by all the men of her acquaintance .

		They feed out of her hand , and , being a poor-spirited lot , meekly endure whatever insults and affronts she pleases to bestow upon them .

		When a fascinating stranger -LRB- the returned native -RRB- appears upon the scene , she makes a dead set at him , and it is some satisfaction to realize that he is an adventurer noto - rious in
Europe	LOCATION	as a gambler and confidence man .

		He has a scheme for promoting an oil field in the
Basilicata	LOCATION	, and gets
Cora	PERSON	to persuade her friends to invest their money in the enterprise .

		When his rascality is eventually disclosed ,
Cora	PERSON	first learns the meaning of defeat , but even then she suffers not so much from remorse as from wounded vanity .

		Hastening to one of the poor-spirited lovers whom she has rejected , she offers herself to him on condi - tion that he marry her at once and take her away
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 463 for a long wedding journey .

		Since he accepts the offer with enthusiasm , he probably gets about what he deserves .

		Another of the suitors shoots the ex - posed adventurer , and then himself , thus partly clearing the stage .

		A more unconvincing piece of fiction we have not often read ; or one in which the characters have been more puppet-like and the action more mechanical .

		In `` The Road of Living Men , '' Mr.
Will Lev	PERSON	- ington Comfort 's fourth novel , the author returns to the manner of ''
Routledge Rides Alone	PERSON	, '' having jettisoned a large part of the cargo of turgid rhet - oric and amorphous philosophizing with which his later books have been overfreighted .

		He still speaks at times with the voice of the mystic , and the robes of the prophet still trail about him , but on the whole he has written another straightforward story of ad - venture , and made it a transcript of external rather than of internal experience .

		It all begins at
Oporto	LOCATION	, where the boy
Thomas Ryerson	PERSON	first meets the girl
Mary Romany	PERSON	.

		Both are children , but both have the sense of being linked together by destiny .

		After this prelude , the story is told in three sections , the scenes being
China	LOCATION	,
Long Island	LOCATION	, and
Ecuador	LOCATION	, respectively .

		Mary is the daughter of a mining prospector whose operations take him to
China	LOCATION	just before the rising of the Boxers .

		Here we have a vivid account of the beginning of that rebellion , and of the heroine 's rescue by
Ryerson	PERSON	.

		The
Long Island	LOCATION	section is an idyllic episode of love-making between the two .

		The South American section again gives us a story of wild adventure , for the pro- spector is working a concession in
Ecuador	LOCATION	, and has to get the better of the warring factions of the repub - lic as well as of his own mutinous followers .

		Here Ryerson joins him , and they succeed , contending against almost insuperable obstacles , in running out the accumulated gold .

		This gives the narrative that whirlwind finish which is one of Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	's specialties .

		Like its predecessors , this novel is largely a paean in praise of woman , and of her potency as a factor in the spiritual development of man .

		Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	makes himself the prophet of woman - kind as an Egerian influence , and all the unlovely current manifestations of the feminist movement seem not to have shaken one whit his faith in her divine mission .

		It is a joy to encounter such whole - hearted romantic idealism as he sets before us in an age when the chief literary currents are setting toward a sordid realism or a grotesque distortion of the truth of life .

		He gives us to understand that the book was written in response to the plea of a friend who wrote : '' Do us just a story a story so sheer and calling , that one by one we shall steal away from the world 's company , as if we heard our lover 's whistle out among the trees ; steal away and follow on and on , entranced , expectant , fresh-eyed as children ; just for once put away reforms and im - pressiveness ; do not remind us this once that we are going full tilt in directions damnable . ''

		And so on .

		It is a little gushing , but it helps us to under - stand the spirit in which the story is told .

		Mr.
How	PERSON	ells would , we imagine , be the last person in the world to suppose that , in '' New Leaf Mills , '' he had produced a work in any way comparable with his own masterpieces .

		But , slight as the new story is , it has all the charm of his inimitable style , and exhales all the sweetness of the personality which has made him the most beloved of our men of let - ters .

		He has simply gone back to the time of his
Ohio	LOCATION	boyhood sixty years ago , and fished out of his recollections the materials for a picture of the way in which simple people then lived on what was then the western fringe of our civilization .

		He tells the story of
Owen Powell	PERSON	and his family , who finds it hard to make a living in town , buys an old mill in the country , with the aim of establishing a coop - erative community of the type which then hovered before men 's minds as likely to furnish the solution of the social problem .

		He wishes to turn over a new leaf , and this suggests a name for the enterprise .

		The plan is given up in the end , and not very much happens in between there is a house-raising , and a surly miller who resents the intrusion of the new owner , and a hired girl who mysteriously disap - pears , and that is about all , except a great deal of talk , tinctured with Swedenborgianism , which is
Owen Powell	PERSON	's spiritual stay in all his reverses .

		It is a book which helps us to understand our forbears of a generation or two ago , and is an undeniably veracious transcript of their life .

		Mr.
Stephen French Whitman	PERSON	gave us a year or so ago , in '' Predestined , '' an unusually human and appealing first novel .

		His second novel , '' The Isle of Dreams , '' is less convincing , partly because he has made it of less familiar material , and partly because he has attempted to indulge in fine writing .

		The story opens in
Rome	LOCATION	, and the first half of it consists of the sort of sophisticated conversation which Mr.
R. W. Chambers	PERSON	reels off by the mile , and which bears no relation to the intercourse of men and women in real life .

		Then , all at once , something happens .

		A novelist , who has the reputation of being a godless scoffer and a man of unclean life , meets an American beauty , whom he wooes tempestuously , being repulsed for his pains .

		Finding himself in her company on a steamship , he lures her to the ship 's side , clasps her in his arms , and jumps over - board with her .

		They are rescued , and landed on a small island somewhere near
Naples	LOCATION	, whereupon he instals the disdainful maiden in a deserted villa .

		Presently the cholera breaks out on the island , and the simple fisher - folk who inhabit it seek to mob the visitor as the magician who has brought this evil upon them .

		Whereupon he develops heroic quali - ties .

		Holding the mob at bay , he persuades them to disperse , and then applies himself heart and soul to the eradication of the plague .

		The hatred and suspicion of the islanders become changed to devo - tion as they witness his unstinted labors in their be - half , and he even wins the blessing of the Camorrist chief who comes from
Naples	LOCATION	expressly to kill him .

		As for the woman , she clearly would be no heroine of romance if she could resist such a hero , and her 464 THE surrender is inevitable .

		When her scandalized friends at last come to her aid , they find her curi - ously indifferent about being rescued .

		It must be said that the story , as a story , turns out to be much better than the opening chapters have led us to anticipate .

		A delightfully whimsical story of the '' Button , button , who 's got the button ? ''

		type is offered in '' The Bishop 's Purse , '' by Mr.

		A charming young woman , who is also a skilled pickpocket , steals a purse con - taining five thousand pounds , and afterwards , grown remorseful , seeks to restore it to its owner .

		But the purse does not stay in the same place , and the pur - suit grows complicated .

		We follow with breathless interest the search for it in its successive hiding - places , and all the while we are rather hoping that the engaging young woman will '' get away with the goods '' for such is the immoral effect to which a story of this type stirs our sympathies .

		The book is by turns detective story , melodrama , and love romance , and in each aspect is particularly entertaining .

		It even provides studies of character that are artistically worth while , which is more than one expects from a light-hearted invention of this sort .

		`` The Heart of the Hills '' is just the sort of novel Mr.
John Fox	PERSON	has taught us to expect .

		There is a
Kentucky	LOCATION	mountain boy with a thirst for knowledge who makes considerable of a man of him - self .

		There is also a mountain girl whose language is not what it might be , but who gropes her way to refinement and the cultivation of gentle instincts .

		These two are predestined for each other , although for a time it seems as if their fates lay in another direction .

		For , contrasted with them , yet very closely linked by circumstance , are two patrician children , a boy and a girl .

		It is only when the final mating comes that elective affinity achieves its deep purpose , and caste has the deciding vote .

		All the way through the novel runs the feud between the
Hawns	PERSON	and the Honeycutts , and their relation - ships are so confused that we are often perplexed to know which is which .

		Two matters of historical interest are ingeniously worked into the narrative the terrorism of the night riders in the tobacco war , and the political struggle that had its dramatic climax in the assassination of
Goebel	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Fox	PERSON	seems to be only at his second best in this book , which means , no doubt , that he has worked out his richest veins , and has to fall back upon tailings .

		The story would be striking enough if we were not all the time forced to contrast it with its prede - cessors .

		`` The Fifth Trumpet '' is a second novel by Mr.
Paul Bertram	PERSON	, the author of that sterling historical romance , `` The Shadow of Power . ''

		The scene is
Constance	PERSON	, the year
1418	DATE	, when the
Council	ORGANIZATION	is in session , and the friends of the Church are earnestly working for its reform from within .

		The novel gives a strong and vivid description of the ecclesiastical corruption then prevalent , when avarice and licen - tiousness ruled in the seats of the mighty , and when timorous souls guarded their speech lest the strong arm of authority should deal with them as heretics .

		The leading character is the town clerk , an austere and indignant puritan , who endangers himself by his rash utterances , and who finally comes under the ban for his murder of a sensual beast whose frock does not save him from this righteous retribution .

		In the end he is saved , through the efforts of an adven - turess of light morals whom he has scorned , but whose life has a nobler side which is revealed to him in his time of trial .

		``
Magnus Stein	PERSON	had at last found a human being worthy of the name one who had sinned and erred , but had never done anything mean or small , one who had suffered the deadliest offence and given all for the offender , who had triumphed over all the lesser instincts of our nature and risen to true greatness through her love , and who , if she had erred up to the last , had with that sin purchased her pardon . ''

		And so , at last , these two take their leave of
Constance	PERSON	, the woman 's soul softened and purified by love , the man 's sympathies deepened by the revelation of her essential character .

		It makes a fine historical study and a beautiful ro - mance , reminding us in many ways of `` The Cloister and the Hearth , '' which is the supreme masterpiece in this kind .

		It is , on the whole , rather more of a compli - ment than the reverse to say of Mr.
Farnol	PERSON	's `` An Amateur Gentleman '' that it is `` The Broad High - way '' over again .

		For who else among our purvey - ors of romantic entertainment could have matched that delightful performance ?

		Surely we do not often find ourselves in better company than that of
Barnabas Barty	PERSON	, whose father
John	PERSON	, sometime Champion of
England	LOCATION	, is landlord of a country inn .

		When
Barnabas	PERSON	, learning that he is heir to the for - tune of a half-forgotten uncle , announces his inten - tion of going to
London	LOCATION	and becoming a gentleman , he encounters his father 's objections , and straight - way proves his quality by knocking him down in a friendly passage of fists .

		Thus do his adventures begin , and they are continued on the road and in the streets of the great city .

		They are numerous and surprising surprisingly numerous , we ought to say and they are such as befits a hero of
Barnabas	ORGANIZATION	's brawn and disposition .

		It would be a serious task even to count the occasions upon which he finds himself in dangerous straits , and clears himself by pluck , not unaided , however , by the extraordinary luck which attends his footsteps .

		It is the
London	LOCATION	of the Regency to which his path is directed , and he swaggers with the best in that society of sporting bucks and beaus .

		Everything comes his way , including the fair and aristocratic
Cleone	PERSON	, whom he wins from many rivals by his prowess and gentleness , and whose love is so strongly cemented that it is proof against the revelation -LRB- which is made in due time -RRB- of his plebeian birth .

		There are characters in these pages that might have stepped out of
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	, and a wholly satisfying romantic complication that is
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 465 lacking in no essential element of interest , and that is worked out in the highest of spirits .

		The hand of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	seems to have lost none of its cunning , and , in `` The Mating of
Lydia	LOCATION	, '' she has again made a surprisingly good story out of comparatively simple materials .

		It is good not only as to texture and finish of detail , but also as to the elaboration of its plot , which rises steadily to a climax of absorbing interest .

		The scene is some - where in the
Lake ` District	LOCATION	, where is situated the gloomy castle to which
Edmund Melrose	PERSON	, at the opening of the story , brings home his young Italian wife and their child .

		Melrose , who is a man of immense wealth , is a collector of antiques and objets d'art , and the castle is filled with the packing cases that have preceded his arrival .

		His passion as a collector is such that he is unwilling to provide his wife with the simplest comforts , for which reason she one day takes secret flight , with her going the child and a valuable bronze
Hermes	ORGANIZATION	much treasured by her husband .

		To him , it is a good riddance -LRB- save for the
Hermes	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and he takes no steps in the matter , beyond providing a miserable pittance for the woman 's support in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Being excessively penurious in all matters wherein art is not concerned , Melrose neglects his tenants until the condition of their cottages becomes a scandal to the whole countryside .

		One day , a young man named
Faver	PERSON	- sliam is bicycling in the neighborhood , and has a bad accident , making it necessary to instal him in the castle , which is the nearest human abode .

		Melrose fumes about the intrusion , but becomes reconciled to it when he discovers that
Faversham	PERSON	is the owner of certain rare gems .

		The young man remains under
Melrose	ORGANIZATION	's roof , is given every atten - tion until he recovers , and is then surprised by an offer from Melrose to make him his secretary and agent at a very large salary .

		He accepts , and is presently informed that he has been made his em - ployer 's sole heir .

		He hopes , as agent for the estate , to be able to secure decent conditions for the tenants , but in this he is thwarted by
Melrose	ORGANIZATION	's obstinacy .

		Here arises the moral issue which the author needs to keep her conscience clear .

		Shall Faversham re - main , accomplishing what limited good he can , and all the time looking forward to the opportunities to be given him later , by full possession , or shall he renounce his prospects , and refuse to act as the agent of so unnatural a landlord .

		When
Melrose	ORGANIZATION	's wife and child turn up , after the desertion of twenty years previous , the problem becomes still more complicated , for in accepting the heirship ,
Faver	PERSON	- sham will be dispossessing those to whom the estate would otherwise go .

		He is lured , and wavers , and then , when Melrose has died and left him the law - ful owner , makes the great renunciation , thereby winning instead the love of the young woman who has made his action in this matter the final search - ing test of his character .

		In her view , the money in his possession would be doubly tainted , because of the neglected villages , and because of claims of wife and child to the inheritance .

		Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	makes too much of this latter point , for surely no man is morally or otherwise bound to leave all his wealth to wife and children , while as for the other point , there is much to be said for
Faversham	ORGANIZATION	's temporiz - ing position in consideration of his generous inten - tions for the future .

		At any rate , there is the problem , and Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	clearly thinks that both arguments against his heirship are morally valid .

		As for
Lydia	PERSON	, a nice girl who paints amateurish pictures , the problem of her `` mating '' is the choice between
Faversham	PERSON	and young Lord Tatham , and we should have been quite as well satisfied had it fallen upon the latter .

		He , however , gets the Melrose heiress as a consolation prize , and his heart does not seem to be damaged by this substitution of a new object of his affections for the old one . ''

		The Combined Maze , '' by
Miss May Sinclair	PERSON	, is a novel similar in general theme to Mr.
Alfred Ollivant	PERSON	's '' The Royal Road . ''

		In other words , it tells the harrowing story of a
London	LOCATION	clerk , who saddles himself with wife , children , and a house on the instalment plan , with no better excuse than is offered by wages of about a hundred pounds a year .

		It is made more harrowing by the fact that the clerk marries the wrong girl , a wanton creature who de - velops slatternly habits and finally runs away with another man .

		All the while , the girl he should have married is near at hand , but even when he might be free to make a home for her , he is prevented by the cost of getting a divorce from his faithless wife .

		When at last he has scraped together the needed amount , the wife reappears , herself deserted , and his hopes of happiness are again blighted .

		Miss Sin - clair 's portraiture is vivid and convincing , at least as to her principal characters .

		The title of the book is taken from a figure in the hero 's polytechnic gym - nasium a marching figure in which boys and girls make complicated designs in the course of their evo - lutions .

		It is not a happy title , because it has to be unduly stretched to become a symbol of the maze of life -
WILLIAM MOBTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The great dearth of English books descriptive of
Austria	LOCATION	is quite re - markable .

		Mr.
Briliant	PERSON	, in his bib - liographical list on
Austria	LOCATION	in the `` Encyclopaedia Britannica , '' does not refer to a single book in En - glish .

		Some will perhaps regard this dearth as a sad reflection on the English-speaking world in so far as it shows our extreme indifference to one of the most important countries of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
James Baker	PERSON	, novelist and traveller , now essays to supply a presumably increasing demand with his work on ``
Austria	LOCATION	: Her People and Their Homelands '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		To begin with the worst that can be said of it , the book is wretchedly written , and the pub - lishers are not to be congratulated on putting out in this form a work which needed to be touched up in grammar , spelling , and style in countless spots .

		466 THE DIAL , -LSB-
June 1	DATE	There are errors which would make a bright school - boy shudder .

		Some slips are obviously due to care - lessness , as when the author speaks of Riva as '' the south-eastern outpost of
Austria	LOCATION	. ''

		The writer has made apparently no attempt to render uniformly and correctly the Slavic names , and serenely writes ``
Cech	PERSON	, '' `` Palacky , '' `` Sevcik , '' `` Dvorak '' -LRB- though the last is correctly given on p. 6 -RRB- .

		Even the Ger - man names are inconsistently printed ; thus on p. 47 we find both Olmiitz and Olmutz , but generally the umlaut marks are ignored .

		In spite of these very serious blemishes , however , there is in the book much that is good .

		The author has a pleasant chatty style which makes easy reading .

		He knows his subject thoroughly , having travelled in
Austria	LOCATION	much for a period of forty years , and makes a very sensible choice of material .

		He has a good eye for the pic - turesque , and in general is scrupulously careful about color-words .

		We wish he had had more space for some of the legends to which he rather tantalizingly refers ; for we doubt if many of these legends are easily accessible elsewhere .

		Considered absolutely , too , the book gives far too little space to
Vienna	LOCATION	; possibly , however , the author deliberately chose thus to save some space for the less known parts of this wonderful country .

		The great Oesterreich indeed is deserving of being more widely known .

		It is full of magnificent scenery ; it possesses interesting relics of a most interesting and significant past , both in its picturesque castles and in its superb museums ; it is a hive of industry of every kind , from the simple , primitive labor of the peasants to the large manu - factories of the centres of trade .

		Moreover , it should be of special interest to Americans because of the racial rivalries so noticeable in many parts of the country .

		Concerning these , by the way , Mr.
Baker	PERSON	is decidedly optimistic ; he regards it as '' really an immense power , for the keen emulation and the struggle for supremacy has enforced advancement on all lines . ''

		Finally , we have much to learn from
Austria	LOCATION	about education .

		Fancy in any American school a well organized course for hotel-keepers and waiters ; yet this is precisely what we find at the
Innsbruck Handelsakademie	LOCATION	.

		On other matters , too , e.g. , the relations between labor and culture ,
Austria	LOCATION	has much for us to learn .

		Mr.
Baker	PERSON	's book may well serve to arouse interest in this won - derful old-new country .

		We must , finally , grumble a little about the illustrations in water color , by Mr.
Donald Maxwell	PERSON	.

		Some of them are beautiful ; yet for the special purpose of the book , we are phil - istine enough to think that well-selected photographs would have served far better .

		President l n the brief and modest preface to S ^ i `` The New Freedom '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- , credo .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	informs us that the book was put together by Mr.
William Bayard Hale	PERSON	, who grouped `` in their right sequences the more suggestive portions of my campaign speeches ... I have left the sentences in the form in which they were stenographically reported .

		I have not tried to alter the easy-going and often colloquial phrase - ology in which they were uttered from the platform , in the hope that they would seem the more fresh and spontaneous because of their very lack of pruning and recasting . ''

		The reader may feel some mis - giving as to the wisdom of this plan while reading the first address , '' The Old Order Changeth , '' which is somewhat general and abstract and shows no marked clearness or vigor ; but as one reads on through succeeding chapters `` What is Progress ? ''

		`` Freemen Need No Guardians , '' `` Life Comes from the Soil , '' and the whole series of twelve addresses , concluding with `` The Liberation of a People 's Vital Energies , '' one becomes more and more convinced that President
Wilson	PERSON	judged wisely in retaining the colloquial tone and oral ring of his original style .

		The tense conviction on fundamental problems of our national life , the broad and deep sympathy with all the people , the splendid enthusiasm for liberty and the free play of human forces these characteristics of Presi - dent
Wilson	PERSON	are fittingly perpetuated in the lan - guage of a leader addressing great audiences of American people .

		One 's satisfaction with the style of the book is confirmed by the reiteration of favorite principles from time to time in the various speeches in a manner scarcely suited to formal written prose , but entirely in keeping with the requirements of oral expression , and serving to impress deeply upon the mind of the reader the chief tenets of the Presi - dent 's political creed and to suggest vividly the liv - ing voice addressing great audiences of men and women .

		Moreover , the enthusiasm of the public leader , so fittingly preserved in this oral style , grows to an ever deeper note and more vibrant ring from the beginning to the end of the volume , so that the effect of the whole series of addresses is assimilated to that of one long and noble oration , rising from sober initial statements through forceful and convincing argument to a climax of rhetorical and even poetic beauty and power .

		The style , however , is not the main thing in these addresses .

		The main things are , first , the man rational , self-restrained , yet fired with indignation against abuses in the government of the great Republic in which he ardently believes ; and , secondly , the simple and ancient principles , few and plain , to which he recalls his people .

		With all his scholar - ship and restraint , both of which stamp these speeches , President
Wilson	PERSON	as he appears in the addresses blends a portion of the spirit of the Hebrew prophets with that of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	.

		He has something of Isaiah 's confidence in
Jehovah	LOCATION	and loyalty to Him with much of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's trust in the plain people .

		No shallow optimism and no barren pessimism appear in these speeches , but a profoundly serious tone of warning and a jubilant appeal .

		They constitute for the people a sort of proclamation of emancipation from the rule of special interests .


1913	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 467 Mr.
Clarence M. Weed	PERSON	, whose sum - rT m ?

		r farm at
Ellsworth	LOCATION	,
New Hamp	LOCATION	- shire , affords him excellent oppor - tunity for the study of
New England	LOCATION	plant and insect life , and who has travelled observantly in other parts of our broad land , contributes an unusually attractive and well-written as well as soundly-instructive vol - ume to the literature of the woods and fields and of the abundant objects of interest there to be found .

		`` Seeing Nature First '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- begins with a preface in which it is contended that an acquaint - ance with the flora and fauna of one 's own country '' not only opens up new fields of thought and effort at home , but also gives the best sort of preparation for travel abroad . ''

		The nature - studies presented in the succeeding chapters are grouped chronolog - ically under the four seasons of the year , beginning with
spring	DATE	, and are about equally divided between plant-life and insect-life .

		As an instance of the author 's carefulness of observation , the following passage on the closed gentian may be quoted : `` The flowers are completely closed , a fact which led
John Burroughs	PERSON	in one of his delightful essays to suggest that it does not receive insect visitors .

		But the worker bumblebees could tell you better , for they have learned how to pry open the mouth of the blossom and enter for the nectar at its base , where they circle around the flower in a way to come in contact with both stamens and pistil .

		And they also can tell from the color of the blossom whether it is young and nectar-bearing . ''

		But how can one be sure that it is the color and not some other sign , perceptible perhaps only to insect sense , that guides the bee to the nectar-bearing blos - soms ?

		Useful to
New Englanders	LOCATION	are the pages devoted to the gypsy and the brown-tail moths , those pests that have lately cost the tax - payer so many thousands of dollars .

		The story of
Leopold Trouvelet	PERSON	and his unfortunate attempt to produce silk from gypsy-moth culture at
Medford	LOCATION	,
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts whence sprang an Iliad of woes might appropriately have found a place in Mr.
Weed	PERSON	's account of the pest as a recent importation from
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Numerous and excellent illustrations -LRB- two in color -RRB- , from photographs and from drawings by Mr.
W. I. Beecroft	PERSON	, enrich the volume , which could be made still more useful , in any subsequent issue , by the addition of an index .

		The '' Tenth ^ * 8 nai > dly possible to say anything Muse '' in her new about
Sappho	PERSON	and her divine island home .

		lyricg ; but it was a happy tnought of Dr.
Mary Mills Patrick	PERSON	, President of Constanti - nople College , `` to reproduce the famous poetess in the picturesque island of Lesbos . ''

		The chapter on Mitylene is wholly delightful ; and the author is to be envied for her charming experiences among scenes where '' one hears the name of Sappho spoken on every hand , both in reference to the poet , of whom all the island is still proud , and to her name - sakes , of whom there are so many that it is perhaps not too much to say that there is one in every family . ''

		Other chapters treat of the age , life , and work of Sappho ; and the eighth contains a good translation of the fragments , including those re - cently discovered in
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		Throughout the book Dr.
Patrick	PERSON	's treatment is colored by a roseate optimism that excites admiration and envy , even when one is compelled to question or deny .

		This virtue , or defect , is seen particularly in her insistence that
Sappho	PERSON	's poetry is to be interpreted as the work of an absolutely impeccable model of propriety , the irreproachable headmistress of an
Academy of Music and Poetry	ORGANIZATION	, where the gentlest and sweetest of Greek maidens were trained to tread the shining paths of serene culture and pious purity .

		This view represents an idealising development of
Welcker	PERSON	's belief , announced about a century ago , and is supported by the weighty name of
Von Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf	PERSON	, assuredly one of the greatest authorities of the century .

		But the re - viewer is unchivalrously skeptical .

		It is dangerous to read a fine Lutheran sense of chastity , or a lofty New England Puritanism , into the erotic poetry of
Greece	LOCATION	written during the seventh and sixth cen - turies before our era ; and the judgment of classical antiquity about the Lesbian nightingale was strik - ingly unanimous on the other side .

		However , the lyrics themselves are the important thing ; and as to their merits the world of letters is absolutely at one .

		Among the twenty-six illustrations that form a valuable feature of the book are included many antique representations of Sappho ; but even from this excellent collection the reader will turn away with the feeling that he has gained no clearer pic - ture of her features than he might make for himself from her own verses and the olden tales of her charm and beauty .

		The volume is legibly printed , simply and pleasingly bound , and tastefully pre - sented in general .

		-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Anglo-Saxon Ever since the prophetic utterance control of of
William H. Seward	PERSON	, in the middle the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		O f tne i ast century , thoughtful pub - licists have pondered over the future of the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		One of the latest of these is Mr.
Frank Fox	PERSON	, news editor of the
London	LOCATION	'' Morning Post , '' whose '' Problems of the Pacific '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- indicates the great questions which are soon to arise in this region and also endeavors to point out their solution .

		It is his belief that '' on the bosom of the
Pacific	LOCATION	will be decided , in peace or in war , the next great struggle of civilization , which will give as its pi-ize the supremacy of the world .

		Shall it go to the White Race or the Yellow Race ?

		If to the
White Race	ORGANIZATION	, will it be under the British flag or the flag of the
United States	LOCATION	, or of some other nation ?

		That is the problem of the
Pacific	LOCATION	. ''

		In the effort to solve this problem he studies in turn , in sketchy fashion , all the countries which lie about this great ocean .

		And in other chapters he compares their armies and navies , and comments on their industrial position .

		His final conclusion is '' that friendly cooperation between the
United States	LOCATION	and Great 468 THE DIAL -LSB-
June	DATE	1
Britain	LOCATION	would give to the Anglo-Saxon race the mastery of the world 's greatest ocean , laying for ever the fear of the Yellow Peril , securing for the world that its greatest readjustment of the balance of power shall be effected in peace : but that rivalry between these two kindred nations may cause the greatest evils , and possibly irreparable disasters . ''

		This conclusion is very gratifying to Anglo-Saxons , yet it can not be said that Mr.
Fox	PERSON	has argued his case as convincingly as might be demanded .

		Per - haps the limits of the volume precluded this .

		Nor is the necessity for the '' mastery '' of the
Pacific	LOCATION	made clear .

		To-day no nation seems to be `` master , '' and yet commerce thrives and peace prevails .

		Only the other day an American professor demonstrated , to his own satisfaction at least , that the cooperation of the
United States	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	would '' prevent any intruders from disturbing the balance of power in the
Pacific	LOCATION	. ''

		And a fairly good brief might be held for
China	LOCATION	, provided the hour of achievement were set sufficiently in the future .

		It is a great pity that Mr.
Fox	PERSON	's volume , which is so readable throughout , suffers from an unusual number of errors in the statement of facts , some thirty-five having been noticed by the present reviewer .

		He speaks of the `` most magnificent and sublime sight '' of hun - dreds of '' black fish '' sporting in the waves and resembling a drove of hogs evidently porpoises .

		A descendant of

Joseph Ballard Crocker	PERSON	, supplies useful footnotes and a biographical introduction to the book .

		A hittorv With the appearance of the fourth of Oreek and final volume of
Theodor Gom	PERSON	- phiiosophv .

		perz ' s `` Greek Thinkers : A History of Ancient Philosophy '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- comes the news of the death of the author , which occurred just after he had corrected the final proofs of the English translation of this volume made by Mr.
G. G. Berry	PERSON	of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		The original design of the work was to provide a history of Greek thought , from its begin - nings in the work of the nature-philosophers of
Ionia	LOCATION	, down to the beginning of the Christian era .

		But as the work progressed the author saw that this plan was impossible , and so restricted his design to the
end of the first quarter of the third century before Christ	DATE	, the epoch , that is to say , when the develop - ment of the sciences reached a point where they could no longer be laid tributary by a single thinker to a systematic philosophy .

		The matter thus crowded out of the present work , dealing with Stoicism ,
Epi	ORGANIZATION	- cureanism , and Skepticism , the author had hoped to cover in another book to be entitled '' The
Phil	PERSON	- osophy of the Hellenistic Age , '' but on which he had made no progress at the time of his death .

		The loss of such a work is most regrettable , for
Gomperz	ORGANIZATION	's history will be especially prized by the reader who wants a more detailed treatment of ancient philos - ophy than can be given in any of the single-volume histories such as
Windelband	ORGANIZATION	's , and yet at the same time wishes to have a treatment less technical in design and more literary in finish and from a later viewpoint than some of the German classic treat - ments .

		The present volume of
Gomperz	ORGANIZATION	's work is given over for the most part to the thought of Aristotle , only the final five out of forty-three chap - ters being devoted to his successors , Theophrastus of Eresus and
Straton	PERSON	of Lampsacus .

		Of Aristotle , the author writes with sympathy tempered by criti - cism ; his attitude toward the Aristotelian logic is appreciative , although he follows Mill in delimiting its functions ; while his discussion of Aristotle 's '' katharsis '' is both clear and suggestive .


Marie	PERSON	- The title , `` Marie-Antoinette : Her
Antoinette	PERSON	's - rn i - \ r ii i i T i - * r first years Ear ty Youth , which Lady Young - in
France	LOCATION	.

		husband has chosen for her very thorough study of one period in the life of the un - fortunate French queen , is accurate enough , per - haps , but likely to give a wrong impression .


Marie	PERSON	-
Antoinette	PERSON	's '' youth , '' as here dealt with , is not her childhood , but the years immediately following .

		The book deals entirely with the four years between the marriage of the vivacious Austrian princess to the excellent but clumsy French Dauphin , and the death of the
Dauphin	ORGANIZATION	's execrable grandfather .

		`` The main object , '' of the work , in the words of the author , `` was to unravel a nebulous , if highly attractive , personality , and to replace by a human
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 469 being the kind of lay figure which over-much indis - criminate reading had tended to produce . ''

		The effort has been crowned with a measure of success .

		In the centre of this foolish , feverish , and depraved society we catch now and then the regular beating of this one warm , pure , and honest heart ; and this one child-matron 's wholesomeness and sanity are all the more pleasing for the contrast with the condi - tions that surround them .

		Marie-Antoinette had faults , but they seem to have been pretty well summed up in the estimate of the brave and severe old Empress , her mother , '' raillerie and untidi - ness . ''

		Lady
Younghusband	PERSON	marshalls her details with a catholic enthusiasm that reminds one of that delightful French historical '' restorer '' M. Len6 ~ tre , although it is only now and then that she commands such a vivifying magic touch as his .

		The very uni - versality of her interest is in her way , for it destroys all perspective and allows the reader 's attention no rest .

		She cares quite as much for the watchful Austrian ambassador Mercy , even for the faithful but tiresome tutor-priest
Vermond	PERSON	, as she does for the heroine herself , and tells us almost if not quite as much about them ; and she - finds it so difficult to let one charming character go until she has ex - hausted all her information concerning him , from his antecedents to his ultimate fate , that it is very difficult to keep a clear idea of the chronology .

		The book would be much more confusing still if it were not for the excellent index , which adds after the name of each person mentioned a sort of description enabling one to place him more easily , thus : ''
Bour	PERSON	- bon , Duchesse de -LRB- daughter of Due d'Orleans -RRB- , '' and `` Bouret ,
Monsieur	PERSON	-LRB- Cabinet Secretary to Louis XV . -RRB-

		. ''

		The volume is published in handsome form by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some notable Mrs '
Alice Ke	PERSON	.

		m P - Wel ch , the author women of the of '' Six Mediaeval Women '' -LRB- Mac - middie ages .

		millan -RRB- , a collection of essays some of which have already appeared in '' The Nineteenth Century and After , '' is a keen and capable student of the past , bringing certain long-dead members of her sex back to life with remarkable skill , consider - ing the very meagre data at her command .

		After a long introduction crammed with curious informa - tion , she takes up in chronological order six gifted women who lived between the tenth and the fifteenth centuries .

		The first one dealt with , the nun Ros - witha of
Gandersheim	LOCATION	, in the
Harz Mountains	LOCATION	, has been treated by no other modern writer , and her biographer depends for information concerning her principally upon her own writings , of which the most important are six religious dramas .

		Almost or quite as unfamiliar to most of us is the
Magdeburg Beguine Mechthild	LOCATION	, whom this investigator shows writing passionate love-lyrics addressed to her God as another might write poems to an earthly lover .

		Mahaut ,
Countess of Artois	ORGANIZATION	, a relative of
St. Louis	LOCATION	, and herself a philanthropist and a disinterested patron of various artistic and industrial endeavors , is portrayed as a remarkable example of virtue and culture in a corrupt and materialistic age .

		The other three names are better known : Marie de
France	LOCATION	, the Anglo-French love-poet whose influence over
Chaucer	LOCATION	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and a host of lesser names is easily traceable ;
Christine de Pisan	PERSON	, the brave fifteenth-century blue-stocking and advocate of equal rights for women ; and
Agnes Sorel	PERSON	, the amiable mistress of Charles VII .

		The author 's desire to make a heroine and a world-power of the lady last named has prompted some inferences to which the facts have not led other historians , and in general this chapter seems the least satisfactory of all .

		A concluding chapter on '' Mediaeval Gardens '' is a prettily-flavored reminder that our forefathers loved trees and flowers quite as much as we do , even if in a different way .

		Mr.
Archibald G. B. Russell	PERSON	's criti - l ^ udy and catalogue raisonne '' of `` The Engravings of
William Blake	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the fruit of many years of study and research by the foremost living authority on the work of that eccentric artist .

		To collectors of
Blake	PERSON	's engravings it furnishes a much-needed guide .

		The catalogue is not only an exhaustive one , including a number of hitherto unknown engravings by
Blake	PERSON	, some of them after his own designs , which have been discovered by Mr.
Russell	PERSON	, but is made of exceptional value by the very full notes that are appended to each item described .

		The information given in these notes is of the most varied character ; apparently nothing has been overlooked that can be of help to the student or the collector .

		The usual information about '' states '' is given ; when neces - sary the subjects are described and the conditions under which the works were produced ; the present ownership of drawings and the rarer prints is indi - cated , together with a multitude of other interesting details .

		In the critical study the story of
Blake	PERSON	's life is told in compact form , his work as an engraver is reviewed , and his peculiar technical processes are described .

		Incidentally attention is called to the fact that '' the great majority of the coloured draw - ings purporting to be
Blake	PERSON	's original designs for his books are copies done from the books by other hands , '' and one of the well-known drawings in the Print Room at the British Museum is placed in this category by Mr.
Russell	PERSON	.

		The illustrations to this book include a number of
Blake	ORGANIZATION	's engravings which have not heretofore been reproduced , and also many of his most important works .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Professor
John W. Cunliffe	PERSON	's `` Early English Classical - Tragedies '' -LRB- Frowde -RRB- is a volume which gives us , with much editorial apparatus , the text of four plays : `` Gor - boduc , '' ''
Jocasta	PERSON	, '' '' Gismond of Salerne , '' and '' The Misfortunes of
Arthur	PERSON	. '' ''

		The Case for Woman Suffrage '' is a critically annotated bibliography of the subject prepared by Miss
Margaret Ladd Franklin	PERSON	and published in
New York City	LOCATION	by the
National College Equal Suffrage League	ORGANIZATION	.

		470 THE DIAL , -LSB-
June 1	DATE	The arrangement of entries is chronological by year of publication , and the classification is into books , plays , articles and periodicals , congressional reports , etc. .

		In - tended primarily for college women , its usefulness should extend among all who are interested in equal suffrage .

		The series of '' English Readings for Schools '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- has just been increased by three volumes : `` Franklin 's Autobiography , '' edited by Mr.
Frank Woodworth	PERSON	Pine ; '' Selections from
Tennyson	PERSON	's Idyls of the King , '' edited by Professor
John Erskine	PERSON	; and '' Old Testament Narratives , '' edited by Professor
George Henry Nettleton	PERSON	.

		The amazingly erudite
Rabbi Kaufmann Kohler	PERSON	, who was in charge of
Sinai Temple	ORGANIZATION	in
Chicago	LOCATION	sometime in the seventies , afterwards officiated in
New York	LOCATION	, and has now for many years been president of the
Hebrew Union College	ORGANIZATION	in
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, attained his seventieth birthday on
May	DATE	the tenth last , and in honor of the occasion , his colleagues have dedicated to him a volume of '' Studies in Jewish Literature , '' which is published by
Herr Georg Reimer	PERSON	,
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		Some of the papers are in German , but the majority are in English .

		Not the least striking feature of the work is the
Kohler	PERSON	bibliog - raphy , which runs to eight hundred items .

		One of the first volumes to appear under the imprint of
Messrs. Sully & Kleinteich	ORGANIZATION	, a publishing-house recently established in
New York City	LOCATION	, is the manual , `` How to Obtain Citizenship , '' prepared by Mr.
Nathaniel C. Fowler	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Brief and simply-worded directions are given in English , Italian , Yiddish , German , and French ; and while no attempt has been made to include strictly technical terms or to unravel such complications as occasionally arise from faulty interpretation of the law , the book contains the essential directions for aliens or foreigners desiring citizenship of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Two other useful manuals published at the same time are '' The Art of Letter - writing , '' by the same author as the above , and '' The Etiquette of To-day , '' by Miss
Edith B. Ordway	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Orison Swett Marden	PERSON	's abounding optimism finds characteristic expression in another addition to the ''
Marden	PERSON	Efficiency Books , '' its subject this time being '' The Joys of Living '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The world-old prin - ciple that life holds for us just as much as we bring to it , that whether life is worth living depends on the liver , that the music of the song is in the ear of the hearer , is elaborated and illustrated with all Mr.
Marden	PERSON	's well - known felicity of manner and richness of thought .

		`` The whole world is full of unworked joy-mines , '' is his inspiriting assertion on an early page , and prospectors for the precious metal will find many a useful hint in his book .

		Without offering anything really new on his somewhat hackneyed theme , the author does well to call attention afresh to the supreme importance of the sub - jective element in the attainment of happiness .

		Under the title , `` The Making of To-Morrow '' -LRB-
Eaton & Mains	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a handy volume packed with little nuggets of wisdom and advice has been made out of selections from Professor
Shailer Mathews	PERSON	's editorial paragraphs contributed to '' The World To-Day '' during the eight years and more that he conducted that wide-awake and never uninteresting monthly .

		Under the general head - ings , '' The Common Lot , '' '' The Church and Society , '' '' The Stirrings of a Nation 's Conscience , '' and '' The Extension of Democracy , '' are grouped two-score brief and pithy disquisitions on present-day tendencies , good and evil , in society , business , politics , international rela - tions , the church and the school , and wherever else the discerning eye of this observant writer turned its gaze in quest of signs of the times .

		Even the game of base - ball is turned to account by
Dean Mathews	PERSON	in pointing his moral and adorning his tale .

		The book is timely and thoughtful and readable .

		Two new volumes are just added to the `` Country Home Library , '' a series of architectural books for the layman published by Messrs.
McBride	PERSON	,
Nast & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		One is '' The Dutch Colonial House '' prepared by Mr.
Aymar Embury	PERSON	, II. , with the purpose of illustrating the applicability of old Dutch methods of architecture to modern construction , especially in designing the small country-home known as the `` long , low house , '' now much in vogue .

		The other , Mr.
Charles E. Hooper	PERSON	's '' Reclaiming the Old House , '' gives detailed directions for properly incorporating present-day conveniences in the architecture of the old-time house without essen - tially disturbing its traditions or charm .

		A third volume , similar in size and appearance , is Mr.
Alfred Hopkins	PERSON	's '' Modern Farm Buildings , '' in which an experienced architect offers suggestions for the most approved ways of constructing stables , barns , and other farm buildings on practical , sanitary , and artistic lines .

		Collected chiefly from periodicals in which they ap - peared some years ago , the pleasant sketches and studies of Mrs.
Katharine Dboris Sharp	PERSON	's '' Summer in a Bog '' -LRB-
Stewart & Kidd Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- furnish agreeable and seasonable reading to amateur botanists and to nature-lovers in gen - eral .

		Miscellaneous local lore and neighborhood gossip , the latter in dialogue form with touches of dialect , two original poems , and frequent quotations in both prose and verse , with brief notes on botanists of greater or less distinction , make up the substance of the book .

		The bog referred to is , or was , in
Madison County	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, and its flora appears to have been rich and interesting .

		The attracti veness of Mrs. Sharp 's volume would have been increased by a division of its contents into chapters with chapter-headings instead of the rather breathless arrange - ment -LRB- diversified , however , by page-headings and other devices -RRB- actually adopted .

		The writer 's fellow-naturalists of her own
State	ORGANIZATION	will especially enjoy the book .

		A critical but appreciative summary of
Eucken	ORGANIZATION	's religious teachings is contained in Professor
Henry C. Sheldon	PERSON	's small volume entitled ''
Rudolf Eucken	PERSON	's Message to Our Age '' -LRB-
Eaton & Mains	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author has a very high appreciation of
Eucken	ORGANIZATION	's philosophy in general , and especially is impressed with those features of it which emphasize the transcendental as well as the immanental nature of the spiritual realm .

		This spiritual realm , to
Eucken	LOCATION	, is equivalent with the reality which has always lain behind the term God ; but
Eucken	PERSON	uses the idea impersonally , and does not believe in the kind of God imagined by believers in what is known as a theodicy that is , a governing of the world by God .

		Professor
Sheldon	PERSON	softens down the refusal of Eucken to postulate a personal God by quotations from his writ - ings in which .

		Eucken does seem hospitable to the idea that some of the attributes of personality inhere in the divine .

		The author 's main criticism of
Eucken	LOCATION	, which whole-souled followers of Eueken and other modernists will consider perhaps the most disappointing part of his little book , deals with the German philosopher 's teach - ings about Christ .

		Eucken is '' Unitarian '' in his posi - tion , and Professor
Sheldon	PERSON	prefers the authority of the New Testament to the use of secular reason here .

		He also seems to deprecate
Eucken	PERSON	's attitude toward the miraculous , which is probably even more agnostic than his present interpreter sees fit to admit .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 471 NOTES .

		A translation , by Mr.
Joseph McCabe	PERSON	, of
Francisco Ferrer	PERSON	's '' Origin and Ideals of the Modern School '' will be published at once by Messrs.

		The Magic Formula '' is the title of a new volume of essays and studies by Professor
L P. Jacks	PERSON	, editor of '' The Hibbert Journal . ''

		Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	will publish the book early next autumn .

		A new novel by
Willa S. Gather	PERSON	, entitled '' O Pion - eers ! ''

		and dealing with the Scandinavian and Bohemian pioneers of the
Middle West	LOCATION	, will be issued early this month by
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two new novels announced for immediate issue by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	are '' The Thunderhead Lady , '' by
Brian Read	PERSON	and
Anna Fuller	PERSON	, and '' An Unknown Lover , '' by
Jessie de Home Vaizey	ORGANIZATION	.

		Three immediately forthcoming
Dutton	PERSON	books are '' The Big Game of Central and
Western China	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
H. F. Wallace	PERSON	; a biography of
Arbella Stuart	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
B. C. Hardy	PERSON	; and '' Industrial Warfare , '' by Messrs.
Charles Watney	PERSON	and
James A. Little	PERSON	.

		The first issues of a new English weekly , '' The New Statesman , '' have recently made their appearance .

		It is of the same form and general type as '' The Nation '' and '' The Spectator , '' but its particular purpose is to deal with public affairs from the standpoint of a sane and practical collectivism .

		Mr. and Mrs.
Sidney Webb	PERSON	and Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	are actively interested in its conduct .

		Dr.
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	has resigned the presidency of
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	, which he has held since
1891	DATE	, in order to devote more of his time to the furtherance of world peace .

		He will hold the office of Chancellor of the
University	ORGANIZATION	, this position being created by the Uni - versity for his especial benefit .


John Casper Branner	PERSON	, professor of geology at
Stanford	ORGANIZATION	since
1892	DATE	, and Vice - President since
1899	DATE	, will become President . ''

		Harper 's Weekly , '' one of the oldest and most influential of the American weeklies , has been sold by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	to ''
Norman Hapgood	PERSON	and associates . ''

		The announcement of sale was made on the 16th by Mr.
George Harvey	PERSON	, president of the
Harper Company	ORGANIZATION	, and editor of the Weekly .

		Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	, for many years editor of ``
Collier	PERSON	's , '' is sure to make of the old ``
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly '' a force far more potent than it has ever been in the past .

		The
Thompson Brown Company	ORGANIZATION	, educational pub - lishers , has conveyed to
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	title to all of its good will , contracts , copyrights , and other assets .

		It announces that the business established in
1844	DATE	and conducted uninterruptedly since then , will continue as a distinct
department of Messrs. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	under the direction of Messrs.
Burges Johnson	PERSON	aud
Edward S. Blagden	PERSON	.

		With this as a nucleus , it is planned to develop an educational publishing business of the highest character .

		The first public library building planned especially for children 's use is about to be erected as an addition to the library system of
Brooklyn	LOCATION	.

		It will stand in a section of the city where the house-builder and the stork are unusually active , and where consequently the juvenile patronage of the library is large .

		The
Brooklyn	LOCATION	librarian , it is also to be noted , has had the courage to condemn as `` dead wood '' 4,500 of the 730,000 volumes in his charge , and they will be disposed of either by gift or sale .

		These and other items of interest are to be found in the current yearly report of the
Brooklyn Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some three years ago the famous explorer , Dr.
Sven Hedin	PERSON	, wrote an account in two volumes of his latest journeying under the title '' Trans-Himalaya : Discov - eries and Adventures in
Tibet	LOCATION	. ''

		It formed by general consent one of the most valuable and fascinating books of travel that had been issued for many years .

		Much interest will therefore be felt in the announcement that Dr.
Hedin	PERSON	has completed a third volume of the work .

		As in the case of the earlier instalments , there will be a large number of illustrations from the author 's own photographs and drawings .

		The book will be published shortly by Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	.

		Among the volumes soon to be published by the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	in its series of '' Studies in English and Comparative Literature '' are : '' Gnomic Poetry in Anglo-Saxon , '' by
Blanche Colton Williams	PERSON	; ''
Aaron Hill	PERSON	, '' by
Alice D. Brewster	PERSON	; '' Learned So - cieties and Literary Scholarship , '' by
Harrison Ross Steeves	PERSON	; and `` Chaucer and the Roman de la Rose , '' by Dean

W. O. Farnsworth	PERSON	, and ''
Diderot	PERSON	as a Disciple of English Thought , '' by
R. Loyalty Cru	ORGANIZATION	.

		A valuable gift consisting of three thousand volumes of statistical literature , collected by Mr.
John Hyde	PERSON	, formerly Chief of the
Bureau of Statistics of the U. S. Department of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	, has been presented by him to the
Statistical Society	ORGANIZATION	of
Japan	LOCATION	, at Tokio , to serve as the substantial nucleus of a new collection that shall in time take the place of the one recently destroyed by fire after thirty-three years of diligent effort in getting it together .

		Mr.
Hyde	PERSON	's collection contains official publications of fifty-two countries , printed in twelve different languages , and the transactions of most of the important statistical societies of the world for a long series of years ; also many miscellaneous reference books .

		515 THE LAUREATESHIP .

		The death of
Alfred Austin	PERSON	, at the age of nearly eighty , is a considerable loss to English literature .

		He was a man of admirable talents , although they amounted to something less than genius , a poet of highly creditable accomplish - ment , and a writer of exquisite prose .

		His life offers an example of continuous devotion to let - ters , increasingly rare in our bustling modern age , yet it was by no means a cloistered life , and did not seek to live in a palace of art aloof from the political and social concerns of the world of men .

		Austin was a publicist as well as a poet , and a steadfast ally of the forces that sustain the social order .

		Born in
1835	DATE	, a Roman Catholic by family and education , he was called to the Bar of the
Inner Temple	ORGANIZATION	in
1857	DATE	.

		But before this he had published a poem and a novel , and after four years in the practice of his profession , gave it up , and devoted the rest of his life to writing .

		The list of his books is a very large one , and of varied interest .

		The collected edi - tion of his poems , published twenty years ago , fills six large volumes , and he has produced much verse since that time .

		Among his poetical works are `` The Season '' and `` The Golden Age , '' satires in verse , `` The Human Tragedy '' and `` Savonarola , '' tragedies , and the miscella - neous volumes , '' Interludes , '' '' Soliloquies in Song , '' and '' English Lyrics . ''

		His prose writ - ings include several novels , a group of political writings , and `` The Garden That I Love , '' a work dear to all lovers of nature .

		He was a powerful journalist and an effective public speaker , and in all his activities deserved well of his country .

		When , in
1896	DATE	,
Austin	LOCATION	was appointed Poet Laureate , after the post had remained vacant for four years , there arose a chorus of protest which took the form of personal abuse , and which continued until his death .

		It was based upon the striking contrast between
Austin	PERSON	and his predecessor , and upon the popular notion that the Laureate should be the greatest of living poets .

		This notion had been realized in the cases of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	, and had come to be a sort of prepossession of the public mind , although the earlier history of the laureate - ship had hardly given it countenance .

		`` Austin is not a
Tennyson	LOCATION	, therefore let us hold him up to ridicule , '' was the almost unanimous cry of 488 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	the journalists , and their treatment of him ever since has afforded a conspicuous example of jour - nalistic bad manners .

		Newspaper writers , and even critics of repute who should have known better , went out of their way to belittle his every new effort and his total achievement , and he became the butt of every cheap wit and random paragrapher .

		It was an unpleasant exhibition , and not to be justified by the occasional bald - ness of an official lyric , or such an exquisite absurdity as may here and there be picked out of his work .

		The man who wrote these lines upon
Beaconsfield	ORGANIZATION	's grave was something more than an object of ridicule : '' Leave me a little while alone , Here at his grave that still is strown With crumbling flower and wreath ; The laughing rivulet leaps and falls , The thrush exults , the cuckoo calls , And he lies hush 'd beneath . ''

		With myrtle cross and crown of rose And every lowlier flower that blows , His new-made couch is dress 'd ;
Primrose	PERSON	and cowslip , hyacinth wild , Gather 'd by monarch , peasant , child , A nation 's grief attest . ''

		And the man who could pen the exquisite verses to `` Agatha '' could not be held , at his best , an unworthy occupant of the post that
Wordsworth	PERSON	once had filled . ''

		She wanders in the
April	DATE	woods , That glisten with the fallen shower ; She leans her face against the buds , She stops , she stoops , she plucks a flower .

		She feels the ferment of the hour ; She broodeth when the ringdove broods ; The sun and flying clouds have power Upon her cheek and changing moods .

		She can not think she is alone As o er her senses warmly steal Floods of unrest she fears to own , And almost dreads to feel . ''

		When
Austin	LOCATION	became Poet Laureate in
1896	DATE	,
England	LOCATION	had lost nearly all of the poets that had made the Victorian age glorious .

		Swinburne was the only poet of the first rank left alive , and this fierce denouncer of kings and priests could not seriously have been considered as fitted for the function of official champion in verse of throne and altar .

		But if not
Swinburne	PERSON	, the one chosen must come from the ranks of the minor poets , and among these
Austin	LOCATION	had many of the elements of fitness , and his nomi - nation was by no means as absurd as it was held to be by the organs of popular opinion .

		While he has not displayed the quality of a
Wordsworth	PERSON	or a
Tennyson	LOCATION	, he has been a fair match for
Southey	ORGANIZATION	, and a great improvement upon
Pye	PERSON	.

		On the whole , he has probably not lowered the average of the laureates , taking the entire list into account .

		The now vacant post comes opportunely with `` the silly season '' now upon us , and will doubt - less help many a distracted journalist to fill his
summer	DATE	space with inept and jejune comment , and bring our old friends
Vox Populi	ORGANIZATION	and
Pro Bono Publico	LOCATION	well into public view in the contributor 's column .

		We shall be told once more or rather a thousand times more that the laureateship is an anachronism , which we cheerfully admit , wishing only that there were many more of them .

		There are still a few anachronisms left such as peppercorn rents , and beef - eaters , and king 's champions to give picturesqueness to English life , and redeem it in part from a Lloyd Georgian drabness , and we prize the laureateship , not only because it gives official recognition to the finest of the arts , but also because it is a survival from an age whose interests were not wholly material , and which had invented neither sociology , nor eugenics , nor `` temperance , '' nor the fetich of efficiency .

		The post of Laureate is a pleasant one to occupy , even although the traditional vinous emolument has been commuted into a payment of prosaic cash , and a poet may make as much of it as his faculties permit .

		It inspired the
Wellington	LOCATION	Ode , and may conceivably in the future inspire other poems as great .

		Nor is it the ticklish business that it was in
Southey	LOCATION	's time to be the Laureate .

		The monarchy has become chastened in these latter days , and it is not likely again to become incumbent upon its official poet '' To toss the litter of Westphalian swine From under human to above divine . ''

		If we may offer a suggestion as to a proper selection for the vacant post , it seems to us that all the signs indicate Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	.

		A foolish sign is found in the fact that parental foresight named him
Alfred	PERSON	thirty-two years ago ; a serious sign is found in the fact that he has this year published a volume of poems so rich in imaginative power and so glowing with pride in the past glories of English history that no one else seems to us to have as clear a title to the honor , or to be so plainly marked out for the exercise of its peculiar function .

		We can far better imagine Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	as the recipient of the laurel -LRB- this time not greener , but more sere -RRB- from the brows of his predecessor , than we can Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	, in whom we fear the divine fire is nearly quenched , or Mr.

Phillips	PERSON	, whose thoughts dwell with the ghosts of vanished centuries .

		Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	is at least the equal in achievement of any of these , and seems likely to go much farther be - fore he is done .

		His appointment would be one that all lovers of poetry would acclaim , and one that would shed new lustre upon the laureateship .

		THE LIFE-STORY OF A MAGAZINE .

		-LSB- EXPLANATORY NOTE .

		Shortly after the suspension of `` The Lakeside Monthly '' in
1874	DATE	-LRB- then believed to be but temporary -RRB- the proprietors of '' Scribner 's Monthly '' -LRB- after - wards `` The Century Magazine '' -RRB- , Dr.
J. G. Holland	PERSON	and Mr.
Roswell Smith	PERSON	, made overtures , which were by some thought quite favorable , for a consolidation of '' The Lake - side ' ' which would be virtually an absorption of it by their magazine .

		In pursuance of this plan , an article was prepared , at their expense and by their direction , for publication in `` Scribner 's '' and distribution also in proof-sheets for wide - spread republication in the newspapers of the country .

		After the article had been written , however , and before its appear - ance in print , the owner of ' ' The Lakeside ' ' rather against the advice of friends asked to withdraw from the arrange - ment ; and hence the article was never printed .

		In view of the recent death of the man who was the magazine 's moving spirit , we have thought that the article would now be of in - terest to many readers , and it is therefore presented herewith for the first time .


EDR	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL . -RSB-

		The just interest awakened by the event of the absorption of '' The Lakeside Monthly '' by ''
Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's Magazine '' calls for some particulars of the
Chicago	LOCATION	periodical 's history , and explanation of ` the unselfish and enlightened policy which , on both sides , dictated the arrangement .

		The sequel will show that the occasion is indeed fruitful ; but the present task , devolved upon an unconcerned though not insen - sible inquirer by the public cariosity , will be limited by its demands .

		It had long been in contemplation to develop `` The Lakeside '' into an illustrated magazine of highest grade as soon as the requisite outlay could be prudently risked .

		To this end , a series of papers on exclusively Western topics , to be elegantly illus - trated , had been planned .

		Meantime , the broaden - ing field of `` Scribner 's '' preoccupied the prospect , and , too , in a manner it could not be hoped to excel .

		The public will quickly recall the illustrated papers on the wonders of the
Yellowstone	LOCATION	, first revealed in `` Scribner 's '' ; those on the Yo Semite ,
Mount Shasta	LOCATION	,
Gray	ORGANIZATION	's Peak , the
California	LOCATION	Geysers , etc. , all superbly presented ; likewise those on Salt Lake , the Mormons ,
St. Louis	LOCATION	, the
St. Louis Bridge	LOCATION	, the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		This eminently popular and successful feature of `` Scribner 's '' was a conquest in the territory of '' The Lakeside , '' belated as the latter was by insufficient capital : a blameless but heavy blow to its hopes long before other causes destroyed them .

		Yet intrinsically `` The Lakeside '' had a brilliant success .

		Remote from the great cen - tres of culture , conducted without the adjunct of an artful business policy , without adequate capital , and almost without assistance , it is a fact that one young man had been able to secure for his magazine a con - ceded fellowship in the highest class of periodicals .

		From the `` Revue des Deux Mondes , '' from `` The
London	LOCATION	Graphic , '' from the
London	LOCATION	''
Saturday	DATE	Re - view , '' from the `` Canadian Illustrated News , '' and from numerous less important exponents of foreign opinion , '' The Lakeside Monthly '' at the time of its suspension had begun to enjoy that recognition which extends to no half-dozen American magazines .

		In this country , such literary connoisseurs as Mr.
James T. Fields	PERSON	in private , and such hypercritical journalists as those of the `` Springfield Republican , '' deliberately adjudged its merits and awarded it praise which no known publication would slight .

		Journals like the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post , '' the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Journal , '' and the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	`` Press , '' habitually silent upon it , would occasionally admon - ish their favorites of an aspiring Western competitor , or surprise the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	public by commending it as one of the four or five excellent American monthlies .

		Indeed , for that healthful conservatism which spurns the taint of sensationalism , and for typographical taste , it probably deserved the palm amongst all ; while in all other respects suffering by comparison less in average quality than in the celebrity of some of the writers .

		It is bare candor to add , after the fullest inquiry , what will strangely contradict uni - versal prepossession , for `` The Lakeside '' was a
Chicago	LOCATION	concern , that in self - exaggeration , or even self-assertion , it was exceptionally artless .

		The clever and justifiable expedients of all manner of publish - ers for conciliating the favor of the press at least next door ; systematic arrangements for extending circulation , by canvassing , by premium gifts , etc. , even mere advertising , were all sparingly used , and the attempt to succeed on merit alone was made in good faith in a city where such an achievement would be only less likely than such an effort .

		Yet , within limits so narrowed by principle , the business policy was surprisingly provident , practical , and successful .

		The presumption of the mercenary that they alone are `` practical '' has seldom been more signally rebuked , for seldom have lower aims effected so much upon so little .

		Late in the year
1868	DATE	was projected and with the New Year
1869	DATE	appeared `` The Western Monthly . ''

		The first number is before us ; judging from which , no conception had been formed of the elements or mission of an exponent of Letters .

		Its proprietors , men probably ignorant of the possibilities of intel - lectual enthusiasm , and without mental qualifications for the literary calling , appealed to the Western public on behalf of '' Literature , '' yet flagrantly dedi - cated their periodical , by a biography , portrait , etc. , in each issue , to such individuals as had a disbursing ambition .

		The original matter was meagre , incon - gruous , and frequently mean ; the rest was selected THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	in the manner of a country newspaper .

		Out of this insignificant publication grew ultimately the chaste and polished `` Lakeside . ''

		When '' The Western Monthly '' was a few months old , a young man who had laid down the knapsack of a
Massachusetts	LOCATION	soldier in the Civil War , a few years before , with an intense literary zeal gathered in the brooding intervals of the march and the camp , came to
Chicago	LOCATION	, and gravitated into the sanctum of the only pretender in the line of his aims .

		This was Mr.
Francis F. Browne	PERSON	, afterward editor and latterly sole proprietor of `` The Lakeside Monthly . ''

		His modest but earnest fertility and industry rapidly improved the magazine , attracting superior contrib - utors , and affording countenance to the pretensions of his business associates .

		From the beginning , however , there was a radical discrepancy of motive involved in the cooperation .

		The prevalent incredu - lity of persons imbued with the commercial spirit toward any but material agencies of success , on the one hand , and on the other the tacit but irrepressible faith in principle as a power by which all durable triumphs are gained , must have divided Mr.
Browne	PERSON	's partners from himself in a sense more vital than a mere division of labor .

		But the former could not spare the respectability and character imparted by Mr.
Browne	PERSON	's untiring and scholarly exertions , nor could he at once assume all the burdens .

		Thus , though partners and stockholders succeeded each other frequently , there remained in the person of somebody the antitype of Mr.
Browne	PERSON	.

		Progress and discouragements alternated with each other .

		In
September , 1870	DATE	, a fire in the magazine 's printing - office destroyed its subscription-list and the entire current edition just from the press .

		But the publi - cation continued , with the interruption of a single number .

		Mr.
Browne	PERSON	invented the name `` Lake - side , '' which was substituted for `` Western , '' and the magazine rapidly grew in credit and recognition .

		Then came the more disastrous fire of
1871	DATE	, in which the whole business part of
Chicago	LOCATION	was destroyed , and with it everything tangible and visible of the magazine , everything but the invisible and imperish - able idea that had made and sustained it .

		This remained ; and after a short delay , and a readjust - ment of its affairs , its publication was resumed , and continued steadily for nearly three years more .

		During its short career of scarce more than five years , the vicissitudes of this publication would he ludicrous , almost , if after its triumph the sequel had been less melancholy .

		On its ideal side , it was as moveless as the pole ; on its commercial side it was simply protean .

		From the colleges and churches would come spectacles and white cravats , to meet pork-packers , bankers , theatre-owners , etc. , in assem - blage at the instance of some friendly but enthu - siastic `` promoter '' of some strange scheme that comprehended both real estate and literature .

		But the subtlety of the plan would be too much for the expected patrons of it ; the lot speculators would fall back upon lots , the packer to his pork , the preacher to his flock , and all would go home wondering what had brought them together .

		Again , when the
East	LOCATION	began to claim
Bret Harte	PERSON	as a desirable adjunct to its literary possessions ,
Chicago	LOCATION	, in the spirit of the commander who ordered seventy-five men detailed to be baptized in order to surpass the fifty conver - sions reported of a rival regiment , resolved to have him .

		A fund of
$ 30,000	MONEY	was pledged , a liberal salary offered
Harte	PERSON	, and '' The Lakeside '' was to be aggrandized .

		But the matter got a hitch in some personal way ,
Harte	PERSON	fled to
Boston	LOCATION	, and nothing remained but a joke on
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The magazine was left , as usual , to work out its own salvation ; and it continued to do it , undismayed .

		Though often in extremis , and seemingly the forlornest of forlorn hopes , there was no thought of desisting , or of any course whatever but to go ahead .

		At times fortune seemed to smile upon it , and the triumph long striven for seemed really to have come .

		Midway in its career a large company , with ample capital , was organized with it for a nucleus , and a fine business block was erected in the heart of the city , which , with the large printing-plant owned and operated by the same company , still bears its name .

		.

		But along with this accession of capital and resources came certain spiritual influences that were soon to be inimical to the true success of the magazine , and this alliance fell apart , Mr.
Browne	PERSON	being still the conductor of the magazine , and becoming through successive degrees its sole proprietor .

		From beginning to end , perhaps as much as fifty thousand dollars was sunk in this publication , coupled with which is this extraordinary fact , that the only year in which it approximately paid its expenses was the last , which was the only one in which Mr.
Browne	PERSON	was exclusive manager .

		It was also conspicuously the year of highest literary tone and total disallowance of the low mercenary spirit .

		Hitherto , it had pieced out the foot of its blanket by character cut from the top .

		Mr.
Browne	PERSON	un - covered its head , and found the blanket without an inch to spare , but long enough , with youth and strength .

		Without doubt , the money that had been spent was mostly wasted .

		From the accession of Mr.
Browne	PERSON	, the magazine uninterruptedly deepened its own channel as a literary current ; a process which might have been hastened by capital , but was only retarded by investments that imparted their own claim to bind the policy toward early remuneration .

		In this sense , it can not be idle to reflect on the interesting paradox ,
viz.	LOCATION	, the enterprise was never doing so well as when most straitened for means ; for the influence on its development of the only man who had his vocation in it was greatest when the hope of diverting it to mere money-getting was least .

		Such are really the facts ; yet , is it credible that out of opportunities actually consisting of disaster an energy and a persistency could be found adequate to evolve , nourish , and ripen a first-class magazine ?

		But it is so , and more : for that sympathy and appreciation which are confessedly the greatest incentives to zeal and devotion appear in this case to have been almost entirely lacking .

		Any -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 491 body can understand a merely mercantile scheme and give it a cheer , even if hopelessly bold ; but how few can , with facility , enter into that refined and lofty enthusiasm which needs not to be gross in order to be practical ?

		Unhappy is that man of feeling who has not acquired a second-nature of utterance , but habitually turns from the dim mirror of a casual listener to the vivid presences in his own mind .

		Willing to be transparent to the meanest apprehension , he becomes inscrutable to the acutest attention .

		This gifted and indomitable man suffered much from this involuntary reserve .

		Contempt of a mere idea on every hand might well have awakened misgivings ; but against these Mr.
Browne	PERSON	was supported by perhaps the first mind in
Chicago	LOCATION	, the late Col.
J. W. Foster	PERSON	, who , having presided over the
American Association	ORGANIZATION	for the
Advancement of Science	ORGANIZATION	, might have given greater authority but not a more ardent sympathy to a scientific publication .

		The gratitude with which Mr.
Browne	PERSON	has been heard to mention others serves rather to show the paucity and rarity of active support from local men of letters and scholars .

		But Colonel Foster was habitual and industrious in his assistance while he lived , by valuable articles and editorial labors , but above all by vouchsafing to others the assurance that Mr.
Browne	PERSON	's ends though high were real , and though remote were practicable ; that his means thereto were well chosen , and that in legitimate business management , as in editorial judgment , he was emphatically qualified for his task .

		But we must forbear cumulative particulars .

		As Mr.
Browne	PERSON	's influence in the concern prevailed , his labors multiplied .

		The lamented death of his friend Colonel Foster needs only to be mentioned .

		In at length finding himself sole proprietor , he found an appalling labor before him .

		But it did not daunt him .

		His personal obscurity became the greater by the isolation of unremitting toil , while his city began to hear from abroad of its most creditable institution , ignorant still of the builder of it .

		Its name at least was , however , beginning to be known at home , and to be borrowed for all manner of establishments .

		* The local journals occasionally reproduced some dis - tant compliment to
Chicago	LOCATION	for having in its midst a real credential for literary cognizance .

		A citizen of distinguished sagacity , after reading its celebrated `` Chicago Number , '' declared that its circulation in
Europe	LOCATION	, by accrediting the civilization of the city , would lower the rate of interest on its loans .

		If it * Beginning with `` The Lakeside Monthly '' and its affiliated `` Lakeside Printing and Publishing Co. '' and `` Lakeside Building , '' there soon followed the `` Lakeside Directory '' of
Chicago	LOCATION	, a `` Lakeside Almanac , '' various '' Lakeside '' literary and social clubs , a suburban village named `` Lakeside , '' with a seminary called `` Lakeside Hall , '' a `` Lakeside '' course of lectures , a `` Lakeside '' weekly newspaper , a `` Lakeside '' clothing house , a `` Lakeside '' brand of writing-paper and of flour , a '' Lakeside '' lodge of Masons , and even a '' Lakeside '' laundry ; while
Chicago	LOCATION	itself began to be called the `` Lakeside City . ''

		The list could be extended almost indefinitely .

		be considered that these amount to hundreds of millions , the practical power of Mr.
Browne	PERSON	's enter - prise is in ridiculous contrast to the expenses of any magazine .

		The time had come , on the soberest principles , for `` The Lakeside '' to be endowed .

		But
Chicago	LOCATION	had not built her own railroads , nor dredged her own river ; and why should she lend her bor - rowed money for her own literature ?

		There was , however , another side to this question , which it was the natural function of the local literati to frame and present to men whose judgment of beef on the hoof had led them to the statelier office of judging more comprehensive interests .

		Booksellers and publishers , too , might have looked up from the muck-rake , for it was not long after this that some of them began to inquire if there might not really be something in a `` Lakeside '' article , pub - lished long before , showing the possibilities and prospects of
Chicago	LOCATION	as a publishing point for books .

		But prevailing dulness in a community on a given subject makes it irksome to an individual of clearer perceptions to affirm the simplest and most obvious truths of it .

		Men of intellectual callings , like other people , count the outlay of strength in getting a
Chicago	LOCATION	millionaire to believe his own eyes off their habitual objects .

		But of all men , Mr.
Browne	PERSON	was least qualified for the task , without sufficient personal acquaintance , without the tact of shrewd unreserve which forms so large a part of the '' magnetism '' we hear of , and without time from his work .

		More - over , his most cherished plans never contemplated , as far as we could learn , a division either of the burdens or the glory of the thing .

		The magazine , virtually conducted solely by himself , upon a scheme of rigid economy , was sustaining itself , with a steadily increasing prospect of early reaching the stage of emolument .

		But the toil was enormous , for , night or day , Mr.
Browne	PERSON	would not suffer the minutest slight or blemish to befall his magazine .

		In this condition the fateful financial panic of
1873	DATE	found him .

		* Very reasonably it might be thought that it would be fatal to so inelastic a way of business .

		A competent judge , however , of his business and his credit believes he would have surmounted this shock , as he had so many before , but for a sterner and sad - der cause .

		Be that as it may , it is as certain as the laws of physiology , that no pecuniary blessing could have averted the calamity of the following
Spring	DATE	.

		Mr.
Browne	PERSON	was exhausted .

		In every such abuse of strength there is a turning-point , generally im - putable to some casualty .

		In this case , it was not the financial panic that overcame him .

		The discern - ing reader will look no farther , when told that these unnatural labors were suddenly arrested to nurse and bury a child .

		The work of several is done by one man only by the aid of intuitions that really save most of the labor .

		Unmindful that these intuitions are but * In the margin of a typewritten copy of this article , Mr.

		In vain physicians advised Mr.
Browne	PERSON	to remit his business to a pro- visional management .

		His soul was in it , and could he hire a man to work his soul for him while he was resting his body ?

		The magazine lagged in time , but suffered not the least deterioration of quality .

		Alarming symptoms compelled Mr.
Browne	PERSON	to be imperatively warned .

		Rejecting with disdain certain mercenary overtures , he adopted the plan of issuing a circular deliberately suspending the publi - cation of the magazine until the restoration of his health should again enable him to go on with it .

		Such is the story of '' The Lakeside Monthly . ''

		No other literary attempt at the mart of grain and swine ever had a story : for only this one had a hero .

		Devotion , in all the fulness of the word , alone made the magazine possible .

		Hence , so inextricably personal is its history that mere salient public facts would virtually suppress it .

		On the other hand , the thrilling particulars which would be coarsened by dramatic portrayal , of struggles so burningly in - tense yet so subtle , with their passages of unwit - nessed joy , their crises of wordless anguish , these it would be stupid not to imagine , yet a trespass to name .

		But when it is seen how this shy , pure , proud man , once so indefatigable , now wasted and worn by his labors and his sacrifice , himself procured for
Chicago	LOCATION	her credit in the world of letters , a higher honor than she owes to any other citizen , it would seem monstrous to a distant spectator that he should walk her streets unhonored .

		BROWNE THE BELOVED *
Francis Fisher Browne	PERSON	, or

		During the last five or six years of his life , when I came to know him intimately , my love and admiration have been constantly growing as the noble strength and beauty of his character came more and more clearly to view .

		I have never ceased to wonder how he was able to do so vast an amount of downright hard work of lasting influence on our literature and at the same time lend a helping hand to hundreds of young aspiring writers , sympathizing with them in their struggles , and cheering them on with heartening advice while himself fighting an almost everyday battle against bad health , heavy enough utterly to disable most men .

		He was one of the literary pioneers of the old West who have made roaring commercial

		paper , THE DIAL , is regarded by far better judges than I am as the most influential of all the American periodicals devoted to literary affairs .

		This paper he founded some thirty-three years ago , and edited almost to the time of his death .

		He never regained anything like sound health after it was broken by camp fevers in the Civil War .

		But nothing could crush him or in any appreciable degree abate his wonderful industry .

		Head and heart triumphed over everything .

		He had a wonderful memory , knew almost every poet , and could quote their finest pieces as if reading from their books .

		The beauty and manly strength of his character and his capacity for life - long sacrifice and devotion are displayed in his writings , but they showed still more tellingly in his conversation when his fine face was glowing with soul radium .

		Like every great-hearted poet , he was a nature lover and a charming companion on wave - embroidered shores and sunny hills and mountains .

		And it is with peculiar delight that I recall my walks with him on the
Pasadena	LOCATION	hills in the
spring	DATE	, and in sublime Yosemite .

		When I took
John Burroughs	PERSON	into the
Valley two years ago	DATE	we had the grand good fortune to find our beloved
Browne	PERSON	there .

		He was suffering from one of his dreadful sick-headaches , and was unable to go to the hotel dinner table ; so I managed to get something he wanted from the kitchen , and we all retired early to our rooms in the
Big Tree Cottage	ORGANIZATION	and went to bed .

		Burroughs had a room to himself , while
Browne	PERSON	and I occupied a larger one separated from
John	PERSON	's only by a thin dry board partition , reso - nant as a fiddle , and which faithfully transmitted every word we spoke or sang .

		After the headache clouds had thinned and lifted a little , all bedroom rules , and even the great cliffs and waterfalls of the valley , were forgotten ; and we began a glorious revel in
Burns	ORGANIZATION	's poems , all of which we had by heart , reciting and singing for hours , and sadly interfer - ing with
John	PERSON	's regular habits , as repeated rappings and calls for sleep-silence testified .

		With lowered voices we then continued our grand revel , keeping down our merry humor fits as low as possible until far on toward the `` wee sma ' hours ayont the twal , '' making a most memorable night of it .

		Beloved
Browne	PERSON	was the only American I ever knew or heard of who had all of Burns by heart , and who understood him so thoroughly that he was able to enjoy the immortal poet almost as well as a veritable Scot .

		As we grow old we cling all the more fondly to old friends ; but Death takes them away just when our need of them is sorest .

		Within the
last two years two of	DATE	my Californian friends of the dear old leal sort have vanished , never to be seen again in this world of light .

		And now Beloved
Browne	PERSON	has gone , and all

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 493 CASUAL COMMENT .

		A LIFE CROWDED WITH NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENT in litei-ature , science , politics , reform , commercial affairs , and other branches of activity , came to an end in the death ,
May 28	DATE	, of Lord
Avebury	PERSON	, better known to most of his thousands of readers as Sir
John Lubbock	PERSON	, in the eightieth year of his age .

		Author of more than thirty books , some of them circulating to the extent of hundreds of thousands and translated into many foreign languages , Lord
Avebury	PERSON	was nevertheless imperfectly educated , in the accepted sense of the term , being removed from
Eton	ORGANIZATION	at fourteen by his father , who seems to have held in no high esteem the ordinary curriculum of Greek ,
Latin	LOCATION	, and a smattering of a few other sub - jects .

		But though he entered the paternal banking house thus early , the boy contrived to educate him - self in natural history and such other studies as appealed to his tastes , not excluding the principles of banking and finance .

		Darwin took an interest in the lad and persuaded his father to give him his first microscope when he was eight years old ; and subsequent walks and talks with the great naturalist stimulated the boy 's interest in botany and ento - mology , about which he was afterward to write so acceptably .

		But it was on the larger theme of human life , its uses and its pleasures , that his most popular and interesting books were written .

		From the long list of his published works a few only can here be selected for mertion .

		`` The Use of Life '' has passed its 171st thousand ; '' The Pleasures of Life '' has attained a circulation of 259,000 in its first vol - ume , and 213,000 in its second ; `` The Beauties of Nature '' is in its 85th thousand ; '' Prehistoric Times , '' `` The Origin of Civilization , '' `` British Wild Flowers , '' `` Ants , Bees , and Wasps , '' `` Flowers , Fruit , and Leaves , '' `` The Senses , Instinct , and Intelligence of Animals , '' with other works of like sort , are widely read and enjoyed , both in his own country and abroad .

		In his thirty years in
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment
Lubbock	LOCATION	procured the passage of many acts for the good of the people , such as the bank-holiday enactment , the bill amending the acts relating to free libraries , the Open Spaces Act , the Shop Hours Regulation Act , the Shop Seats Act , and others .

		Honors and university degrees and honorary mem - berships in learned societies came to him in profu - sion .

		In short , his range of activities and interests and his capacity for work were all but boundless .

		THE REVIVAL OF THE ART OF ORAL STORY - TELLING , as that art is encouraged and practiced by the conductor , or oftener conductress , of the children 's story-hour , is cause for felicitation .

		The earliest mode of imaginative creation has now come to be also the latest , and hundreds of library workers and children 's teachers are zealously culti - vating their faculty for graphic and realistic oral narration .

		Evidence of the present increasing vogue of the story-teller is found not only in the story-hour which every up-to-date public library prides itself on maintaining , but also in the late noteworthy manuals devoted to the oral narrator 's art .

		No fewer than five useful books on the subject have appeared in this country within the
last six years	DATE	, and four of these books date back only three years or less .

		As far as the literature of the subject may indicate , it would seem to be an American rather than a world-wide movement that we are now witnessing ; and experience seems to show that the enduring favorites among the tales told to the young people are the age-old fairy stories and hero legends which have long since earned their right to be regarded as classic .

		Animal stories of later date , such as Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	knows so well how to write , are also in demand .

		Naturally enough , the listeners show a disposition to become narrators on their part , too ; and story-hours under the lead of one of the children are growing in favor .

		In one of the
Boston	LOCATION	schools , for example , the fifth and sixth grade teachers are encouraging the pupils to tell to the class the stories they themselves have heard at the public library or elsewhere .

		`` Boys must have changed since I went to school , '' says the head - master ; but it is rather the methods than the boys that have changed .

		At any rate , he welcomes the innovation as tending to improve the English of the story-tellers , who happen to be largely of alien extraction .

		A NEW MASTER OF ENGLISH PROSE , one who seems to us to have achieved a greater degree of artistry and enchantment in this medium than any other since Pater , is to be welcomed in the author of '' Sirenica , '' a little volume just from the press .

		Of this writer , Mr.
W. Compton Leith	PERSON	, we know nothing other than that he is an Englishman whose name first appeared upon a title-page five years ago , when his '' Apologia Diffidentis '' was issued .

		The praise that we were almost the first to accord that remark - able book at the time of its appearance would be wholly inadequate to the merits of its successor , so greatly has the author grown in power and eloquence .

		`` Sirenica '' maintains as its thesis that the fabled song of the sirens was not one of sensual enticement , but rather the call of Romance , `` the high music of sedition '' that leads men away from the tried and known paths of every day to the perilous heights of spiritual adventure in quest of '' the imagined better thing . ''

		Despite mythology , the singers have never died , but their fatal music still sounds across the roar of things to-day as potently as when Odysseus strove desperately against his cords in the mad effort to follow its lure .

		Such is a suggestion of the theme that Mr.
Compton Leith	PERSON	develops with a charm of thought and expression that seems to us of a very high order .

		His rhetoric is stately and dignified , his diction is rich in melody and color , his thought glows with the reflection of that inner ecstasy or passion in which all genuine literature finds its source .

		We have come upon no book in several years -LRB- with the possible exception of
Francis	PERSON	494 THE DIAL , -LSB-
June 16 Thompson	DATE	's essay on Shelley -RRB- which seems to us more akin to genius , which carries on more worthily the splendid tradition of English prose .

		With a fitting regard to the enduring quality of its contents , the publishers have given the little book a material form of very unusual attractiveness and dignity ... `` SHIRTSLEEVE LITERATURE '' is the name applied by the ``
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Library Bulletin '' to a depart - ment of printed matter that certainly does not come under the heading `` polite literature '' or `` belles let - tres , '' but that is nevertheless full of interest , often attractive and even artistic in its material form , and has been known to engage the services of talented writers and first-rate illustrators .

		Just at present some admirable examples of this literature are being sent out by the great transportation companies to those busy with the problem of choosing the
summer	DATE	resort most conducive to their health and happiness during the approaching vacation .

		Sundry sugges - tions on the collection and use of shirtsleeve litera - ture are quoted by the '' Bulletin '' from Miss
Mary J. Booth	PERSON	, librarian of the
State Normal School	ORGANIZATION	at
Charleston	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		Certain sorts of government and municipal publications , advertising pamphlets and booklets , railroad and steamship folders and handbooks , and other industrial and geographical material , are often rich in practical information and diversified with numerous and excellent illustrations , even though the latter may be only photo-engravings .

		From a four-page list prepared by Miss Booth of publications of this kind , we take a few specimen titles : ``
Alaska	LOCATION	Glaciers and Ice-fields , '' issued by the
Alaska Steamship Co.	ORGANIZATION	; `` Argentine Republic , '' issued by the Pan -
American Union	ORGANIZATION	; `` The
New Arizona	LOCATION	, '' by the
Southern Pacific R. R.	ORGANIZATION	; `` Arkansas Homes and Harvests , '' by the Cotton Belt Route ; ``
California	LOCATION	, '' by the
Rock Island Lines	ORGANIZATION	; `` Crater Lake National Park , '' by the
Interior Department	ORGANIZATION	; `` Report on
Hawaii	LOCATION	, '' by the
Bureau of Labor	ORGANIZATION	; `` Occident is no Accident , '' by the
Russell-Miller Milling Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of such sort is the abundant shirtsleeve literature obtainable at little or no expense by indi - viduals and libraries , and often useful for educational purposes .

		Library picture collections can be advan - tageously added to from this source .

		WHAT AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY OUGHT NOT TO BE , according to the late
John Bigelow	PERSON	, is exemplified in
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	's justly famous account of his own life .

		Writing to his friend ,
George von Bun	PERSON	- sen , soon after the publication of this remarkable work , Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	, as may be read in the fifth vol - ume of his `` Retrospections , '' just published , thus expressed his opinion of it : '' Mill 's autobiography was an act of suicide .

		But for that he would have left a reputation for which some might have envied him .

		But
Providence	LOCATION	has mercifully extinguished all interest in the man who could write his own life without mentioning that he had a mother , or allud - ing to brother or sister except once to complain of what he was required to do for them .

		He was an intellectual monster without being monstrously intel - lectual . ''

		This recalls
Carlyle	PERSON	's opinion of the book , `` wholly the life of a logic-chopping engine , little more of human interest in it than if it had been done by a thing of macadamized iron . ''

		But contrast with this
Carlyle	PERSON	's words to
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	on hearing of Mill 's death as recorded in
Norton	ORGANIZATION	's
London	LOCATION	diary and published in the current `` Scrib - ner 's Magazine . ''

		`` I never knew a finer , tenderer , more sensitive or modest soul among the sons of men .

		There never was a more generous creature than he , nor a more modest .

		He and I were great friends , an ' when I was beginnin ' to work on my * French Revolution ' there was no man from whom I got such help . ''

		In the same conversation amus - ing reference is made to the charm that Mrs.
Taylor	PERSON	, whom Mill ultimately married , exerted upon him when `` that man , who , up to that time , had never so much as looked at a female creature , not even a cow , in the face , found himself opposite those great dark eyes , that were flashing unutterable things while he was discoursin ' the utterable consarnin ' all sorts o ' high topics . ''

		Finally , here is a part of what
Norton	PERSON	himself wrote about Mill in his diary : `` No man has done more than he in
England	LOCATION	to keep the standard of thought high , and its quality pure .

		Every man of thought , however he may have differed from him in opinion , has had an unqualified respect for Mill .

		My feeling for him has in it a very tender element mingled with respect . ''

		Considered as the book of a man in whom ''
Providence	LOCATION	has mercifully extinguished all interest , '' the `` Autobiography '' has had an astonishing number of reprintings in various countries and languages .

		EDITORIAL FRANKNESS is surely not wanting in the candid explanation given by Colonel
George Harvey	PERSON	for the transfer of ''
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly '' to other editorial management and other publishers .

		`` All , we suspect , '' he says in the issue of
May 31	DATE	, `` will agree that more causes than one have contri - buted to the general result .

		Some friendly critics attribute it solely to poor editing , and goodness knows we would be the last to deny so obvious a fact as that we have n't been able to edit '
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly ' well enough to make it pay .

		But when it comes to admitting , as some assert , that the ` Weekly ' would be commercially as successful to-day as it was thirty years ago under Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	and
Thomas Nast	PERSON	if now directed by those men of talent , we have our doubts .

		Times have changed .

		The country was conservative and thoughtful in those days .

		Now it is radical and impetuous .

		The ' Weekly 's ' general policy has never veered .

		It has always stood for progress along cautious lines . ''

		That its publication has continued at a loss for twenty years , is a rather surprising announcement .

		We read further : `` Too many periodicals get in one another 's way . '

		Harper 's Magazine ' and ' The North Ameri - can Review , ' both of which are prosperous , are all we need and all we can publish advantageously in
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 496 conjunction with our book business .

		I shall transfer my own editorial work from `
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly ' to ` The North American Review , ' beginning a series of articles in the
July	DATE	number , inaugurating a complete editorial department , ` comment ' included , in the autumn . ''

		Mr.
Norman Hapgood	PERSON	and the
McClure Publications	ORGANIZATION	, it is reported , have purchased the '' Weekly , '' and Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	will act as editor .

		His resumption of the editorial pen is cause for satisfaction to those who have already tasted the fruit of that pen when its holder was engaged in the conduct of `` Collier 's Weekly . ''

		THE ART OF THE ILLUMINATOR , one of the oldest as it is also one of the most beautiful of arts , is fast going the way of all individual processes that demand the exercise of patient and long-continued labor of a minute and exacting sort .

		That it is not yet extinct , however , is evidenced by a work recently exhibited in
Chicago	LOCATION	, in which the best traditions of the art found skilful exemplification .

		This work consists of a collection of tributes to the memory of
John Plankinton	PERSON	, a prominent pioneer in the Western industrial field , the entire volume being engrossed on vellum and elaborately decorated in gold and colors by Mrs.
S. S. Frackelton	PERSON	and her daughter .

		Of especial interest is the fact that instead of the usual rather meaningless or only broadly suggestive decoration usually employed by the illuminator , practically every design in this work has a directly literal or symbolic relation to the subject Several years of almost continuous labor were necessary to carry the undertaking through to completion ; but the result is a beautiful memorial which with proper care will endure for centuries .

		It seems to us that the larger public libraries might appropriately do something to revive and foster the art of the illuminator , not only by arousing public interest and appreciation , but also by direct com - missions to such artists as are available for work to become a part of the library 's permanent collections .

		Certainly there could be few more interesting or fitting memorials in any library than such a volume as we have mentioned here , but devoted to a score or two of the foremost names in local history rather than to a single person .

		LIBRARY DOINGS IN DISTANT DALLAS are
evi	ORGANIZATION	- dently keeping pace with the rapid growth of the community to which the
Dallas	LOCATION	Public Library ministers .

		From the annual report of the librarian , printed in the
Dallas	LOCATION	`` Times-Herald , '' we learn that the library 's shelf-room has been doubled by the recent addition of a two-story metal stack with a capacity of thirty-five thousand volumes , that the reference room has been enlarged , a municipal refer - ence department started , new books purchased to the extent of the available funds , circulation increased , story-hour continued to the undoubted satisfaction of listeners and story-tellers , and that , in order to keep the
Dallas	LOCATION	library abreast of the times , its head ,
Miss Rosa M. Leeper	PERSON	, has visited the sister institutions in seven cities of the middle West , including
Chicago	LOCATION	, studying especially the methods of library extension there employed .

		That
Dallas	LOCATION	library-users are of an inquiring mind , wholesomely athirst for information , appears from Miss
Leeper	PERSON	's account of the questions propounded in the reference department .

		`` These questions , '' she says , `` come through personal inquiry , by letter and by phone , and cover all imaginable subjects from the spelling of words and the naming of a baby to taxable values of corporations and chemical affinities . ''

		-LRB- Let us hope , parenthetically , that the taxable value of a chemical affinity was not among the problems to be wrestled with by the reference librarian . -RRB-

		Not least among the improvements planned by the
Dallas	LOCATION	library officials is an increase of library facilities for the colored people of the city .

		* CONCERNING AN AMERICAN RHODES SCHOLAR OF TALENT ,
William Chase Greene	PERSON	by name , a
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	graduate and now in his eighth term at
Oxford	LOCATION	, it is reported that , having won the famous Newdigate prize last year with a poem entitled ''
King Richard	PERSON	the First before
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, '' he has now captured the
Charles Oldham	PERSON	prize with an essay on `` The Sea in the Greek Poets . ''

		This latter prize , which amounts to about three hundred dollars , is awarded yearly to the writer of the best essay on a subject connected with Greek or Latin literature , the com - petition being open to all members of the university whose matriculation dates back not more than twenty - eight terms .

		Mr.
Greene	PERSON	's achievements -LRB- which include also the honor of being chosen class odist by his Harvard class , and of delivering the Latin salutatory at graduation -RRB- reflect credit on his
New England	LOCATION	ancestry .

		He is a grandson of Mr.
William L. Greene	PERSON	of
Dorchester	LOCATION	, for many years publisher of `` The Congregationalist . ''

		His father is Professor
Herbert E. Greene	PERSON	of
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	.

		To win a poetry prize that in the past has been awarded to such men as
John Raskin	PERSON	,
Dean Stanley	PERSON	, and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, is no small honor ; to be the first American to do this adds to the distinction .

		That this
Rhodes	PERSON	scholar will not succumb to an over-burden of academic honors , but will be heard from later in the larger competition that awaits him in the big world of letters , is the hope which one naturally cherishes after following thus far Mr.
Greene	PERSON	's course as a student .

		AN UNGAINLY PLEONASM , heard not infrequently in speech , and met with even oftener in writing and perhaps with rather greater frequency in En - glish books than in American , though of this one can not pronounce with certainty is exemplified in the latest of those admirable language lessons contributed by Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	to '
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		In the course of his essay on ''
Linguis	PERSON	- tic Causes of Americanisms '' in the
June	DATE	number , occurs this sentence : '' Hence the verb would have been sure to have maintained itself in the language , even had it been an Americanism . ''

		This over - 496 THE DIAL -LSB- Jiirie 16 emphasis of the preterite idea , if one may so call it , is all the more noticeable from its being immediately preceded by the remark that `` language is always economical and cuts down , wherever practicable , unnecessary circumlocutions . ''

		The use of such word - wasting forms of expression as '' he would have been glad to have seen you , '' instead of the simpler and perfectly adequate '' he would have been glad to see you , '' strikes the ear with something of the awkward - ness , something of the illogical quality , of the double negative where no affirmation is intended .

		Indeed , an analysis of the foregoing sentence reveals an unexpected closeness of analogy to the double negative , '' He would have been glad to have seen you '' must mean , strictly , '' He would have been glad to have his interview with you over , '' or , in other words , he dreaded the interview and did not desire to see you ; that is , he would have been sorry to see you which is the exact opposite of what the speaker intended to say .

		THE VAST COMPANY OF WOULD-BE AUTHOKS , Or of near-authors , as they might prefer to be called , has its size brought home to us in such professional confessions as have recently been made by Mr.
Reginald J. Smith	PERSON	, head of the firm of
Smith , Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and editor of the `` Cornhill Maga - zine . ''

		Mr.
Brett	PERSON	?

		s late `` Atlantic '' article on book - publishing has called attention to the disproportion between the yearly number of submitted manu - scripts arid published books a ratio that excited some surprise and probably stirred an occasional doubt as to the accuracy of the figures given and now Mr.
Smith	PERSON	presents an exhibit even more astonishing .

		For the magazine in his charge there are annually read between twenty - five hundred and three thousand manuscripts , of which on an average only one in two hundred , or one-half of one per cent , is accepted .

		Apparently this does not include mat - ter contracted for beforehand or furnished in the regular routine , since twelve or fifteen manuscripts would not go far in providing for a year 's issue of the magazine .

		Of manuscripts offered to the firm for book publication , the number averages about six hundred a year , and of these somewhat less than two per cent are accepted .

		Few indeed are the chosen out of the many who feel themselves called to authorship , even if one allows for the possible acceptance elsewhere of works rejected by this or that or the other publisher .

		But when all other re - sources fail , the rejected author may always bring his book into being at his own expense of course provided he is able to pay the printer .

		That such a course is in almost ninety-nine cases out of every hundred a foolish waste of money seems to have no effect on the ever-increasing output of these publica - tions which have never been published .

		THE LIBRARIANS ABROAD , like the `` Innocents , '' tend to flock together and go in special parties , though not always in especially chartered vessels , as did that cheerful company of sight-seers on the good ship ''
Quaker City	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		There comes to our notice the project of a European tour for the sum - mer of
1914	DATE	, designed for librarians and offering many attractive features .

		The
Bureau of University Travel	ORGANIZATION	, of
Boston	LOCATION	, appears to be conferring with the
Massachusetts Library Club	ORGANIZATION	concerning the details of such a tour , which of course is still far from being definitely decided upon .

		A part of the
Bureau	ORGANIZATION	's letter to the President of the
Club	ORGANIZATION	is as follows : '' The purpose of the tour is to bring such people in touch with the best things of greatest interest per - taining to their chosen profession , with appropriate allowance for recreation and the usual sight-seeing in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		... I submit herewith a combination of three tours subject to your consideration , which may be revised to best suit conditions .

		... It is , of course , understood that the name of every person participating in this tour shall first have the approval of your
Committee	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The proposed itinerary includes the
Azores	LOCATION	,
Algiers	LOCATION	,
Naples	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	,
Flor	PERSON	- ence ,
Venice	LOCATION	,
Milan	LOCATION	, the Italian lakes ,
Switzerland	LOCATION	,
Heidelberg	LOCATION	, the
Rhine	LOCATION	,
Cologne	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	,
Stratford	LOCATION	,
Warwick	PERSON	,
Kenilworth	LOCATION	, and Liver - pool with the suggested omission of
Greece	LOCATION	and the Shakespeare country , or one of them , should a shorter tour be desired .

		Such persons as may find themselves interested in the foregoing , which is taken from the ''
Massachusetts Library Club Bul	ORGANIZATION	- letin , '' are invited to communicate with the President of the
Club	ORGANIZATION	, who is now Mr.
Drew B. Hall	PERSON	, Libi'arian of the
Somerville Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		SINOLOGY MADE EASY , or comparatively easy , to the western world would seem to be among the possibilities of the not too distant future , now that an alphabet of only forty-two characters has been adopted , to supersede the unwieldy system of ideo - grams -LRB- eight thousand or more in number -RRB- hitherto used by the Chinese for the literary expression of their thought .

		Of the forty-two characters ^ twenty - three are vowels and nineteen are consonants .

		Thei Greek , the Russian , and the Latin alphabets have been drawn upon to express some of these vowel sounds , but the extraordinary variety and peculiarity of the Chinese vowels seem to have made it impos - sible to find appropriate symbols in any existing alphabet , and hence a number of native characters had to be pressed into service .

		But even so , the alphabet is not so forbidding as to deter the linguist .

		Russian literature , well within the mastery of non - Russian students , is printed in an alphabet of thirty - five letters , and the Coptic alphabet -LRB- which , however , does not worry many of us -RRB- is nearly as rich .

		At all events , a dictionary of the Chinese language somewhat less bulky than an ''
Encyclopaedia Bri	PERSON	- tannica '' ought soon to be an accomplished fact , and before long the western world may be reading Confucius in the original .

		The reform is a fitting accompaniment to the establishment of a republican government in place of the outworn monarchy .

		THE DIAL 497 THE RECONSTRUCTION OF A VENERABLE LIBRARY BUILDING , in such a manner as to preserve in fire - proof material its present characteristic features while also materially enlarging its dimensions , is now going on in the thorough rehabilitation of the old
Boston Athenaeum	ORGANIZATION	in Beacon Street .

		Long and earnest has been the debate over the question of a new building or a reconstructed and enlarged old one ; and , happily for the lovers of the historic and the picturesque , affection for the old has carried the day .

		With the addition of a sub-basement and two stories , and the substitution of durable steel and cement for perishable wood , care being taken to reproduce in facsimile the present famous reading - room , hallowed by memories of the great New En - gland authors who in old times there pursued their studies , the building will be greatly improved for the uses to which it is devoted , and at the same time will not be very noticeably altered in plan and appearance .

		Its literary treasures will be rescued from the now imminent risk of destruction by fire , and in the process of rescue their daily use and en - joyment will not be interrupted .

		This simultaneous reconstruction and occupancy of a building , lately effected in the case of a great railroad terminal in
New York	LOCATION	, and some years earlier accomplished by another railroad in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, is more of a novelty in the library world .

		The prosecution of this rather difficult work will be watched with interest .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		POETRY AND THE OTHER FINE ARTS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Of the two correspondents who criticized the policy of `` Poetry '' and the judgment of its editor in your last issue , one seems to get so much pleasure out of his at - tack on contemporary poets that it would be a pity to interfere with his acrobatic exercise .

		In the letter of the other correspondent I seem to dis - cern a different tone , and it may serve as the text for a few reflections on the status of poetry in the public mind as compared with that of certain other arts .

		Mr.
Bene	PERSON	`` t complains of '' Poetry '' because , in
the first eight months	DATE	of its existence , it has published only one poem to which he can give high praise , this one being '' of very great distinction . ''

		Of course I might mention other poems which seem to me distinguished ; but assum - ing for the moment that Mr.
Bene	PERSON	`` t is correct , may I not insist that the publication of even one poem '' of very great distinction '' in two-thirds of a year should be counted not poverty but riches , an achievement which quite justifies the existence of the magazine and pays for all the labor and capital that have gone into it .

		I turn to the catalogue of our
last autumn	DATE	exhibition at the Art Institute , and look over the list of prize - winners since
1902	DATE	, during which period , until last year , no prize was given in the
United States	LOCATION	for poetry .

		For three years the
Potter Palmer	PERSON	gold medal and
$ 1000	MONEY	prize , founded in
1910	DATE	, have been awarded to pictures which no critic has ever stated to be '' of very great distinction , '' upon which , indeed , no superlatives have been expended .

		Of the eleven pictures which , since
1902	DATE	, have won the
Harris	PERSON	silver medal and
$ 500	MONEY	, three or four might be called distinguished ; but it is doubt - ful whether any one of these deserves the '' very , '' as
Sargent	PERSON	's portrait of Chase is not the best this painter can do , and
Tarbell	PERSON	's '' Girl Crochetting '' is a perfect example of preciosity a trivial subject turned out with the most exacting nicety , a quality of which Mr.
Bene	PERSON	`` t accuses our magazine .

		And the four awards of the bronze medal and
$ 300	MONEY	continue the same story .

		Ditto in
Pittsburgh	LOCATION	, where the prizes are still larger and the competition is international .

		Has any critic of standing given a superlative to Mr.
Philpot	PERSON	's picture , which drew
$ 1500	MONEY	this year , or to that of Mr.
Sims	PERSON	, which had the same luck last year ?

		Indeed , can one find a single masterpiece in the whole list of
Pittsburgh	LOCATION	prize-winners since
1896	DATE	, whether of the gold , silver , or bronze class ?

		Yet '' Poetry , '' which aims to be an exhibition gallery for poets , is criticized if it does not , in the critic 's opinion , print a masterpiece or two each month .

		Poems , paintings , statues , `` of very great distinction , '' are not created often ; meantime the lesser achievements in these arts the vital and provocative experiments , the works which seem to embody some mood of beauty , the expressions of insight or inspiration which seem a-thrill and alive these are entitled to the consideration of the public .

		They must have this consideration , the poet the artist of any kind must have a public to speak to , else his art can not grow , he can not go on .

		The people must grant a hearing to the best poets they have , else they will never have better .

		The great periods in any art come only when great energy of creation meets equal energy of sympathy , that is inexorable law .

		`` Poetry '' endeavors , however imperfectly , to give the poet a chance to be heard , to gather together his public , and to reward him , though inadequately , for his work .

		It would like to give as many prizes as the Art Institute does ,
viz.	LOCATION	, nearly thirty a year , ranging from
ten dollars	MONEY	to a thousand .

		It would like to pay its contributors so handsomely that a good poet could earn as fair a living as a good painter , or at least as fair as many bad painters who seem to support families without difficulty .

		In these efforts the magazine is necessarily no wiser than its editors , whose judgment is far from infallible , and who assert merely their honesty of purpose and a certain training in the art .

		Others could doubtless do the work better ; but no one else attempted it .

		HAUPTMANN AND THE NOBEL PRIZE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Permit me , as a Scandinavian , to correct an erroneous impression conveyed by Mr.
W. H. Carruth	PERSON	's letter in your issue of
June 1	DATE	.

		It is by no means true that the Nobel prize is awarded for a literary work of any single year , be it
1912	DATE	or
1913	DATE	.

		It is awarded to authors whose lifework has gone in an absolute idealistic direction .

		Thus the Norwegian au - thor
Bjornson	PERSON	won the prize `` because his books revealed a spirit of singular purity . ''

		In regard to
Hauptmann	LOCATION	, I will say that it is ex - tremely probable that his name was decided upon before `` Atlantis '' was published .

		The prize is awarded once a year , that is the only way in which it is connected with the literature of the hour , heaven be praised !

June 16	DATE	A MANY-SIDED PHILANTHROPIST .

		* Mrs.
Barrows	PERSON	s choice of a title , '' A Sunny Life , '' for her biography of her husband , is a happy one .

		Through his many-sided personality the white radiance of eternity seemed to shine as through
Shelley	PERSON	's dome of many-colored glass .

		Rich and varied were his gifts of mind and heart , and with them all he was the embodiment of that joyous faith in the eternities and the immutabilities that gives to life its noblest significance and takes away from death its bitterest pang .


Samuel June Barrows	PERSON	was born of poor parents on the 26th of
May , 1845	DATE	, in
Columbia Street	ORGANIZATION	, on the lower East Side of
New York City	LOCATION	.

		His father ,
Richard Barrows	PERSON	, cousin to
Richard Hoe	PERSON	of printing-press fame , and employed in his factory , was taken from his family when
Samuel	PERSON	, one of five brothers and sisters , was but three years old .

		The widow supported her little ones and herself as best she could , chiefly by making shoe-blacking , accord - ing to a precious recipe brought from
England	LOCATION	, in small quantities for a restricted circle of customers ; and in this domestic industry the children helped her until they were old enough to find other and better employment .

		At eight years of age the school education of him with whom we are here concerned came to an end , partly by reason of an illness that made close confinement inadvisable , and soon afterward he obtained employment suitable to his strength and ability in his prosperous cousin 's printing - press works at a weekly wage of one dollar , of which one cent went to him as his very own and was usually dropped into the contribution plate at church .

		However , despite this excess of vir - tue in the boy , and notwithstanding his early engagement in evangelistic labors along the wharves and among the sailors , heaven did not claim him in his tender years , but spared him for a half - century more of increasing usefulness on earth .

		The mastery of shorthand and of telegraphy , with the acquisition of a correct and forceful literary style , helped him to a succession of good positions as private secretary and in journalism ; and his early marriage to a woman almost as gifted and capable as himself still further advanced his fortunes at the same time that it assured him a singularly happy and * A SUNNY LIFE .

		beautiful home life .

		Emancipation from the fetters of an outworn creed was followed by preparation for the Unitarian ministry at the
Harvard Divinity School	ORGANIZATION	.

		The pulpit of the
Meeting House Hill Church	ORGANIZATION	at
Dorchester	LOCATION	was then offered to him and accepted , but after four years of distinguished service there he felt reluctantly compelled to accept a call to the editorship of '' The Christian Register , '' which , with the volunteer cooperation of Mrs.
Barrows	PERSON	, he conducted for sixteen years .

		Next came a term in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, miscellaneous literary work , the secretaryship of the
Prison Association of New York	ORGANIZATION	, travels abroad and at home in the interest of prison reform , and a zealous parti - cipation in countless other good works , until at the age of sixty-four a fatal attack of pneumonia ended his labors on earth .

		What impresses one most in the life so pre - maturely closed is the rare union of brilliant literary , scholarly , and artistic gifts with moral endowments of the highest order .

		In any one of numerous departments in literature , schol - arship , music , in the ministry , in social reform , in journalism , in public life , or in some admin - istrative business office he was qualified to achieve a more than ordinary success .

		There seemed to be nothing that he could not do , except that which was base , as his co-workers were wont to declare of him .

		But it is prob - ably as a penologist of enlightened vision and great practical ability that he will be longest remembered .

		Next to that might well be cherished in memory his entire independence and fearlessness as a member of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and his splendid work there in behalf of wise legis - lation .

		Of course it was his very uprightness , so out of alignment with the crookedness of political methods , that brought about his defeat when he offered himself for reelection .

		As there is space here for but a few short extracts from this admirable biography of a brilliantly gifted man , and as it is one 's every - day habits that best indicate one 's quality , we select for quotation a passage or two that will both bring Mr.
Barrows	PERSON	into nearer view and convey at least a suggestion of his range of interests and tastes and abilities .

		Midway in her narrative Mrs.
Barrows	PERSON	says of him : `` Whatever people about him were doing he liked to learn to do .

		Thus he learned to make nets , and many a hammock for baby , or doll , or friend , still remains to show his kindness as well as his skill .

		Chess and draughts he could play well , but found them more expensive in nerve power than he could afford .

		Cards he thought a waste of time .

		There was one homely game in which his nimble fingers made him facile
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 499 princeps .

		Many a one , old and young , I have seen him challenge , and he was always the winner .

		That was the old classic game of jackstones .

		I even saw him once when playing with real ' knuckle bones ' in
Greece	LOCATION	, where they have played it since
Homer	ORGANIZATION	's days .

		Pebbles , beans , bones , iron ` jacks , ' it was all the same to him .

		It seemed as if his fingers were
India	LOCATION	rubber and could be turned backward or forward as occasion demanded .

		One day , while we were waiting for a belated street - car , some small boys were playing jackstones on the pavement .

		He laid down his book-bag and in his happy , genial way , stepping over among them , began to play with them , teaching them some of the
New York	LOCATION	varia - tions of his own street childhood : ' helping the lady over the stile , ' ' putting the horse in the stable , ' ' skunks , ' etc. .

		Our car came along , and that was the end of the lesson .

		But a few days later , at the same corner , we heard a youngster say , as he recognized my husband , then a United States Congressman : ` That 's the feller that interduced '' skunks '' inter Dorchester ! '

		Such is con - temporary fame ! ''

		Again , the following serves well to show us the man as music-lover and musician .

		Barred from a liberal education in his youth , he not only mastered many languages and other branches of learning in later life , but he took up music in mature manhood , learned to play the flute , ac - quired proficiency in singing , and then made himself at home with the pipe-organ .

		In his wife 's words : '' Not only with his voice , but with his fingers , did my husband elicit music .

		For several years he studied composition and harmony and enjoyed the science of it .

		He wrote several hymns and composed words as well as music , but it was not till he was fifty that he gave up the flute and began the piano .

		He used laughingly to say that he was tired of blowing into a hollow stick .

		One day I went with him to help him select a suit of clothes , a duty he always expected of me .

		As we walked along he said he wished we were going to select a parlor organ instead . '

		Very well , ' I said , ' wear your old clothes and have the organ . '

		So we passed
Rogers Peet	ORGANIZATION	and brought up on Fifth Avenue at an organ store , and the price of the clothes down and
ten dollars	MONEY	a month later soon made it his !

		In a surprisingly short time he was playing all the tunes in our ordinary hymn-book ... `` The next morning I stole round to
St. George	LOCATION	's chapel , where he went always from eight to nine in the
morning	TIME	.

		I followed the call of organ notes and slipped in behind him on an empty bench , and my heart ran riot with sympathetic joy as I saw his happiness .

		Slowly and painstakingly he was playing
Handel	PERSON	's Largo , quite alone as he supposed , but his whole soul was in it .

		When he had finished he reverently closed the organ and turned to go . '

		You here ? '

		he cried with pleasure .

		But I could not see him for the mist in my eyes . ''

		Here is a glimpse of the penologist , orator , and linguist , at a dinner of the
Seventh Inter	ORGANIZATION	- national
Prison Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Budapest	LOCATION	, in
1905	DATE	: '' The
last night	TIME	there was a banquet and a chance to use the carefully prepared and memorized speech .

		He had the seat of honor at the raised official table , and as I was next to him , I could look down and over the sea of faces in that big banquet hall and watch their sur - prised expression as he slipped from his French opening into simple but perfectly understandable Hungarian .

		Then they began to cheer , as only Hungarians can .

		And as he told how , when he was a little boy , his mother lifted him to her shoulder in the streets of
New York	LOCATION	that he might see Kossuth pass by , I thought the roof would come off .

		They banged the dishes , jumped to their feet , on to the chairs , and some of the more en - thusiastic at the rear of the hall on to the tables , and shouted and pounded for some minutes , before he was allowed to go on .

		It was only a ten-minute address , but it won their hearts , and the next morning it appeared in every paper throughout
Hungary	LOCATION	. ''

		In closing , we can not do better than to quote a few words from Rabbi Wise 's tribute to Mr.
Barrows	PERSON	at a largely attended memorial service conducted by the
Prison Association of New York	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Few men have lived of whom it might more truly have been said than it may be said of
Samuel June Barrows	PERSON	that the world was his country and all mankind his countrymen , ' and every man , especially every op - pressed man , a brother . '

		If this cosmic man was capable of partiality or preference , it was revealed in devotion to land or lands where liberty was not , where the high boon of freedom was yet to be won .

		In his love of justice and in the justness of his love , he had ' circum - navigated the seas of philanthropy , ' literally as well as spiritually , resting charity upon the immutable founda - tions of justice , and benevolence upon the everlasting rock of brotherhood . ''

		Mr.
Barrows	PERSON	is fortunate in his biographer a writer of acknowledged charm , of long experi - ence with the pen , and of course more intimately familiar with her husband 's public and private life than any other one person could be .

		And she is fortunate in her subject a theme worthy of both her literary skill and her woman 's in - sight and sympathy .

		Yet it is no mere eulogy of the deceased that she has given us .

		Four years have passed since his death , and they have been turned to good account in making as full and authoritative as possible this history of his life and work .

		Portraits and other illustrations , with appended matter and index , help to round out its completeness .

		ROME THE MAGNIFICENT .

		* In spite of the elaborate and learned histo - ries of various periods of Roman history , from
Niebuhr	PERSON	down to
Ferrero	PERSON	, there has remained room for a comprehensive story of the greatest military and political power the world has ever known .

		To accomplish this within the compass of a single volume of 316 pages , with no * THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS

		A
Survey of Roman Culture	ORGANIZATION	and Civilization .

		By
J. C. Stobart	PERSON	.

		M. A. Illustrated .


Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		500 THE DIAL , -LSB-
June 16	DATE	sacrifice of color or perspective , has been the task set for himself by Mr.
J. C. Stobart	PERSON	, late lecturer in history in
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	, Cam - bridge .

		The author 's equipment and method were favorably inferred from his previous work , '' The Glory That Was
Greece	LOCATION	, '' published two years ago .

		The somewhat ad captandum titles , taken from
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	's '' To
Helen	PERSON	, '' are perhaps suitable enough to the scope of the books , a survey of Hellenic and Roman culture and civilization ; and incidentally reflect the high esteem which
Poe	PERSON	has always enjoyed in
England	LOCATION	.

		But within this limit there has run another and a corrective purpose .

		Mr.
Stobart	PERSON	does not hesitate to bring the charge of being Tendenzschriftsteller against the ancients ,
Livy	PERSON	and
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	,
Diodorus	PERSON	and Polybius . ''

		Diodorus of
Sicily	LOCATION	was seeking mainly to flatter the claims of the Romans to a heroic past .

		Polybius , the trained Greek politician of the second century
B. C.	PERSON	, was writing Roman history iu order to prove to his fellow-Greeks his theory of the basis of political success .

		Livy was seeking a solace for the miseries of his own day in contemplating the virtues of an idealized past .

		Tacitus , during an interval of mitigated despotism , strove to exhibit the crimes and follies of autocracy .


Edward Gibbon	PERSON	too -LRB- I write as one who can not change trains at
Lausanne	LOCATION	without emotion -RRB- saw the Empire from the standpoint of eighteenth century liberalism and materialism .


Theodor Mommsen	PERSON	made
Rome	LOCATION	the setting for his Bismarckian Cjpsarism , and , finally ,
M. Boissier	PERSON	has enlivened her by peopling her streets with Parisians . ''

		Against these Mr.
Stobart	PERSON	strongly urges his own thesis probably the compelling reason for his writing the book .

		Briefly , it is as follows : '' The Republic was a mere preface .

		The Republic till its
last century	DATE	did nothing for the world , except to win battles whereby the road was opened for the sub - sequent advance of civilization .

		Even the stern tenacity of the Roman defence against Hannibal , admirable as it was , can only be called superior to the still more heroic defence of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	by the Jews , because the former was successful and the later failed .

		From the Republican standpoint
Rome	LOCATION	is immeasurably inferior to
Athens	LOCATION	. ''

		This is a pretty severe arraignment of the pioneer era , of the `` hard-knocks '' people who steadily prepared the way `` for the subsequent advance of civilization '' ; and will hardly change the current of admiration for the fathers who did things , as against the Caesars who gradually lost their grip .

		We naturally turn with interest to what Mr.
Stobart	PERSON	has to say of the first of the Caesars `` the foremost man of all this world , '' the im - posing figure that stands between the Republic and the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		The reaction from
Mommsen	PERSON	's idolatry reached its extreme in
Ferrero	PERSON	's picture '' of his greatest fellow-country man as an unscru - pulous demagogue who blundered into renown through treachery and bloodshed . ''

		And now once more we are to revise our opinion of the mighty
Julius	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Stobart	PERSON	, conceding
Caesar	PERSON	's greatness , appraises it with epigrammatic candor : `` Without making him a demigod , we ought to be able to see his greatness .

		... It is probable that from a very early age he was ambitious , and his family con - nections clearly marked out his career as a democrat .

		He had the failure of Sulla before his eyes .

		The great - ness of his character lay chiefly in an instinctive hatred for muddle and pretence .

		From the first , I think , he was aiming at power for himself in order to put things straight .

		Whether self or country came first in his calculations , it is hard , perhaps impossible , to determine ; but the historian is not necessarily a cynic when he de - mands strong proof of altruism in the world of politics . ''

		When it comes to the question of credit for the creation of the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	, we are quite prepared to see Mr.
Stobart	PERSON	carefully lift the laurel from the first Csesar and place it on that of his `` chilly and statuesque '' grand-nephew Octavianus , otherwise known as Augustus : ''
Julius Csesar	PERSON	had failed through pride .

		When he fell , the whole dreary round of proscriptions , triumvi - rates , and civil wars had to begin again .

		The inevitable monarchy had to be devised afresh on a different basis : that was the task of Augustus He devised it in such a manner that it lasted in the West for just five cen - turies , and in the
East	LOCATION	for nearly fifteen .

		Indeed , it can hardly be said to be totally extinct now in the twentieth .

		Judged by results then , the work of Augustus was clearly a consummate piece of statesmanship .

		When we con - sider the methods by which that result was obtained , we shall , I think , esteem
Augustus	PERSON	as the greatest states - man in the history of the world . ''

		Augustus 's long reign of practically forty-five years was one of organizing and upbuilding the imperial power on the decrepit framework of the Republic .

		Cool , cautious , but deter - mined , he gradually drew into his own hands , as
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	says , `` the functions of the senate , the magistrates and the laws . ''

		His military achieve - ments , important as some of them were , could not but stand in penumbra , if not in eclipse , when compared with those of
Caesar	LOCATION	.

		Moreover ,
Augustus	PERSON	suffers from the lack of any great biographer or historian , ancient or modern : caret sacro vate .

		We know what
Augustus	PERSON	found , and we know what he left ; but the con - tinuous tale of what he was doing and how he did it from year to year of his almost half-century of power , remains less than half told .

		To sup - ply in part this deficiency , as well as to establish his thesis of the supremacy of Augustus , Mr.
Stobart	PERSON	's two chapters on Augustus and
Augus	PERSON	- tan
Rome	LOCATION	occupy one quarter of the entire book ,
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 501 and are easily its best written portion .

		Again he does not hesitate to say : `` The ancient historians prefer to record small victories over barbarian tribes , or the petty gossip of the Roman streets , while they have little to say about the tireless administration which in one generation transformed the Roman world from a horrible chaos into that scene of peace and prosperity shown to us in the pages of
Strabo	PERSON	and
Pliny	ORGANIZATION	.

		So while our eyes are fixed upon the sins and follies of Roman emperors and courtiers , until we get an impression of rotten tyranny conducted according to the caprice of monsters and fools , all the time the greater part of
Europe	LOCATION	was advancing in peace to a state of gen - eral culture and civilization such as it had never known before , and such as it never knew again until the nine - teenth century . ''

		We must not forget the sub-title `` a sur - vey of Roman culture and civilization . ''

		Mr.
Stobart	PERSON	has little good to say of the literature and art of the Republic ; after appreciative sketches of
Cicero	LOCATION	,
Livy	PERSON	, and
Lucretius	PERSON	, and of such relics of Republican architecture as the Tabularium and the
Temple of Fortuna Virilis	ORGANIZATION	, his conclusion is as follows : '' On the whole , the verdict must go against
Rome	LOCATION	at any rate republican
Rome	LOCATION	as regards artistic originality .

		The
Rome of Cicero	ORGANIZATION	's day was amazingly rich and dreadfully poor .

		It had a high culture in some respects , but it was too corrupt , morally and politically , to produce good work of its own .

		If there had been any possible rival in the field ,
Rome	LOCATION	would assuredly have perished in the course of that distracted century -LRB- the first before Christ -RRB- .

		If she had perished then , what would she have left to the world ?

		A few second-hand comedies ,
Lucretius	PERSON	and
Cicero	LOCATION	; a small equivalent for all the blood that she had shed , and all the groans of her provincials . ''

		Without its illustrations , the book would be good , even fascinating , reading , as any short extract from it would show .

		But with them the grandeur that was
Rome	LOCATION	is adequately visu - alized ; and so , in the words of the author , '' the pictures are an integral part of my scheme . ''

		About a hundred fine plates in photogravure , collotype , and half-tone give some idea of the Roman greatness in architecture and portrait sculpture .

		Baalbek and
Palmyra	LOCATION	in the
East	LOCATION	, Timgad in
Africa	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Provence	LOCATION	, and
Spain	LOCATION	all are represented by familiar , and unfamiliar , buildings , statues , and busts .

		The list of illus - trations , too , contains a description of each picture , leaving the reader in no doubt as to the location , date , and significance of the subjects .

		Several maps , a limited bibliography , a chro - nological summary , and a good index , complete the usefulness of this sumptuous volume , which , notwithstanding its tone of parti pris , may possibly be placed at the head of the list as '' best general work '' on ancient
Rome	LOCATION	.

		THE DRAMAS OF
GERHART HAITPTMANX	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Professor
Lewisohn	PERSON	's faithful , and sympa - thetic English translations of
Gerhart Haupt	PERSON	- mann 's plays show a true appreciation of the fine poetic quality in the work of
Germany	LOCATION	's greatest present-day dramatist , as well as a rare knowledge of the subtleties of the German lan - guage and of its perplexing dialects .

		He helps us understand the large humanity which is
Hauptmann	PERSON	's basic creed , and he guides us un - erringly through occasional mazes of symbolism .


Hauptmann	PERSON	is not a standard-bearer for any ism or literary cult , nor the exponent of a sub - versive moral philosophy .

		He states the facts of life simply and profoundly , because he has a divinatory understanding of what the time-spirit demands , and of the revolutionary forces that are stirring beneath the surface of contemporary life .

		In his first sociological drama , '' Before Sun - rise , '' he voices a plea for the children whose right to be well-born and well-reared has been denied them .

		Itspremiere in
1889	DATE	was the scene of wildly contesting opinions .

		It roused the public as well as the critics to indignant protest .

		How could a mere stripling dare to reveal the mystery and the tragedy in that threatening dictum , `` the sins of the father shall be visited upon the children '' ?

		Ibsen had done this two decades before ; and a horrified public had re - belled , only to be convinced later that nothing could silence the intrepid Norwegian 's protests against the social order .

		More deeply even than than its purpose , the crass realism of the drama offended the critics .

		If they had been able to sense its dominant motif ,
Helene	PERSON	's plea for her right to a heritage of moral and physical health in her pitiful struggle against her envi - ronment , it would have meant more to them than a disclosure of conveniently concealed wrongdoing .


Hauptmann	PERSON	found inspiration in his native heath , its people , its folk-lore , and most of all in its social needs .

		His early environment shaped his attitude toward our perplexing social prob - lems .

		Stirring tales of the Silesian weavers and of the injustice of the economic conditions under which they labored were recalled at the bidding of his genius .

		The terrible climax in
1844	DATE	, when the hatred in the hearts of the miserable weavers against their oppressors incited them to lawless deeds , furnished the subject-matter for his drama , '' The Weavers . '

		THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	facts upon which
Hauptmann	PERSON	bases this magni - ficent depiction of a hopeless revolt .

		The sullen brutality of certain types is revealed with grim truth , and yet the drama conveys its own spirit - ual message in its appeal for social betterment .

		Neither `` The Beaver Coat '' nor `` The Conflagration '' are good stage plays .

		As read - ing dramas they are unique , principally so through their portrayal of the hypocritical , thieving , and cleverly unscrupulous Mrs.
Wolff	PERSON	-
Fielitz	PERSON	.

		Here
Hauptmann	PERSON	's predilection for psychological analysis has ample scope .

		Ho - garth 's satiric pencil might have done justice to the types he portrays , and the lives some of them are forced to lead as the dupes of a designing woman .

		Volume II .

		of the new collected edition con - tains three dramas of social revolt . ''

		Drayman Henschel '' is a sombre picture of the undoing of an honest , simple-minded man through the misdeeds of a woman . ''

		Rose Bernd , '' a drama of compelling force , excels in the poignant note of its moral preachment : a well-grounded protest against the accepted code of condemning women for the same moral lapses which we condone in men .

		In Rose 's case those who denied her right to be lovingly and justly dealt with are even more to blame for her crime than our inconsistent social laws .

		The girl 's despair - ing cry , '' No one has ever loved me enough ! ''

		implies a terrible accusation .

		The invalid wife of the man who caused the girl 's downfall is one of the finest characters in
Hauptmann	LOCATION	's marvellous gallery of women .

		Her heart goes out to the sorely-tried girl in an agony of sympathy ; and by conquering the revolt in her own soul , she tries to befriend her .


Hauptmann	PERSON	is temperamentally akin to
Tolstoi	LOCATION	.

		Like the great Russian in '' The Power of Darkness , '' he lights an abyss of guilt and despair with a ray of divine pity .

		He has a splendid comprehen - sion of the disturbing issues that are unsettling time-honored standards , and his understanding sympathy guides his pen when he pictures the soul agonies of men and women who lack the strength to battle against temptation .


Strindberg	LOCATION	, the arch-naturalist , tells us that `` the true , the great naturalism seeks out those points of life where the greatest conflicts occur .

		It loves to see what is not to be seen every day .

		It rejoices in the battle of elemental powers , whether they be called love or hatred , noble or revolting instincts .

		It cares not whether they be beautiful or ugly , so that they be only great . ''

		In
Hauptmann	PERSON	's naturalistic dramas this ele - ment of greatness predominates .

		Since '' Before Dawn '' made dramatic history , he has entered a new poetic realm in his best-known drama , `` The Sunken Bell , '' and in `` The Assumption of Hannele , '' with results that have established his fame as a poet .

		But , after all , he excels in the bold and subtle depiction of souls struggling for light .

		Often , as in `` The Rats , '' his lurid pictures of moral degradation obscure his ideal - istic outlook .

		This
Berlin	LOCATION	`` tragi-comedy '' deals with all sorts and conditions of burrowing , sneak - ing humanity , who are living in moral darkness .

		The piteous , impelling motive in the drama is a lonely , heart-hungry woman 's longing to call a child her own .

		She adopts the illegitimate offspring of a poor emigrant girl and passes it off as her child .

		Contrary to the bargain they made , the girl demands her child back , under threats of telling the truth about it .

		The woman then casts caution and reason to the winds , and begins to enmesh herself in a web of crime and deceit , until at last she ends her life in despair .

		The grey background of actuality , darkened by human derelicts and failures , is brightened by the poor creature 's mother-love .

		We realize the autobiographical note in
Hauptmann	LOCATION	's great symbolic fairy drama , `` The Sunken Bell . ''

		Written after the failure of the kaleidoscopic historic play , ``
Florian Geyer	PERSON	, '' it is a despairing confession of his own inability to reach the heights , a stage at which every great artist gives us of his best .

		The bell , which sounds in the valley , but not on the heights , where mortal man tries in vain to live , untram - melled by duties and conventions , can never ring harmoniously until man is strong enough to subordinate his material desires to his ideal - istic aims .

		Aside from its symbolic significance , this drama must be classed as the best of Ger - man poetic fantasies .

		The verse is beautiful , and the author opens vistas of pantheistic life that make his fairy world seem very real to us .


Hauptmann	PERSON	's vindictive J' accuse !

		is the keynote of `` Hannele , '' a thrilling revelation of cruelty , poverty , and the transfiguring faith of childhood .

		The drama ranks high as an imagi - native dream poem , and it reflects its author 's humanitarian point of view as regards the chil - dren of the poor , their misery , their longings , and their comforting faith .

		Continued success often hampers the creative artist in his efforts to give expression to the problems which a struggling world presents to him .

		Under the spell of his own creations his ideal is likely to lead him astray , on paths that promise glory for little effort .

		Production becomes too easy .

		In
Hauptmann	PERSON	's case the
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 503 two comedies , `` The Maids of the Mount '' and `` Schluck and Jan , '' as well as the bewilder - ing glassworks fable , '' And
Pippa Dances	PERSON	, '' typify this transition stage .

		The drama , `` Lonely Lives , '' is dedicated to those who have lived them , and they are legion , though most of them avert the tragical outcome by their stoic acquiescence .

		`` The tragedy of life is in not knowing the tragedy in our lives . ''

		When the young are set at vari - ance with the old because they try to readjust their lives to their enlarged vision and to the demands of a changing world , conflicts are bound to occur .


John Vockerat	PERSON	rebels against a paternalism that warps and stunts his better self , and against the submissiveness and utter self-effacement of a wife who does not under - stand his aims .

		The climax comes when the woman who is destined to be his true soulmate appears on the scene .

		It is this woman of advanced ideas who flies from the responsibility which a union with him would have imposed on her .

		`` You have broken me ! ''

		is his accusation against his parents and his wife when death seems his only refuge .

		Of such is the kingdom of tragic failures !

		Only the Superman , '' the symbol of humanity raised to its highest power , '' can feel the right pity for his fellow-man , according to
Friedrich Nietzsche	PERSON	.

		Pity for the weak he considers harmful , inasmuch as it aids in spreading a cult of misery .

		Nietzscheism is a powerful factor in shaping the trend of thought in
Germany	LOCATION	to-day , since its principles are no longer questions of casuistry , but part of the ethics of our common life .


Hauptmann	PERSON	exemplifies this conception of pity most significantly in ''
Michael Kraemer	PERSON	, '' the soul tragedy of an erratic old artist , magni - ficently strong in his allegiance to the highest ideals of his art , but pitiably weak in his human relations .

		His daughter
Michaline	PERSON	is a Super - woman in her understanding of his aims , and in her pity for the mediocre talent which can never achieve the ideal he strives for .

		In this splendid girl
Hauptmann	PERSON	lays bare the very soul-fibres of the modern woman , with her longing for freedom from all fetters and for the unhampered development of her individuality . ''

		Our Colleague
Crampton	PERSON	'' is the story of a dissolute genius , led back to a life of decency by his daughter , whose pity for his vagaries is a result of her unswerving devotion , after his wife has left him .

		Peace as the dream of the future of a warring family is the theme of '' The Reconciliation . ''

		An ill-considered marriage is the basis of all the trouble , and an unselfish girl 's pitying love re - deems one son , and will probably bring about a life of content .


Hauptmann	PERSON	's clairvoyant vision makes him probe deep in revealing these con - ditions in modern family life .

		Few of the legends which have enriched the folk-lore of the world carry their human appeal as directly as do the epic poems of the trouba - dours .


Hauptmann	PERSON	's unusual dramatic version of ''
Henry	PERSON	of Aue '' casts this entrancing tale of the soul - woes of an erring man and the regen - erative power of unselfish love into a sympathetic modern form .

		Its portrayal of the superstitions and abounding faith of mediasval life and its true reflection of the eternally human are deter - mining factors in predicting immortality for this great epic .

		Boccaccio 's Griselda legend has furnished the theme for many fanciful tales .


Hauptmann	PERSON	modernizes
Griselda	ORGANIZATION	in a way to bring her close to us .

		Her revolt against mediseval conditions of tyranny in marriage is quite like the modern woman 's rebellion against what she considers hindrances to her cherished dream of self - fulfilment .

		Men and women of the modern subversive type , in a setting full of contrasts and conflicts , challenge
Hauptmann	PERSON	's genius for naturalistic portrayal in the five-act prose drama , ''
Gabriel Schilling	PERSON	's Flight . ''

		The vampire of ultra - modern propensities is depicted as one of those trouble-breeding affinities who are becoming more and more dangerous in this day of unsettling moral precepts .

		If we look upon
Gerhart Hauptmann	PERSON	as a world poet , one whose magic art reflects the changing currents of thought in his own coun - try , a country whose literary standards are helping to formulate ideals the world over , this new English edition of his dramas ought to hold a promise for closer spiritual communion in the future , through this interpretation of some of the greatest works in modern literature .

New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		504 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	more direct than his novels and dramas , of his philosophy ; for all his books are permeated by a philosophy deeply rooted in human nature .

		These essays , therefore , as well as giving inten - sity and definiteness to our appreciation of his fiction , are an exposition of a type of mind and philosophy .

		The enchanting first part of the volume , '' Concerning Life , '' is a series of studies based on incidents of varying interest and power but always thought-provoking .

		Merest trifles are here brought into the centre of attention , examined , and found possessed of profound significance .

		Here we find
Galsworthy	PERSON	the artist as well as the thinker .

		One reads and re-reads with delight such prose poems as `` Magpie Over the Hill , '' a poignant tale of sacred and profane love ; or '' Riding in Mist , '' a lyric of strange exaltation in presence of danger ; or `` Romance Three Gleams . ''

		The thorough thoughtfulness , the delicate sensitive - ness , the complete expression of these sketches give them rare distinction .

		In the second section , '' Concerning Letters , '' although the meditative essay mood prevails and gives charm and intimacy , the purpose of the author seems to be to develop in a more systematic way his philosophy of literature .

		His magic word is Truth .

		He does not mean that the purpose of fiction is to teach , to give facts , or indeed that it should have any purpose at all .

		To use his own figure , the novelist is as a lantern - bearer in a dark street , who directs people neither in one direction nor another , who is not criticizing the condition of the street , who has no word of praise or condemnation for anything , but who is merely bringing light into the street that people may see things as they are .

		Let the novelist or dramatist but sincerely attempt to tell the truth , and the public will all the more surely take to themselves , even though with much resistance and discomfort , the moral contained therein .

		If the story is true it has a moral , , for `` every grouping of life and character has its inherent moral . ''

		Detachment is therefore essential to the artist .

		He must worship Truth in an impersonal way , not for any immediate practical purpose . ''

		It is certain that to the making of good drama , as tp the practice of every other act , there must be brought an almost passionate love of discipline , a white-heat of self-respect , a desire to make the truest , fairest , best thing in one 's power ; and that to these must be added eyes that do not flinch .

		Such qualities alone will bring to a drama the selfless character which soaks it with inevitability . ''

		Such is the demand truth-telling fiction makes upon the writer .

		In what mood is the reader to receive it , and how is it to serve him ?

		To liberate one from himself , to help him out of his own personality with its limitations and wants , into the realm of the impersonal , where Perfection reigns , is the pleasant function of art . ''

		For , what is grievous , doubting , grim , about our lives is that we are shut up within ourselves , with an itch to get outside ourselves .

		And to be stolen away from ourselves by Art is a momentary relaxation from that itching , a minute 's profound , and as it were secret enfranchisement .

		The active amusements and relaxa - tions of life can only rest certain of our faculties , by indulging others ; the whole self is never rested save through that unconsciousness of self , which comes through rapt contemplation of Nature or Art . ''

		There is a compelling charm in this philoso - phy of the impersonal , a charm which belongs to every work of art that can be called perfect .

		One feels the same sense of security in the com - pleteness and finality of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's world of Ideas .

		It is this detachment , the essence of the aesthetic attitude , that is so much cultivated by the more ambitious contemporary artists in fiction .

		Per - sonal energism here gives way `` to the philosophy that craves perfection , to the spirit that desires the golden mean , and hankers for the serene and balanced seat in the centre of the see-saw . ''

		But while there is no denying the attractive - ness of this philosophy of perfection , one hesi - tates to yield fully to it .

		It recognizes , after all , only the values of
Truth and Beauty	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is no place for the '' glory of the imperfect , '' the denial of which leads to a subtle pessimism observable in Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	and others , and erroneously attributed by them to despair as regards truth .

		There is a form of pessimism due to atrophied spiritual nature , to lack of sympathetic activity among men .

		Euripides ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, as Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	says , have been accused of pessimism because they have bravely told truth , held the mirror up to nature .

		He is almost ready to measure greatness by the intensity of the charge of pes - simism .

		But these are truly great men , not even directly in proportion to their passion for Truth , indispensable as that is for a great man , but in proportion to their creative power and depth of understanding .

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's temperament is essentially of the critical and disciplinary type .

		His severity of thought and taste is especially welcome in an age continually running rampant in religion and art .

		To discipline must be admitted a worthy service .

		And yet , one must ask , would it have been a greater achievement to inspire ?

ANDALUSIA	LOCATION	.

		*
Southern Spain	LOCATION	looks to-day like a vast garden , and so probably it has looked for a thousand years , which is about the period since the
Moors	ORGANIZATION	began to cultivate it .

		Mr.
Paul Gwynne	PERSON	writes of this delightful region in his new volume , '' Along
Spain	LOCATION	's River of Ro - mance , '' calling it the Tarshish of the
Bible	LOCATION	, and doubting the sanity of Jonah who chose this heaven-blessed land in which '' to flee from the presence of the Lord . ''

		At any rate the district is to-day still primitive , romantic , and unspoiled for the curious traveller .

		To gather his material the author has carried out the novel plan of following the length of a great river valley , finding such a route `` more natural than lines of latitude and longitude and far more sympathetic than a railway . ''

		He chooses the valley of the Guadalquivir , which stretches from the eastern heights of the penin - sula entirely across
Andalusia	LOCATION	to the western coast .

		Travelling mule-back with an able and most companionable guide , he journeys leisurely along this `` passionate '' valley a direct con - trast to his own `` chaste '' Thames and visits many little-known towns , such as Villacarrillo ,
Ubeda	LOCATION	,
Baeza	LOCATION	,
Torralba	LOCATION	,
Menjibar	PERSON	,
Anduja	LOCATION	,
Bujalance	PERSON	.

		Account of the daily happenings , the thoughts suggested by these happenings , and occasional chapters on native customs make up the book .

		Many passages , written on the spot , bring the scenes described vividly before us .

		Thus the sweltering heat and terrific dust of an Anda - lusian mid-day are depicted as follows : '' We sought every morsel of shade that was to be found by the way : if only a telephone pole threw its slim shadow along the road , Angel duly steered his mule along the shadow ... Every time his mule passed mine it would exchange a glance of deep sympathy with the animal that I rode , whilst my own beast would sigh profoundly and look fixedly ahead as who should say , ' In the far future it will not always be like this .

		Some day a biped with intelligence will ride me .

		He will beat me perhaps , and twist my tail , but he will do it in the shade not in this furnace of flies . '

		... There were three square inches of shade under an acacia opposite , and we leapt or rather descended , from our mules with what alacrity was vouchsafed to us , and tied them to the tree .

		I distinctly saw
Angel	ORGANIZATION	's beast shrug his shoulders .

		My own steed looked up and down the village once only , then closed its eyes ... There was no footpath , just nothing but a road so deep in dust that rats could have burrowed along without your seeing them . ''

GEORGE G. BROWNELL	PERSON	.

		RHYTHM IN ENGLISH PROSE .

		* In his `` History of English Prose Rhythm , '' Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	has added another imposing volume to the long series with which he bids fair to fill a `` five-foot shelf '' of his own books .

		This latest contribution shows the traits familiar to Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's readers for some forty years now , and all of them even more strongly marked than before : ultra-Toryism , delight in cudgel-play , inex - haustible robustness and gusto , prof useness both of matter and of statement , and a catholicity or should we say indiscriminateness ?

		of vocabulary that reminds one of
Burton	PERSON	's translation of the `` Arabian Nights . ''

		Only one new trait appears : the attacks that his last four or five volumes have drawn upon him have made him , as he puts it , most astonishingly `` cautious in fending off carps . ''

		And I seem to find him more frequently and genuinely than before admitting the possible fallibility of some of his conclusions .

		His style may be irritating to many it is to me but it reveals the man himself , quite unashamed , as he recognizes humorously when he speaks of `` almost innumerable forms of individ - ual eccentricity , from those of
Carlyle	LOCATION	and
Meredith	PERSON	to those of Cluvienus and myself . ''

		Nevertheless , the book is notable , both as the first extensive and comprehensive study of its subject , and as funda - mentally sound and discriminating .

		Inasmuch as the only predecessors whom Profes - sor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	mentions are Bishop Hurd and
John Mason	PERSON	, both about the middle of the eighteenth century , it is well to begin with a brief statement of the investigations of two more recent men , who approach the subject in ways sufficiently different to be of service in discussing the volume under review .

		In the `` Proceedings of the
Modern Language Association	ORGANIZATION	'' for
1904	DATE	, Professor
F. N. Scott	PERSON	published a paper on `` The Most Fundamental Differentia of Poetry and Prose , '' and in
1905	DATE	another on `` The Scansion of Prose Rhythm . ''

		In the first paper he searches into primitive causes of expression to find the difference .

		He concludes that in the beginning vocal utterance was for the sake of giving vent to emotion or for the sake of communication .

		Very often , indeed , it served both purposes , though nearly always with one intention dominant .

		In both kinds of expression he finds a rhythm , a tendency for the voice to rise and then to fall , since `` for physiological and psychological * A HISTORY OF ENGLISH PROSE RHYTHM .

		By
George Saintsbury	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		reasons all vocal utterances are rhythmical . ''

		In the expression of emotion the rhythms tend to repeat regularly , that is , metrically ; in expression for com - munication the rhythms vary in length .

		In prose literature , he maintains , the rhythm is always there unless a writer is so hampered by his notions of grammar and of conventional expression that his writing has little in common with speech .

		In the second paper Professor
Scott	PERSON	plots the curves of these prose rhythms , and finds two main classes .

		In the first the climax is at the apex of the curve , in the second it is somewhere on the down-stroke of the curve , usually near the apex .

		Both of these classes vary infinitely in their length , in the length of the two phases of the curve , and in the presence of minor apexes in the course of both phases ; also , the two kinds are not infrequently combined .

		Pro- fessor
Scott	PERSON	does not attempt to judge the excellence of any particular rhy thmed prose ; he merely insists that rhythm is almost inevitably present .

		If I report him correctly , however , he intimates that the rhythm grows more marked as the prose grows more oratorical .

		In
1910	DATE	, Mr.
P. Fijn	PERSON	van Draat of
Utrecht	LOCATION	pub - lished in Anglistische Forschungen a treatise of 145 pages on `` Rhythm in English Prose , '' which he has since supplemented by papers in
Anglia	LOCATION	- for
April	DATE	and
November , 1912	DATE	.

		In his introductory paragraphs he tells us how he happened upon his quest and what his goal is .

		`` I had been reading
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	's ` You Never Can Tell , ' and laid down the book , inwardly thanking the author for the pleasant evening he had given me ... Presently I began to ponder why in this lilting title , ' Yon never can tell , ' the adverb ' never ' in spite of all rules of grammar preceded the auxiliary . '

		You can never tell ' it ought to have been .

		But no sooner had I changed the word-order than I found that the great charm of the title was gone .

		Where was the curious lilt that had given the words that haunting ring ?

		No , there could be no doubt about it : in the face of all grammar the title should be : ' You never can tell . '

		And none other .

		`` So the ordinary word - order had been departed from for the sake of this pleasing lilt , this rhythmical movement .

		Was this a solitary instance , or as was more natural to suppose had the striving after rhythmical movement conscious or unconscious made itself felt in any other way ?

		Would it give us a cue to a few at least of the unsolved problems of grammar ?

		The more I turned the subject over in my mind the more I became convinced that I had struck gold ; that not one or two , but a dozen , phenomena , unaccounted for until now , ceased to puzzle me the moment I approached them from this point of view .

		It suddenly became clear now why in Old English we seldom read about ` Aelfred cyng ' but about ' Aelfred cyniny . '

		I could now account for the use of the preposition ' to ' after the verb ' to dare ' in : 4 He has not dared to do it ' ; while its absence became equally clear in : ' How dare you do it ? '

		and in ' He dare not do it . ' ''

		Mr.
van Draat	PERSON	's assumptions about the relations of prose and poetry are fairly indicated by the sen - tence -LRB- from Minor 's `` Neuhochdeutsche Metrik '' -RRB- which serves as a motto for his first chapter : `` The history of poetry teaches that it is precisely in highly developed literature that we find uncertainty about the boundaries between poetry and prose ; there arise an unrhythmed poetry and a rhythmic prose . ''

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 507 I question whether the statement thus unequivocally made is either very useful or precisely true ; I think we shall find Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's statement of the case distinctly better .

		Of the importance of poetry for this investigation , Mr.
van Draat	PERSON	says -LRB- p. 8 -RRB- : `` Now , while an unrhythmical prose-writer is by no means an exception , an unrhythmical poet is a contradiction in terms , the essence of poetry as far as the outward form is concerned being rhythm .

		-LSB- ` Metre ' is the better word here . -RSB-

		Whereas in prose , therefore , the rhythmical prin - ciple in the use of to after to make is observed only occasion - ally , in poetry it is carried through systematically , and it is for this reason that we make poetry our guide ; here we shall find a systematic application of every rhythmical device to which the prose-language occasionally has recourse . ''

		Farther on he says -LRB- p. 14 -RRB- : '' When we speak of rhythmical prose we do not mean , of course , unbroken , uninterrupted rhythmical movement ; but prose that evinces a tendency to form rhythm-groups ; to hold closer together , by means of rhythm , words that logi - cally belong together . ''

		In keeping with this dictum , he naturally concludes that since poetry is dominated by four measures , therefore , in rhythmic prose '' We shall avoid a succession of three or more unstressed syllables , and that no rhythmic prose is possible when many unstressed words come together ; if they do , some stress is involuntarily laid upon one of them , unless the sense pro- hibits it . ''

		Fortunately , since all of his investigations turn upon the insertion or omission of one syllable , or upon the shifting of accent in certain dissyllables , or upon shifting word-order -LRB- such as the split infinitive , which he defends at length and successfully -RRB- , his questionable statements of larger matters do not affect the validity of his conclusions about the effect of rhythm on English grammar .

		He praises very highly the Authorized Version , but leaves Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	to exhaust his vocabulary and his ridicule upon the unhappy Revisers .

		With neither of these investigations has Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	much in common : he is not primarily interested either in Volkpsychologie or in philology .

		His whole concern is with the artistic history of '' the other harmony . ''

		Let me first take up his theory .

		Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	takes as his motto
Quintilian	PERSON	's dictum that '' we can not speak except in short or long syllables , of which feet are made '' a principle that , in English at least , slurs or ignores the immense number of syllables which are , strictly , neither short nor long ; and indeed Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	recognizes this qualification constantly in his scansions , and occasionally in his comments .

		But no one , I think , will quarrel with him for accepting as a fundamental axiom the very earliest attempt to discriminate between prose and poetry
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's description of prose as '' neither possessing metre nor destitute of rhythm . ''

		Much of his book is given to illustrating and enlarging upon this distinction .

		Of verse , for instance , he says -LRB- p. 342 -RRB- : '' In it the rhythm is always arranged correspondingly , though sometimes in a very intricate correspondence , with the answering parts at considerable distances one from an - other , and though large substitution of equivalent rhythmical units is in some cases permitted .

		In other words , the principle of sameness is that which is at the bottom of it , though this sameness may be , and in all the very best poetry always is , allied with as much variety as is consistent with its preser - vation .

		And one main , if not all but autocratic and automatic , means of securing this is the division into ' lines ' or ' verses , ' which , in iheir recurrence , bring out this identity in diversity . ''

		The scansion of rhythmical prose , however , he tells us -LRB- p. 344 -RRB- , '' Is arranged on a principle totally different , and indeed opposed , when compared with that of poetry .

		Instead of sameness , equivalence , and recurrence , the central idea turns , on difference , inequality , and variety .

		And though a certain amount of correspondence is introduced by the necessary presence of the identical quantity-combinations called feet , these are to be so arranged that they will not constitute metre '' In his final classification , Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	has four forms or groups of forms : `` I. Poetry or metre . ''

		II .

		Unmetrical or only partially metrical poetry , which , however , retains the arrangement of ' verse , ' or division into sections not identical but corresponding with one another , definitely separated by a considerable pause , which is not determined strictly by the sense .

		-LSB- Here belong
Ossian	PERSON	,
Blake	PERSON	, and Whitman . -RSB- ''

		III .

		Fully but strictly rhythmical prose . ''

		IV .

		Prose in which rhythm , though present , is subordi - nated to other considerations . ''

		The third of these divisions is the main subject of this book , with only such attention to the fourth as is necessary for discussing the prevalence , char - acter , and quality of the third at various periods .

		Almost inevitably ,
Professor Saintsbury	ORGANIZATION	puts Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	at the absolute apex of accomplish - ment in what he calls '' symphonic or polyphonic '' rhythm .

		Of this '' ornate style '' he remarks -LRB- p. 203 -RRB- : `` It is obvious that extremely , delicately , and compli - catedly rhythmed prose of this kind is by no means exten - sively or universally fit for what has been called ' the instrument of the average purpose . '

		... That style is in - trinsically unsuitable for direct and methodical exposition ; doubtfully and only occasionally suitable for plain narration ; critically impossible as a vehicle of conversation , scientific instruction , practical argument , and the whole range or ranges of what is succinctly called ' business . '

		The very users of it confess this in various ways .

		We want , as
Beatrice	PERSON	says , ' another for working days . ' ''

		Of this plainer prose he says -LRB- p. 424 -RRB- : `` We have seen that in the seventeenth - eighteenth century sober style , though you can apply the system of quantitative scansion as you can to almost everything spoken or written by an educated Englishman the process has , in differing degrees , but more or less uniformly in kind , a certain air of superfluity and unnaturalness .

		It neither evolves nor ex - plains any music : it merely shows that there is little or none to be explained or evolved . ''

		It follows naturally that Professor
Saintsbury	PERSON	does not assign the highest rank to any prose that is markedly rhetorical or oratorical , although he does grant considerable importance to the part rhetoric has played in awakening men to the possi - bilities of decorative prose .

		He points out , for example -LRB- p. 108 -RRB- , that '' Logical arrangement of thought , though it has sometimes failed to be rhythmical , lends itself with remarkable ease to rhythmical arrangement .

		The barest syllogism has a cer - 508 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	tain rhythm ; and when that syllogism is clothed and ex - tended rhetorically , it is the fault of the writer if he does not develop the rhythm likewise . ''

		And in discussing `` Euphues '' he remarks that '' The everlasting see-saw of antithetic balance almost inev - itably spoils the rhythm which it is intended to provide .

		.

		.

		There is rhythm ; but its perpetual correspondences , more or less clumsily fulfilled , defeat the purpose , fail to pay the debt of the elusive , undulating , and continually various harmony of prose '' -LRB- p. 131 ^ .

		But he concludes that '' After all , whatever be the foibles of
Euphuism	LOCATION	, it stands for the first deliberate and elaborate attempt at making prose ornamental , and bringing it into definite decorative order '' -LRB- p. 133 -RRB- .

		Judged by his standards of rhythm , oratory rarely deserves high praise , for , as he says at the beginning of his discussion of
Burke	PERSON	-LRB- p. 273 -RRB- oratorical rhythm per se -LRB- as has been observed almost to satiety , no doubt -RRB- is somewhat limited .

		But a few pages later he quotes the famous passage beginning `` It is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the Queen of
France	LOCATION	, then the Dauphiness , at
Versailles	LOCATION	, '' and after admitting its sentimentality , he declares that anyone who `` Can regard it impartially ... will be puzzled to find in English for more than a century before it , a more beautiful passage merely as harmonious phrase .

		The rhythm is still generally of the kind we have been discussing stepped and paralleled and .

		balanced .

		Except in these ways , the author 's chief device of variation and harmonic contrast is connected -LRB- as we have seen had become usual since
Addison	PERSON	-RRB- with the ends of the clauses and sentences ' years ' and ' at
Versailles	LOCATION	. '

		; ' orb , ' ' touch , ' but then f vision ' ; the descents of the next two sentences to the contrasted syllables of ' joy ' and ` fall ' ; and so throughout .

		But , in its own way , .

		in the juxtaposition of long sentences and short ; of rising and falling clauses ; even , a new thing to be thought of , or rather an old one revived , in the vowel-sound of the paralleled word-groups ' that sensibility of principle , ' ' that chastity of honour , ' the thing is a masterpiece a little in bravura perhaps to those who , while doing its form justice , do not sympathise with its matter , but certainly something much above bravura to those who do '' -LRB- p. 211 . -RRB-

		.

		.

		Many passages of De Quincey he praises highly -LRB- once he even says that ''
Browne	PERSON	might have written some '' -RRB- , but of the famous `` Bishop of Beauvais ! ''

		peroration of his ''
Joan	PERSON	of Arc '' he complains that '' It is noisy , and blares , which rhythmical prose should never do , though verse sometimes may .

		The moment that one note in prose so overpowers the next that you can not attend to it , the error of oratorical style , and the Augustan system , returns '' -LRB- p. 309 -RRB- .

		And he remarks of De Quincey ,
Wilson	PERSON	, and Landor that '' In fact , all these pioneers of polyphonic prose are apt , and naturally enough apt , to slip into the harangue , and in so doing to revert to the old alternation of antithesis and bal - ance , instead of the continuous meander of true rhythmical prose that is not oratory '' -LRB- p. 324 -RRB- .

		Finally , in his Conclusion , he points out in some detail the defects of the qualities of oratory which deny to it the highest flights of true rhythmical prose -LRB- p. 463 -RRB- : '' In actual spoken oratory , or in very rhetorical written passages , epanaphora may be effective ; but it is too rough and boisterous an instrument for higher prose , nor can the looser rhythm tame and train it as does the stricter metre .

		And , once more , it and all forms of repetition , down to the careless recurrence of a single word except in a markedly different sense , without any special rhythmical stress on it , are dangerous , because they are in a manner rebel to the same great Law of Variety .

		Epanaphora and similar forms of repetition are good -LRB- when not abused -RRB- in verse , because they are in accordance with its
Law of Recurrence	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are bad in prose for an exactly corresponding reason . ''

		So much for
Professor Saintsbury	ORGANIZATION	's theory , which , however obvious in some respects and debatable in others , has nevertheless this merit : it sets forth in discriminating terms and from a consistent point of view the varieties of rhythmed prose in English .

		And the discrimination is the important thing .

		We need not , for example , agree with his ranking of oratory , but he has made clear that the rhythms of the orators are not like the rhythms of
Browne	PERSON	and
Taylor	PERSON	and
Newman	PERSON	and Pater and
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		His scansion the practical application of his theory to details of rhythm is thoroughly charac - teristic .

		At the outset he gives us a Table of Feet in which he marshals , with all the pomp and circum - stance of their classical names , the various feet which he finds in rhythmical prose .

		In this table , besides the four dissyllabic feet and the three trisyllabic ones common in our English verse , he musters five of three syllables , ten of four syllables -LRB- all , by the way , reducible to combinations of dissyllabic feet -RRB- , and ends with the `` dochmiac , '' which convenient epithet applies to any foot of five syllables in whatever combination of short and long .

		In a note he adds that `` Monosyllabic feet , with the syllable necessarily long , are very frequent . ''

		The most interesting of these feet is the dochmiac , of which he says : '' In English prose those contain - ing two long and three short are perhaps the com - monest , arranged in their different combinations .

		One long and four short , similarly varied , is not uncommon ; and three longs with two shorts inter - vening may be found ; but more than three longs , I think , never . ''

		Now , since Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	rather scorns statistics , I could not resist the tempta - tion to check up his deductions by an appeal to his own practice .

		Out of the first hundred dochmiacs which he marks in his scansions , two-thirds have only one long syllable , and only two have three longs -LRB- in both cases the first three syllables -RRB- .

		Of the five possible varieties with only one long , he did not mark any in which the long syllable is the first of the five ; and of the ten possible varieties with two longs , he marked no cases in which the two longs were the last two in the foot .

		In his hundred cases he has only fourteen of the possible twenty - five varieties , and a half dozen of the fourteen comprise eighty-two of the instances .

		As I read the passages which Professor Saints - bury has scanned for us , it seemed to me that on the whole he chopped the rhythms up too much , and used too many feet of one , two , or three syllables : these short feet often made my reading drag , whereas more feet of four or five syllables would have corresponded better with the rapidity of the passage .

		Upon trying , therefore , to see in how many
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 509 instances I could have combined these short feet into dochmiacs , I found that in the passages in which he marked a hundred , I could have marked a hundred others .

		Evidently Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	is not unduly given to finding these longer feet .

		Scrutiny of the two lists , however , brought out some curious facts .

		The type which he uses most -LRB- two shorts , long , two shorts , marked 33 times -RRB- he never avoids ; and the two types he avoids most -LRB- the two combinations of anapest and iamb -RRB- he uses only two and three times each .

		The only type as to which use and avoidance seemed at all equal was the short-long - short-long-short , which he marked nine times and avoided fifteen times .

		One might suppose that in the case of the long feet the number of polysyllables would be important , for Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	rarely ends a prose foot within a word , as we so commonly do in verse .

		As a matter of fact , syntactical groupings are the most important , for only fifteen of his dochmiacs consisted of single words fourteen of them nouns , and ten of these in
Browne	LOCATION	.

		-LRB-
Diuturnity	ORGANIZATION	, annihilation , pro- prietaries , and perpetuation illustrate the four types he marks . -RRB-

		Half of his dochmiacs consisted of three words , and about two-fifths of only two words ; but he makes only seven of four words , where my own list has thirty-four instances .

		When we turn again to less drily technical matters and inquire what Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	has to tell us about the history of English prose rhythm , we find in brief this : In Old English we find men who wrote prose that shows conscious , deliberate , and successful , though limited , artistry ; but the later loss of inflec - tion and the introduction of Romance elements would have left even notable work to be done all over again .

		The rather sudden and wonderful blossoming of polyphonic harmony in the prose of the seven - teenth century -LRB- as in the nineteenth , coming later than the great poetry -RRB- he recognizes and praises , but does not explain .

		It is easier to show how it brought just because it was obviously not `` the instrument of the average purpose '' what he calls the '' concurrence of the plain '' style , which the Augustans were to elaborate * somewhat into the '' standard '' style so long thought especially appro - priate to history .

		continent , and a cogent plea for in - telligent interest and effective action for its preser - vation , is contained in Mr.
W. T. Hornaday	PERSON	's vol - ume , '' Our Vanishing Wild Life : Its Extermination and Preservation '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Forests , water power , and even fertility of the soil may perchance be re - stored when depleted , but no miracle of conservation can bring back to us a vanished species of bird or mammal .

		The present generation , assisted by rapid transportation , improved fire-arms , smokeless pow - der , the '' Maxim silencer , '' the '' pump gun , '' and like abominations , is depleting at an ever accelerating rate every species of game bird and mammal under the legal permission of laws framed all too often solely in the interest of sportsmen .

		Illegal shoot - ing of non-game birds and mammals , and their gradual depletion by the destruction or modification of their native feeding and breeding grounds , com - bine to reduce still further our wild life , and in many cases to bring it near or quite to the vanishing point .

		Mr.
Hornaday	PERSON	's book bids us pause and consider whether or not we have the right to rob future gen - erations of their privileges of enjoyment of this phase of nature simply to gratify our desire to kill or to flaunt the borrowed plumes of some breeding bird for an ornament The call by women for aigrettes has all but exterminated the heron , and these plumes now bring over fifty dollars an ounce in the world 's markets .

		The birds of paradise are doomed , and tens of thousands of tiny humming birds are mar - keted every year at the wholesale price of about
two cents	MONEY	per skin .

		The women of civilized countries can stop this wholesale extermination if they will .

		The plume hunters are skilful villains , and know their business .

		They move from land to land , as legal restrictions and extermination of their quarry compel them .

		Nothing short of the cessation of the demand for the plumage of wild birds for millinery purposes will save any bird , protected or unprotected , which the trade demands , from 510 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Dr.
Hornaday	PERSON	's treatment is constructive as well as critical and denuncia - tory .

		The effective organization of the protective work of the
Audubon Society of America	ORGANIZATION	, the bird reserves , the
State	ORGANIZATION	and national protective measures are all described .

		It is the duty of men of science to take intelligent steps to secure effective legislation , of the schools to teach conservation of wild life , of the hunter to maintain a higher standard of sports - man 's ethics , and of the
State	ORGANIZATION	and nation to act promptly , intelligently , and effectively in order that all may cooperate to conserve for the future the vanishing remnant of our wild life .

		In recent years there has appeared a series of histories and biographies by writers of Roman Catholic per - suasion , the purpose of which seems to be to explain or justify the part played by Catholic leaders in
England	LOCATION	in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries .

		Chief among these writers is the
Abbot Gasquet	PERSON	-LRB- a historian of judgment and ability -RRB- ,
Miss J. M. Stone	PERSON	, and Mr.
Martin Haile	PERSON	.

		To this group we may , perhaps , add Miss
Henrietta Haynes	PERSON	, whose recent biography of Queen
Henrietta Maria	PERSON	is written from the same viewpoint , though the author 's own relig - ious attitude can scarcely be inferred from her cau - tiously written narrative .

		Miss
Haynes	PERSON	has not been fortunate in her subject :
Henrietta Maria	PERSON	was not a great woman , and her career , as the biographer confesses , was a failure .

		But she occupied an im - portant position in a great crisis , and we are glad to know her more intimately than we have in the past .

		It is clear from
Miss Haynes	LOCATION	's account that for the
King	ORGANIZATION	's difficulties in the earlier years of his reign the Queen was not much to blame : she came to
England	LOCATION	at the age of sixteen when the trouble was about to begin , and can have had but little influence on events .

		Still , she did cause trouble in the royal househoid , for she was an ardent Catholic , and was surrounded by servants of her own faith .

		It is the author 's opinion that these servants were stupid and tactless , and that the King was justified in sending them back to
France	LOCATION	.

		As the years passed , the Queen 's influence with the unlucky
Charles	PERSON	in - creased , with the inevitable result that Puritan hos - tility toward the Stuarts was intensified .

		The chief value of Miss
Haynes	PERSON	's work lies in her study of the Queen 's relations with the Romanists , both in
England	LOCATION	and abroad , before and during the civil war .

		In her efforts to advance the cause of her faith in
England	LOCATION	, she displayed much zeal , but little wisdom .

		`` It is hardly too much to say that she pulled down her husband 's throne to help her co - religionists . ''

		And in the end she gained nothing from it .

		Interesting facts that bear on the perpetual conflict between the Catholic factions in
England	LOCATION	are also brought out , and some attention is devotee to the attitude of papacy toward the troubles of Brit - ain .

		There are also valuable chapters on the Queen ' f activities during the war and the period of exile
Miss Haynes	PERSON	has drawn her information largely from Uatholic sources , and has apparently discovered mate - rials that have escaped the search of earlier historians of the Stuart period .

		In her narrative she seems to -RRB- e unusually free from prejudice , and makes no effort to magnify the virtues and abilities of a Queen who possessed these in a moderate degree only .

		Twelve xcellent illustrations , chiefly portraits , help to give reality to the personal side of the story .

		The hitherto Among all the reforms clamoring for neglected science consideration in these piping times of gastronomy .

		o f progression , Mr.
Henry T. Finck	PERSON	, it would seem , has in many ways the most rational one of all , and the one least calculated to disturb any vested interest that has a right to live .

		Its creed and platform , constitution and by-laws are set forth in '' Food and Flavor : A Gastronomic Guide to Health and Good Living '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a work as appetizing as any chapter of
Dickens	LOCATION	.

		It has two distinct aims , of which the first is the rescue of the sense of smell from a remarkable amount of ignorance and false teaching .

		What we know as the sense of taste , it seems , goes only so far as to permit us to discern six several things , i. e. , whether a given subject on the tongue is sweet , sour , bitter , salty , alkaline , or metallic as those with a severe cold in the head may have had occasion to observe .

		All the other delights of food and drink depend di - rectly upon the sense of smell .

		This is Mr.
Finck	PERSON	's own contribution to science , and it assuredly gives him title to discourse as freely as he pleases upon flavors , since he is the first to learn how they are best discerned .

		But he adds to this a really erudite knowledge of good food , at least as far as the
United States	LOCATION	and the countries of
Europe	LOCATION	have good food .

		He has taken a number of journeys , every one of them as filled with gustatory pleasure as
Sterne	PERSON	's was with sentiment , and has brought back something worth remembering on every one of them .

		It has been pointed out that man can live on
ten cents	MONEY	a day , and so everything above that sum is paid out for Flavor -LRB- the word is capitalized throughout the book -RRB- ; and Flavor cures dyspepsia , decreases divorce , promotes friendliness , decreases the possibilities of war , improves the disposition , and really advances any number of reforms that might be mentioned .

		Moreover , it makes for conservatism , as
Washington	LOCATION	Irving observed , `` Who ever heard of a fat man heading a mob ? ''

		The book is well illustrated by Mr.
Charles S. Chapman	PERSON	.

		Mr.
J. Smeaton Chase	PERSON	, in his new book entitled `` Cali - fornia Coast Trails : A Horseback Ride from
Mexico	LOCATION	to
Oregon	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , found a surprising amount of this older phase of
California	LOCATION	life , and portrays it with exquisite sympathy .

		He exhibits a fine appreciation for nature in all her moods of sun and fog , and in all her aspects of desert , chaparral , and redwood forest , which so uniquely characterizes the varied coast of
California	LOCATION	.

		Mountain and sea meet along our
Pacific	LOCATION	shores mostly in precipitous cliffs , at whose inhospitable feet the ocean swells of the wide Pacific roar incessantly and break in foam .

		No camino real skirts this shore , and the traveller must find his way from ranch to ranch by dim and winding cattle-trails , and chance the quicksands at the fords of the almost dry beds of the streams .

		Less romantic in historical perspective , but no less beautiful and interesting , is the trip through the redwood forest belt of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, north of the
Golden Gate	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
California	LOCATION	here revealed by the author is the real one of the untarnished frontier , where the wide expanses of land and sea fill and satisfy the spirit , for the time at least , and the whirl of the street and the noise and the grime of the mart seem far away .

		In Mr.
Chase	PERSON	's pages the call is sounded for every
California	LOCATION	rover to take to the trail .

		Nelson 's life
Miss E. Hallam Morehouse	PERSON	's account and associations of `` Nelson 's Lady Hamilton '' will be remembered as an admirably can - did treatment of a difficult subject , and should secure attention for her newer work , '' Nelson in
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		This latter takes up a fascinating corner of a topic that has received less attention than it deserves , ransacks it thoroughly , and places the re - sults before the reader in a way that does not detract in the least from that fine humanity which has made the great admiral almost the most human of the major characters of history and the most lovable of conquerors .

		Not only this , but it brings out the positive genius of the man , from his uninteresting boyhood and youth , so ridiculously normal in the light of the fate before him , through to the wonder - ful end which left
England	LOCATION	as proudly tearful as when the immortal
Sidney	PERSON	gave up his life for his fellows and his country .

		The means whereby this praiseworthy result is attained are the simplest .

		Practically all that
Nelson	PERSON	did when away from his native soil is eliminated from the narrative , only so much as tends to throw light upon his conduct in
England	LOCATION	itself being retained for purposes of con - nection .

		His life as a boy in a country parsonage , his years in a school of little note , his boyish choice of the sea as a vocation , a choice reached boyishly and with no more apparent sense of his complete fitness for mastery than comes to other boys , his youthful hopes and almost more frequent youthful disappointments ; and then a fame , attained quite as much in spite of things as because of them , that has lifted him into the immortal throng whom we know as ''
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	's men . ''

		In this book the stress is on Lady Nelson , rather than on the woman whose beauty was fit companion for
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	's valor , and there is no shirking of the problem presented and no solution of it , either , except on the plea of the genius that can command anything in this world , once it is established in the minds of men .

		There are numerous illustrations , all of unusual interest , and a general impression of a well-rounded whole , sympathetic and readable , such as a thoroughly good biography should have .

Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , wherefrom one may discern that we have a rational civilization in these
United States	LOCATION	, at least in spots , perhaps , even , that it is not as spotted as our European kinsfolk think .

		While other writers of fiction are interested in construction and dialogue , plot and `` punch , '' thrill and sensation , problem and solution , Mr.
Martin	PERSON	satisfies himself and his readers with an entirely normal pair of happy human beings .

		The beginning husband is a young lawyer in a good firm with excellent connections , the scion of a good stock , and with
sixty dollars	MONEY	a week by way of income ; the wife with whom he begins -LRB- and ends -RRB- the book is also the scion of a good old stock , the child of parents wealthier than his own , if anything , but entirely suited to him in social station , education , tastes , and habits .

		And they marry , and have a baby , and live within their income , and have pleasant friends , and all the de - lights of life , just as most of us would have them if we could select our surroundings with as much discernment as Mr.
Martin	PERSON	has drawn his charac - ters .

		The book abounds in what is called `` dry '' humor , the narrator having energy enough left after his day 's work to see the fun in life ; and the reader may be warranted a smile with him on every page .

Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean empire , impresses Captain
B. Granville Baker	PERSON	as having points of resemblance to the great ''
Volk	PERSON	- erwanderung '' that fifteen centuries ago wrought so great a change in the map of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		In his timely and instructive volume , `` The Passing of the Turkish Empire in
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , he forecasts the future by help of the past , arriving at the conclusion that '' it may be taken for granted that the Ottoman Empire as a
European Power	ORGANIZATION	is a thing of the past , that all those provinces carved out of
Europe	LOCATION	by the sword of Othman have been lost by the sword , and that of
Turkey	LOCATION	in

		Constantinople will remain 512 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	Turkish for some time yet ten years , perhaps fifteen but methinks the Turk is tired of his stay in
Europe	LOCATION	, that he will soon pack up his small posses - sions and return to
Asia	LOCATION	Minor , whence he came . ''

		In the expansion of crowded Slavic and Teutonic peoples toward the territory so long held by the Ottoman invaders , Captain
Baker	PERSON	somehow contrives to persuade himself that there is menace to the se - curity of the British Empire .

		``
Germany	LOCATION	is daily perfecting an already formidable navy , '' he warns his fellow-countrymen , '' for flank defence first , then for further enterprise ;
Austria	LOCATION	has recently greatly added to the budget for naval and military purposes , and the road to
Saloniki	ORGANIZATION	is no longer closed by
Turkey	LOCATION	;
Italy	LOCATION	, with her considerable naval power , is allied to
Germany	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	.

		What is
Great Britain	LOCATION	, the vast Empire encircling the moving forces from west to east , doing towards her own safety ? ''

		Germanophobia , evidently , was not the least of the motives impelling the author to write his book ; and of course the lesson , or one of the lessons , it is intended to teach is the necessity of a bigger army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Skilfully executed drawings from Captain
Baker	PERSON	's own pencil , together with a map of
Turkey	LOCATION	in
Europe	LOCATION	, add to the interest and value of the book .

		No book could be more timely , in this the semi-centennial year of the pivotal battle of the Civil War , than Mrs.
George E. Pickett	PERSON	's romance , `` The Bugles of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
F. G. Browne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which com - memorates her late husband 's heroism in that des - perate encounter , and at the same time tells the love story of Colonel
Jasper Carrington	PERSON	and
Catherine Marshall	PERSON	.

		It pictures the
Virginia	LOCATION	of
fifty years ago	DATE	, the conflict of emotions with which loyal Virginians took up arms against the flag of their country , the high hopes and fine enthusiasm of those who dreamed of and fought for a `` free South '' and a '' new nation , '' and the sacrifices they cheerfully made in the gallant endeavor to realize their dream .


Jasper Carrington	PERSON	, a young lieutenant and graduate of West Point , stationed at a far-western post with Captain
Pickett	PERSON	when news reached him of
Virginia	LOCATION	's secession , resigned from the army , as did his captain also , and both made their way by a long and circuitous route to the old home .


Kate Marshall	PERSON	was waiting in suspense to learn whether her lover would espouse the
Union	ORGANIZATION	cause or draw his sword for the Old Dominion and the South .

		Narrow escapes from arrest as a deserter , dangers to his life from a rival suitor for the heroine 's hand , with perils of the battlefield , where indeed he is seriously wounded , combine to make the hero 's fortunes interesting to the reader , as they did to heighten and prolong the loving anxiety of his sweetheart .

		General
Pickett	PERSON	, the admiration and inspiration of those under him and of those associated with him , plays of course an important part in the drama , whose climax is reached on the field of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	.

		In subordinate details , the presentation of the old
Virginia	LOCATION	negro , the faithful family servant , is especially good .

		`` Uncle Zeke , '' who held that `` a lie is a abomina - tion ter de Lawd -LRB- en a ve ' y present help in time er trouble -RRB- , '' and '' Old Pete '' and `` Black Pomp , '' are all drawn to the life .

		The tone and atmosphere of the book bear evidence of long and faithful pre - paration for its writing .

		The `` leading conquerors '' whom Professor
Bevan	PERSON	has chosen to discuss are Alexander ,
Caesar	LOCATION	,
Charles the Great	PERSON	, the Ottoman Sultans from Osman to Souliman ,
Cortez	LOCATION	,
Pizarro	PERSON	, and
Napoleon	PERSON	.

		Sober , objective , cautious , convinced that
Caesar	PERSON	's commentaries are too vague and untrustworthy to have great value and that their author '' added nothing new to the art of war , '' that
Charlemagne	PERSON	's work left no permanent impression , the historian is very chary of super - latives , although he closes his volume and his biography of the great Corsican with the admission that `` In spite of all his limitations , it seems im - possible to point to a more marvelous career in the annals of humanity . ''

		Certain of the chapters , notably those on
Charlemagne	PERSON	and the Spanish Conquistadores , are made up largely of detailed and valuable studies of manners and customs ; these are unquestionably the best part of the book , but they have no proportional equivalents in the other chapters .

		It is to be regretted that there are no maps .

		A modern atlas would of course be of little help with most of the book ; and though the author makes frequent efforts to keep us in touch with the scene of the events he is narrating , by suggesting a modern landmark in the neighborhood of the ancient one , the inclusion of a few charts and plans would have been of great usefulness .

''

		The result is an entertaining volume marked by refreshing informality .

		Thus his contributions range through wide and varied fields , from an admirable description of the durbar and notes on Indian politics or economics to all sorts of minor details , including a picture of two impish young Hindus who suddenly went flat on their faces and crawled under a rope attached to the hind leg of a dismal old cow , `` ex - plaining with grins that it was not right to show dis - respect to cows .

		Mr.
Tait	PERSON	, a master of arts and bachelor of divinity , holds a cure in
Christchurch	LOCATION	,
New Zealand	LOCATION	, and was formerly lecturer on elocution in
Melbourne Univer	LOCATION	- sity ; Mr.

		This latest book of the latter has for a sub-title the statement that it is '' designed as a self-instructor for all who would excel in the art of public speaking , '' and it covers the ground both by precept and example .

		But it really takes up the art about where Mr.
Tait	PERSON	leaves it .

		The latter is concerned with the elements , the former with the finished product of the schools .

		Mr.
Tait	PERSON	is explicit in regard to the simpler and more fundamental things , as if his public lacked the clearness of speech and power to make itself heard that Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	takes for granted .

		In few words , and those easily comprehended , the Australasian shows how to speak simply , articulately , and audibly , how to read with comprehension and deliver with effect , and there he ends his little book .

		Mr.

		The little tract , whose full title describes it as '' an original , economical and expeditious plan for the universal dissemination of knowledge and virtue by means of free public libraries , '' gives an account of an actual library started by the author at

		The little volume , which is freely illustrated with photographs , maps , and charts , is published by the

		A new chapter , with new illustrations , entitled '' Greater

Pickett	PERSON	and His Men , '' a biography commemorating the author 's soldier-husband , one of the foremost com - manders on the Confederate side , and leader of the historic charge against
Cemetery Ridge	ORGANIZATION	on the third day of the battle .

		The book is frankly a tribute to General
Pickett	PERSON	and the men of his Division ; but as an intimate recital of the events connected with the battle it will have an additional appeal .

		Messrs.

		The imagination and the art of the Chinese writer , however , do not maintain the high level of these few choice stories throughout even this small volume of selections .

		The perfection and lightness of touch of a
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	, evinced in the best tales , is inharmoniously matched with the crudity and formlessness of others . ''

John Cotton Dana	PERSON	, comes to us in a beautifully printed folio of barely six pages of reading matter , with a lavish abundance of blank pages before and after .

		The type is thirty-point Cheltenham , and the edition is limited to twenty-five copies .

		The short tract is full of good advice , exhorting to read first for profit , then for pleasure , and at all times to practice honesty with oneself and the world in one 's literary opinions , one 's literary likes and dislikes .

		A larger public than can be reached in this restricted issue of Mr.
Dana	PERSON	's essay ought to have access to it , and it is to be hoped that it will be made more readily available , if steps to that end have not already been taken .

		Court gossip and intrigue and bickering and bitter - ness are dished up in highly-flavored form in
Countess Larisch	LOCATION	's book of rankling memories , entitled '' My Past '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , and professing to clear up the mystery of the tragic end of
Rudolph	LOCATION	, Crown Prince of
Austria	LOCATION	.

		The purpose of the book , written after a quarter-century of silence , is explained as a desire to free the writer s name from intolerable calumnies and slanders that have caused one of her sons to shoot himself and have em - bittered the lives of her daughters .

		Extraordinary accusations against high personages no longer living abound in the sensational narrative of the '' Countess , '' who , by the way , is no longer Countess Larisch , a legal annulment of her marriage having been effected in
1896	DATE	, as she herself relates , and a subsequent union with an untitled person having taken place .

		The book is writ - ten in a style to ensure its being read , it is well printed , well illustrated , well bound , and will for a season take a conspicuous place in the department of literature -LRB- the chroniques scandaleuses -RRB- to which it belongs .

		Mr.
Cobden-Sanderson	PERSON	, of the well-known '' Doves Press , '' at
Hammersmith	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	, announces the aban - donment of his scheme for the publication of Shake - peare 's works , which will not now be carried farther than the three Roman plays and the poems .

		One reason for this alteration of plan will be received with regret namely , the '' not remote closure of the Press . ''

		The reason for this is the growing strain of reading , revising , and passing the printed sheets , work which , with the design - ing of the books , is peculiarly his own . ''

		This has grown of late with an increasing pace in the grey twilight of our wintry weather . ''

		He is thns '' constrained to forego at last the delight of projects which seemed ever to multiply with the work and the years '' ; and '' to adjust his eyes to other scenes and his hopes to far other projects . ''

		There are , however , to be some final publica - tions of the
Doves Press	ORGANIZATION	, which `` shall serve as far as possible to round off the range of thought and expression comprised in the publications of the Press and the variety of the problems whose solution it has been the primary object of the Press to achieve . ''

		Coincidentally with the issue of the last two vol - umes of
John Bigelow	PERSON	's `` Retrospections of an Active Life '' comes the announcement that plans are on foot for the erection of a memorial to that statesman , diplomat , and scholar .

		The committee having the matter in charge , headed by Hon.
Joseph H. Choate	PERSON	, has sent out circulars calling for subscriptions , and saying that it is felt the most fitting memorial to Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	would be a building on the campus of
Union College	ORGANIZATION	,
Schenectady	LOCATION	, N. Y , from which
Bigelow	PERSON	was graduated , and also the establishment of a
Bigelow Professorship of Political Science	ORGANIZATION	in that college .

		Serving on the committee with Mr.
Choate	PERSON	are such men as Messrs.
Oswald Garrison Villard	PERSON	,
Charles E. Hughes	PERSON	,
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	,
Elihu Root	PERSON	, and many others .

		The retirement of Mr.
Robert Underwood Johnson	PERSON	from the editorship of '' The Century Magazine , '' and the appointment of Mr.
Robert Sterling	PERSON	Yard -LRB- formerly of
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- as general manager , call atten - tion anew to the revolution that has of late been effected in the conduct of monthly periodicals .

		It is the busi - ness end of such publications that is now considered all-important , and a
J. G. Holland	PERSON	-LRB- the '' Century 's '' first editor , before it changed its name of '' Scribner 's Monthly '' -RRB- is no longer the man desired for the control of a great magazine a necessary result , no doubt , of the increased and increasing specialization in all activ - ities , literary and other .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	has been so long connected with '' The Century , '' of which he has been editor-in-chief since Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's death , that his retire - ment can not fail to canse widespread regret .

		SEX THROUGH BIOLOGY Torelle 's Plant and Animal Children : How They Grow Those interested in social hygiene agree that the best approach to the teaching of the facts of sex is through biology , and this book gives in acceptable form an adequate treatment of essen - tials .

		It presents in clear and simple language the life history of plants and animals .

		It makes clear the ideas of evolution , heredity , variation , effect of environment , and the evolution of sex .

		In connection with each type of plant and animal discussed is given an account of the manner in which its reproduction is accomplished , until the fundamental law of egg and sperm is seen to pervade all but the lowest forms of organic life .

		DEALING AT AN OLD STAND We all like to have our dealings with people we may know and can come face to face with , rather than a mysterious company or corporation of limited personal responsibility and no individuality .

		We are a firm , established forty years , and have been in our own six-story building , where we have the largest plant of intaglio plates in the world , for twenty-eight of these years .

		All the work of printing and binding is done under our personal supervision .

		Our books are exactly as represented and we guarantee them .

		The fact that
Dun	ORGANIZATION	and Bradstreet have given us the highest rating for years is evidence that this guarantee is good .

		As to the desirability of the books themselves : The
Department of Commerce and Labor	ORGANIZATION	has called us `` the makers of the finest books in the world . ''

		The
New York Herald	ORGANIZATION	once called us the `` Tiffanys of publishers , '' and the
New York Times	ORGANIZATION	has stated that we make `` veritable editions de luxe , '' and our books have been winning medals since
1876	DATE	.

		That hundreds of thousands of persons of keen perceptions and cultivated tastes are purchasers is evidence that the prices are reasonable ; and the fact that they buy again and again seems proof that the books are honestly and satisfactorily made .

		For example : Mr.
George W. Vanderbilt	PERSON	has bought four sets of our Balzac ; Mr.
J. P. Morgan	PERSON	bought the first two sets of our fine edition of
The Queens of England	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- all the sets of that edition have been sold -RRB- .

		A man who has bought every one of our sets in fine bindings writes when sending final cheque on account : '' This I believe closes up our account in full .

		I have to thank you for the favors and courtesy extended during our business relations , and should I need anything in your line 1 shall surely know where I can go and be treated honestly by . ''

		For forty years , `` at the old stand , '' we have been quietly making books as good as experi - ence , conscientious work , and some taste could produce .

		Our principle has been , and is , to give fair dealing and honest value for a fair price .

		Our charges are commensurate with the labor and material expended .

		We do not offer cheap books , nor do we invite extravagance .

		We have aimed for , and have received , the highest awards at international expositions all over the world .

		To those who care to know something about our work we shall be glad to send an illustrated pamphlet that is not a mere catalogue but a thing of considerable literary and artistic interest .
