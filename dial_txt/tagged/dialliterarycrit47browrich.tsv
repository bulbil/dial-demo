		BRIEFER MENTION 24 NOTES 25 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS FOR
JULY 25	DATE	LIST OF NEW BOOKS 26 A POETS MIND .

		The world at large has been acquainted with
Swinburne	PERSON	the poet for nearly half a century .

		The acquaintance has not been improved in pro- portion to the opportunities offered , for of the line of some twoscore books that stretches from '' The Queen Mother '' of i860 to '' The Duke of Gandia '' of
1908	DATE	few have become widely read , and popular attention has been concen - trated upon only a small part , and that by no means the most significant , of the author 's total achievement .

		Nevertheless , the name of the poet has long been upon the lips of most edu - cated persons , and numerous tags of his verse have become a part of the currency of literary conversation and criticism .

		Those who have desired to pursue the acquaintance , making it more comprehensive and substantial , have had access to an abundance of material , and the essential characteristics of the man who ex - pressed himself in the many books have been clearly discernible to all who have wished to know them .

		We are of those who believe that no writer , be he a Shakespeare -- pace
Robert Browning	PERSON	-- or a
Swinburne	PERSON	can successfully mask his true spiritual lineaments , or deceive his readers into thinking him other than he really is .

		It takes discernment , no doubt , and penetrative insight , to discover the man behind the book , but when we really come to know him our knowledge is of a deeper and truer sort than that which we have of most of the people with whom we come into the ordinary personal rela - tions of life .

		There is , however , in most of us a strong desire to supplement the deeper knowledge of a great poet that we may get from his books , by a certain amount of the other kind of knowledge that takes the form of anecdote , of personal idiosyncrasy , of intimate confession , of trick of speech and bearing .

		Having viewed him on parade , as it were , we like to see him also in fatigue uniform or in civilian dress .

		And , so prone are we to confuse accidents with essences , we do not realize how trivial or superficial all our added knowledge of this latter description must be , how relatively unimportant , in the case of a man who has already revealed to us his inmost soul .

		We may be glad to have it , and THE DIAL -LSB-
July	DATE	h it may have its proper function in our mental portraiture , but we must be careful not to let it fill the eye to the exclusion of the traits that really matter .

		All that the
Great Monarch	ORGANIZATION	actually was -- to take
Thackeray	PERSON	's pointed illus - tration of the principle now in question -- he must have been without perruque or sceptre , without any of the trappings of fashion or royalty .

		This exception taken , these qualifications allowed , we may express without further reserve the satisfaction given us by the four letters from
Swinburne	LOCATION	to
Stedman	PERSON	that the
London	LOCATION	`` Times '' has recently made public .

		Few Swinburne letters have ever appeared in print , and few are likely to appear until the publication of Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	's memoir ; but permission has been granted for the printing of these four , which for the first time make the poet known in the intimate aspect of a personal correspondent .

		They were written in 1874-5 , when
Swinburne	PERSON	was 36-8 years of age , their recipient being some four years his senior .

		The first two relate mainly to Landor , being occasioned by Sted - man 's volume of selections from that poet ; the other two are semi-autobiographical , being in response to a request by
Stedman	PERSON	-LRB- just then at work upon his '' Victorian Poets '' -RRB- for such information as he might be permitted to use .

		Incidentally , they speak in a highly interesting way of some of the greater figures in American literature .

		What is particularly noteworthy in these letters is their gentle and self-effacing spirit , which is in sharp contrast to the arrogant dogmatism of
Swinburne	PERSON	's published prose of a critical character .

		The truth seems to be that while he held to his critical convictions intensely , and did not mince matters in their statement , he was an excessively modest man in respect to his own achievements and his position in the world of letters .

		He could fiercely champion the cause of a writer whom he admired , but could hardly believe that those who praised his own writings really meant all that they said , or were at all justified in their admiration .

		This statement may be illustrated by the passage in which he speaks of the great elegy , '' Ave atque Vale . '' ''

		I am very glad you like my elegy on Baudelaire ; I wrote it with very sincere feelings of regret for the poor fellow 's untimely loss , which gave it a tone of deeper thought or emotion than was called forth by the death of
Gautier	PERSON	, with whom -LRB- though from boyhood almost his ardent admirer -RRB- I never had any correspondence ; but in spite of your kind mention of it in this month 's s Scribner 's Magazine ' which I have just seen I can not believe it worthy to tie the shoes -LRB- so to speak -RRB- of the least , whichever may be the least , of the great English triad or Trinity of elegies --
Milton	PERSON	's ,
Shelley	PERSON	's , and
Arnold 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		I am content if it may be allowed to take its stand below the lowest of them , or to sit meekly at their feet . ''

		Again , speaking of his experiments in Greek and Latin verse , he says : '' I confess that I take delight in the metrical forms of any language of which I know anything whatever , simply for the metre 's sake , as a new musical instrument ; and as soon as I can am tempted to try my hand or my voice at a new mode of verse , like a child trying to sing before it can speak plain .

		This is why without much scholarship I venture to dabble in classic verse and manage to keep afloat when in shallow water . ''

		`` Without much scholarship ! ''

		this from the man who ranks with
Jonson	PERSON	and
Milton	PERSON	and Gray among the great English poets who have also been great scholars .

		It is , at least , not the language of egotism or even of self-confidence .

		What is said in these letters about the poets of
America	LOCATION	is in reply to
Stedman	PERSON	's remon - strance concerning certain harsh observations found in '' Under the Microscope . '' ''

		Your rebuke on the subject of American poetry is doubtless as well deserved as it is kindly and gently ex - pressed .

		Yet I must say that while I appreciate -LRB- I hope -RRB- the respective excellence of Mr.
Bryant	PERSON	's ' Thanatopsis ' and of Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's ' Commemoration Ode , ' I can not say that either of them leaves in my ear the echo of a single note of song .

		It is excellent good speech , but if given us as song its first and last duty is to sing .

		The one is most
august	DATE	meditation , the other a noble expres - sion of deep and grave patriotic feeling on a supreme national occasion ; but the thing more necessary , though it may be less noble than these , is the pulse , the fire , the passion of music -- the quality of a singer , not of a solitary philosopher or a patriotic orator .

		Now , when
Whitman	PERSON	is not speaking bad prose he sings , and when he sings at all he sings well .

		Mr.
Longfellow	PERSON	has a pretty little pipe of his own , but surely it is very thin and reedy .

		Again , whatever may be Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	's merits , to talk of his poetry seems to me like talking of the scholarship of a child who has not learnt its letters .

		Even
Browning	PERSON	's verse always goes to a recognizable tune -LRB- I say not to a good one -RRB- , but in the name of all bagpipes what is the tune of
Emerson	LOCATION	's ? ''

		In the letter dated some six months later , he recurs to this subject . ''

		I read your former letter very carefully and have since re-read a good deal of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's first volume of poems therein mentioned , which certainly contains noble verses and passages well worth remembering .

		I hope that no personal feeling or consideration will ever pre - vent or impair my recognition of any man 's higher qualities .

		In
Whittier	LOCATION	the power and pathos and righteousness -LRB- to use a great old word which should not be left to the pulpiteers -RRB- of noble emotion would be more enjoyable and admirable if he were not so deplorably ready to put up with the first word , good or bad , that comes to hand , and to run on long after he is out of breath . ''

		Now all this is genuine criticism , and its
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL substantial justice must be allowed .

		At least , no American not blinded by excess of patriot - ism can fairly deny that the critic 's position is tenable if not absolutely secure .

		If only Swin - burne had printed these things , and left for private communication the petulant things that he did print about
Emerson	PERSON	and
Lowell	PERSON	and ``
Whittier	LOCATION	-LRB- which his warmest admirers find it hard to forgive him -RRB- , how much better it would have been !

		The self - revelation afforded by these letters constitutes an even stronger claim to our interest than the critical comment .

		In external matters alone , it is extremely interesting to learn that
Swinburne	PERSON	never spent more than a few weeks altogether in
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	, that he was a good cragsman as well as a good swimmer , and that he was once urged to stand for Parliament as a radical candidate , but was dissuaded by
Mazzini	PERSON	, '' the man I most loved and revered on earth , '' and felt greatly relieved .

		It is also interesting to learn the details of his Catholic and Jacobite ancestry , and to read that '' when this race chose at last to produce a poet it would have been at least remarkable if he had been content to write nothing but hymns and idyls for clergymen and young ladies to read out in chapels and drawing rooms . ''

		We like to know , too , that he regarded '' Hertha '' as the best of his poems , and that he thought there was little '' praiseworthy or notable '' in that first volume of '' Poems and Ballads '' that had made him famous , and upon which -LRB- to the shame of criti - cism -RRB- the current estimate of
Swinburne	LOCATION	is still mainly based .

		Deepest of all in interest , perhaps , is the long passage -LRB- too long for complete quotation -RRB- which gives us the poet 's confession of religious faith .

		Here is its more significant part : ■ I always felt by instinct and perceived by reason that no man could conceive of a. personal God except by crude superstition or else by true supernatural revela - tion ; that a natural God was the absurdest of all human figments , because no man could by other than apocalyptic means -- i. e. , by other means than a violation of the laws and order of nature -- conceive of any other sort of Divine person than man with a difference -- man with some qualities intensified and some qualities suppressed -- man with the good in him exaggerated and the evil excised .

		This , I say , I have always seen and avowed since my mind was ripe enough to think freely ... But we who worship no material incarnation of any qualities , no person , may worship the Divine humanity , the ideal of human perfection and aspiration , without worshipping any god , any person , any fetish at all .

		Therefore I might call myself , if I wished , a kind of Christian -LRB- of the
Church of Blake	ORGANIZATION	and
Shelley	PERSON	-RRB- but assuredly in no sense a Theist .

		... I think and hope that among the younger Englishmen who think at all just now Theism is tottering ; Theism , which I feel to be sillier -LRB- if less dangerous -RRB- even than theology . ''

		This clean-cut statement should bring to per - manent confusion the criticasters who continue to prate about
Swinburne	PERSON	as a poet of sound and fury only , whose intellect was a negligible quantity .

		As compared with it , whatever con - fession of faith we may find in either
Browning	PERSON	or
Tennyson	PERSON	-LRB- commonly taken as the typical modern poets of robust thought and reasoned belief -RRB- seems turbid or misty .

		Here is a poet who knows what he believes , and why he believes it .

		The faith thus confessed has always been implicit in
Swinburne	LOCATION	's song , and no one could read with intelligence '' The Last
Oracle	ORGANIZATION	, '' for example , and fail to understand its deep under - lying thought .

		`` To the likeness of one God their dreams enthralled thee , Who wast greater than all Gods that waned and grew ; Son of God the shining son of Time they called thee , Who wast older , O our father , than they knew .

		For no thought of man made Gods to love and honour Ere the song within the silent soul began , Xor might earth in dream or deed take heaven upon her Till the word was clothed with speech by lips of man . ''

		But to those for whom the verse is without meaning , the prose should be sufficiently clear .

		In token of the appeal which
Swinburne	ORGANIZATION	makes as a religious prophet to minds not sealed by dogmatism , and of the positive aspect of a teaching which may seem merely negative at the first hearing , we will quote , in closing , these words from a letter recently sent us by a man who is an admirer of the poet , and also , signifi - cantly , a professional theologian . ''

		Humanitarianism , the note of the living literature of this
twentieth century	DATE	, has its highest expression in
Swinburne	LOCATION	.

		Anthropology is central in Christian The - ology ; it may be a matter of indifference to others , but the Christian must know , ' What is man ? '

		One hun - dred years hence
Swinburne	PERSON	's anthropology will provide the prosy platitudes of the schools of ` divines . '

		... I am not a preacher with an eccentric literary taste ; I am for the diffusion of Swinburne because I am a minister of Jesus Christ and his fathomless gospel which dies when man fails of a just estimate of himself . ''

		It is perhaps the greatest service done us by the publication of these
Swinburne	PERSON	letters that they justify such an attitude as that taken by our correspondent , that they show us the poet 's mind expressing itself in terms of the plainest prose upon questions which have their dwelling-place only in the upper regions of the intellectual life , yet which it is vitally important that men should face , and find for them answers that fit into the pattern of modern knowledge .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, CASUAL COMMENT .

		A MARVEL OF LITERARY PRODUCTIVENESS ha8 passed out from the company of toiling penmen ; and yet he was no toiling penman himself .

		If the attempt should ever he made to prepare a complete list of the late
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	's writings , the compiler would find his task a formidable one in - deed .

		A tentative check-list of the more important , and of some less important , products of Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's rapid pen has recently appeared in a
Boston	LOCATION	news - paper , and its titles number two hundred and fifty - three .

		The
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, the
Boston Athenaeum	LOCATION	, and the
Harvard University Library	ORGANIZATION	fur - nished most of the data sought ; but a far wider and more thorough search would be required for any - thing like a complete bibliography .

		Probably not even the author himself could have drawn up a full list of his writings .

		A pamphlet on
Texas	LOCATION	immi - gration is mentioned in his autobiography as one of his earliest publications , but no
Boston	LOCATION	library has it , and one questions whether Dr.
Hale	PERSON	himself could have laid his hand on a copy .

		The wide range of his literary activities is illustrated by even a partial list of his works .

		.

		He wrote on the '' Cosmogony of
Dante	PERSON	and
Columbus	LOCATION	, '' a paper on ''
Coronado 's Discovery	ORGANIZATION	of the Seven Cities , '' an account of '' The Fall of the Stuarts , '' something about '' Emigration of Women to
Oregon	LOCATION	, '' and fiction and fable , poetry and sermon , in endless variety .

		The number of points at which he touched the world was all but infinite , and the large humanity of the man grows upon us with every day that passes since his death .

		Some of Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's sayings and counsels , as they are now being reported , are characteristic and full of common sense . ''

		I am especially gratified , '' he is reported to have said on one occasion , '' over the organization of a boys ' society in the
State of Maine	LOCATION	.

		Their motto is ` Patience , ' and they call it the
D. G. M. Club	PERSON	, which , translated , means the Do n't Get
Mad Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		That ought to be the motto of every person and nation on the earth . '' ''

		Three hours ' dictation is enough for any man engaged in literary labor .

		It should begin at 9.30 o'clock in the
morning	TIME	, behind a locked door , with a secretary who knows more than you do and can spell .

		At half - past twelve , as I once said , you may open your doors and let the wildcats , or the tame , rush in .

		Attend to the business of your callers in the
afternoon	TIME	, and get out into the open .

		In the evening play cards in your family , read , but not too much , go to see your friends , let them come to see you , or there may be a good play at the theatre / ' '' My advice to every one is to live out of doors as much as possihle .

		A healthy man should walk six miles a day without fatigue .

		But a dozen miles in an open street car or buggy is just as well , I think .

		The air and sun are what one needs . '' '

		• Good sleep is the first necessity for health and labor .

		If for any cause you lose sleep , be sure to make it up .

		Maintain the average '' -- which in his case was nine hours ; but not all have Morpheus so submissively at their beck and call , at any time of day or night , as our cheerful and optimistic and equable Dr.
Hale	PERSON	appears to have had .

Dana Estes	PERSON	, publisher , traveller , archae - ologist , a veteran of the Civil War , sometime secretary of the
International Copyright Asssciation	ORGANIZATION	, and otherwise a man of note and of varied experience , died at his home in
Brookline	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	,
June 16	DATE	, at the age of sixty-nine .

		Born and educated at
Gorham	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, and trained in business at
Augusta	LOCATION	, and from the age of nineteen in
Boston	LOCATION	, he made himself prominent and successful as a book-publisher .

		He was associated , first and last , with the
Boston	LOCATION	firms of
Degen , Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Lee & Shepard , Estes & Lauriat	ORGANIZATION	, and
Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Historical works of value , published by subscription , were his speciality ; and
Guizot	PERSON	's and
Martin	PERSON	's histories of
France	LOCATION	,
Duruy	ORGANIZATION	's histories of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, besides editions of leading European novelists ^ were issued in handsome and substantial form by his house .

		The '' Zig-Zag Journey '' series under
Hezekiah Butterworth	PERSON	's editorship , the u Knockabout Club '' series , the '' Vassar Girl '' series , the popular stories of Mrs.
Laura E. Richards	PERSON	-LRB- daughter of Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	-RRB- , the scarcely less popular cook-books of Miss
Maria Parloa	PERSON	, and the remarkably successful American edition of '' The Chatterbox , '' were also among Mr.
Estes	PERSON	's widely-known publications .

		It was the nearly ten years ' litigation over the exclusive American right to the '' Chatterbox '' title -LRB- a claim finally made good at the cost of almost
$ 30,000	MONEY	-RRB- that paved the way to Mr.
Estes	PERSON	's organization of the
Copyright Association	ORGANIZATION	above mentioned .

		Of his travels in
Africa	LOCATION	and elsewhere , and his interest in palaeon - tology and archaeology , there is not space here to speak .

		Mr.
Estes	PERSON	was a good example of the enlightened and broad-minded publisher of the old school .

		t t t The three days ' festival in honor of
Frederic Mistral	PERSON	, the beloved poet of
Provence	LOCATION	, to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the publica - tion of his poem '' Mireio , '' is reported to have been a complete success .

		To few men is it given to hear their own funeral orations , and to scarcely more is it granted to assist at the unveiling of their own statues .

		But this latter happiness has fallen to the lot of the greatly beloved poet of
Provence	LOCATION	.

		Yet the singular event was to him , in prospectu , a trying ordeal .

		A few weeks ago he wrote to a friend : '' Pity me !

		To assist at the unveiling of my own statue is the most uncomfortable task that could fall to my share ; I would exchange all these fetes for a simple lunch with two or three dear friends under the white pop - lars beside the Rhone . ''

		Nevertheless , when the day arrived , it proved to be one of exceeding joy to all concerned , including the central figure .

		The museum of antiquities , newly housed in the ancient palace of
Laval	LOCATION	, which the poet had bought with the proceeds of his Nobel prize and given to Aries , was formally
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL opened to the public : and this and the other events of the festival were witnessed by enthusiastic throngs of the poet 's admirers .

		The publication , a year and a half ago .

		of
M. Mistral	ORGANIZATION	's Memoirs , in English as well as French , must have won him many new friends in this country , where he is pleasantly remembered by older readers through
Miss Preston	PERSON	's charming version of his ' ; Mireio , '' published in
Boston	LOCATION	over thirty years ago .

		A NEW EPOCH OF LIBRARY DEVELOPMEXT IX Califorxia is entered upon with the passage by the last legislature of the bill providing for a county library system throughout the state .

		This is a direct result of the admirable work done by the
State Li	ORGANIZATION	- brary , within the last few years , in the extension , improvement and coordination of library facilities ; and its effect in time will be to weld the public libra - ries of the state into practically a single cooperative organization , centring in the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		The new law is permissive and elastic , and libraries may enter the county system or not , according to local preference ; but the intention of the act is that the leading public library of a county shall assume the functions of a county library , extending its privi - leges freely to all residents and having supervision of the smaller libraries within its field .

		This will greatly improve the condition of the school district libraries , now often moribund , which as branches of a live county system will be revived to usefulness .

		Good support of the system is assured through a special county tax , and this additional appropriation will undoubtedly be an inducement to libraries to enter the county system .

		An interesting feature is the provision that no person shall be eligible for appointment as county librarian who is not certified as qualified for the position by the
State Librarian	ORGANIZATION	, or the librarian of
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	, or the libra - rian of the
State	ORGANIZATION	university -- this being evidently a portent of a future system of state certification for librarians , such as now prevails for teachers .

		In - deed , this law is striking evidence of the growing feeling that public libraries should be put more nearly on a plane with public schools , especially as regards financial maintenance and salaries paid , than is the case at present .

		A XEW DEPARTURE LX ExGLISH PROSE
COMPO	LOCATION	- srriox .

		as required for admission to
Harvard	LOCATION	, was made about a year ago , when candidates were per - mitted to write either on one of the prescribed liter - ary topics or on a subject of current and practical interest for which they had not laboriously crammed .

		`` While three-quarters of the would-be freshmen followed what was perhaps for them the safer course and expatiated on '' The Appearance and Character of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, '' not a few burned their bridges behind them and pushed forward boldly into the terra incognita , or terra parum cognita , of sponta - neous literary effort .

		From an interesting leaflet entitled `` The Xew Examinations , '' just published by the
New England Association of Teachers of English	ORGANIZATION	, we learn that among the topics not taken from the prescribed reading were some of this sort , -- u The effect of the game of football on the school of which you have been a member during the past year , '' '' Your reasons for your choice of a college , '' and '' What subjects you plan to study in college , and your reasons for choosing them . ''

		Here , evidently , was matter for independent thought , and the non - literary essays printed in the leaflet display far more individuality than could have been exhibited in any rechauffe of prescribed book-knowledge .

		The youth who dared to denounce interscholastic football , and the one who pleaded its cause , each wrote with force and conviction .

		If a lad can not take an interest in the things of literature , it is hopeless to expect any live utterance from him on Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	; better let him express himself on a humbler theme and one nearer home ... A bllxd leader of the bllxd is now attract - ing attention in the Bacon-Shakespeare controversy .

		Miss
Helen Keller	PERSON	publishes a letter giving her experience in the absorbing game of acrostic-chasing . ''

		I copied the pages from the Shakespeare text literatim , '' she tells us , '' so that I could trace them with the ten eyes of my fingers ; '' and her findings are thought by Mr.
Booth	PERSON	's disciples to be of super - lative importance .

		Miss
Keller	PERSON	's marvellous powers of intuition , abnormally developed by the peculiari - ties of her condition , render most interesting and significant this participation of hers in the otherwise tiresome and often foolish discussion .

		Yet it should be borne in mind that no sense is more easily deceived or more responsive to suggestion than the sense of touch .

		The ten eyes of the fingers -LRB- to use Miss
Keller	PERSON	's apt and poetic expression -RRB- easily see what they wish to see , or what they are expected to see .

		This gullibility of the touch-sense was well known to Aristotle -LRB- to go no further back -RRB- , and is illustrated by the ancient experiment of crossing the index and second fingers and gently pressing the surface of a globule with their tips , whereupon the eyes of these two fingers see two globules instead of one .

		This illustration may not be the aptest possible ; but what it is desirable to remember is that it belongs to the very nature of illusion , when it is seeking to establish itself as truth , to call forth from many quarters an astonishing number of what the credulous hail as convincing proofs .

		... The late
Coloxel Alexander K. McClure	PERSON	, whose death last month carried sorrow to his many friends and regret to his still more numerous admir - ers and readers and hearers -LRB- for he was a familiar figure on the platform and a widely-read author of historical , biographical , and autobiographical vol - umes -RRB- had .

		in his eighty-one years of actively useful life , amassed treasures of experience and observation such as few can ever hope to possess .

		Besides editing with distinction the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	'' Times '' and mak - ing it a power for civic righteousness in his almost hopelessly unrighteous city , he wrote '' Lincoln 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, and the Men of his Time , '' '' Our Presidents and How We Make Them , '' `` Recollections of Half a Century , '' '' Old Time Notes of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, '' and other works , including several books of travel in his own country .

		The friend and comrade of such famous old Pennsylvanians as
Tom Scott	PERSON	, Editor
Forney	PERSON	,
Simon Cameron	PERSON	,
Samuel Randall	PERSON	, Judge
Kelley	PERSON	, and
Galusha Grow	PERSON	, he was a sturdy and picturesque figure in the public life of his
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is pleasant to remember that when the newspaper he owned and so ably edited -- a paper apparently too good for its time and place -- suspended publi - cation and left
Colonel McClure	ORGANIZATION	without means , he was fittingly provided for by being appointed pro- thonotary , having in early life made acquaintance with the law and been admitted to the bar .

		Few books of miscellaneous reminiscences are more inter - esting than his '' Recollections . ''

		The '' glorious Fourth '' as an index of our civilization is most certainly an ignominious Fourth .

		The historical and literary and musical programme that might furnish the day 's festivities , and that did formerly constitute the chief feature of its celebration , has now been mostly superseded by demoniac din and senseless racket , with a melan - choly train of deaths and mutilations and conflagra - tions to lend lurid horror to the newspaper columns of the next morning .

		A society for the intelligent observance of our natal day has , indeed , been formed , and all over the land an encouraging reaction against our present puerile and dangerous and costly method of making merry is manifesting itself .

		The city of
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, has already achieved noteworthy results , its patriotic citizens subscribing generously to furnish young and old with a series of pageants or historic spectacles that dignify the day and leave no mangled limbs or blackened ruins behind .

		And now we learn that our national capital has adopted the safe and sensible Fourth-of-July plan and is rais - ing a considerable sum for a suitable public enter - tainment , in furnishing which the board of trade , the chamber of commerce , and the school committee are cooperating .

		Let now the mischievous fire - cracker and the nerve-racking torpedo pass into innocuous desuetude .

		The blessings of liberal library support are often more than are '' covenanted in the bond . ''

		Some of these are briefly touched upon in the
Aurora	LOCATION	-LRB- 111 . -RRB-

		Public Library 's monthly publication , '' The Library Guide . '' ''

		Material results , '' says the writer , whom we assume to be the librarian , `` are often a sort of by-product of a well-managed public library .

		It is thought that the public libraries of
Springfield	LOCATION	and
Worcester	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, have done their full share in promoting the industries of those cities by supplying books that have stimulated invention , leading to improved processes , better methods , and often-times to new devices .

		In this way those insti - tutions have paid for themselves over and over , as have other well managed libraries . ''

		The indirect commercial benefit accruing to
Aurora	LOCATION	from her excellent public library is then considered .

		It appears that the library draws visitors and readers and book-borrowers from many of the surrounding towns , and the inference is safe that this influx of strangers -LRB- from no fewer than sixteen neighboring towns in '' the last few months '' -RRB- brings at least a little increase of trade to
Aurora	LOCATION	's shop-keepers .

		Here is an argument calculated to appeal even to the most un-bookloving of finance committees when the annual appeal for a public-library appropriation has to be made ... The domain of unremunerative authorship is a large one , and there is always ample elbow-room and opportunity there for fresh aspirants to obscur - ity and poverty , fame and fortune being the irre - sistible lure to the great throng .

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, in his after-dinner remarks at the recent banquet of the Royal Literary Fund , in
London	LOCATION	, specified as particularly unprofitable -LRB- in pecuniary returns -RRB- the departments of history , poetry , essays , literary criti - cism , and anthropology , and advised young writers to give their energies to fiction , although even here he acknowledged the prospect to be rather dark .

		The rich , he declared , who deny themselves nothing else , persist in denying themselves books , and even the popular novels are not bought by individuals in any great number -- not over twenty per cent , in his opinion .

		The seven-penny novel he is reported as likening to the sword of Damocles in its menace to the young novelist 's success .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	might have greatly lengthened his list of pecuniarily unprofitable - ologies ; but nevertheless we hope the geologists , ornithologists , entomologists , and even the ontolo - gists , will not abandon their researches and give us no more books .

		Man can not subsist on a diet of pure fiction ... A sign of promise from
Iowa	LOCATION	catches the eye in the current issue of the ``
Iowa	LOCATION	Library Quarterly , '' a sixteen-page periodical published by the
Iowa Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	.

		The town of
Shenandoah	LOCATION	, which is credited in the latest census with 3573 inhabitants , seems more appreciative of its
Sunday	DATE	opportunity to visit the public library than do many larger and perhaps more cultured communities of the
East	LOCATION	.

		Concerning a recent
Sunday	DATE	attendance we read : '' Sixty-seven young men and 34 young women visited the library from 2:20 to
5:30 o'clock	TIME	, a total of 101 .

		It was almost universally true that every one came in quietly , immediately went to a table or shelf , and continued occupied in reading until he left ... Almost the entire number who came in were under twenty-four years of age '' -- the very time of life when
Sunday	DATE	afternoon is apt to seem designed primarily for other than literary uses .

		Almost coincident with this bit of news from the prairie , there comes an encouraging item from
Massachusetts	LOCATION	: the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	has re - cently lengthened its
Sunday	DATE	hours , closing now at ten instead of nine o'clock .

		They might easily do worse , both in
Boston	LOCATION	and in
Iowa	LOCATION	.

COMMUNICA TIOXS	ORGANIZATION	.

		MAKING PRINTED MATTER EASIER TO READ .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Until the half-tone plate as a means of illustration became popular , bringing with it the clay-coated shining printing surfaces to show off its deUcate shadings on the paper , we heard comparatively little about eye-strain .

		That the highly-finished papers do cause distress to readers , is generally admitted .

		Now we have the activ - ities of the
Boston Society of Printers	ORGANIZATION	directed to a reform in the shape of individual letters .

		Some of the letters of the alphabet are '' proved by laboratory tests '' to be `` offenders '' -LRB- quoting from an editorial in The Dial -RRB- .

		Before accepting the asserted proof , it is , I think , reasonable to inquire into the character of the laboratory tests .

		If the letter O is placed before me and its distance from me gradually increased to the vanishing-point , I may be able to recognize it at a greater distance than the letter E , and these tests may be in groups of words or in single letters .

		But in read - ing , I do not examine the letters so intently , except as a proofreader on the alert for wrong fonts .

		It is the '' word-shape '' I read , not the letter-shape .

		Most printers '' spell by sight . ''

		Ask some of them to spell an unusual word , and they are not quite sure until they set it up and look at it or write it .

		The shape of the word is their guide .

		Research , particularly the research of the
Boston Society of Printers	ORGANIZATION	, has many fascinations , and that they have found many '' bad characters '' in the types may be subject for congratulation as by such process of elimi - nation they may find the good ones .

		The inference is that they will advise making the bad ones as much like the good ones as possible ?

		Will not distinction be lost ?

		Will not the subtle word-shape be lost ?

		It may not be freely admitted by the experienced that the purpose of printed matter is to convey thought , but it may be cau - tiously admitted as a philosophical truth .

		Type mod - elled on the lettering of ` the ancient scriveners , or on the styles used by the fathers of the printing art , it is almost profane to criticise -- perhaps .

		Mr.
Bruce Rogers	PERSON	goes back to the fountain-head of the art for inspiration in developing taste and style in modern typography .

		In all the classic forms of alphabets esteemed by the elect , the ■ bad characters '' in the letter forms , according to my idea of the `` laboratory tests , '' must be exceedingly bad .

		The Printers ' Society of
Boston	LOCATION	appears to be working against the influences of the vicarious inspiration of Mr.
Bruce Rogers	PERSON	.

		The suggestion that a Roman inscrip - tion would be more legible if a Greek character should be used in place of one or more of the Roman characters , is new .

		The fun that the average citizen delights to make of monumental inscriptions with the classic V 's instead of U 's is modern but not new .

		That the weight of the lines of certain type forms make legibility great or less , we all know .

		The biblio - phile delights in type that is to be looked at but not read .

		The newspaper reader and magazine reader will be quite content if the spiky
Jenson	PERSON	, the graceful old - style with the high ascenders and low descenders , obscure thinnesses and obtrusive thicknesses , are con - fined to those who want books to look at .

		For them - selves , they ask a good full-bodied letter with an honest printing face as the means of carrying the predigested mental food suited to their dyspeptic condition .

A. H. McQcilkls	PERSON	.

		DIPROYEMENTS IN TYPE DESIGN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The views upon typographical reform , expressed by Mr.
George French	PERSON	in The Dial of
June 16	DATE	, will be echoed by all who have studied the subject closely , and especially by those who have had experience in the diffi - cult task of designing new type-faces .

		Improvements in type design are possible only within very narrow limits .

		The time for making any radical alteration in the Roman alphabet has long gone by .

		Even the introduction of a single novel letter would not be tolerated if its use should change in any marked degree the appearance of the words containing it .

		Those who have tried to decipher early seventeenth-century handwriting , and know how long it takes to become sufficiently accustomed to the inverted h so that the words in which it occurs can be grasped by the eye without working them out letter by letter , will appre - ciate the force of this statement .

		The substitution of the Greek lambda for the present lower-case I , as pro- posed by Dr.
Cattell	PERSON	, is objectionable upon this ground , and also because it would introduce an inharmonious character into the alphabet and so spoil the beauty of any page upon which it might be used .

		The effect would be somewhat analogous to the use of the italic I in place of the vertical letter .

		That some letters can be read at a greater distance than others is incontestable .

		Yet were all of those now in use discarded , and the entire alphabet reconstructed upon scientific lines , it is scarcely conceivable that a new set could be invented , each and every letter of which would be equally legible at any given distance .

		It is easy to overestimate the eye-strain induced by these inevitable differences .

		Laboratory tests will be of little value if they ignore the fact that , in reading , the indi - vidual letters are scarcely noted .

		Even when one con - sciously tries to look at them closely , as in reading proof , it is hard to do so , since we are accustomed to see words , phrases , and sometimes sentences , as units .

		While this comprehensive view is facilitated by the arrangement of the words upon the printed page , the length of the lines , the spacing between them , the color of the ink , the sharpness of the impression , the texture of the paper , and other refinements that enter into good printing , the character of the type is also of prime importance .

		Optically , the ideal type is that which enables the eye to take in most at a glance .

		This means that the entire font must be free from any dis - tracting feature however slight .

		So small a thing as a slightly exaggerated serif upon a single letter is quite enough to impair the effect of the type when seen as a page .

		Rigorously severe simplicity is an inexorable requirement .

		Furthermore , the '' set '' of the letters must be so adjusted that in every possible combination , the words will look right .

		For these reasons , the designer soon discovers that there is very little scope for innovations .

		The fact is , the Roman alphabet was so thoroughly studied in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , and the proportions of each letter were worked out so carefully , that no sub - stantial improvement has since been devised .

		This , how - ever , does not imply that no modification is possible .

		It is no doubt worth while that the scientific tests should be made and be given the widest possible range .

		I shall be surprised if they do not show that the most beautf ul types are also the easiest to read , and that what is called for is improvement in the types used in machine composition .

		Some Old Familiar Faces .

		* Looking back from the vantage-ground of his mature age -- which -LRB- if he will pardon the innocent pun -RRB- is as a lusty winter , kindly and not frosty -- Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	is favoring his readers with a series of informal recollec - tions of old friends who have won fame on the stage or with the pen .

		His agreeable memories of actors , recently published in book form under the title `` Other Days , '' are speedily followed by similar reminiscences of authors , first printed in part in the ''
Saturday	DATE	Evening Post , '' and now collected and enlarged and named `` Old Friends : being Literary Recollections of Other Days . ''

		The famous names of that golden age of American literature , the middle and later nine - teenth century , that so attractively besprinkle Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's pages are
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Aldrich	PERSON	,
Taylor	PERSON	,
Curtis	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Stedman Stod	PERSON	- dard , and others of less renown .

		Some English authors , notably
Dickens	PERSON	and
Wilkie Collins	PERSON	, are introduced ; and more than once Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	himself , in poem or personal anecdote or half-tone portrait , is made to contribute to the reader 's entertainment .

		To begin our quoted selections with one having to do chiefly with the author himself , here is a picture of him deliver - ing a poem before the Society of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the
Potomac	LOCATION	, at the
Philadelphia Academy of Music	ORGANIZATION	in
1876	DATE	. ''

		The scene , as I recall it , presented a superb pageant of life and color .

		There was a multitudinous audience .

		The stage was thronged with men renowned in war and eminent in peace .

		General
Hancock	PERSON	presided .

		My seat was at the left of that commander , and on my left sat
General Sherman	ORGANIZATION	.

		... I have addressed many au - diences , but never an audience more eagerly responsive and generously enthusiastic than that assemblage of members of the Society of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the
Potomac	LOCATION	.

		When I returned to my seat , after the delivery of my poem , every person upon the stage was standing ; the house was ringing with cheers ; General

		First in his book , and apparently foremost in Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's admiration and grateful homage , stands the poet
Longfellow	LOCATION	, whose acquaintance the author made as a youth , before going to seek his fortune with his pen in
New York	LOCATION	.

New York	LOCATION	:
Moffat	PERSON	,
Yard & Co	ORGANIZATION	, greatest poet is refreshing in an age when , as he complains , no name in literature is uttered with that accent of profound respect and sincere admiration that trembled on the tongue of his contempories fifty years ago when the leading men of letters were mentioned .

		Some of Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's reasons for ascribing supremacy to his old friend are as follows : '' A reason for thinking
Longfellow	PERSON	is the foremost of American poets is the belief that he was more objective than any of the other bards , and was elementally actu - ated by an impulse of greater and broader design ... Another reason why
Longfellow	LOCATION	stands foremost among our poets is that he possessed and manifested a more comprehensive , various , and felicitous command of verbal art than has been displayed by any other American poet ; while still another is that he speaks with a voice that is more universal than personal . '

		Evangeline , ' ' The Build - ing of the Ship , ' ' The Golden Legend , ' `` The Saga of King
Olaf	PERSON	, ' ' Tales of a
Wayside Inn	ORGANIZATION	, ' and '
Hiawatha	PERSON	' are works that illumine the general imagination , express the general human heart , and are freighted with the general life of man . ''

		Anecdotes illustrating the poet 's keen sense of humor , even when the laugh was against him , follow in some abundance , and other amiable traits of the man are touched upon .

		His kindli - ness and his all but invariable custom of saying nothing but good of his fellow-craftsmen , and indeed of all men whatsoever , might perhaps have been advantageously imitated by his eulo - gist in that part of his book that treats of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	.

		The latter 's peculiarities are well enough known by this time , and Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's catalogue of his offences seems hardly called for .

		Selecting a few lines from the milder portion of the author 's censure , we will quote . ''

		The writings of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, in so far as they are anything , are philosophy : they certainly are not poetry : and they do not possess even the merit of an original style ; for
Macpherson	PERSON	, with his `` Ossian ' for - geries ;
Martin Farquhar Tupper	PERSON	, with his ' Proverbial Philosophy , ' and
Samuel Warren	PERSON	, with his tumid < Ode , ' were extant long before the advent of Whitman .

		Fur - thermore ,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's writings were not unknown ; while the brotherhood of man had been proclaimed in
Judea	LOCATION	, with practical consequences that are still obvious .

		No author has yet made a vehicle of expression that excels , in any way whatever , or for any purpose , the blank verse of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Milton	LOCATION	.

		In the hands of any artists who can use them , the old forms of expression are abun - dantly adequate , and so , likewise , are the old subjects ; at all events , nobody has yet discovered any theme more fruitful than the human heart , human experience , man in his relation to Nature and to God . ''

		With the last clause , Whitman himself would undoubtedly have been in hearty agreement .

		But in the main this estimate of the '' good gray poet '' seems hardly likely to be confirmed by the verdict of posterity .

		Some of Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's explanatory remarks
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 13 seem to be designed for very young readers .

		A half-page devoted to recounting a few of the main facts of
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	's life , upon in - troduction of her name , seems , to the ordinarily intelligent reader of the book , like so much padding , however appropriate it may have been in the columns of the '' Post . ''

		Also , his pro- fuse notes of admiration whenever he chances to mention
Scott	PERSON	are not exactly indispensable to the enjoyment of his chapters , however cordially one may share his enthusiasm for that prince of romancers .

		One of the best chapters in Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's book is that on
Aldrich	PERSON	, who has but so lately left us .

		The friendship between the two began even before they had seen each other , and was strengthened by frequent letters that passed between
Cambridge	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	.

		Strikingly characteristic of the youth who was afterward to produce u
Marjorie Daw	PERSON	'' is the subjoined ex - tract from one of his friendly missives to the yet unseen correspondent in
New England	LOCATION	. ''

		How sweet is the letter that comes to a sick-room , fresh from the hand of a very dear though unseen friend !

		And how sweet it is , when one is just convalescent enough to sit before a comfortable writing-desk and lan - guidly hang thoughts , like a week 's washing -LRB- pardon the homely comparison -RRB- , upon a line , to watch ' the swell mob of characters , ' as
Tom Hood	PERSON	says , creep gradually over the page !

		This pleasure is mine now , dear
Winter	DATE	, and a sort of dreamy joy comes over me , when I think how very soon your eyes will run over these lines , -- almost following the point of my pen .

		How odd that I have never seen you !

		How strange that we have looked into each other 's hearts , and never touched a hand or exchanged a glance !

		If we should never meet , I shall always think of you as one of the delicious phantoms which have , before now , flitted through the heaven of my fancy , leaving me only a dim conjecture of what it might have been .

		I can not see you ; but I can send you my mind , the better part of me , which can not be taken away . ''

		A welcome variety is given to Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's pages by the occasional and graceful introduc - tion of a poem or part of a poem from his pen .

		Especially good is the threnody that concludes his chapter on
George William Curtis	PERSON	; and the brief extract he gives from his tribute to Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	on the occasion of the Autocrat 's seven - tieth birthday makes one desire the remainder .

		However , his poetical works are not difficult of access .

		A serious disfigurement of so excellent and handsome a volume is to be noted in the many misprints , if such they are to be called .

		The
Craigie	ORGANIZATION	house in
Cambridge	LOCATION	is repeatedly referred to as the Cragie house , and thus it stands even in the index , which also gives
Whiteman	PERSON	for Whitman , and is further vitiated by unalphabetic arrangement .

		Page 247 con - tains a jumbling of lines , or an insertion of foreign matter , that makes nonsense .

		Absolute accuracy is not expected in a volume of ram - bling reminiscences ; but it is desirable that it shall be capable of being read without stum - bling .

		The portraits are many and good , and the typography is luxurious in its generous size and open arrangement .

		The Search for the AVesterx Sea .

		*
Canada	LOCATION	is charged with new energy ; a new spirit is animating her .

		Thousands of emigrants have been attracted to her shores and are settling upon the great plains of her
Greater Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		She is building railroads ; she is planning a deep waterway system to the sea .

		This new energy is not exhausted in the pursuit of material advan - tages ; it has infused itself into the spirit of scholarship as well .

		The group of students who have been educated at Canadian and foreign universities are filled with enthusiasm for their fatherland , and are making themselves a power in the world of science and letters .

		Particularly is this the case in the field of history .

		The recent reorganization of the
Canadian Archives	ORGANIZATION	is a sign of this vita nuova .

		The enterprise for which that institution stands has attracted the best minds of
Canada	LOCATION	; systematic efforts are being made to gather into the new building erected by the government all the material that bears upon the past of the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	, and the institu - tion is becoming more and more the centre of research in Canadian history .

		Mr.
Burpee	PERSON	's volume upon the search for the path westward to the sea is undoubtedly inspired by this new life .

		Its contents will attract the attention of all those who are interested in the
Canadian Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, whether that interest is scientific , commercial , or otherwise ; for it is the first adequate and scientific treatment of that won - derful story of the western fur-traders who , in their search for gain and their love of adventure , penetrated mile by mile along the water-courses until the foot of the mountains were reached : and then , led on by their enthusiasm , crossed the rocky peaks and canoed down the rivers to the
Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	.

		The attention of the European world was first called to the
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	by the explorer after * The Search fob the Western Sea .

		14 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, whom it was named , and the first interest in that body of water was inspired by the hope of finding an open waterway through the continent of
America	LOCATION	to the Indies .

		It was not until the
eighteenth century	DATE	was almost ended that this hope was entirely abandoned .

		Mr.
Burpee	PERSON	has traced in a careful and scholarly manner the various enterprises , from the time of
Henry Hudson	PERSON	to the appearance of those volumes by
Arthur Dobbs	PERSON	which were written for the pur - pose of arousing an interest on the part of the public in an enterprise which was already known to be hopeless .

		If one desires to trace the history of this search , as undertaken by the Company of the Merchants of the
London	LOCATION	Discoverers of the
Northwest Passage	ORGANIZATION	, or of the
Hudson Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	, to follow the incidents that occurred in the voyages of such men as
Hudson	LOCATION	, Button ,
Baffin	LOCATION	,
Fox	ORGANIZATION	,
Hull	PERSON	, and
James	PERSON	, it will be impos - sible to find a more satisfactory work than this by Mr.
Burpee	PERSON	.

		A second phase of the search opened when the
Hudson Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	and its agents began to explore the courses of the rivers .

		Strangely enough , the men who controlled the
Hudson Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	realized only very late in the life of that company the necessity of sending their agents into the interior .

		For years they lived in the hope that the Indians from the far West would come to the seacoast in order to purchase their wares .

		Their earlier explorations were undertaken by their traders almost independently , and largely on account of their love of adventure .

		Later , the success of their rivals from the French colony of Nouvelle-France , who were the first to reach the region around
Lake Winnipeg	LOCATION	, aroused the English company .

		These earlier explorations of the
Hudson Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	are carefully described by Mr.
Burpee	PERSON	.

		Thus he traces the wanderings of
Henry Kellsey	PERSON	, and attempts to fix definitely the path by which that wandergeist penetrated into the interior .

		More successful is his account of
Anthony Hendry	PERSON	, because the material for tracing the path of this first Englishman to reach the
Saskatchewan	LOCATION	is more ample .

		He has followed step by step the course of
Samuel Hearne	PERSON	, who found the path northward to the
Coppermine River	LOCATION	, along which Sir
John Franklin	PERSON	was to pass many years later .

		Having discussed in the first part the enter - prises of the English from
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	, Mr.
Burpee	PERSON	turns to the French discoveries along what he calls the '' southern gateway , '' which leads from the
St. Lawrence	ORGANIZATION	and the
Great Lakes	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was through this gateway that the search for the western sea was to be successful , for the only route to that will-o-the-wisp of so many voyagers was along the network of inter - nal waterways across a wide continent .

		Mr.
Burpee	PERSON	does not repeat the often told story of the early discoveries of
Champlain	LOCATION	, but begins his continuous narrative with the search beyond the Great Lakes .

		From these internal seas the French penetrated to the
Greater Northwest	ORGANIZATION	and reached the waters that flow into
Lake Winnipeg	LOCATION	.

		Without doubt , the most interest - ing chapter in the book is that devoted to the wanderings of the most daring explorer of all the pioneers -- the Frenchman La Verendrye , who was the first of Europeans to catch sight of the
Rocky Mountains	ORGANIZATION	.

		The material illus - trating his explorations has been gone over with great care by Mr.
Burpee	PERSON	, and his account will stand as one of the most authoritative that has yet been written .

		When , by the Treaty of
Paris	LOCATION	, in
1763	DATE	,
France	LOCATION	withdrew from
North America	LOCATION	and gave up to her English rivals Nouvelle-France and the country east of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, the knowl - edge of the West that had been gained by the French voyageurs and coureurs de bois became a part of the British acquisitions .

		From this time onward , however , the French Canadians were the able guides of the English explorers .

		The British merchants followed rapidly on the footsteps of their English soldiers in taking possession of the field .

		Alexander Henry ac - tually reached
Mackinac	LOCATION	earlier than the British soldiers , and was soon ready to push farther westward .


Jonathan Carver	PERSON	, whose credit as explorer is about as suspicious as that of Father Hennepin , aroused the interest of the English by printing his travels ; and this book inspired many of his readers with the hope of reaching the
Pacific	LOCATION	by the new passage .

		The
Hudson Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	, hitherto satisfied with its few expeditions into the interior , was aroused to new vigor , first by the independent traders from
Montreal	LOCATION	, and then by the association of these traders into the
Northwest Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		This new company , founded in
1785	DATE	, contained men of tremendous enterprise , ability , and daring , -- such as
Peter Pond	PERSON	,
Alexander Henry	PERSON	, and the
Mackenzies	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was one of these last named ,
Alexander Mackenzie	PERSON	, who was finally to com - plete the exploration and reach the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		The search was then ended .

		Trade and love of adventure had been the motives that had led generations of explorers westward until the goal was reached .

		On the whole , great praise can be given to Mr.

Burpee	ORGANIZATION	's narrative , and the scholar will unques - tionably turn to this volume for an authoritative statement of what actually occurred during any one of these numerous explorations .

		Unfor - tunately , however , the scholar will look in vain for references in the footnotes .

		Here and there Mr.
Burpee	PERSON	has indicated the source from which he has drawn his story ; but only occasionally .

		For the most part the reader is left to infer that he has gathered his material from manuscript journals or printed material , but is rarely given the satisfaction of knowing exactly what these are or where they are to be found .

		It is true that Mr.
Burpee	PERSON	furnishes at the close of the volume a bibliography that will be found very useful to the student of this subject , but it is hardly sufficient to excuse this conspicuous neglect .

		The style of the narrative is not what would be called u animated . ''

		In fact , it moves along so quietly that one finds it occasionally monot - onous ; but possibly it is this particular quality that gives us the feeling that we are reading the work of a scholar .

		There is never any attempt to pick out dramatic incidents for their own sake , no straining to picture with the aid of the imagination a course of events that may or may not have occured .

		Mr.
Burpee	PERSON	has stuck to the texts which he has used , and the truth of his narrative is his goal .

		in realizing them .

		It was Beethoven who came , not only as the innovator , but also as the man who was to understand and to fulfil .

		Whatever form of music he touched , he enlarged and car - ried forward .

		The profound seriousness of his character appeared in his epoch-making produc - tions .

		With the chord of E-flat major , struck by the full orchestra , which opens the '' Simf onia Eroica , '' the battle with the old was declared and the victory of the new was assured .

		Although
Beethoven	PERSON	lived in close , association with the titled and the great , he was no courtier ; the self - educated hero recognized the value of his work , and had small reverence for temporalities that could but indifferently justify themselves before his imperious demand of use and service .

		They spent a whole anxious night with him once in the vain attempt to persuade him to make some changes in his '' Fidelio . ''

		If music has now everywhere found a recognition as a deeply intentioned art , the result is largely due to this man who gave to it the whole of his life and effort .

		It was the great age of
Germany	LOCATION	in all ways except the political .

		The last feverish years of Xapoleon were disturbing
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The com - poser at first looked upon him as the represen - tative of the republican spirit ; but with the revelation of his true character Beethoven strongly expressed his disappointment and ab - horrence .

		In literature he had as contempo - raries and co-workers
Schiller	PERSON	and Goethe ; in philosophy he found himself in association with
Kant	PERSON	and
Hegel	PERSON	; the Oriental world was reopened and began to pour her hoarded trea - sures into the lap of
Europe	LOCATION	;
Lessing	PERSON	and the Schlegels had given criticism a genuine scientific character ; Homer and Shakespeare and
Cal	LOCATION	- deron and
Dante	PERSON	were made accessible in trans - lations that have hardly been equalled since ; history and science were making similar ad - vances .

		Beethoven 's education had been of the most meagre kind , but , like Shakespeare , he made up for it by a remarkable capacity of intuitive understanding and a limitless power of absorption .

		The ideas of
Europe	LOCATION	were teeming in his brain , and the resources of his art found development in the storm and stress of expres - sion .

		He pondered his writings with immense care ; he composed with extraordinary energy ; he was an unsurpassed improvisator on the piano or organ ; but his pieces were elaborated with extreme caution , and long periods of time elapsed before he found them suitable for public accept - ance .

		The heroic , the normal , the transcen - dental , in life and thought , were his assured 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, dwelling-place ; and his music is the wittiest and the wisest yet given to the world .

		Beethoven had a tormented time in his daily living ; he was not well equipped to battle with the usual exigencies that confront a man in the practical sphere .

		His family was a care and trial to him ; he met with the usual indifference to his purposes , and a remarkable amount of in - gratitude ; he found himself unable to enter upon a settled and regular existence .

		He spent most of his life in
Vienna	LOCATION	, with a few journeys to other large cities of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		He had the recognition and admiration of the great - persons of his time .

		He was seen to be one of the excep - tional leaders .

		He had the gift of friendships , although these were not undisturbed by tem - pests .

		He has left an imperishable heritage , and the world has grown better because he has lived in it .

		The new edition of the letters of Beethoven in two sumptuous volumes is assuredly a final and authoritative one .

		Dr.
A. C. Kalischer	PERSON	, of
Berlin	LOCATION	, the editor and compiler , makes the fol - lowing remarkable statement : '' There are many new letters printed here for the first time , some of exceptional length ; and they show the composer to us under new aspects .

		The edition is a crit - ical one .

		By that I mean that it was my chief aim to see that the text was pure .

		For that purpose it was necessary to consult as many original letters as possible , a task on which I have been engaged for a good twenty years .

		During the time I have examined over six hun - dred autograph letters , and compared them with printed editions , and then made corrections .

		Taking everything into account -- style , grammar , orthography , and punct - uation -- - I have the astounding declaration to make ,
viz.	LOCATION	, that of all the editors of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	's letters , none has reproduced quite correctly any of the original letters which I have examined .

		Of all editors , likewise copy - ists of Beethoven letters ,
Anton Schindler	PERSON	and
Otto Jahn	PERSON	were the most careful .

		In the preparation of a critical edition , the great collection of letters of
Beetho	LOCATION	- ven copied by
Otto Jahn	PERSON	-LRB- now in the
Royal Library	ORGANIZATION	of
Berlin	LOCATION	-RRB- is of immense advantage . ''

		There are presented in the Kalischer edition twelve hundred and twenty documents ; these are of course principally letters , authenticated to the uttermost , and accompanied by copious annotations and explanations , giving the present place and ownership of the letters , clearing up obscurities and allusions , and connecting them with the events in the author 's career which gave them birth .

		The Royal Library of
Berlin	LOCATION	, the
Gesellschaft	ORGANIZATION	der Musikfreunde and the
Stadt	PERSON	- bibliothek of
Vienna	LOCATION	, the music firms of
Breit	PERSON	- kopf and
Haertel	PERSON	and
Peters	PERSON	at
Leipsic	LOCATION	, and
Schott	PERSON	and Sons at
Mainz	LOCATION	, and many private collectors , have rendered Dr.
Kalischer	PERSON	liberal assistance .

		He is intimately acquainted with all sides of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	's life and work , and is admirably equipped to expound the letters , which are often enigmatical and abound in pecu - liarities that call for elucidation .

		The letters are exceedingly varied and indi - vidual .

		Beethoven was in no sense a model letter-writter .

		The idea of the publication of his letters no more came into his head than it does into ours when we rapidly throw off a short effu - sion to one of our friends .

		He was not a literary man like
Wagner	PERSON	, his successor .

		These letters are the immediate expression of his feelings and opinions at the time , and therefore as vital as so much conversation .

		The expression is often loose and sometimes obscure ; he had an idiom peculiar to himself .

		They are sufficiently frank and delightfully contradictory ; he can call a man a rascal in one outburst of feeling , and then be quite complimentary to him in another .

		He had a strange and humorous faculty of punning , some of these efforts verging on the impossible .

		The letters make a running commentary on their author 's life ; and in reading them through in their present chronological arrangement , there rises up vividly before us the picture of the man and his environment , his arduous struggles , his impetuous determinations to free himself from every sort of bondage , his recognition of his place and worth .

		Yet the reserve of the man rarely allows him to reveal the deepest parts of his nature ; some of them belong to the love - episodes of his career , which terminated disas - trously , and some of them deal with his art .

		He had an artists admiration for his predecessors .

		He calls Bach '' the forefather of harmony , '' and of
Handel	ORGANIZATION	,
Haydn	PERSON	,
Mozart	PERSON	, he says : '' Do not snatch the laurel wreaths from them ; they are entitled to them , as yet I am not . ''

		Still , he could say of ''
Don Juan	PERSON	'' that the music was degraded by the scandalous subject .

		There are letters written to the famous people of the time , to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, the
Cardinal Archduke Rudolph	PERSON	, an intimate friend , to the Orientalist , Von Hammer-Purgstal , to the poet ,
Grillparzer	PERSON	, to
Bettina von Arnim	PERSON	, to Sir
George Smart	PERSON	in
London	LOCATION	, to
Theodor Koerner	PERSON	.

		In one of the letters he makes this utterance on art : `` Continue ; do not only practise art , but get at the heart of it ; this it deserves , for only art and science raise man to the God-head .

		The true artist is not proud , he unfortunately sees that art has no limits ; he feels darkly how far he is from the goal ; and though he may be admired by others , he is sad not to have reached that point to which his better genius only appears as a dis - tant , guiding sun .

		I would , perhaps , rather come to you and your people , than to many rich folk , who dis - play inward poverty .

		If one day I should come to H. , I will come to you , to your house ; I know no other

		THE DIAL 17 excellences in man than those which cause him to rank among better men ; where I find this , there is my home . ''

		Here is a piecfe of musical criticism : '' I heartily rejoice in the same opinion which you share with me in regard to the terms indicating time - measure , which have been handed down to us from the barbarous period of music .

		For , only to name one thing , what can be more senseless than allegro , which , once for all , means merry , and how far-off are we fre - quently from such conception of this time-measure , in that the music itself expresses something quite contrary to the term .

		So far as the four principal movements are concerned , but which are far from having the im - portance of the four winds , we consider them last .

		It is another matter with words indicating the character of a piece ; these we can not give up , as time refers rather to the body , whereas these are already themselves related to the soul of the piece . ''

		Of his deafness , which came upon him so early and which left to him only an inner hearing of his compositions , he writes : '' O ye men who regard me or declare me to be malig - nant , stubborn or cynical , how unjust are ye towards me !

		You do not know the secret cause of my seeming so .

		From childhood onward , my heart and mind prompted me to be kind and tender , and I was ever iuclined to accomplish great deeds .

		But only think that during the last six years , I have been in a wretched condition , rendered worse by unintelligent physicians .

		Deceived from year to year with hopes of improvement , and then finally forced to the prospect of lasting infirmity -LRB- which may last for years , or even be totally incurable -RRB- , born with a fiery , active temperament , even susceptive of the diversities of society , 1 had soon to retire from the world , to live a solitary life .

		At times , even , I endeavored to forget all this ; but how harshly was I driven back by the redoubled experience of my bad hearing .

		Yet it was not possible for me to say to men : Speak louder , shout , for I am deaf .

		Alas !

		how could I declare the weakness of a sense which in me ought to be more acute than in others -- a sense which formerly I possessed in highest perfection , a perfection which few in my profession enjoy , or ever have enjoyed ; no , I can - not do it .

		Forgive , therefore , if you see me withdraw , when 1 would willingly mix with you . ''

		For students of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, this edition of the letters is now the only one .

		Dr.
Kalischer	PERSON	calls it a complete edition -- meaning , as he explains , that he has given all the letters contained in other editions , together with many additional ones now printed for the first time .

		His anno - tations and commentary give his work the char - acter of a biography , and it is brought up to date .

		These volumes belong in the same cate - gory with those of
Thayer	PERSON	, the American author of the monumental account of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		The translation , made by Mr.
J. S. Shedlock	PERSON	, is very well done ; it reproduces the idiom of the original , the irregularities of the style , its vehemence and humor , even the astonishing puns as far as anyone can .

		The translator also fur - nishes a valuable Introduction .

		There are two good indexes .

		Many portraits of the composer at different periods of his life are inserted , and facsimiles of the manuscripts of his famous works are given , as also of the letters .

		The publishers have done their part well ; the volumes are superb specimens of print and binding .

		In fact , with
Thayer	PERSON	, with
Marx	PERSON	, and with the present publication , one will have a good apparatus for the study of the unique and illustrious musician 's life and achievements .

		Social , axd Bi rgnrase Life of Anxtext
Rome	LOCATION	.

		* The writer of a book on the social life of the past is exposed to a thorough testing of his ability and character .

		In the first place , it is desperately difficult to acquire a satisfactory knowledge of the social life of any period , so there arises the temptation to substitute the probable for the reliable .

		And even when this fundamental difficulty has been painfully over - come , there remains the enticement to command attention by painting the social picture strik - ingly like our own day , or in striking contrast thereto , or at any rate strikingly something .

		It is hard to paint in calm and serene accuracy , when the public eye can be caught and held by a deviation of the brush so slight as to seem almost pardonable .

		For example , in dealing with slavery , we have seen in our own age what a tremendous effect a writer may produce by dwelling upon the more emotional phases of the subject .

		Nor is it at all unfair to set forth the ter - rible physical sufferings and mental anguish of the slave ; it is only a question of emphasis .

		Yet in an historical treatise it is not the part of san - ity to give twenty pages to the horrors of the dungeon or the flogging-post , and a single paragraph to the economic aspects of slavery ; although the average reader , and even the average author , is prone to find more interest in the less balanced treatment .

		Similarly , in the matter of food and drink the much quoted impossible table dainties of an Apicius are far more alluring than the humble grain and garden-truck on which Gaivs and Gaia , or roughly the whole Italian nation , regularly subsisted .

		It will take many volumes of sane scholarship , and many years must be spent in popularizing results , before the general concep - * Social Life at

		For this reason one will welcome every publi - cation on this topic that is marked by sound knowledge , by clarity of presentation , and by freedom from extravagance .

		Of late , Roman history has felt the effects of the general tendency to emphasize the economic and sociological sides of historical study ; and our libraries have been enriched by some excellent studies of life under the

		But the first century b. c , prior to the accession of
Augustus	LOCATION	, has been comparatively slighted , despite the existence of such a stimulating and delightful introduction as
Boissier	PERSON	's Cicero et ses amis .

		Some explanation of this may be found in the obvious importance of the political history , which has proved so engrossing as to bring about the neglect of the social side where it did not bear very directly on the public life .

		Toward the remedying of this neglect Professor
Fowler	PERSON	has contributed an important volume , wherein he essays to tell quce vita , qui mores fuerint in the days of the great orator .

		A treatise of this nature falls into rather natural divisions , and in our volume we find eleven chapters with such captions as '' The Lower Population , '' `` The Daily Life of the Well-to-do , '' `` The Slave Population , '' and `` Religion . ''

		Of these divisions , the third , which treats of '' The Men of Business and their Methods , '' will probably seem the freshest to most readers .

		The
first three decades of the second century	DATE	b. c. witnessed a tremendous in - pouring of wealth into the city on the Tiber .

		The war indemnities of
Carthage	LOCATION	and other conquered states , the booty from the victorious compaigns , the produce of the Spanish mines , and other sources of wealth , must have con - tributed millions upon millions of money .

		In 167 b. c. the Roman citizen was freed from the property tax .

		And the governmental prosperity was reflected in the capitalistic possibilities .

		The age of speculation and colossal fortunes was at hand .

		In a few decades there was found a Crassus with about a
million dollars	MONEY	invested in land alone , although that was only a tiny part of his possessions ; and
Plutarch	PERSON	has left a sin - gularly interesting account of one source of this magnate 's wealth : `` Observing -LSB- in
Sulla	LOCATION	's time -RSB- the accidents that were familiar at
Rome	LOCATION	, conflagrations and tumbling down of houses owing to their weight and crowded state , he bought slaves who were architects and builders .

		Hav - ing collected these to the number of more than five hun - dred , it was his practice to buy up houses on fire , and houses next to those on fire : for the owners , frightened and anxious , would sell them cheap .

		And thus the greater part of
Rome	LOCATION	fell into the hands of Crassus . ''

		Most fortunes , however , were amassed by means much less picturesque .

		Ordinary business had grown to an enormous scale ; and the shrewd man had abundant opportunity .

		Food for hun - dreds of thousands of mouths had to be brought to
Rome	LOCATION	and .

		distributed ; marine traffic proved extremely lucrative when the risks were reduced by a rough system of mutual insurance ; taxes had to be collected , and , like other public busi - ness , the collecting was done by contract ; all the activities of banking were open .

		In short , there were all the necessities and opportunities of a huge city that was the opulent mistress of the world about the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	.

		The facilities for credit and for the transfer - ence of money are decidedly surprising to the reader whose knowledge of financial matters is practical rather than historical .

		The Roman argentarius would not only pay money on a written order , but would issue a letter of credit valid in distant cities .

		The example always referred to is the banker who provided for
Cicero	ORGANIZATION	's son , when he went to spend his student days at the
University of Athens	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the matter of debt the standing instance is
Julius Caesar	PERSON	, who seems to have amassed a debt of nearly a million and a half dollars while he was still a youth .

		Nor may this be attributed solely to the genius of this famous borrower ; for there were bankers who were lending on a large scale , and any '' respectable '' citizen could borrow freely without the least trouble .

		Sometimes , indeed , lending became a mere gamble , as may be most easily seen in an extreme case .

		Rabi - rius was a financier of the '' high '' type , dealing in the stock of the large tax-farming companies and lending money to municipalities as well as to individuals .

		Among his debtors was
Ptolemy Auletes	PERSON	, King of
Egypt	LOCATION	, who was driven from his throne .

		But
Rabirius	PERSON	was willing to gamble on his restoration ; and not only continued to make loans himself , but also to recommend the venture to other financiers .

		Eventually , polit - ical pressure was called into play , with the result that the royal debtor was placed once more in control of the Egyptian treasury .

		But straight - way he turned upon his hapless creditor , who was fortunate to escape to
Italy	LOCATION	with his life .

		Even the most advanced form of '' insurance '' against the result of elections can hardly par - allel this remarkable instance .

		Herewith we have stumbled upon the inter - ference of the capitalist in government ; and this became a persistent menace , particularly in the
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 19 administration of the provinces .

		At the worst , the abuses were simply terrible .

		At the best , the large question of the financial dependence on the provinces was a matter of deep concern : and we may quote the words spoken by
Cicero	PERSON	when he was pleading for an effective campaign against Mithridates in
Asia	LOCATION	. ''

		And believe me -LRB- though you know it well enough -RRB- that the whole system of credit and finance which is carried on here at
Rome	LOCATION	in the Forum , is inextricably bound up with the revenues of the Asiatic province .

		If those revenues are destroyed , our whole system of credit will come down with a crash . ''

		We may not carry the thought further ; but here the orator has voiced a large part of the explanation of the two centuries of occidental history .

		Fortunately ,
Rome	LOCATION	managed to grope along until the strong rule of the early Empire brought some sort of solution .

		Of the remaining chapters of Professor
Fowler	PERSON	's interesting book we may notice only one , and that with the utmost brevity ; but it is worth pointing out that '' Marriage and the Roman Lady '' may be accepted as a concise and clear statement of a question not seldom mis - understood .

		Our author knows that there were Clodias and other large-eyed ladies at
Rome	LOCATION	; that passionate love and serious marriage were distinctly dissevered ; that most men and a grow - ing number of women felt no final obligation toward conjugal fidelity in the strictest sense .

		But he understands withal that the family tie was still a reality to many , and that the histo - rian 's folly of believing in universal virtue is only less absurd than the folly of believing in universal vice .

		The race that still cherished the tales of Lucre tia and
Virginia	LOCATION	could not be alto - gether void of ideals of chastity and fidelity .

		And whenever the student of this period begins to breathe hard in the fetid atmosphere of a part of our evidence , he will turn with glad relief to a husband 's tribute left us by a Roman of the day , whose name was probably
Q. Lucretius Vespillo	PERSON	.

		When his wife died he recorded her story and his own touching grief on marble ; and the centuries have kindly preserved a large part 6f it for our instruction .

		On the narrative of her thrilling adventures and perils , we may not tarry , although it makes some fiction seem dull .

		But we must quote the husband 's account of her daily life and homely virtues as given in Professor
Fowler	PERSON	's paraphrase . ''

		You were a faithful wife to me , and an obedient one : you were kind and gracious , sociable and friendly : you were assiduous at your spinning -LRB- lanijicia -RRB- : you followed the religious rites of your family and state , and admitted no foreign cults or degraded magic -LRB- super - stitio -RRB- : you did not dress conspicuously , nor seek to make a display in your household arrangements .

		Your duty to our whole household was exemplary : you tended my mother as carefully as if she had been your own .

		You had innumerable other excellences , in com - mon with all other worthy matrons , but these I have mentioned were peculiarly yours . ''

		This portrait of a rare and precious woman may stand to challenge any hasty general condemna - tion of the marital life of a people so well worth understanding .

		The other sections of the book must be passed over ; but they are all carefully written , and to many will prove more interesting than the two we have mentioned above .

		For the general reader the treatment is adequate throughout ; and to the student the volume may be recom - mended just as cordially , with the suggestion that he will often find in it a starting-point rather than a resting-place .

		It is the sort of book we are glad to welcome in accordance with our opening paragraph .

		< * IX > , HERE A WELL-MEAXDfG BOOK ! ''

		In his interesting introductory essay to the new reprint of
Florio	PERSON	's Montaigne , Mr.
Thomas Seccombe	PERSON	speaks as a lover of Montaigne , but not as an idolater .

		`` Montaigne , '' he says , '' reminds us of the solitary
Robinson	PERSON	on his island , meditating always upon the same theme of the singular adventures and melancholy fate of man .

		To show us how whimsical a creature man is , how infinite in his variety and insatiable in his desires , he takes himself and exhibits the creature to us .

		He lives before us .

		He tells us what an indecent old fellow lurked behind the fur and velvet of his ceremonial manner .

		He tells us how gluttonously he ate , how he crossed himself when he yawned , said ' God be wi ' ye ! '

		when he sneezed , and how fond he was of scratching . ''

		The world had always had its frank speakers , but never , until Montaigne , a speaker whose frankness , untouched by com - punction , dealt zestfully with his own foibles .

		`` To ` pour oneself out like Old Montaigne , ' '' says Mr.
Seccombe	PERSON	, '' has become , consciously or unconsciously , the ideal of every personal writer from La Bruydre and
Pascal	PERSON	onwards .

		He has indeed cast his pollen over La Bruyere ,
Montesquieu	LOCATION	,
Rousseau	PERSON	,
Sterne	PERSON	,
Charles Lamb	PERSON	,

		20 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, after all , has the bland ingenuousness of the
Lord of Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is a radical differ - ence between the man who prattles about him - self for love of the theme , and the man who announces , '' I am about to commit an amiable indiscretion : listen and you shall hear what a sad dog I really am . ''

		The one writer who resembled Montaigne in his manner of self - revelation was Mr.
Secretary Pepys	PERSON	, who had probably never read a line of the Essays , and had no notion of writing for any eye but his own .

		Mr.
Seccombe	PERSON	's sketch of
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	's life and genius is admirable for the most part , being disfigured only by an occasional ebullience of style , and by one or two momentary debauches of metaphor , such as , '' He finds the living nerve in the old flint classics , which are to him no mere dried specimens of literary form , but human documents palpitating with life . ''

		A passage more fairly representing him would be , '' Mon - taigne possesses every quality appropriate to a great prose - writer with one single exception , the poetic quality and its accompanying gift of ideality . ''

		We do not understand Mr.
Seccombe	PERSON	to be the editor of the present text , which is a reprint of the third edition of
Florio	PERSON	-LRB- 1632 -RRB- , but he is frankly a
Florio	PERSON	partisan . ''


Florio	PERSON	's Montaigne , '' he declares , '' still ranks as the great outstanding and standard English render - ing ... the regnant Montaigne , the most pop - ular rendering in the market on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	. ''

		Whatever may be true of its market value , the supremacy of
Florio	PERSON	is hardly an acknowledged fact on other grounds .

		His Elizabethan English is often , with all its elab - oration , brilliantly faithful to the meaning of the original .

		But in a multitude of instances it expresses anything but that meaning .

		He was at all events the pioneer ; and the edition of
1603	DATE	had a further sentimental interest .

		Its effect upon Elizabethan literature was instant and powerful .

		Bacon quoted it ;
Ben Jonson	PERSON	had a copy ; and whether the Shakespeare auto - graph in the British Museum is genuine or not , the subsequent plays are full of reminiscences of the Essays .

		However , it is not the version Shakespeare knew which is now put before us in modern dress , but a later edition , much revised yet still far from perfect .

		Some
half century later	DATE	, Cotton puts forth his translation , with the admission that although he is confident he under - stands French '' as well as any man , '' he has '' sometimes been forced to grope at '' his author 's meaning .

		Sometimes he left out passages which were too much for him ; his interpolations are far fewer than
Florio	PERSON	's .

		Both
Florio	PERSON	and Cotton are , says Mr.
Seccombe	PERSON	, very inaccurate : '' No successor , however , has arisen , and we must make the best we can of them . ''

		This seems to put them in the same class , as to be taken or left in their original form .

		But in fact a num - ber of attempts have been made , with fair measure of success , to approximate a perfect version by the emendation of Cotton , -- as it stands , certainly not less a masterpiece than
Florio	PERSON	.

		Toward such a version the revisions of the Hazlitts made a good deal of progress .

		Apart from the question of accuracy , there is no ver - sion of Montaigne so delightful to read as that of the elder
Hazlitt	PERSON	.


W. Carew Hazlitt	PERSON	has , by repeated revision , produced a text no doubt greatly more accurate , but also far less spirited and idiomatic .

		However , it is certainly true that
Florio	PERSON	has a place of his own which is far more independent of revision than that of Cotton .

		He is , if noth - ing else , an Elizabethan classic ; and he is best reprinted , as in the present instance , word by word , with the old spelling , and with all the crimes upon the original frankly unavenged .

		This limited edition is beautifully made , and of those eleven hundred and fifty copies printed for sale in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	'' before the type was distributed , '' none are likely to find their way to the second-hand counters . ''

1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 21 the philosophy justifies and guides the life .

		This life springs from the lower life of the senses , and carries it forward , in a form true to both , to its final attainments .

		The spiritual life is a thoughtful , progressive , tentative one , and has room enough , motive enough , and light enough , for endless expansion .

		But this expan - sion must be supported by a rational appre - hension of its grounds ; and this apprehension is philosophy .

		The philosophy grows with the life which it expounds and by which it is expounded .

		Such a life is in the highest degree progressive , and binds together at once the reflective and the empirical world .

		Hence experience , in its individual and collective form , in its sensuous and its thoughtful possession of the world , in its outward spread and upward stretch , in its hold on earth and air by root , by stem , by tendril and by bud , is of such variety and scope as to give to the life of the spirit an endless develop - ment , and a constantly enlarged mastery of the substance and form and direction of its powers .

		An ever changeable and ministering philosophy goes with this development , shares its enlarged vision , and is close at hand to lend support to the vision of the spirit and impart to it form and foundation in its daily contact with human experience .

		The first postulate , therefore , of spiritual growth is spiritual powers : and the second pos - tulate is an intellectual activity which carries light , with increasing disclosure , along the path of progress .

		Philosophy is no mathematical for - mula , good for certain processes and to be em - ployed in one way only ; is no semi-mechanical junction of ideas , having at all times the same operation in the world of thought , and a like adaptation to all minds , but is a variable vision of each spirit as it pursues its own way , -- an adumbration of truth , a sequence of convictions which subserve the immediate purposes of life and bear it forward as a real unfolding of power for higher purposes .

		Philosophy is , like the vital principle , an indispensable presence every moment , but variable in manifestation as each new point is reached in the unfolding .

		How can such a philosophy justify itself each instant to the mind that entertains it ?

		and how can it hold its own in the presence of other thinkers ?

		The validity of such a philosophy is the vindication of our higher life .

		If there is such a life , it must have its basis in such a phil - osophy , involved or formulated .

		From the earn - est history of the human mind there has been a persistent expenditure of thought in framing such a philosophy and in urging it upon other minds ; and also an equally persistent effort by other minds in crowding it out , although the contempt they have brought to the effort has itself been only another phase of the same eter - nal explanatory process .

		Man 's life is much broader , much deeper , with much wider rela - tions , than men are prepared as yet to accept .

		AVe move but slowly toward the grand recon - ciliations of the world .

		The sensuous elements are more obvious , more immediate and universal , than the spiritual elements ; as the soil is more obtrusive and constant than are the plants that
spring	DATE	from it .

		Yet the spiritual life , the life that transcends the sensuous life , is constantly coming to birth and rising above it ; ' as the vegetable life , hardy or tender , plain or beau - tiful , common or rare , is all thrust up out of the soil as the one great storehouse of mystery .

		Men have a fondness for the mechanical , and a sense of knowledge and mastery in connection with it which often serves to veil the higher possessions and problems of life .

		Take such a doctrine as Evolution , so central in human thought : men have often made a limitation and obstacle out of it , rendering it in too rigid and narrow a fashion .

		It has become a deadlock of physical depend - ences , leaving no room for spiritual powers .

		Not till the spiritual life is found immanent in the physical process does the world become alive again , and Evolution , pressing through all inferior forms , comes to its true measurement in spiritual expression .

		A changeable philosophy not only momen - tarily justifies itself to the mind that entertains it , but makes an ever-renewed appeal to the intellectual world at large .

		We come to see that philosophy constantly errs by pushing some clues too far , and by neglecting others .

		It has not reconciled the elements of life , but has developed them separately and in antagonism to each other .

		It has found some single ray of light , planted itself in it , pursued it in its obscure development , and so mistaken it for a full illumination .

		This fundamental conception is enforced in '' The Life of the Spirit '' in its leading direc - tions -- unity and multiplicity , change and per - sistence , the outer and the inner world , truth and happiness .

		The solution in each discussion is found to emphasize this dependence of a spiritual life on the growing apprehension of the dependence of the two worlds , physical and spiritual , on each other .

		The style of the book is somewhat diffuse , but it leads us by a sure path to this fundamental notion of an expand - ing life which is mothering the world and bring - 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, ing to it a truer and more adequate philosophy .

		These discussions are sometimes obscure in phraseology , and we are compelled to overpower the immediate expression by the ruling idea .

		In this respect , the second chapter , '' Change and Persistence , '' is least satisfactory .

		But however we may trip here and there , the path becomes more and more a highway before us -- the very highway in which the human family is travelling .

		Briefs on New Books .

		It is doubtful if there is another The curious th ■ English literature who has life of
Sterne	PERSON	.

		& .

		.

		more of himseli in his works or more of his works in himself than
Laurence Sterne	PERSON	.

		To go from his books to his life is like going from one volume to another in a continuous narrative .

		We can not pretend to know either the man or his work without studying both .

		All that distinguishes the books marks the man or his associates .

		And this curious life we have now an excellent opportunity to know , as we have not known it hitherto , in Professor Cross 's '' Life and Times of
Laurence Sterne	PERSON	'' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		It is an extremely interesting narrative , as
Sterne	PERSON	moves from the obscurity of a
York	LOCATION	parish to the full blaze of
London	LOCATION	society , so that he is as well known as the prime minister , and has a letter delivered to him with only the address `` Tristram Shandy ,
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		And his friends are such remark - able persons , -- that assembly of Demoniacs , espe - cially , of whom
Hall Stevenson	PERSON	, his best friend , was the leader .

		This club was an unholy congregation of Devil-worshippers for fun .


Wilkes	PERSON	, the politician , virtually broke up the concern , when , during the invocation of his Satanic majesty , he let loose a baboon decked in the conventionial insignia of the Devil , and produced indescribable consternation among the revellers .


Sterne	PERSON	's many love affairs , from his affection for
Miss Lumley	LOCATION	, which was blighted by their marriage , to the soul-consuming passion of the dying old man for Mrs.
Draper	PERSON	, both married , -- all these are much like the affairs of the heart that we find in the pages of `` Tristram Shandy '' or '' The Sentimental Journey . ''

		They were very likely judged correctly by
Coleridge	PERSON	, who said that
Sterne	PERSON	resembled a child who just touches a hot tea - pot with trembling fingers because it has been for - bidden him .

		Professor Cross keeps from the unjust acerbity of Thackeray in treating of these delicate matters , and yet does not gloze them over as not calling for reprobation .

		It is
Sterne	PERSON	's surpassing humor that saves the books , and his '' queerness '' that puts him out of the roll of common men and keeps us from looking too closely at the deed .

		The relation of the author to his literary sources is well brought out , and yet the prime fact is never lost sight of that the residuum which gives distinction to the work is , after all ,
Sterne	PERSON	's supreme comic power .

		Professor Cross 's final judgment , that he was '' a humourist pure and simple , and nothing else , '' indi - cates his weakness as well as his strength .

		Even so scholastic a title as '' A Inv ^ TZ ^ .

		Pluralistic Universe '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- will not weaken the impulse that goes out to welcome any pages written by Professor
William James	PERSON	.

		The volume forms the
Hibbert	PERSON	Lectures given at
Manchester College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, last year , and requires for the patient and technical comprehension the devotion to philosophic subtlety that the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	tradition supports .

		Yet the manner is thoroughly American , and must have seemed most unconventional to the older academic usage .

		The central concern of the philosophy , that moves swiftly , even jauntily , ` twixt heaven and earth , is the framing of some concept that will impart rationality to the cosmic creation and satisfaction to the human specta - tor and sharer of the worldly destiny .

		More speci - fically , it becomes a protracted contest between the demands of the absolute and the adequacy of the vital illumination of experience ; and yet , more concretely , it becomes a direct competition between the sover - eignty of the logic-bound intellect and the demands of the eager emotions .

		Professor
James	PERSON	finds no help and much confusion in the absolute , and finds the very essence of all that is significant and vital in the changing stream of experience .

		His most serious skepticism is of the commanding claim of the reason in its opposition to the will to believe ; and his arraignment of the vices of the philosophers is just this abuse of intellectualism , which renders them unresponsive to the real meaning of experience , whose formal outline , like men of straw , they find inadequate to their rational and ethical needs .

		Into this type of philosophical nicety , as into matters of artistic technique , only the professional will care or dare to follow ; and the discerning and interested amateur , as he follows the conversation or the ex - hibition with appreciation and respect , is peculiarly grateful for the illuminating and refreshing personal touches of the expositor .

		The hearers of Professor
James	PERSON	doubtless had this advantage to a greater extent than his readers ; but the latter will be repaid for the effort to secure an intelligent insight into the Jamesian point of view .

		Describing the rise of the drop-curtain and the beginning of the varied entertainment , the author writes : ''

		Here beginneth the first ` boilesque , ' -- to endure full sixty minutes . ''

		The misuse of ■ decimate '' hardly calls for serious censure in com - position that strains for lively picturesqueness rather than for correctness ; yet the book might have been written effectively and at the same time with a little less of appeal to a low standard of literary taste .

		All this makes for a certain realism in considering the affairs of our mental household that is helpful ; it prevents romancing in the field of immature speculation : and it discourages mere impressionism , which is hardly compatible with the careful analysis that alone yields the useful type 24 THE DIAL -LSB-
July	DATE	of fact .

		Yet withal it does not subordinate fact to principle , but accumulates and explains facts in the interests of the principles which are the chief concern alike of the man of affairs and of the student .

		The volume before us is a serviceable approach to this desirable end .

		His recent decora - tion by the Emperor of
Japan	LOCATION	was a striking proof that his influence extends even to the antipodes .

		Another tribute of respect reaches him at this memo - rable period of his life in the form of a brief biog - raphy , with appreciative comments on his services to education and the higher life , from the pen of Dr.
Eugen Kuehneman	PERSON	, professor of philosophy at
Breslau University	ORGANIZATION	, and twice within the last three years interchange professor at Harvard . ''


Charles W. Eliot	PERSON	, President of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
May 19	DATE	,
1869-May 19 , 1909	DATE	-RRB- '' is a thin octavo -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- with frontispiece portrait of its subject , and done into English by the author 's friend , Dr.
A. W. Boesche	PERSON	, instructor in German at
Harvard	LOCATION	.

		The original appears in the
May	DATE	and
June	DATE	numbers of the
Deutsche Rundschau	ORGANIZATION	.

		The interest of the pro- duction , to us who are already familiar with Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's life-history and work and ideals , lies in its revelation of a cordial and intelligent appreciation of American educational methods as illustrated by the forty years of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	's development under its late chief executive .

		Incidental comparisons and contrasts with German methods and ideals impart additional interest to the author 's chapters .

		The book is an important memorial of the Eliot regime .

		Typical old The passing of the genuine Yan - worthies of kee , -- shrewd , witty , resourceful ,
New Bedford	LOCATION	.

		mU ch adicted to swapping horses and stories , and finding in a jack-knife and a pine stick a never-failing solace and innocent distraction , -- is to be regretted by lovers of the idiosyncratic in human character .

		The gathering together of the racy anecdotes and fading memories of typical old
New Bedford	ORGANIZATION	worthies -LRB- and unworthies -RRB- in a volume entitled '' In Whaling Days '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is to be credited to an unknown editorial hand acting in behalf of the late
Howland Tripp	PERSON	, whose literary aspirations and activities are briefly noticed in an introductory chapter .

		Mr.
Tripp	PERSON	appears to have been a diligent student of human nature in its hum - bler types , and to have recovered from that insatiate past which is ever devouring the present a multi - tude of personal anecdotes and character-sketches that are well calculated to amuse the lover of homely
New England	LOCATION	stories .

		His chapters have such alluring headings as these : `` A Town Meeting Episode , '' ''
Peanut Jim	PERSON	, '' '' A Skim-milk Incident , '' '' The First Tale of
Phineas Foodie	PERSON	, '' '' How
Jerry Went	PERSON	to
Boston	LOCATION	, '' and '' A Grandfather 's Advice . ''

		The whaling element denoted by the title is all but lacking in the book , but the word serves well enough to indicate the time of the occurrences it chronicles .

		A few of the author 's poems , on simple themes but of excellent workmanship , conclude this posthumous edition of his writings .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Messrs.
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	publish a new edition of
Motley	ORGANIZATION	's '' History of the
United Netherlands	LOCATION	, '' four volumes in two at a very moderate price .

		The present publication should bring to this standard work an acces - sion of many new readers .

		A new and revised edition of '' Practical Golf , '' by Mr.
Wallis J. Travis	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are new chapters on '' hazards '' and aluminum clubs , and the photographic illustrations are numerous and instructive .

		Dr.
Samuel McComb	PERSON	, Associate Director of the
Emmanuel Church	ORGANIZATION	, issues \ mder the title '' The Power of Self-Suggestion '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- a small vol - ume containing an address , which reviews in the spirit of the movement connected with that church the varie - ties of aid to be derived from a vigorous and confident appeal to the best within one . ''


London	LOCATION	's Lure , '' compiled by Miss
Helen	PERSON	and Mr.
Lewis Melville	PERSON	, is an anthology of brief passages in prose and verse , classified with more than ordinary intelligence , relating to the great city , its sights and scenes , its denizens , and its natural beauties .

		A great number of authors have been drawn upon for this attractive little book , which is published by the Mac - millan Co. . ''

		The New International Year Book '' for
1908	DATE	is published uniform with '' The New International Ency - clopaedia '' by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and is edited by Messrs.
Frank Moore Colby	PERSON	and
Allen Leon Churchill	PERSON	.

		This is the second annual issue of this series , which fol - lowed the older series after a gap of five years .

		We hope that support will not be lacking for the enterprise now resumed .

		It is so valuable for general reference that we can hardly believe that it will not command the sale necessary for its continued publication .

		The whole work is admirably done .

		Mr.
Colby	PERSON	's name alone is a guaranty of thoroughness and accuracy , while the list of his associated contributors is of a nature to command the respect of those who know .

		Miss
Mary E. Burt	PERSON	has done much useful work in the popularization of good literature for children 's reading , and not the least of her services is represented by the two volumes she has recently prepared for
Messrs. Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of the volumes is `` Kipling Stories and Poems Every Child Should Know . ''

		Miss
Burt	PERSON	's preface tartly says : '' Here are some of the Strong Hearts who , a hundred years hence , will be studied in colleges , instead of that fetich , `` The Princess , ' and in lower schools , instead of those other fetiches , diacritical marks , and the made-up ` reading-matter ' of commercial • educational houses ' ; for it is the dull product of unlit - erary minds which ' feminizes our schools , ' and not the woman teacher . ''

		Without admitting all this , we will agree that Kipling makes good reading for boys and girls of every age .

		The other volume is '' Adventures Every Child Should Know , '' and is based upon
Carlo Lorenzini	PERSON	's '' Pinocchio , '' -- a fantastical story-book for children that has been vastly popular in
Italy	LOCATION	.


1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 25 Notes .

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a text-book of Trigonometry for advanced students in schools of technology .

		It is the work of Messrs.
Arthur Graham Hall	PERSON	and
Fred Goodrich Frink	PERSON	.

		To the '' Noble Thought '' series of booklets , pub - lished by the late
Dana Estes	PERSON	, has been added '' The Thoughts of
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	Antoninus . ''

		In this case the publisher acts also as the editor .

		Volume II .

		of '' Readings in Modern European History , '' compiled by Professors
James H. Robinson	PERSON	and
Charles A. Beard	PERSON	, is now published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The extracts cover the period subsequent to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		The '' Pocket Kipling , '' with its pretty covers of flex - ible leather , now includes the volume of '' Just So Stories for Little Children , '' which should at once find its way into a few thousand more nurseries .

		Messrs.
Doubleday	PERSON	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers . ''

		Writings on
American History	ORGANIZATION	, '' the bibliography begun in
1906	DATE	, is continued for
1907	DATE	under the general editorial supervision of Professor
J. F. Jameson	PERSON	.

		The actual compiler of the volume , which is published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is Miss
Grace G. Griffin	PERSON	.

		The death of
Sarah Orne Jewett	PERSON	, on the twenty-fourth of
June	DATE	, took from us one of the most conscientious of our story-writers .

		Miss
Jewett	PERSON	was deeply rooted in the life of
New England	LOCATION	, and has pictured many of its phases with deep fidelity and nnfailing charm .

		Born in
September , 1849	DATE	, she had nearly completed her sixtieth year .

		Her first book , ''
Deephaven	ORGANIZATION	, '' was published in
1877	DATE	, since which time she has been , except for very recent years , engaged in continuous literary work .

		Among her best known books we may mention '' A Country Doctor , '' '' A
Marsh Island	LOCATION	, '' A White Heron , and Other Stories , '' '' The Country of the Pointed Firs , '' and '' The Tory Lover . ''

		She wrote a great many short stories for old and young , besides sketches of
New England	LOCATION	life and landscape , and the volume on the Normans in the '' Story of the Nations '' series .

		She was made a Doctor of Letters by
Bowdoin College	ORGANIZATION	, a graceful and deserved tribute from the ancient seat of learning in her native state of
Maine	LOCATION	.

		From the days of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle there has heen a constant succession of people trying to write the history of
England	LOCATION	, hut few have succeeded in producing anything that one is likely to read for the pleasure of doing it .

		The late
John Richard Green	PERSON	was perhaps the first man to really popularize the subject in his `` Short History of the English People . ''

		His work has been carried on by Professor
C. R. L. Fletcher	PERSON	of
Magdalen College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, whose '' Introductory History of
England	LOCATION	'' is now complete ; and offers not only to the student , but to the everyday reader as well , a brilliant picture of the growth from humble beginnings of the great nation , whose sons have determined the destiny of the North American continent .

		This work strikes an entirely new note in historical narration .

		Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	loves fairness and hates humbug and heroics , whether of the popular , the political , or the personal brand .

		He does not consider pictur - esqueness so much as character .

		He displays a lofty standard of common-sense and a love of rational righteousness , which , combined with keen critical capacity and a power of expressing himself with pregnant terseness , results in his history being not only profound in political sagacity , but extra - ordinarily bright and sparkling as a piece of liter - ature .

		In fact , though one is apt to suspect epigram and brilliancy in a historian , this work is a solid contri - bution to the subject , lightened by flashes of wit , and permeated by a generous sense of humor , in sympathy with modern methods of thought and expressed in modern language .

		The fact that the first two volumes have already taken the place of
Green	ORGANIZATION	's History in more than one of the largest Universities in the
East	LOCATION	shows that the merits of Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's work have been quickly recognized .

		BRIEFER MENTION 59 NOTES 32 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 53 Ajax defied the lightning with some sort of poetic justification ; but why should anyone wish to defy the stars ?

		They surely do not threaten us , and if in fact they control human destiny -LRB- as astrology claims -RRB- it would be futile to seek to resist their decrees .

		Nevertheless , '' defiance to the stars '' is the slogan of the newest movement in poetry -- a movement born in
Italy	LOCATION	early in the present year , and rejoicing in the name of Futurism . ''

		Erect on the pinnacle of the world we hurl forth once more our defiance to the stars ! ''

		These are the plain words which close the manifesto of the Futurists , and the entire truculent document seems to indicate that its authors mean business .

		This manifesto , which proceeds from
Milan	LOCATION	-LRB- following by a century and a year the
Milan Decree	ORGANIZATION	that helped to make world-history -RRB- , is an extremely interesting piece of writing .

		It is signed by one
Signor F. T. Marinetti	PERSON	, who edits '' Poesia , '' which is a literary review of some four years ' standing , henceforth to be the organ of the new school of literature .

		No description could do justice to the present proclamation of the Rights of Man in his character as a literary artist .

		Our own best efforts would stand in pale contrast to
Signor Marinetti	PERSON	's flamboyant and explosive diction .

		Here are a few of the features of the programme : '' We wish to sing the love of danger , the habit of energy and of daring .

		The essential elements of our poetry will be courage , audacity , and revolt .

		Literature having hitherto magnified pensive quietude , ecstasy , and slumber , we wish to exalt aggressive action , feverish insomnia , the firm step , the perilous leap , the slap and the fisticuff ... The poet must spend himself with heat , brilliance , and prodigality , to augment the enthu - siastic fervor of the primordial elements ... Poetry should be a violent assault upon unknown forces , demand - ing that they lie down at the feet of man ... We wish to glorify war -- sole hygiene of the world -- militarism , patriotism , the destructive gesture of the anarchist , the beautiful Idea that slays , and scorn for women .

		We wish to destroy museums and libraries , to combat morality , feminism , and all forms of opportunism and utilitarian cowardice . ''

		There is no doubt that literature , thus con - ceived , would no longer bear much resemblance to the domesticated product with which we are used to play , as with a tame cat .

		The household pet would renew its ancestral jungle character , 34 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, surprising us not a little by the transforma - tion .

		The plank about museums and libraries in the Futurist platform is explained with much feel - ing later on .

		Most artists chafe a little under the restraining grasp of the dead hand , however appreciative of its salutary influence ; but our fiery Futurists cast it off altogether .

		This sub - ject is treated with appropriate scorn , which is worked up into a fine frenzy at the close . ''

		We wish to free
Italy	LOCATION	from its gangrene of pro- fessors , archaeologists , ciceroni , and antiquaries ; we wish to rid her of the innumerable museums which cover her with innumerable cemeteries .

		... To admire an old picture is to pour our sentiment into a funeral urn in - stead of hurling it forth in violent gushes of action and productiveness .

		Will you thus consume your best strength in this useless admiration of the past , from which you will forcibly -LRB- forcementj come out exhausted , lessened and trampled ? ''

		Museums , libraries , and academies are the '' graveyards of lost efforts , the calvaries of cru - cified dreams , the registers of broken-down springs -LRB- elans brises -RRB- . ''

		They may serve the old and feeble after a fashion , but we , '' the young , the strong , and the living , '' will have none of them . ''

		Welcome , therefore , the good incendiaries with their sooty fingers !

		They come !

		They come !

		Set fire to the book - shelves !

		Turn the canals that they may flood the museum vaults !

		Let the glorious old can - vases float adrift !

		Seize picks and hammers !

		Sap the foundations of the venerable towns ! ''

		Thus in true Berserker spirit will the Futurist clear his path .

		Thus will he sweep away the old art , as
Nietzche	ORGANIZATION	has swept away the old morality , to make way for the new .

		It is amusing to observe the cavortings of our young lions , and to hear them roar , for we know that Bottom is their real prototype , and imagine that the most frantic among them would hesitate before giving literal effect to their threats .

		That they are young would go without saying , but they think it necessary to tell us in so many words . ''

		The oldest among us are thirty ; we thus have at least ten years in which to accomplish our task .

		When we are forty , let younger and more daring men cast us into the waste-basket like useless manuscripts .

		They will come against us from far away , from all quarters , leaping on the cadence of their first poems , clawing the air with their crooked fingers , and sniffing , at the gates of academies , the grateful savour of our putrefying minds -LRB- la bonne odeur de nos esprits pourrissants -RRB- , already dedicated to the catacombs of the library .

		But we shall not be there .

		They will find us at last on a winter 's night , in the open country , in a sad iron shed pitter-pattered by the monotonous rain , huddled round our trepidating aeroplanes , warming our hands at the miserable fire made with our present-day books flicker - ing merrily in the sparkling flight of their images .

		They will riot around us , panting with anguish and spite , and , exasperated by our proud and dauntless courage , they will rush to kill us , their hatred all the stronger be - cause their hearts will be drunk with love and admira - tion for us .

		And powerful and healthsome Injustice -LRB- la forte et la saine Injustice -RRB- will then burst radiantly in their eyes .

		For art can only be violence , cruelty , and injustice . ''

		But perhaps we have quoted enough of this turgid rodomontade .

		It ends with the phrase we have chosen for a title -- `` Erect on a pin - nacle of the world we hurl forth once more our defiance to the stars ! ''

		It is all set forth in a quadruple issue of '' Poesia , '' with a cover pic - turing the Futurist on his pinnacle , not exactly defying the stars , but slaying with his shafts the dragons of the slime .

		The contents of this extraordinary publication consist chiefly of opinions , expressed personally to the editor or through the press , concerning his new propa - ganda .

		They come from various parts of the world , and may be had in the Italian , French , Spanish , German , and English languages .

		The briefest of these opinions , which is also the most pointed , is from
M. Jules Clare	PERSON	tie , and injects a note of sanity into the discussion . ''

		Dear Poet : Do you not fear the ironical wink of the defied stars ?

		And leave us at least Montaigne -- of whom I am sure -- and
Monna Lisa	PERSON	, who can now no longer deceive anyone .

		Her smile , believe me , is a part of Futurism . ''

		A less urbane rebuke than this might not be undeserved .

		A pronouncement that declares an automobile to be a more beautiful object than the Victory of Samothrace , that derides the Gioconda as artistic aliment for doddering aesthetes only , that describes
Signor Fogazzaro	PERSON	as a poet for imbeciles , that exalts the brute in man and scorns the spiritual essence , -- such a pronouncement is fair game for any sportsman who thinks it worth his ammunition .

		But we are not disposed to go gunning for our cocky Futurists .

		After all , they are young , and much may be allowed them for that .

		Their extravagance has a nucleus of sanity , and is not much wilder than the extravagance that has accompanied many of the really important revo - lutions in taste and artistic practice .

		Revolt has always been one of the most effective agents of literary advance .

		It was revolt '' From jigging veins of rhyming mother wits And such conceits as clownage keeps in pay , '' that heralded the Elizabethan drama .

		It was revolt from artificiality and mannerism that inspired the '' Lyrical Ballads '' and renewed the youth of English poetry a century ago .

		It was revolt from the bondage of a classical tradi -
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 35 tion that informed the romantic movement in
Germany	LOCATION	and transformed the literature of that country .

		It was revolt that bore '' Hernani '' to triumph in
France	LOCATION	, and CEhlenschlager in
Denmark	LOCATION	, and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	in
Norway	LOCATION	, and the coterie of u De Nieuwe Gids '' in
Holland	LOCATION	, and Swin - burne and
Morris	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	, and
Poe	PERSON	and Whitman in
America	LOCATION	.

		Only , it is to be observed that the revolt which is mere mouthing , and does not justify itself by its artistic fruits , is of all futilities the most ridiculous .

		Let our Futurists show that they have it in them to enrich the literature of the modern world , and it will be easy to forgive the damnable faces and rhetorical contortions with which their mission is pro- claimed .

		By way of caution to any who may indulge in a too unguarded criticism of
Signor Marinetti	PERSON	and his gallant band of star-defiers , we note that the last page of '' Poesia '' contains the proces-verbal of a duel in which the editor figured three months ago , and in which his luck - less opponent received '' une blessure pene - traiite , de trois centimetres environ , a Vavant - bras droit , dans la region musculaire . ''

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A favorite
New England	LOCATION	story-teller has been taken from us , and readers of
New England	LOCATION	tales of the good old kind that numbers now but very few writers will mourn .

		Miss
Sarah Orne Jewett	PERSON	, who died at her ancestral home ,
South Berwick	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, on the twenty-fourth of last month , in the sixtieth year of her age , was educated at the
Berwick Academy	ORGANIZATION	, and received the honorary degree of
Litt	PERSON	, D. from
Bowdoin College	ORGANIZATION	.

		From her father , the late Dr.
Theodore H. Jewett	PERSON	, she derived some of those qualities that made her so successful a writer ; and it was that father whom she had chiefly in mind in writing her story of '' A Country Doctor . ''

		The opportunities she enjoyed of seeing and studying types of
New England	LOCATION	character in accompanying her father on his professional rounds must have been many , and they were put to good use .

		As early as her twentieth year she became a contributor to '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly . ''

		in whose pages the larger part of her work originally appeared .

		She tried her pen in three departments of prose literature , -- the plain
New England	LOCATION	tale , sometimes expanded to the length of a novel ; the historical romance -LRB- see '' The Tory Lover , '' one of her later books -RRB- : and the popular chronicle of historic events -LRB- '' The Story of the Normans '' -RRB- .

		But the short story of that village life with which she was so familiar called forth her best powers .

		In this she ranks not far below Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	among the dead , and Mrs.
Mary E. Wilkins Freeman	PERSON	among the living .

		The meeting of American - librarians at
Bretton Woods	ORGANIZATION	.

		N. H. .

		early this month , was the third largest in the history of the
Library Associa	LOCATION	- tion -- only
Magnolia	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- with
Boston	LOCATION	as an annex -RRB- in
1902	DATE	.

		and
Narragansett Pier	ORGANIZATION	in
1906	DATE	, having attracted larger gatherings .

		The presence of over eight hundred of the active library workers of the country attests the interest of the members in matters pertaining to their profession .

		Many able and sug - gestive papers were read , and many old and some new subjects of library administration were threshed over .

		The lights and shades of library commission work furnished material for the most popular of the meetings and discussions .

		The
National League of Library Commissions	ORGANIZATION	gave itself up to reciting and hearing the experiences , serious and laughable , of library workers in many States , from
Nebraska	LOCATION	to
Maryland	LOCATION	, and numerous traits of human nature , especially rural human nature , were amusingly illustrated by the stories of these missionaries in the cause of culture .

		This session must have offered the strongest possible contrast to that of the
Bibli	PERSON	- ographers of
America	LOCATION	, held the same day and in a sedater mood .

		A PLEASANT INCIDENT OF THE COMMENCEMENT season was the bestowal of the Litt-D .

		degree on Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	by
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	-- while the band played her '' Battle Hymn '' and all present rose to their feet in her honor .

		President
Faunce	PERSON	's well-chosen words in presenting the di - ploma were these : '' Doctor of Letters ,
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	,
Boston	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, author , philanthropist , mother , friend of the slave , the prisoner , and all who suffer , singer of the battle-hymn of freedom , allied with
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	through her distin - guished husband , allied with all educators through her faith that it is the last of life for which the first was made . ''

		Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	said of the degree conferred upon her : `` It is doubly precious to me because my grandfather received here his degree of A. B. , I can not tell when , but it was long before I was born .

		Then , too , my husband , Dr.
Howe	PERSON	, was a graduate .

		It is a most beautiful occasion , and I was indeed much pleased when the band played the ' Battle Hymn . ' ''

		Seldom has the old Baptist meeting-house at
Providence	LOCATION	, where the
Brown	PERSON	commencement exercises are held , witnessed a more noteworthy event , and never before , one can safely affirm , has it seen the decoration of so youthful a nonagenarian -- or , indeed , of any nonagenarian .

		The library training-class is doing good work .

		The educating and '' breaking in '' of appren - tices by this practical method , where the public library is large enough to afford the requisite facil - ities , and is also in constant need of new recruits to its working force , can not be too highly commended .

		As compared with that admirable institution , the library school , there is a saving of time and expense to the learner , and an avoidance of that sometimes excessive devotion to theory which a two or three 36 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, years ' course at
Albany	LOCATION	might conceivably encour - age in some zealous students .

		Local conditions and local needs are also better learned in the library training class , and greater surety of immediate employment at the end of the course may sometimes be counted on .

		The
Springfield	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library has just sent out its annual circular to
Smith	PERSON	and
Mount Holyoke	LOCATION	colleges and to local high schools , announcing the approaching examinations for admission to a training class of six , the course to cover ten months -LRB- less four weeks of vacation -RRB- and to involve forty-three hours of work each week , including two evenings .

		One month 's instruction and practice in each of the library 's several depart - ments will be given , and there will be prescribed reading as well as regular lectures or talks .

		The circular ends with the following salutary reminders and counsels : `` A love of reading is not alone suffi - cient equipment .

		A high-school education or its equivalent is regarded as the minimum requirement , and among the chief qualifications besides culture and general information are good health , earnest - ness , accuracy , and tact .

		Library work must be a vocation rather than an avocation , and makes the same demands on the applicant 's time and interest that are made by business .

		It offers a delightful field for persons who unite with culture an earnest love for work of a broadly educational and human - tiarian character . ''

		A SPECTACULAR PRESENTATION OF
SCHILLER	PERSON	'S ''
Joan	PERSON	of Arc '' was enjoyed by fifteen thousand on-lookers at the
Harvard Stadium	ORGANIZATION	on
Tuesday	DATE	evening of Commencement week .

		Three years ago the `` Agamemnon '' of iEschylus was successfully given on the same spot in the original Greek ; but on this later occasion it was wisely decided to resort to the vernacular , and accordingly Miss
Anna Swan	PERSON	- wick 's version , revised by Mr.
George Sylvester Viereck	PERSON	, was used .

		Miss
Maude Adams	PERSON	and a com - pany of players selected from Mr.
Charles Frohman	PERSON	's dramatic forces filled the various parts , and were aided by a host of well-trained supernumeraries in the battle scenes , the coronation pageant , and else - where .

		So elaborate and magnificent a presentation of this drama was surely never before seen , and may well never be seen again .

		Schiller himself could not have failed to be delighted and to pronounce it grandios in the extreme , had he been one of the vast audience ranged semi-circularly about that end or segment of the stadium appropriated to the purposes of the play .

		The leading part was well conceived and interpreted , as was to have been expected of
Miss Adams	PERSON	, and her support was good .

		The pecuniary profits of the performance go , most fittingly , to the
Germanic Museum of Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Cold storage for unused literature was the theme of an animated discussion by the
Library Association	ORGANIZATION	at its recent gathering in the
White Mountains	LOCATION	.

		Seven years ago President Eliot of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	read a paper before the Association on '' Storage Libraries , '' advocating the keeping of obsolete and other unused literature in storage .

		A different sort of storage was that advocated by Librarian
Gould	PERSON	in his address as President of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	, who presented a scheme of library coordination which would include the establishment of central storehouses of books to be loaned to out - lying libraries , thus saving much expense of dupli - cation and vastly increasing the usefulness of the smaller and poorer libraries .

		These central reser - voirs would also serve some of the purposes of clearing-houses , while each would specialize in the collecting of literary material having to do with its own region .

		A fund of a hundred thousand dollars , or perhaps more , he generously estimates as neces - sary for the establishment of one such regional library , and '' a single great gift like that which was made two or three years since for purposes of edu - cation in this country , would suffice to put the whole system in operation . ''

		-LRB- Perhaps the
Laird of Skibo	ORGANIZATION	will take note of this . -RRB-

		• • • The poet and the potentate are on the best of terms with each other as long as the man of song hymns the praises of the monarch and causes his muse to sing the divine right of kings .

		But for democratic , iconoclastic , , convention-defying poets -- especially if these poets have a keen wit and a caustic humor -- the sovereigns of the earth have small use .

		So little use , indeed , has the present German Em - peror for poetic genius which refuses to consecrate itself to the greater glory of the powers that be , that he can not abide the silent presence of such genius even in the seemingly inoffensive form of mute bust or inanimate statue .

		Accordingly , on coming into possession of the late Empress of
Austria	LOCATION	's beautiful villa at
Corfu	LOCATION	,
Kaiser Wilhelm	PERSON	makes all haste to get rid of the statue of
Heine	LOCATION	that has so long adorned it .

		The poet who has given the world those match - less '' short swallow-flights of song that dip their wings in tears and skim away '' possesses no charm to soothe the Hohenzollern breast , and away he is bundled to his
Hamburg	LOCATION	publishers , for a paltry ten thousand marks or so -- to the house that has long befriended him , and that will now , let us hope , con - tinue its protection .

		The whole incident serves as a striking fulfilment of
Heine	LOCATION	's dying prophecy : ''
Heine	PERSON	ne meurt pas come le premier venu , et les griff es du tigre survivront au tigre lui-meme . ''

		The sublimity of egotism has been attained , it would seem , by the gifted author of '' Cyrano de Bergerac . ''

		Before selling his
Paris	LOCATION	house to a banker , as he recently did ,
M. Rostand	PERSON	sealed up the door and placed a bronze tablet to mark the threshold once pressed by the foot of genius .

		All inferior mortals will henceforth enter by an unsancti - fied portal constructed in another place .

		Self-conceit like that is fairly awe-compelling .

		Even
Whistler	LOCATION	did not surpass it in his reply to an admirer who had declared that there were only two great painters ,
Velasquez	PERSON	and
Whistler	LOCATION	.

		`` Why drag in
Velas	LOCATION	-

		THE DIAL .

		demanded the great and only
Whistler	LOCATION	.

		Disraeli the inimitable is said to have remarked , without blush or tremor : '' When I want to read a good book , I write one . ''

		The delightfully caustic
Henry Clapp	PERSON	, of journalistic fame , was once asked what a certain pompous and self-satisfied clergyman , temporarily without a pulpit , was at that moment doing . ''

		He is waiting for a vacancy in the Trinity , '' was the quick rejoinder .

		Possibly the gentleman might have expressed it differently , but the reply was felt to be apt .


Charles Sumner	PERSON	displayed mag - nificent self-confidence when , speaking of certain political changes that threatened to leave him a statesman without a party , he appealed to the large audience before him and demanded : '' What , then , is to become of me ? ''

		Another statesman of splendid egotism was rather cruelly punished in a witty Tejoinder attributed to
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	.

		The victim of the retort was not present , but had been spoken of by another as not believing in the
Bible	LOCATION	. ''

		Why should he ? ''

		asked the laconic man of military deeds ; u he did n't write it . ''

		It has been held by certain worldly-wise men and women that the crime of wrong-doing is in being detected .

		One might almost maintain , in contemplating the effrontery of those who have a genius for self-conceit , and for something else as well , that the sin of egotism lies in not being able to u carry it off '' successfully .

		Critical power and creative power are , for some inscrutable reason , seldom found united in the same person .

		A painter one day caught an art - critic in the act of pointing out certain defects in one of the artist 's canvases . ''

		But you could not paint a picture to save your life , '' remonstrated the man of palette and brushes ; '' what right , then , have you to criticise the pictures of others ? ''

		The critic bided his time and invited the artist to breakfast , where he served him an egg that had outlasted its pristine freshness .

		One taste was enough to draw from the guest an expression of unfavorable com - ment . ''

		But you could not lay an egg to save your life , '' retorted the host ; '' what right , then , have you to criticize the eggs of other people 's hens ? ''

		A recent writer , who happens to be also a college instructor in English , eases his bosom of certain '' confessions , '' declaring that very few teachers in his branch of learning can write -- really write .

		They can , of course , compose a thesis or draw up a report on their work , or even review a book ; but that , he affirms , is not writing .

		The antagonism that has always existed between the man who picks to pieces and the man who puts together , and even between the corresponding tendencies in the same man , will probably continue to the end of time -- or until the analytic and the synthetic shall merge into one .

		A WELL-PATRONIZED LIBRARY FOR COLORED readers is an encouraging sign that the things of the higher life do not appeal in vain to our negro fellow-citizens .

		The public library of
Louisville	LOCATION	,
Kentucky	LOCATION	, has published a small folder that describes its recently-opened branch library for the colored race .

		There are said to be forty thousand inhabitants of this class in that city , and the library building provided for them , similar in all respects to the usual
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	branch library , cost , with its books and other equipment , nearly
forty-two thousand dollars	MONEY	.

		Before
October	DATE	of last year , when the new building was opened , the branch had been maintained for three years in temporary quarters , and had attained a circulation of almost thirty-six thousand volumes a year .

		This has now considerably increased , so that an average of more than a book a year can be credited -LRB- or charged -RRB- to each colored person .

		Whether or not it is a distinction to be proud of ,
Louisville	LOCATION	is said to be the only place in the world to have a branch public library for its colored inhabitants ; and it is already planning the establishment of another .

		Journalism as the subject of a university course promises to draw many earnest students .

		The School of Journalism connected with the Uni - versity of
Missouri	LOCATION	has finished its first year and presents some encouraging results .

		While it was at first questioned whether more than a score of would-be reporters and editors could be attracted to the course , there were actually enrolled ninety-seven students , including fourteen young women .

		Seventy - four out of this total number entered for the four years ' course , twenty-three being partial-course stu - j dents from other departments of the university .

		| The showing that these school-trained journalists will make a few years hence , in competition with those who have worked their way in the strain and stress of hard every-day `` hustle or get left , '' will be watched with interest .

		But both a priori and a posteriori reasoning would seem to warrant expecta - tion of good results from the operation of this new university department .

		The Teddy bear and the public library might seem to represent opposite extremes as sources of intellectual quickening and food for the mind .

		The
Wisconsin	LOCATION	u Library Bulletin , '' however , teaches that any such conception of their relationship is erroneous .

		Among the mentally improving games that are played , with official sanction , in the chil - dren 's room of the
Eau Claire Public Library	ORGANIZATION	are '' Toot , '' the automobile game , which is played with cards , '' Magic Hoops , '' '' Gogglebug , '' '' The Trolley Came Off , '' much enjoyed by girls , and `` Teddy Bear , '' which is thus described : '' The ' Teddy Bear ' is pinned upon the wall .

		The players , one at a time , glance at the bear , aim with the finger , close eyes , walk across the room and endeavor to touch the heart of the bear . ''

		If this demands too severe intellectual application from the little ones , there remain '' Dancing Dunces '' and '' Pop-in-taw . ''

		The public library 's sphere of usefulness appears to be unlimited .

		Having already assumed some of the functions of the kindergarten , it now usurps the 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, office of the nursery .

		Why not establish a merry - go-round and side-shows , with perhaps a menagerie and a sawdust ring , and serve some of the ends of the circus -- not peripatetic , but stationary , and open every day including
Sundays	DATE	and holidays ? ''

		Poison labels '' for library books that are not altogether trustworthy have been suggested by the inventive and resourceful librarian of the
Los Angeles Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and the suggestion has met with approval from many quarters .

		Abbott 's '' Life of
Napoleon	PERSON	, '' for example , should be conspicuously labelled for the benefit of the unwary .

		Prescott 's '' Conquest of
Mexico	LOCATION	, '' with its fascinating picture of an
Aztec Empire	ORGANIZATION	, is another book that should display cautionary signals .

		Froude 's delightful '' History of
England	LOCATION	'' might have a few of Free - man 's caustic comments pasted on the cover .

		Such bits of authoritative and unsparing criticism would thus serve their end much better than if incorporated in an annotated catalogue , which the book-borrower might not chance to see .

		In the domain of belles lettres it is not proposed to use u poison labels , '' however poisonous some of the fiction may be that occasionally creeps into even the best-regulated pub - lic library .

		The wholesomeness or injuriousness of works of the imagination is more a matter of opinion than is the accuracy or inaccuracy of a learned book .

		Some casual impressions of a modest hero were received by the hundreds of participants in two recent college commencements .

		At
Williams	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Wilfred T. Grenfell	PERSON	was made a doctor of laws , and the following week saw him receive the master - of-arts degree at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		The heartiness of the applause that greeted his appearance on both occa - sions left no doubt of the high esteem and admiration in which this man of daring deeds and consecrated life is held by the world at large .

		It is interesting to note that Dr.
Grenfell	PERSON	's first impulse to devote his life to his present work was received , as he took occasion to relate in his address at the
Williams	ORGANIZATION	alumni dinner , from some words that fell from the lips of our evangelist
Moody	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	.

		National library headquarters in
Chicago	LOCATION	will soon be counted as not the least of the quicken - ing influences that are promoting public library growth in the
Central West	LOCATION	.

		By vote of the Amer - ican
Library Association 's Executive Council	ORGANIZATION	it has finally been decided to carry out the already ex - pressed intention to transfer the headquarters from
Boston	LOCATION	to
Chicago	LOCATION	-- an intention hitherto thwarted by lack of suitable office accommodations .

		The trustees of the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	extended the offer of a large and finely arranged suite of rooms in the library building , and the offer was accepted .

		Eastern librarians regret the transfer , although many of them recognize the increased opportunities for usefulness which the new situation will furnish .

		THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TYPE IN THE WORLD .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		My attention has just been called to several com - munications , recently printed in your columns , upon the subject of type-design .

		Without illustration it is per - haps superfluous to attempt to add anything of value to the discussion , which , however , I hope may continue and spread until the type-founders awaken to many of the enormities that , in the name of improvement , they are perpetrating upon the beautiful letters of the early type - cutters .

		Mr.
Gookin	PERSON	's admirable letter expresses throughout my opinions on the subject more precisely than I can hope to do , but I wish to emphasize particularly the statement made in its concluding paragraph -- that the most beautiful types are also the easiest to read .

		I speak , of course , only of Roman letters .

		There are many exceedingly beautiful Gothic types , but to our modern eyes they are all more or less illegible .

		The world will never go back to reading black-letter , nor will any Gothics more admirable than those left us by the fifteenth century type-cutters ever be devised .

		Gothic may well be called a dead letter , so far as any future development of its forms is concerned .

		Like the cathedrals , it has been done once perfectly , and , aside from display lines , no conscious effort to revive its use in printing will ever result in more than a curiosity of book-making .

		Of the Renaissance or Roman types , then , let us con - sider the abstract legibility -- that is , of an ideal type set in an ideal manner .

		It is futile to expect any one form of letter , even in various sizes , to accommodate itself to all sorts of composition .

		Our modern demands upon type for magazine or newspaper work will seldom permit the use of an ideal letter without detriment to the page as a whole .

		The most beautifully printed magazine of the present day is probably '' The Monthly Review '' published in
London	LOCATION	; but it is a far cry from its broad pages of twelve-point Scotch type to the crowded double-column illustrated pages of most of our periodicals .

		The demands of each upon the type - designer are quite different , and must be met in quite different ways .

		It is obvious , therefore , that the laboratory tests , while doubtless interesting and instructive , will be of little practical use unless all the possible variations of letter-forms are experimented upon -- which would appear to be a task of herculean proportions .

		Inci - dentally it would be interesting to know what types have been used in determining that certain letters are '' offenders . ''

		In other words , when we speak of the alphabet whose alphabet do we mean -- Ratdolt 's or
Estienne	PERSON	's ,
Caslon	PERSON	's or
Baskerville	LOCATION	's , Euschede `` s or Bodoni 's ,
Morris	PERSON	's or
Goodhue	ORGANIZATION	's ?

		It is as profitless to discuss an alphabet , abstractly , as it would be a color .

		Concrete examples are absolutely necessary -- for a starting-point at least .

		Personally , I have not the least hesitation in choosing amongst the many admirable examples we have had given us .

		From both aesthetic and utilitarian stand - points , the Roman letter was , like the Gothic , done once , perfectly and for all time , when
Nicolas Jenson	PERSON	cut the type that appears perhaps in its greatest perfection in his ''
Eusebius	LOCATION	'' of
1470	DATE	.

		I have never seen the '' Cicero '' of the same year , but many pages of the
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 39 ''
Eusebius	LOCATION	'' are so lightly inked that the letter-forms may be examined almost as in a smoke-proof .

		After twelve years ' study of it , minute comparison with almost every other Roman letter , ancient and modern , and two or three unsuccessful attempts to reproduce its forms in modern matrices , I believe it to be at once the most beautiful and the most legible type in the world .


Modi	PERSON	- fications of it there may properly be for special purposes , and for modern readers some alteration of set and ahgnment may be desirable ; but in variety and refine - ment of form and in noble proportion , improvement of it is forever impossible .

		Compared with many another of the beautiful early types , it is , at first glance , by no means striking in appearance .

		There is an almost total absence of super - fluous or distracting features ; but this very quality of reticence is one of its chief claims to stand as the finest model upon which to base our efforts in devising new founts .

		And these new founts will , to my mind , be suc - cessful in so far as they approximate
Jenson	PERSON	's , and unsuc - cessful in proportion to their divergence .

		I naturally dissent from Mr.
McQuilkin	PERSON	's character - ization of the
Jenson	PERSON	as `` spiky '' -LRB- unless , indeed , he refers to the so-called `
Jenson	PERSON	' of the type-founders -RRB- .

		Rather does it fulfil his desire for '' a good full-bodied letter with an honest printing face . ''

		I heartily agree with his description of Old-Style as '' graceful , '' and admit cheerfully the '' high ascenders and low de - scenders '' but again differ from him on the point of '' obscure thinnesses and obtrusive thicknesses . ''

		These , I must maintain , are features of Modern Roman types in contradistinction to Old-Style .

		In comparison with the early Old-Styles , the first Modern types were lacking in purity of form and defi - cient in proportion .

		They nevertheless possessed great distinction and style , and none more than
Bodoni 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		We have gone on reproducing their more obvious or super - ficial features , or else combining them with the qualities of Old-Style , until at last most of our body types are hybrids , possessing few marks of good breeding and almost invariably wanting in that saving grace of the earlier Modern letters -- style .

		In conclusion , let me say that inasmuch as both Mr. French and Mr.
Gookin	PERSON	have done me the honor of com - mending the modification of
Caslon	PERSON	made for '' Geofroy Tory , '' it may interest them and others to know that , though set by hand , it was cast upon a type-setting machine .

		With slight modifications , machine-setting also would have been quite practicable .

		I can not think it quite so successful an experiment as they say , but it may help to prove that if the machines can not give us beautiful type , the difficulty lies somewhere else than in the mechanical department .

		`` THE LAW '' EST SHAKESPEARE 'S PLAYS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		In his latest eccentricity entitled '' Is Shakespeare Dead ? ''


Mark Twain	PERSON	is quick to believe , or to pretend to believe , that the
Stratford Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	could not have written the Shakespearean plays because he was not a lawyer .

		He finds that the author of the plays , whoever he was , was an expert in '' that wonderful trade , that complex and intricate trade , that awe-compelling trade '' -- the law .

		If he -LRB-
Mark Twain	PERSON	-RRB- were appointed arbiter to decide '' whether Shakespeare wrote Shake - speare or not , '' he '' would place before the debaters only the one question , Was
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	ever a practicing lawyer ?

		and leave everything else out . ''

		His conclu - sion of the whole matter is that '' the man who wrote
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Works knew all about law and lawyers .

		Also that the man could not have been the
Stratford Shakespeare	LOCATION	-- and was n't . ''

		Resisting the temptation to point out other weak places in the argument , -- if argument it can be called , -- I will undertake nothing more than a single comparison , handing it over to the reader without comment .

		In a thoughtful essay on '' The MakiDg of a Great Poem , '' with which Mr.
Charles W. Hodell	PERSON	concludes his scholarly study of '' The Old Yellow Book , Source of
Browning	PERSON	's ` The Ring and the Book ' '' -LRB- reviewed in The Dial for
November 16 , 1908	DATE	-RRB- , the author-editor says : '' In the legal lore and technical phraseology so abundantly displayed throughout the Poem , and especially in Books VIII .

		and IX. , the Poet evidently depended very largely upon what he found in the Book .

		This display of out-of-the - way technical lore has perhaps caused some readers to stand in awe of the learned acquirements of
Browning	PERSON	in the eccle - siastical law .

		But the study of the Book makes it evident that he learned about all of his law from the Book . ''

		Concluding this phase of his subject , the critic adds : '' We have here an interesting example of how easily and thoroughly a master artist may gain sufficient technical lore , even in a difficult field , to astonish his critics .

		And this may perhaps offer a striking truth to those who guess at
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's occupations by his chance references to tech - nical subjects , no matter how accurate they may be . ''

		WAS SWINBURNE SAVED FROM DROWNING BY MAUPASSANT ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	, in some personal recollections of Swinburne published in the
June	DATE	number of the '' Fort - nightly Review '' of
London	LOCATION	, has this to say of the English poet 's narrow escape from drowning at Etretat in
1870	DATE	: '' He was caught by the race of the tide under the Port d'Amont , because of the weakness of his stroke .

		He was pursued , floating like a Medusa with shining hair outspread , and was caught a long way out to sea , behind the
Petite Porte	ORGANIZATION	, by a yachtsman who , oddly enough , happened to be
Guy de Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	.

		I may record that , in describing this incident to me not long after it happened ,
Swinburne	PERSON	said , etc. ... These incidents are , I think , not mentioned by
Guy de Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	in his very picturesque account of the occur - rence . ''

		I happen to have at hand
Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	's account of the affair , and the two stories do not agree , -- for which one of several possible reasons , I shall not attempt to settle .

		Here is what the Frenchman says : '' ... Un matin , vers dix heures , des marins arriverent en criant qu'un nageur se noyait sous la Porte d'amont .

		Bs prirent un bateau et je les accompagnai .

		Le nageur , ignor - ant le terrible courant de maree qui passe sous cette arcade , avait ete entrained puis recueilli par une barque qui pechait derriere cette porte , appelee communement la Petite Porte . ''

Powell	PERSON	-RSB- apprit que j' avais essaye , trop tard , de porter secours a son ami ... '' Maupassant , it will be seen , expressly states that he had nothing to do , directly or indirectly , with the saving of

		Memoirs of a Many-Sided Man .

		* There are , here and there , and in every age , a few variously gifted men who do many things so extremely well that in doing each they seem to have been born and trained for that and noth - ing else .

		Such a man was the late
Nathaniel Southgate Shaler	PERSON	, whose fragment of Autobiog - raphy , ending with his coming of age , and sup - plemented by an account of his later years from the competent hand of his widow , is now pub - lished in a substantial octavo volume , with illus - trations , numerous extracts from
Shaler	PERSON	's large correspondence , and tributes from the pens of some of his many admirers and friends .

		Born in
Kentucky	LOCATION	, of good Southern and slave-holding stock , educated by himself -LRB- the best of teachers -RRB- , by a private tutor , and finally by the great
Agassiz	PERSON	and other instructors at the
Lawrence Scientific School	ORGANIZATION	, he led a life of so constant and strenuous application to enlarg - ing the bounds of human knowledge that his comparatively early death in
1906	DATE	, at the age of sixty-five , may reasonably be ascribed to the over-taxing of a frame constitutionally lacking in robustness .

		Even the briefest outline of Professor
Shaler	PERSON	's full and useful life should include some mention of his short term of service as a soldier in the field , fighting for the cause against which most of his earlier friends were enlisted .

		That he allowed no thirst for military glory to quench his ardor for scientific research is fortunate .

		He had skill in the use of arms and no lack of the fighting spirit , but higher claims prevailed .

		Of the unusual quality of his mind , many illustrations could be given .

		A striking proof of rare endowments is found in his remarkable union of memory , verbal memory even , with an early bent for original research .

		He speaks of having learned , in youth , some fifty thousand lines of poetry in various languages , a large part of which remained with him to the end .

		In those early days of restless and wide-ranging inquiry , he tells us that the abstractions of meta - physics had a peculiar fascination for him , and even the fatal charm of
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	claimed him as a willing victim .

		But his maturer judgment upon the value of metaphysics may be gathered from the following : '' The field of metaphysical speculation opened before me as a new universe ; of all the vagarious devotions * The Autobiography op

		of my childhood and youth , this took the firmest hold upon me .

		I began to read all I could of philosophers and their writings .

		The
Mercantile Library	ORGANIZATION	in
Cincinnati	LOCATION	-LSB- across the river from the
Shaler	PERSON	home in
Kentucky	LOCATION	-RSB- had many such books which I devoured .

		I recall the pleasure with which I bought a set of
G. H. Lewes	PERSON	's ' History of Philosophy , ' a rather poor book as I now see it , but then a treasure in my eyes .

		I had two German manuals , the titles of which I have forgotten .

		The curi - ous thing about this prolonged excursion is that I really got something out of it .

		I appear even to have gained an adequate idea of
Kant	PERSON	's `` Critique , ' though I doubt if I could compass it to-day without much labor .

		With all this intense interest in the speculations of men and the history of the evolutions of their systems , I had no real belief in the essential verity of them .

		They charmed me as an exercise of wits much as did chess , to which at this time and at various later periods I became addicted . ''

		The confessed weakness in
Shaler	PERSON	's educa - tional equipment lay in the field of mathematics , and he deplored to the end his ignorance of the calculus , which would have aided him in some of his researches .

		The wonder is that so active and so quickly assimilating an intelligence should not have laid hold of this branch of learn - ing , as it did of so many others .

		The account of
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	's original way of examining and instructing his pupil from
Ken	PERSON	- tucky is of exceeding interest .

		The great natur - alist affected to hold in contempt the lad 's previous acquisitions in zoology , botany , and geology , and subjected him to a rather rough and trying novitiate ; then , with a suddenness of transition that puzzled the pupil , he became most friendly and communicative , and the two entered into a sort of comradeship that proved extremely pleasant and profitable to at least the younger man , and probably to both .

		Professor
Shaler	PERSON	's various expeditions in search of knowledge , on sea and land , to glaciers and mountains and volcanoes , would fill volumes with interesting narrative and noteworthy inci - dent .

		In his early manhood he climbed Vesu - vius while it was in eruption , and is said to have been the first person to look into the crater of an active volcano .

		Such account as he gives of his exploring journey to
Anticosti	LOCATION	and Labrador shows him to have been heedless of danger when the thirst for information in matters of science was upon him .

		But the inflicting of suffering on dumb animals , even in the cause of science , was unbearable to him .

		He once felt constrained to kill a wounded seal in order to end its agony , but the creature 's face haunted him for the rest of his days , and he never again took an animal 's life . ''

		Some of my friends , '' he writes , `` esteem this fanciful softness ; it does not seem to me so , for if it were fit I would slay a man and not be troubled about it further than by the regret that
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 the conditions required the action .

		It is the sudden and brutal assault of the hunter on the unoffending creature which breeds this pain . ''

		A few more sentences from the
Anticosti	LOCATION	chap - ter will be of interest . ''

		As all those who have made hard campaigns know , discomfort , such as we became accustomed to , much lessens the love of life .

		In fact , that fancy for contin - uous existence is in some measure the product of ease and comfort , while what we call bravery is largely but merely a hard-minded state which suffering induces even where men are not clearly conscious that they are in torment ... Probably the largest profit I found in the voyage about the shores of the
St. Lawrence	ORGANIZATION	came to me from the discomfort and the danger there encoun - tered .

		Our conditions were in both these regards rather worse than those of the common fisherman ; for in addition to the labor and trials of those who go down to the sea for fish , we had to cleave to lee shores and to fight our way through the surf to study the land .

		It was very hard work in fairly hard danger ... All this was well for us , for the best you can do for a boy is to expose him to hardships which bring him nigh to death . ''

		Coming from the pen of one whose own edu - cation was gained by determined and independ - ent effort in a chosen direction , and to whom la mollesse was the most unpardonable of human weaknesses , the following remarks are worth pondering : '' Here let me turn aside for a word concerning the grim aspect of our so-called education , which makes it well-nigh impossible for our youth of the higher classes to have any intimate contacts with men who may teach him what is the real nature of his kind .

		He sees those only who are so formalized by training and the uses of society that they show him a work of art in human shape .

		He thus has to deal with his fellows in terms which are not those of real human nature , and thereby much of his own is never awakened .

		He may live through long fair - appearing years , yet fail to have the experiences neces - sary to humanize him fully .

		I have known many an ignorant sailor or backwoodsman who , because he had been brought into sympathetic contact with the primitive qualities of his kind , was humanely a better educated man than those who pride themselves on their culture .

		The gravest problem of civilization is in my opinion how we are to teach human quality in a system which tends ever more and more to hide it . ''


Shaler	PERSON	's debt of heredity to his mother was acknowledged by him to be great , and her moulding influence in his formative years was all-important .

		So manly a man 's confession of obligation to the charm and stimulus and refin - ing power of female companionship is not to be lightly dismissed .

		He says : '' I would I could have set down a fit acknowledgment of my debt through all my days to the women whose influence has entered into my life and shaped for the best whatever has developed in me .

		I feel that I can - not do this part of my task even to myself , so it will have to remain undone .

		It is , however , fit to say that it has been my good fortune from the age of fifteen years on , to be always in large measure controlled by women of high character .

		For this I am devoutly thankful ; for it kept me from the pit whereto I have seen so many go .

		While a man should be a man 's man in quality , taking his measure from his relations with his own sex , in my opinion he can not attain his full stature without the influence of women .

		Of himself alone the male human is a mere fragment of his kind ; he attains to his humanity through the shaping influence of its better half . ''

		In her book , '' The Masters of Fate , '' pub - lished three years ago , Mrs.
Shaler	PERSON	took occa - sion to present a picture of her husband battling almost daily with a fatal malady and holding death at bay month after month before the end finally came .

		His fortitude under the torment and the terror of angina pectoris , which would seize upon him in the classroom or on the lec - ture platform and compel a pause until the vital forces regained the upper hand , was something far finer than heroism in battle , because gener - ally unknown and unrecognized .

		The wife 's con - tinuation , therefore , of her husband 's unfinished life-story could not fail to be an admiring trib - ute to his many virtues , while at the same time it is , by help of numerous excerpts from letters and data from other sources , a satisfying com - pletion of the book .

		A ten-page list of her hus - band 's published writings , and twenty double - column pages of index , conclude the volume .

		The present review has touched upon but a small part of Professor
Shaler	PERSON	's earlier life , and has dwelt chiefly upon one phase of his virile per - sonality .

		The book itself , and the man 's own voluminous writings , in prose and verse , must be studied for anything like a full acquaintance with his many-sided character and varied talents .

		42 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, headlines of the daily newspaper .

		There is always some sort of ability behind a fame of this kind , but thoughtful readers hardly need be told that immediate newspaper reputation is no guarantee of thorough scholarship and reliable reasoning powers on the part of an author .

		The ordinary reader , however , will not lift an attract - ive literary cloak to hunt for possible flaws in the substance and logic underneath .

		That
Signor Ferrero	PERSON	has selected and arranged and put forth his material in an attractive way , for the average intelligent reader , few would be found to deny aside from those whose sense of propriety will rebel against his frequent airing of conscious pride in having '' made a hit . ''

		Aside from an attractive literary dress , our author has reaped the harvest of still another common source of immediate interest .

		The word has gone out in countless bold headlines that this brilliant young Italian has suddenly brought tumbling to the ground the whole edi - fice of Roman history , as built up and fortified by the lifelong labors of scholars of the past , such as
Mommsen	PERSON	and Duruy , whom he specifi - cally names as having almost ceased to be read by cultivated people in
America	LOCATION	as in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Human nature has always had a lurking delight in seeing things knocked down , provided they belong to someone else , and
Ferrero	PERSON	undoubt - edly owes not a few readers to this impression .

		And so the fact that

Antony	PERSON	, Lucullus and
Pompey	LOCATION	,

Ferrero	PERSON	's points of view , '' have become subjects of fash - ionable conversation in Parisian drawing-rooms '' is not to be hastily taken as proof that the toils of his predecessors have been in vain , or that the final word on the development and signifi - cance of
Rome	LOCATION	has now been said .

		Ferrero 's training has not been such as to give him the command of the materials of Roman history possessed by a scholar like
Mommsen	PERSON	.

		To be free from
Mommsen	PERSON	's particular prejudice in favor of
Caesar	LOCATION	and against
Cicero	ORGANIZATION	is well so far as it goes , but to have possessed a greater share of
Mommsen	PERSON	's enormous store of first - hand knowledge of the sources of his subject would have given his history a far better chance for a place among the indispensable tools of the student of the future , even though it might have cost it no small part of its popularity of the moment in the fashionable conversation of Parisian drawing-rooms .

		A collaborator of
Lombroso	LOCATION	, the author 's attention in the past has been devoted rather to certain phases of phil - osophy and sociology than to the facts of ancient history .

		These studies have apparently fixed certain conclusions in his mind so firmly that evidence not in harmony with those conclusions stands but a poor chance of due consideration .

		To feel perfectly sure in your own mind as to what must have been true in any given case con - tributes immensely to self-satisfaction and saves an enormous amount of labor that might other - wise have been spent in sifting evidence .

		But it is beyond human power to tread safely over the pitfalls that lie along that road , and the his - torian who wishes his work to have lasting influ - ence in the field of scholarship must reach his goal by another route .

		With
Ferrero	PERSON	's insistence upon the import - ance to history of the multitude of little things going to make up the everyday life of the aver - age man , no one is likely to disagree .

		Even in monarchies apparently of the most absolute type , the influence of the countless thrusts and pushes coming up from below is a powerful factor in the movements at the top , and it is too true that this field of investigation has as yet received no adequate attention .

		We may take it for granted that all branches of ancient his - tory will experience more or less dislocation and readjustment of previous views , as the evidence of this class still available is gradually collected , evaluated , and brought to bear .

		But it is a field for prodigious labor , in which perspiration will count more than brilliant theorizing .

		In one of his lectures our author takes up the sub - ject of wine in Roman history , a theme on which any man well versed in Roman literature might readily present a very interesting , instructive , and suggestive essay .

		We are distinctly told , however , in the preface to the volume containing this lecture , that it is an essay after the plan in accordance with which it seems to the author that economic phenomena should be treated .

		And yet we have merely twenty-five pages of interesting reading matter , putting us in com - mand of the ascertainable facts of no single fea - ture of the subject .

		Horace is of course drawn upon as a witness in the '' investigation , '' but one whole side of the testimony which his odes pre - sent is left absolutely unmentioned .

		Whether this was through oversight , or intentional , the result is a thoroughly distorted
Horace	PERSON	.

		Varying readers will naturally get varying impressions from the facts and characters of ancient history , as described in the available sources of information .

		One is tempted to con - clude that
Signor Ferrero	PERSON	has developed a habit of getting just that impression which is most remote from his own idea of the facts , and then
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 43 imagining that everyone else has received the very same impression , and taken it as the exact truth .

		His treatment of the story of Antony and
Cleopatra	ORGANIZATION	is a case in point , and a good illustra - tion from the fact that the newspapers gave it so much sensational attention when the lecture in which it is embodied was delivered before American audiences .

		Now a reader may readily follow him in this matter just as far as the most liberal interpretation of any evidence actually adduced will allow , and yet not be driven to any radical revision of his estimate of the entire episode at all .

		Still ,
Ferrero	PERSON	imagines that he has effected a tremendous reconstruction , and tells us with a deep and evident sense of self - satisfaction that the newspapers of
Europe	LOCATION	, from one end to the other , heralded his conclusions as '' an astounding revelation . ''

		Considering the fact that the modern newspaper needs in its business enough '' astounding revelations '' each morning to fit the pattern evolved beforehand for the front page by the headline artist , the careful reader has learned not to be astounded too easily .

		To prove that
Antony	PERSON	's career in the
East	LOCATION	was not exclusively a matter of romantic infatuation , that motives of a more selfish origin were mingled with it , is , as a contribution to the knowledge of any student of Roman history , about on a par with proving to the man who has seen the garbage barges dumped that there are organic impurities in the waters of
New York	LOCATION	harbor .

		And yet the romantic infatuation was there , and left to the world a story out of which it will get entertainment long after the labors of many a patient historian of
Rome	LOCATION	have been forgotten .

		It will take more than a Ferrero , too , to bring
Julius Caesar	PERSON	down to the level of an ordinary temporizing Roman politician , seek - ing only to do the thing that would best lend itself to his immediate purposes at
Rome	LOCATION	, and unconscious that his acts were big with signifi - cance for the future .

		The recession from
Mommsen	PERSON	's exaggerated Ca?sarism had gone far toward a normal level before
Ferrero	PERSON	came upon the stage ; but there was an extraordinary brain there , and an eye that could see beyond the immediate horizon , nevertheless .

		We all know that either the hero or the villain forms a tempting subject to the literary artist for over - coloring ; but heroes and villains do exist , and we can not go through the pages of history beat - ing them down to the general level on the abstract principle that '' the average of mankind , under average conditions , are neither particularly good nor particularly bad . ''

		The fifth volume of '' The Greatness and Decline '' is specifically entitled '' The Republic of Augustus . ''

		The backbone of the volume is its vigorous assault upon the idea that Augustus either established a monarchy or had any desire to do so .

		On the contrary , we are asked to believe that he was simply the elective President of a republic , coming up again and again for reelection by an electorate entirely at liberty to set him aside for a better man if it could find one , having a co-president with equal powers at his side a part of the time , and devoting his energies persistently to an attempt to impart renewed vigor to the old forms rather than to supplant them , whether openly or by indirection .

		And the author flatters his American readers with the statement that they are able to under - stand Roman history much more readily than Europeans , because they are living under a republic of the same kind !

		We shall only remark that he has produced no sufficient evi - dence to prove that the government of
Italy	LOCATION	under
Augustus	PERSON	was not radically less demo - cratic than it had been during the days of
Cicero	PERSON	's career , to say nothing of such a con - stitution as that of the
United States	LOCATION	, even with an
Aldrich	PERSON	in charge of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		The terms republic and empire as actually used are of course vague at best , but to use the
United States	LOCATION	as an illustration of what one means by calling the
Italy	LOCATION	of Augustus a republic can lead only to hopeless confusion , if it be not too patently absurd to lead at all .

		The man who is to overthrow the scholarship of the past , in this or any other field , must be more accurate than that .

		We may concede to
Signor Ferrero	PERSON	a literary ability which makes Roman history interesting .

		We should be glad if it were possible to concede such scholarship and care as would make him a safe guide to the readers whose interest his literary ability may arouse .

Thomas Hood	PERSON	and his Period .

		* An account of the life of
Thomas Hood	PERSON	, and j of his share in that interesting period between j the great Georgians and the great Victorians , j has long been needed .

		The '' Memorials , '' pre - pared by his son and daughter , have not suf - | ficed , because their incomplete , though loving , record gives no clear and coherent idea of the ; poet 's life .

		Furthermore , the materials which 1 would enable the student to supplement the * Thomas Hood : His Life and Times .

		Jerrold .


New York	LOCATION	: The
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Walter	PERSON	44
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
July 16	DATE	, considerable information therein contained have been inaccessible .

		To the task , and the oppor - tunity , Mr.
Walter Jerrold	PERSON	has come with un - usual qualifications .

		He is the grandson of the witty
Douglas Jerrold	PERSON	, admirer and friend of Hood ; he is an experienced biographer ; he has already edited the humorist 's poetical works .

		We expect much of a biographer so qualified , of a biography so opportune ; and , on the whole , we are not disappointed .

		Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	's book is destined , however , to become a book of reference .

		It is certainly not intended to be merely a '' popular biography . ''

		Both preface and the ensuing chapters testify to painstaking endeavors for accuracy and com - pleteness .

		Accuracy seems usually to have been attained .

		Completeness , in the fullest measure , has not ; and , in the Life of a poet whose posi - tion in his age was so interesting and important , a high degree of completeness we have a right to demand .

		For example , a bibliography is lack - ing and is sadly needed .

		Hood deposited in any periodical bank open to him , and the record in the works collected by his children is not full and not always reliable .

		Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	's failure to make up for this deficiency is unfortunate .

		His other faults of omission are venial , and are mentionable only because of his apparent adop - tion of u thorough '' as the motto for his labors .

		The present edition of Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	's book is a reprint .

		When the volume was published in
England	LOCATION	, a reviewer in '' The Athenaeum '' for
April 11 , 1908	DATE	, was able to adduce letters of
Charles Lamb	LOCATION	which threw new light upon an important episode in the admirable friendship between these two men of letters .

		To the strict - ures of this review , which students of Hood should consult , may be added another criticism , equally slight it is true , yet of the same char - acter .

		The collected edition of
Hood	ORGANIZATION	's work contains some clever dramatic criticism writ - ten , so it is asserted , for '' The Atlas '' -- that ''
Sunday	DATE	news - waggon '' which was founded in
May of 1826	DATE	.

		When was Hood dramatic critic for '' The Atlas '' ?

		The question is assuredly not a vital one , yet it is conceivable that the historian of the nineteenth century stage may wish to have it answered .

		Since '' The Atlas '' was not in the British Museum Library , Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	lets the question drop with a guess at
1828	DATE	as the date .

		Yet , as it hap - pens , a comparison of the extracts reprinted with the dramatic notes of '' The Literary Gazette '' solves the problem , and proves that Hood was attached to '' The Atlas '' from its inception in
1826	DATE	to some time late in the sum - mer of the same year , certainly until after the week of
August 5	DATE	, when an opera which he reviewed was produced .

		A letter of
October 10 , 1826	DATE	, from which the contemptuous phrase '' news-waggon '' has just been quoted , suggests that he had parted company with the editor by that date , while the reviews in '' The Atlas '' for
1827	DATE	, which is in the
Yale Library	ORGANIZATION	, are ex - pressly asserted to be by a new reviewer 's hand .

		And , to conclude these minor complaints , why are we not referred to that most effective of all tributes paid to
Hood	ORGANIZATION	after his death ,
Thack	PERSON	- eray 's Roundabout paper '' On a Joke I heard from the Late Thomas Hood '' ?

		These omissions , save in the case of the bibli - ography , are trivial , and not to be taken as an indication of untrust worthiness , or as an impli - cation that Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	's work has not been well done .

		Indeed , in some respects it has been overdone .

		It is his thoroughness in certain fields which has made inconsiderable oversights conspicuous .

		He has flung himself upon the doubtful years of
Hood	ORGANIZATION	's early life , where the work of the son and daughter was most unsat - isfactory .

		He has treated these years exhaust - ively .

		In fact , there is some danger that the hasty reader may be misled , for he will find as many pages devoted to the youthful Hood in
Scotland	LOCATION	as to the poet of 1840-45 -- the friend of
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	, and author of '' The Bridge of Sighs '' and '' The Song of the Shirt . ''

		To be sure , we were ignorant of many interest - ing circumstances in the humorist 's early career , until the publication of Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	's book .

		Yet , not equally but doubly interesting is that last of
Hood	ORGANIZATION	's life for which the first was made .

		One feels , to choose an instance of this lack of proportion , that a very important episode in
Hood	LOCATION	's later career , his financial failure in
1834	DATE	, might have been given more attention .

		Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	has made it clearer than ever before that Hood was too unfortunate in his relations with publishers to be altogether blameless .

		This failure in
1834	DATE	was a turning-point in his life .

		It drove him abroad , and entailed '' comics '' and ill-health until he died .

		If we could get at the facts of the crisis we might know Hood better .

		Again , one feels the need of a wider discussion of
Hood	ORGANIZATION	's intimate and very import - ant connection with the humanitarian movement of his time , a relationship which began at least as early as
1832	DATE	, for it was then that he answered '' Pauper '' with , '' If you love your Dolls and Nancys , Do n't we make you marry ? ''

		The fault is a fault of proportion , and it is a
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 45 lack of proportion which is the most serious artistic criticism to be made against this volume .

		Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	has been governed in some measure by what the '' Memorials '' lacked , rather than what the life of
Thomas Hood	PERSON	demanded .

		The result is a book which , for all its excellences , leaves a little to be desired .

		I have reserved these excellences until last , because they are more apparent than the defects .

		Indeed , they are not only apparent , they are most extensive .

		This life of
Hood	ORGANIZATION	will prop - erly go to its place upon many library shelves as the standard reference book for an author whose fame , though small , is constant .

		It is trustworthy , and it contains much not elsewhere to be found .

		Furthermore , it should welcomed by readers who are interested in
the first half of the nineteenth century	DATE	, for the brilliant circle of the old ''
London	LOCATION	Magazine '' is given the essay which it long deserved ; and if the forties are stinted the twenties have little to complain of at Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	's hand .

		Nor can lovers of
Hood	ORGANIZATION	afford to be ignorant of the new letters here contained , letters which brighten our pic - ture of a personality almost Elizabethan in its quaintness and most potent in its charm .

		The faults of Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	's book are probably re - flected from the infinitely more serious errors of the u Memorials '' upon which his labors were based .

		It is to be regretted that he has not entirely escaped their influence .

		But , while regretting , we are gratefully appreciative of his very considerable services to the cause of
Thomas Hood	LOCATION	.

		History axd Romaxce of the Great Lajces .

		* It is a rather curious thing that after remain - ing comparatively neglected in current literature for so many years , the Great Lakes of
North America	LOCATION	should become the subject of two such admirable volumes as those of Mr.
Curwood	PERSON	and Professor Channing .

		The story was well worth telling , and it has been well told in both of these books , which , while they cover the same field , are sufficiently dissimilar in plan for each to have an interest and value of its own .

		The '' Story of the Great Lakes '' is a popular his - tory of the whole lake region from the days of
Champlain	LOCATION	to the present time , the narrative being divided into three parte , or periods , called * The Great Lakes .

Edward Chan	PERSON	- ning and

New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Discovery and Exploration , the
Struggle for Possession	ORGANIZATION	, and
Occupation and Development	ORGANIZATION	.

		The writers do not pretend to have brought to light any strikingly new material .

		Their work is based upon the recognized authorities , -- notably , in Part I. , on
Parkman	PERSON	and
Winsor	PERSON	, and on the original narratives of
Champlain	LOCATION	,
Hennepin	LOCATION	, and Lahontan , of La Salle 's voyages , of the Jesuit Relations ; and in Part II. , on Parkman again , on
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's Travels , the Glad - win Manuscripts , and various narratives of the War of
1812	DATE	.

		Part III. , covering the period of
Occupation and Development	ORGANIZATION	, is drawn from a multitude of sources ; the authors have made very effective use of the widely scattered and sometimes inaccessible material of the period , weaving it into a connected and readable story of the settlement and exploitation of the region of the
Great Lakes	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is perhaps a little to be regretted that they did not see fit to round out the story by telling us something of the explor - ation and development of the Canadian side of the lakes .

		The reader indeed gets the impression from both these books that after the close of the period of French rule the story of the Great Lakes was almost entirely a story of American development .

		One would have liked to hear something more , for instance , of the history of the
Northwest Company	ORGANIZATION	, whose fur-trading operations had so intimate a bearing on the story of the Great Lakes ; of their vessels that plied on
Lakes Huron	LOCATION	and Superior ; and of the canal that the Company built at the
Sault	LOCATION	.

		One is struck , too , by the absence from the otherwise excellent List of Books , at the end of the '' Story of the Great Lakes , '' of any Canadian work , with the single exception of Professor
Colby	PERSON	's '' Canadian Types of the Old Regime . ''

		Not a single Canadian work is cited , for instance , on such a controversial topic as the War of
1812	DATE	.

		However , these are but trifling omissions in what is in other respects a fair-minded , well - balanced , and decidedly readable history of the
Great Lakes	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Curwood	PERSON	's book is conceived upon a somewhat original plan .

		It is divided into two unequal parte , the first and larger of which , is devoted to the Great Lakes as they are to-day , and particularly to their vast shipping industry and how it was developed .

		In the second part , a brief account is given of the origin and history of the lakes , from prehistoric times to the War of
1812	DATE	or thereabouts .

		This supplementary portion compares rather unfavorably with Pro- fessor
Channing	PERSON	's book , which is more accurate and better balanced .

		It might have been wiser 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, if Mr.
Curwood	PERSON	had confined himself to the modern story of the lakes ; for here he leaves little to be desired .

		As an industrial history of the Great Lakes , his book stands by itself .

		Most of us had a general idea of the character of the shipping industry of these great inland seas , but Mr.
Curwood	PERSON	's book is a revelation as to its magnitude and significance .

		He manages to crowd into his pages a wealth of detail which gives practical value to the narrative without detracting from its interest to the general reader ; and the attractiveness of the book is further en - hanced by numerous full-page illustrations .

		* Having made a brief visit to
America	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	seems to have felt that it devolved upon her to write a novel with an American setting .

		But we can not consider '' Marriage a la Mode '' to be one of her successful efforts .

		It is hardly more than a sketch in dimensions , and bears many evi - dences of flagging powers and hasty composition .

		`` We look to it in vain for those qualities of delicate characterization and subtle analysis that we have come to expect from her , nor do we find the finished texture of her better and earlier work .

		There are curious infelicities of phrasing , as in the case of the woman whose mourning for her lost charms is described by saying that '' she had never yet recon - ciled herself to physical losses which were but the outward and visible sign of losses ' far more deeply interfused . ' ''

		There are reckless statements , such as that which attributes the fortunes of the heroine 's father to his having u ravaged and destroyed great tracts of primeval forest in the northern regions of his adopted state , '' which state happens to have been

		special abhorrence , she is of mixed Spanish and Irish blood , and is in no wise characteristically American , except in a superficial way .

		Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's main purpose is to set forth the evils of American divorce , but her horrible example is one that Americans can not take seriously .

		Even the English - man who serves as the hero -LRB- for the whole compli - cation is brought about by an international marriage -RRB- is so poor a creature that it seems fairly natural that he should go to the dogs when his wife forsakes him , and we find it difficult to take much sympathetic interest in a man so devoid of stamina .

		The con - trast between what the author might have made of her theme and what she has made of it occasions melancholy reflections .

		We can only hope that this ill-digested production does not mark the permanent decline of her powers .

		When
Dick Sugden	PERSON	, a young American in
London	LOCATION	, falls in love with
Daphne Medlycott	PERSON	, his slender for - tunes preclude the carrying of his romance to its logical conclusion .

		But when he returns to
England	LOCATION	, ten years later , the owner of fabulous mines and other desirable properties , the case is different , and he is contentedly accepted by
Daphne	PERSON	and
Daphne	PERSON	's family .

		At this point Miss
Macvane	ORGANIZATION	's story of '' The Black Flier '' begins .

		The hour of the wedding is at hand , and the guests are assembled , when it is discovered that the license has confused the names of the contracting parties , and must be corrected .

		Dick , arrayed in his wedding garments , hastily cuts across country on his way to the nearest town , con - fronts a hedge , recklessly jumps over it , and lands sprawling in the road , sprained and helpless .

		A solitary lady driving a motor-car comes along at a furious speed , stops long enough to help
Dick	PERSON	into the tonneau , and speeds away with him to the north .

		Heedless of his request to be set down in the town for which he had been making , she puts on speed , and does not stop until they reach a secluded hostelry at Muckledean , over the Scottish border .

		Here cir - cumstances conspire to make them appear man and wife , and all novel-readers know what that means -- in the sight of the ancient law of
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		Thus is created a complication so extraordinary that when
Dick	PERSON	at last gets back to his betrothed , he has to invent as plausible an account as possible of his disappearance , for the simple reason that telling the exact truth would fix upon him the character of a modern Munchausen .

		Nobody would believe so wild a yarn as that , and he must substitute a story that sounds halfway credible .

		But when the matter is smoothed over , and a second date set for the wed - ding , his troubles have only begun , for he gets legal advice to the effect that the unknown companion of his wild northward ride is undoubtedly his lawful wife .

		He is also pursued by a detective on the charge of having stolen the motor-car .

		Presently the com - panion of his escapade turns up , and is no other than the wife of the dissipated baronet who happens to be the head of the family into which
Dick	PERSON	is about to marry .

		This frees him from the fear of becoming a bigamist , but by no means restores
Dick	PERSON	's peace of

		Daphne mean - while wearies of excitement , uncertainty , and suspi - cion , and , instead of marrying
Dick	PERSON	, is wedded to the faithful curate .

		Since she is a woman of the u icily regular , splendidly null '' type of beauty and char - acter , we are rather relieved -- and so , to his own naive surprise , is
Dick	PERSON	, whose thoughts have all the time been most unbecomingly haunted by the per - sonality of the woman who had led him into his great adventure .

		Nothing is now left but for the baronet to die ; and with that happy despatch we reach the end of one of the most fascinatingly ingenious com - edies that we have encountered in the fiction of re - cent years .

		Mr.
Stanley Weyman	PERSON	declares that he will write no more novels -- which is rather a pity , for his in - vention show few signs of flagging , and '' The Wild Geese '' is one of the best stories he has ever given us .

		The scene is
Ireland	LOCATION	in the
early eighteenth century	DATE	: the heroine is the high-spirited chatelaine of a decaying house , and the hero is a middle-aged soldier of fortune , her kinsman whom she has not seen for a score of years , and who appears in the character of her legally constituted guardian .

		A Protestant and a supporter of the
House	ORGANIZATION	of
Hanover	LOCATION	, the visitor is anything but welcome , for the country - side is seething with rebellion , and a rising is immi - nent .

		Suspicion turns to hatred and violence when the newcomer is found taking active steps to thwart the conspirators , and the savage clansmen more than once nearly compass his destruction .

		He is by no means a hero of the swashbuckling variety , but a grave and seasoned warrior , cautious but determined , a composite of Roundhead and
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	, and he main - tains so imperturbable a front in the face of danger that his hot-blooded foes hesitate long before ventur - ing to attack him .

		Most violent of all in her hatred is his fair cousin and ward , whose emotions are deeply stirred by what she takes to be the cause of faith and patriotism .

		We know well enough that she will suc - cumb in the end , and she makes a most engaging fury before she is tamed .

		There is real power in this book , the power of vital characterization and vivid description , the power to make us realize a picturesque historical situation .

		The author really must change his mind about further writing ; he is too serious a novelist to be spared .

		Mr.
Percy Brebner	PERSON	's `` A Royal Ward '' is a straightforward story of a rather old-fashioned sort , without psychological subtleties or perplexing mys - teries , which keeps a surprisingly firm hold upon the reader 's interest .

		It is a story of
England	LOCATION	during the
Regency	LOCATION	, and its hero is a Frenchman who lands in secret upon the
Devon	LOCATION	coast , is reputed to be a Bonapartist spy and is pursued as such , but in realitv comes upon a private mission .

		He makes the acquaint - ance of the heroine at an early stage of the history , for he takes refuge in her home , and is concealed by her from his would-be captors .

		Having thus saved him , her interest in his personality is naturally en - listed , and the way is thus paved for a pretty romance .

		Presendy the scene shifts to
London	LOCATION	, where
Ladv Betty	PERSON	becomes the idol of the fashionable world , while
Victor Dubuisson	PERSON	finds himself , innocently enough , entangled in a plot to assassinate the Prince Regent .

		From the perils that beset them both -LRB- for
Lady Betty	LOCATION	is in danger of being forced into a dis - tasteful marriage -RRB- the lovers finally make a wild flight to the coast and escape to
France	LOCATION	, where their troubles end .

		The multiplication of toy monarchies , and their imaginary projection into out-of-the-way nooks in the map of
Europe	LOCATION	, goes merrily on .

		We have had at least a score of them during the past twenty years , and their combined area , were they really existent , would leave little room for the great powers .

		The latest of them , invented by Mr.
Anthony Partridge	PERSON	, is named Yaria .

		and its political drama is presented in an ingenious work of fiction entitled u The King - dom of
Earth	LOCATION	. ''

		The king is an old reprobate , sup - porting a dissolute life by the exorbitant taxation of his people , and the crown prince is reputed to be even worse than the ruler .

		But thereby hangs a tale .

		For this same prince , sedulously fostering for his own secret ends the legend which holds him to be a notori - ous evil-liver , is in reality a pattern of austere virtue , and a republican at heart .

		Posing to the world -LRB- through the agency of a double -RRB- as a sensualist and a debauchee , he is all the time plotting with a revolu - tionary band to overthrow the monarchy , intending himself to renounce his claim to the succession .

		The young woman in the case is half English , half
Varian	PERSON	, and , although she is not let into his secret until near the exciting close of the story , believes in him despite all scandalous report .

		Adventures follow thick and fast as the plot developes , and the hero shows him - self a very marvel of resource and intrepidity , playing his dangerous game to the end , and coming out com - paratively unscathed .

		When the curtain falls upon the drama , he has become plain
John Peters	PERSON	, and there is a Mrs.
John Peters	PERSON	to make up to him for the loss of a kingdom .

		Mr.
H. C. Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	has devoted many years to the study of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, and has given us the best biography of the dramatist to be had in the English language .

		u Fame 's Pathway , '' which takes the form of a historical novel , is a sort of by-product of the author 's more serious labors , and supplements them in a happily fanciful way .

		The limitations of the novelist who takes for Ids herb a figure from actual history are manv .

		and it is difficult to reconcfle the claims of truth with those of literary art : while of all varieties of the biographical novel , that which is concerned with the man of letters is the most for - bidding .

		Considering the obstacles he has had to contend with , Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	has achieved a more than creditable measure of success in picturing the life and fortunes of the young
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, and reproducing the atmosphere of the period in which he struggled .

		Few writers of historical fiction have the equipment which the present writer brings to his 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, task , or can give their work reality by so great a store of verifiable detail .

		Faithfulness rather than imaginative daring characterizes the book viewed in this aspect .

		In its other aspect -- that in which the early stirrings of genius are sought to be realized -- the book is cautious , and a little too much senti - mentalized .

		Its hero is an engaging youth , his sur - roundings are picturesque , and the story of his love for Madeleine Be * jart is pleasantly told .

		If his name were not Moliere , we should hardly suspect that he was destined -- that he was well on the way -- to become one of the wisest souls and one of the pro- f oundest searchers of the human heart that have ever observed the tragi-comedy of life .

		But it is not fair to exact the impossible of any writer , and one can hardly be blamed for failing to find new words fit to be uttered by a
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	makes no such pretension ; he takes for granted that even a great genius is not always upon stilts , particularly in his formative period , and that in daily intercourse with his associates he may appear very much in the guise of the ordinary mortal .

		We are even inclined to think that he was ill-advised in adding `` The Romance of a Genius '' as a sub-title to his novel ; the fact that
Moliere	PERSON	was a genius is sure to be in the background of the reader 's consciousness , but the author could not have been expected to do more than see to it that his characterization was not inconsistent with that fact .

		Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	again finds his account in a South American revolution , and his story called '' The White Mice '' seems likely to endear him still further to his juvenile audience .

		To any following more critical he can hardly expect to appeal , for the book is too absurdly lacking in all the qualities that belong to serious fiction .

		It is just a breezy tale of a Venezuelan ruction , having for its hero an ingenu - ous youth , the son of an American '' king of finance , '' and for its heroine the daughter of a deposed and imprisoned Venezuelan President .

		The problem is to get the prisoner out of his dungeon , and claim the daughter as a reward .

		It is all delightfully simple , and the mechanism of counterplot is not enough over - worked to give us any anxiety concerning the out - come .

		The tale is breezy , '' smart , '' topical , and enlivened by slangy humor .

		It may be read at a gallop , and put aside without a pang .

		The rubber plantation in
Mexico	LOCATION	has been used for many years to defraud the gullible portion of the American public ; it is now put for the first time perhaps to an honest use by Mr.
Herman Whitaker	PERSON	, who has made it the theme of an exceptionally inter - esting novel .

		Not only does '' The Planter '' expose the unconscionable methods of the promoter of this species of enterprise , but it also throws a light upon the conditions of labor in semi-tropical
America	LOCATION	, revealing a degree of brutality in the treatment of the hapless native bondmen that recalls the most sensational descriptions of Southern plantation life in our own dark ages of slavery .

		An honest
New England	LOCATION	youth is sent down to
Mexico	LOCATION	as manager of one of these '' fake '' plantations , and discovers a condition of affairs considerably different from that pictured in the prospectus of the company .

		He sets about the task of bringing order into the neglected enterprise with unexpected energy and ability , and at the same time imparts an element of humanity into the treatment of the native laborers .

		But this is not the way in which he is expected to u make good '' by the company at home , and when they learn of his pernicious activities they plan to oust him , and vest control of the plantation in the most brutal of the local slave-drivers .

		A hurried journey home thwarts this conspiracy , exposes the swindling opera - tions of the company , and results in the manager 's return to
Mexico	LOCATION	with enlarged powers .

		This is the skeleton of the plot ; the romance is provided by a beautiful Mexican girl whom the hero loves and wins after overcoming the usual variety of obstacles .

		As a vivid presentation of scenes and characters com - paratively unexploited , this novel makes a strong appeal to the jaded sense , and may be recommended as a picturesque and intelligent piece of work .

		Mr.
Oliver Cabot	PERSON	is the author of `` The Man without a Shadow '' -- a title not to be taken in the
Peter Schlemihl	PERSON	sense , but symbolically , as meaning one who has lost all memory of his past .

		The story is told in the first person , and we make the hero 's acquaintance in a private asylum for the insane at the moment when he first comes to consciousness after a period of torpor .

		His memory is a blank , but his faculties are otherwise restored , and he soon discovers the nature of the establishment in which he is living , and shrewdly surmises that he is de - tained from sinister motives .

		His awakened intelli - gence enables him to plan an escape , which is successfully accomplished .

		But his plight is still serious , for , although free , he is penniless , knows not whither to turn for aid , and has not the slightest clue to his own identity .

		Such a situation clearly calls for much ingenuity on the part of the writer , who contrives to keep us interested in his hero through a long series of happenings , which finally land him in a French chateau , with wife and fortune restored , and a patched-up memory .

		This story may be regarded as a faint reflection of '' Somehow Good , '' and , although it offers not a tithe of the art or the psychology of Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	's novel , may yet be recognized as an entertaining production .

		`` The
Chrysalis	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Harold Morton Kramer	PERSON	, is a story that begins upon the football field at
New Haven	LOCATION	, and ends in the far
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		Polit - ical and financial intrigue form the substance of the narrative , and , together with a certain admixture of physical violence , gives it virility .

		On the senti - mental side , it provides two heroines , the second and prevailing one being '' sprung '' upon us midway , in the person of a young woman who believes herself to be of Siwash blood .

		When it turns out that she is as white as the hero , his scruples vanish , and he takes her to his heart .

		The book is embellished with much Chinook jargon , for which a glossary has to be furnished .

		THE PI AT , 49 in the hero , whose earlier life has been based strictly upon self-seeking and vindictive motives .

		In '' The Making of
Bobby Burnit	PERSON	, '' Mr.
George Randolph Chester	PERSON	tells us how an ingenious youth , thrown upon his own resources as far as initia - tive is concerned , exchanges the world of clubdom and sport for the world of business , is enabled by the failure of various enterprises to sharpen his eye - teeth , and eventually makes for himself a successful career .

		Bobby is the son of a millionaire who dies , and expresses in his will the conviction that his son is a fool .

		The estate is left in a secret trust , except for the large merchant establishment which the senior Burnit has built up , and this is left outright to the boy , who is to carry it on .

		He is soon tricked into forming a stock company with a rival establish - ment , and finds himself frozen out by his designing new associate .

		All this has been accurately foreseen by the father , who has left a series of sealed envel - opes addressed to his son , which are delivered one by one in the crises that call for them .

		An early number in the series is inscribed '' To My Son , upon the Occasion of His Completing a Consolidation with
Silas Trimmer	PERSON	, '' and reads : '' When a man devils you for years to enter a business deal with him , you may rest assured that man has more to gain by it than you have .

		Aside from his wormwood business jealousy of me ,
Silas Trimmer	PERSON	has wanted this Grand Street entrance to his store for more than a third of a century ; now he has it .

		He '11 have your store next . ''

		Bobby is a sadder and a wiser youth when he reads this letter , for its prediction has already been fulfilled .

		The terms of the trust release for his use successive instalments of his in - heritance , and each time a new venture is under - taken , quickly ending in disaster .

		And with each disaster , one of the envelopes is produced , making sardonic comment upon the latest lesson of experi - ence .

		Bobby gradually learns that business people are not '' sportsmanlike '' in their dealings , which is a great grief to him , but the knowledge in time fits him to meet them on their own ground .

		He suc - cessively finances a land improvement scheme , an electric lighting corporation , a stranded Italian opera company , and a moribund newspaper .

		With the lastrnamed enterprise the tide turns , he becomes a forceful influence in civic affairs , boldly attacks the boss and the gang , and after a hard struggle , has the whole panic-stricken pack on the run .

		Success has come to him at last , and then , in the manner of the ` most approved fairy tale , the disastrous earlier ventures develope new signs of promise , and he finds himself a winner all along the line .

		He opens the last of his father 's envelopes , and reads : M I knew you 'd do it .

		dear boy .

		Whatever mystery I find in the great hereafter I shall be satisfied -- for I knew you 'd do it . ''

		There is a slender thread of love - story running through this entertaining yarn , but it adds practically nothing to the interest , which is wholly centred upon
Bobby	PERSON	's successive eye - openings and their salutary contribution to his development .

		Brief * ox New Books .

		The conservation Whether Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	's '' Remaking TourlnlZZr 1 ?

		the
Mississippi	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- owes water-courMet .

		its inception to recently stimulated public interest in the conservation of our inland waterways , we are not informed ; but in any event the book is one which ought to appeal to a wide con - stituency .

		The task which the author has undertaken is to describe the efforts that have been made during the past hundred years to subdue for the better use of mankind the vast network of rivers comprising the
Mississippi	LOCATION	system .

		The idea underlying the work is that the great
Middle West	LOCATION	is approaching a day when congestion of traffic will compel a widespread return to the use of waterways , and that therefore the further improvement of these invaluable natural facilities is a matter of supreme importance to all sections of the country .

		Dividing the
Mississippi	LOCATION	system into six parts -- the main river below
St. Louis	LOCATION	, the
Ohio	LOCATION	, the Chicago-Illinois route to the Lakes , the
Upper Mississippi	LOCATION	, the
Missouri	LOCATION	, and the minor tributaries -- Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	discusses with con - siderable fulness the physiographic character of each water-course , the steps that have thus far been taken to facilitate navigation , and the problems involved in the future of the
Middle Western	ORGANIZATION	waterways in general .

		He writes as a journalist rather than as an engineer , and the result is an exceedingly readable treatise on a subject about which the majority of our people know altogether too little .

		The national government , the author , says , has expended on the
Mississippi	LOCATION	and its branches between two hundred and two hundred and
fifty millions of dollars	MONEY	, of which much has been consumed in experimentation and much has been wasted , but a great deal remains in permanently improved channels and in public works ample for their task for a century .

		Just what has been done with all this money -LRB- and the additional sums expended by the States and by private enter - prise -RRB- , and how the work has been done , is adequately presented ; and not the least valuable aspect of Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	's chapters is the incidental light they throw upon the rather dubious river-and-harbor policy of the
United States	LOCATION	during the past half-century .

		On the whole , the reader is given to understand that very great progress has been made , though less than might easily have been realized with a larger measure of foresight and a smaller admixture of petty politics .

		With respect to what is to-day the most talked-about phase of the subject in the
Central West	LOCATION	, i. e. , the Lakes-to-the-Gulf project -- the author predicts that in the new era of waterway development , which he believes to be dawning , this enterprise will be one of the first to be carried into execution .

		It may , however , be noted in this connection that a special board of engineers created by act of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has recently reported that the scheme would cost
$ 128,000,000	MONEY	, that the mere maintenance of the waterway would entail an expenditure of
S6	ORGANIZATION	.000.000 a year , and that the project is therefore too costly to be justified by the present needs of commerce .

		50 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, Epistolary and The ^ of forcible and adequate ex - literary remaim pres8ion in short compass belonged of a noted editor .

		to fa e j ate
Wendell Phillips Garrison	PERSON	, for forty-one years editorially connected with '' The Nation , '' and during the last twenty-five of those years its editor .

		He died
Feb. 27 , 1907	DATE	, only eight months after relinquishing the post he had so long and ably held .

		Most of his literary work being anonymous , and therefore difficult to identify in the columns of his paper , the volume of '' Letters and Memorials '' edited by his classmate , Mr.
J. H. McDaniels	PERSON	, and published by the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is welcome to his numerous former co-workers and admirers , arid deserves to be read and studied by many besides .

		A fine example of the careful scholarship that is now fast becoming obsolete with us , Mr.
Garrison	PERSON	set his stamp on his weekly journal so deeply and inefface - ably that it will be long ere his dead hand ceases to influence its course and to uphold its ideals .

		The memorial volume contains an introduction by Mr.
McDaniels	PERSON	, an unsigned outline of Mr.
Garrison	PERSON	's life , a hundred pages or more of his letters , chiefly to contributors , a chapter on the fortieth anniversary of '' The Nation , '' a brief selection from Mr.
Garri	PERSON	- son 's poems , and nearly a hundred pages of prose miscellanies from his pen .

		A clear and pleasing portrait of the editor , from a photograph taken in
1894	DATE	, forms the frontispiece .

		The most intimately personal parts of the book , and hence the most inter - esting , are the letters .

		These are written in an off - hand , unstudied way , which reveals much of the character of the man and # of his mental attitude toward his own offices and convictions , as well as toward those of other people .

		Mr.
Garrison	PERSON	was of course a born reformer , and his patience with oppo - sition could hardly be called angelic .

		A significant expression occurs in one of his letters written to his friend Mr.
William Roscoe Thayer	PERSON	: '' I am firm in the faith that President
Harper	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	must be put down . ''

		Putting people down was a favorite occupation with both Mr.
Garrison	PERSON	and Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	, and it probably lessened their influence and their power for good .

		The process is one that may be gratifying to the performer and amusing to the spec - tator , but is scarcely likely to persuade or convince those who are in disagreement .

		The really great leaders , like Lincoln , do not accomplish results in that way .

		The few poems of Mr.
Garrison	PERSON	's that are given show strength and sincerity , with admirable perfection of form .

		Altogether the volume forms a worthy memorial of a distinguished and useful career .

		An illuminating Volume Four of the `` French Men biography of of Letters Series '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is Sainte-Beuve .

		p ro f eS 8or
George McLean Harper	PERSON	's study of Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve .

		It has the distinction of being the first book written in English on the life and work of the most eminent French literary critic , and the merit of being an unusually careful and scholarly bit of work .

		The biography differs from its French forbears in roundly denying that Sainte-Beuve had a definite theory or method of criticism ; which difference in attitude has little significance , perhaps , except to remind the reader that this biographer is an American and the others were Frenchmen .

		Professor
Harper	PERSON	has a very comfortable habit of skilful digression to aid the reader 's treacherous memory .

		Mention of the '' Port - Royal , '' for instance , leads to a swift but thorough review of that movement ; mention of Sainte-Beuve 's relations with
Lamennais	PERSON	suggests a somewhat ex - tended biography of that half-forgotten reformer .

		There is no idealization of a very imperfect subject ; the critic 's cowardly treatment of the Hugos , his low standard of private morality , his numerous shifts of doctrine and party , are discussed with unsparing frankness ; but with all restrictions , the biographer remains an enthusiastic admirer of his subject .

		With regard to
Sainte-Beuve	ORGANIZATION	's frequent changes of front , in fact , Professor
Harper	PERSON	finds it the most natural thing in the world that a critic 's interest in the object of his study should temporarily spell approval .

		Hard and fast comparisons are dangerous but attractive ; and we remember and ponder such assertions as '' Sainte-Beuve is the most serviceable literary critic
France	LOCATION	has known . '' ''

		For scope and appreciation combined with minute knowledge of detail , neither the modern nor the ancient world affords an instance of a comparable talent in the field of criticism . '' ''

		Beginning with a rapid sketch of the rules regulating warfare in ancient and mediaeval times , the author traces in considerable detail the growth of the law and practice of belligerency from the days of Grotius through the Russo-Japanese con - flict of 1904-5 .

		There is not much here that is new , but for a general survey -- one that should lend itself with peculiar readiness to consultation by the layman -- this portion of the monograph will be found of ser - vice .

		More important , because dealing with fresher material , is the commentary upon the successive articles of the Convention promulgated at the
Second Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	two years ago .

		Drawing at every stage upon a wealth of historical and legal reference , and following closely the text of the Hague Conven - tion , Dr.
Bordwell	PERSON	is able to present a serwe of illuminating comments upon this most recent attempt to formulate the principles and methods of modern warfare .

		The usefulness of the book would have been materially enhanced by the subjoining of a chapter comprising an orderly summary of the changes introduced in current practice by the speci - fications of the
Hague Convention	ORGANIZATION	.

		The entire monograph , in truth , partakes rather too much of the character of a note-book .

		Likely to be of real service to students of international affairs are certain documents appended to the text , notably the regula -

Hull	PERSON	's volume on u The Two Hague Conferences and their Contri - butions to International Law '' -LRB-
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has at once taken high rank in the rapidly accumulating literature of the twentieth-century peace movement .

		The author was one of several Americans present at The Hague in a journalistic capacity during the
Second Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

		His account of the
Conference of 1899	ORGANIZATION	is based principally upon the official record as published by the Minister of For - eign Affairs of the
Netherlands	LOCATION	.

		For the Confer - ence of
1907	DATE	.

		the primary source is likewise the official record , the use of which in its unpublished state was extended to Dr.
Hull	PERSON	by the same digni - tary .

		The arrangement of the book is such that the reader may readily follow the history and transac - tions of either conference alone , or he may just as readily cam ' the two together and compare them point by point .

		The work is essentially historical , and the author has evaded frequent temptation to enter upon the field of partisan argument or theo - retical contention .

		The participation of the dele - gates from the
United States	LOCATION	in the transactions of the two conferences has been given special promi - nence .

		After a detailed narrative of the discussions of the rules of warfare upon land and sea , there fol - lows a fifty-page chapter upon the victories achieved in behalf of international arbitration and another of equal length comprising a summary of the results of the conferences and their historical importance .

		To the layman , at least , these are likely to prove the most valuable portions of the book .

		Dr.

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ; and his treatment , though germane and adequate to his purpose , yet in no marked degree rises above the conventional and uninspiring presentation of a topic of vital interest .

		The book is , however , a text , and persistently holds to the impression of the stu - dent with the data and the procedure of the useful thought processes .

		It tells him what functional value thinking has in the organic scheme ; what its connections are with the nervous substrata ; what its How to u * e orchestral instrument * .

		dependence upon the sensory stream of experience and upon the motor channels of expression ; it fol - lows the elaboration of the simpler experiences into the more involved perceptive and imaginative and conceptual fields ; and it relates the process to the logical standards of the product in sound reasoning .

		It sets the whole presentation in an educational frame , and leaves a picture instructive for those on instruction bent , but hardly attractive to those whose reactions demand a more intrinsically artistic mode of appeal .

		For sound thought and the psy - chology thereof , like virtue , must be made attractive ; and the field is open to the psychological craftsman who can make of the analysis of the thinking pro- cesses an impressive literary and yet realistic canvas .

		Despite the ever-increasing number of books on musical topics written for the amateur , the popular demand shows no sign of diminution .

		In the nature of the case , these books are for the most part merely re - statements in simplified and abbreviated form of what has already been said in more abstruse and elaborated way by those writing technically on the subject .

		They show little or no originality of thought ; their manner of treatment is all-important .

		Yet they fill the important role of intermediary between the more scientific writers and the public at large , interpreting and elucidating in untechnical language matters difficult of comprehension to the layman .

		In this class of books is Mr.
Daniel Gregory Mason	PERSON	's '' The Orchestral Instruments and What They Do '' -LRB-
Baker-Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is a popular conden - sation of the contents of various scientific treatises on orchestration , of which those by
Berlioz	ORGANIZATION	and Gavaert are the most important .

		The descriptions of the various instruments of the orchestra are rein - j forced by photographs of them as played , as well as by brief illustrations from well-known scores showing how the various composers have employed the sev - eral voices of the orchestra ; and the attentive reader may gain a fair idea of the particular problem which the composer of orchestral music has before him .

		The author has been fairly successful in accomplish - ing what he set out to do , and the entire field of instrumentation is covered in the hundred odd pages of the book .

Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	, which will be of ser - vice not only to the Latin specialist but also to the student and critic of any literature .

		The decline in quality with a corresponding increase in quantity of literary production after a period of great work is well illustrated in the work of the epic poets after

		The tendency to satire after an outburst of high poetic creativeness is shown in the work of
Persius	LOCATION	,
Martial	ORGANIZATION	, and Juvenal , just as it was in our own eighteenth century .

		Finally , the bombast of the worn-out drama , which marks the late post-Shakespeareans , is witnessed also in the case of
Seneca	LOCATION	.

		The place which these authors hold in their own period , as well as their absolute merit , is admirably brought out by Mr.
Butler	PERSON	by means of copious illustrations in both the original Latin and in excellent translations .

		No attempt is made to glorify these poets unduly ; their faults are indicated clearly enough , but a generous endeavor is made to save them from an undeserved neglect .

		To this is attached the opinion , sometimes with reservations and more often without , of a few men whom the world honors for what they have done and cherishes for the qualities which they do not exhibit in this aspect of their activities .

		Then there is accumulated the voluminous evidence of the pro- fessional psychic researcher ; and , finally , the over - whelming realism of bad photographs .

		It follows the usual plan of such books , with somewhat less than the share of attention generally given to the periods of exploration and colonization , the space thus saved making possible a fuller treatment of the national phase of our history .

		The illustrations , and the various helps provided for teachers and students , combine with the text to make this book one of the most satisfactory now available .

		`` The Mental Man , '' by Mr.
Gustav Gottlieb Wenzloff	PERSON	, is a text-book of psychology in outline , published by the

		The Fate of Iciodorum , '' by Dr.

Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , is a pungent satire upon the humbug of protection to national industries by means of the tariff .

		The book is expanded from a sketch called `` The Octroi at Issoire , '' written a quarter of a century ago , and points its moral most effectively .

		But the shaft of no satire , we fear , can pierce the pachydermatous hides of our national legislators , whose swinish behavior during the last three months has been , if possible , more disgusting than in any previous raid upon the trough .

		A TREASURY OF ENGLISH LITERATURE Selected and edited by
KATE M. WARREN	PERSON	, Lecturer in English at
the University of London	ORGANIZATION	.

		With an Introduc - tion by
STOPFORD A. BROOKE	PERSON	.

		PURPOSE AND AIM .

		-- This book presents a complete series of illustrations , in prose and verse , of the course of English Literature from the earliest times to the
eighteenth century	DATE	.

		It is not only a most valuable companion volume to such well-known anthologies as
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	's '' Primer of English Literature , '' but ia a work complete in itself , and will supply the need of those unable to study the subject in the original and complete works .

		It enables the student to form his opinions and reach his conclusions at first hand , instead of taking them second-hand and ready-made from any history of literature .

		It can not fail to be of great value in the teaching of the subject , as well as in its study , and in addition will appeal to those who are neither teaching nor studying it , but who love and follow it for its own sake .

		EXTENT AND SCOPE .

		-- The selections begin with the Early English of the
7th Century	ORGANIZATION	, including examples of the earliest prose , that of
King Alfred	ORGANIZATION	in the
9th Century	ORGANIZATION	, and the Old English Chronicles ; and the broadening course of the lit - erature is illustrated by selections from the writers of the suc - ceeding centuries , those of the Old and Middle English before Chaucer being especially full and interesting , Copious extracts are given from
Mannyng	LOCATION	,
Rolle	PERSON	of
Hampole	LOCATION	,
Langland	LOCATION	,
Wyclif	LOCATION	, and
Gower	PERSON	.

		The Elizabethan period , and that from
Bacon	LOCATION	to
Milton	LOCATION	, are fully represented , as are the Age of
Dryden	PERSON	and of Pope .

		The last period covers the writers from the time of
Johnson	PERSON	to that of
Burns	PERSON	.

		METHOD AND AR RANGEM ENT .

		- The passages selected are interesting in their subject-matter and literary relationships , as well as representative of the author and the period .

		Translations and glossaries accompany the Early English selections , at the foot of each page .

		The arrangement is necessarily chronological , but the selections are characteristi - cally grouped as far as possible .

		A COMPLETE GUIDE TO HERALDRY By
A. C. FOX-DAVIES	PERSON	, of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's Inn .

		Barrister-at-law .

		Editor of `` Armorial Families . ''

		Author of `` The Art of Heraldry , '' etc. .

		Nearly 800 designs and several plates in color specially executed for the present work by
GRAHAM JOHNSTON	ORGANIZATION	.


Herald Painter to the Lyon Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		The aim of the work is to give in a convenient form and at a price not hitherto attempted a comprehensive and accurate guide to the law and practice of heraldry .

		During the editorship of '' Ar - morial Families '' and kindred works , the author has had a prac - tical experience which is probably unrivalled in its extent , and the fruit of his labours are now em - bodied in the present volume .

		The author deals first with the evolution of the science of Her - aldry , treating this most methodi - cally ; but the main part of the book will consist of a practical exposition of the science as prac - tised at the present day .

		Every part of the science and each `` charge '' will be dealt with and explained , both as to its meaning and the rules which govern its use .

		Grouped under each heading will be found the rules appli - cable thereto and explained with a fulness of knowledge which it is hoped will render the work a standard one in time to come .

		The ILLUSTRATIONS are entirely new , having been pre - pared on a uniform and exhaustive plan .

		They are the work of Mr.
Graham Johnston	PERSON	,

		WILLIAM
ALLEN WHITE	ORGANIZATION	'S new nov el A CERTAIN RICH MAN Its Author is a distinguished newspa - per man , an Editor on the staff of the
American Magazine	ORGANIZATION	, widely known through his vigorous short stories , etc. .

		Its Scenes are those of a city in the
Middle West	LOCATION	from the time of its settlement in the height of the `` free soil '' excitement to the present day .

		Its Hero is a dominant captain of industry , fighting against odds and under pressure of occurrences beyond any foresight , weighing private ethics against the '' larger good '' of organizing a great industry .

		Its Plot is so genuinely real that it seems to grow involuntar - ily from the nature of the characters and the condi - tions of the times .

		Its Interest is intense .

		The leisurely fidelity to life in every line gives even the minor char - acters the reality of the folks one knows and loves .

		Its Americanism is its strongest feature , its life .

		No one will deny its realism , the vitality of its men and women , the accu - racy of a lifetime 's observa - tion of men and circum - stances .

		`` The author tells the story with sincerity , justice , sympathy , and accuracy .

		Written evidently from the storehouse of personal experience , with such candor and truth that the narrative touches the tenderest mem - ories ... the phases of life with the pas - sage of time are carefully and interestingly observed , and have rarely been so admir - ably portrayed ... The whole design is carefully , skillfully drawn ... deftly woven into a fascinating romance .

		`` It pulsates with humor , interest , passion - ate love , adventure , pathos -- every page is woven with threads of human nature , life as we know it , life as it is , and above it all a spirit of righteousness , true piety , and heroic patriotism .

		These inspire the author 's genius and fine literary quality , thrilling the reader with tenderest emotion , and hold - ing to the end his unflagging , absorbing attention . ''

		TENNYSON .

		In our centenary celebration of the annus mirabilis which gave birth to
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Darwin	LOCATION	,
Gladstone	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	,
Holmes	PERSON	, and
Lincoln	LOCATION	, not to mention several other names of considerable importance , we pay , in unwonted measure , our grateful tribute to the famous dead .

		No other year in the history of the English-speaking peoples is comparable with the year
1809	DATE	in respect to the number of distinguished men who then opened their eyes upon a world which was to be made better by their existence .

		Nor can we point to any coming year in which we will be called upon to celebrate so important a centenary group .

		It would be invidious to assert , taking the three greatest of these names into consideration , that one of them counts for more than the others in the history of human progress .

		The execu - tive who directed to successful issue the greatest war in modern history , the student of nature who transfigured the face of science and made a new mould for the thoughts of men , the poet who achieved supreme distinction in the art of expression and fused in his perfect verse all the essential elements of the spiritual life , -- each of the three embodies in his own sphere of ac - tivity the qualities that are summed up for us in the word greatness .

		Of Tennyson we simply say that he was the greatest English poet of his time , and all else is but amplification of that one indubitable fact .

		The present is not the best time for the full realization of that fact .

		We are at once too near the poet and too far away from him to take the most accurate measure of his stature .

		We are too far away in the sense that seventeen years have passed since he was a living presence who might any day enrich our lives with some new crystallization of spiritual truth , or impart some new prophetic vision to our eager sight .

		The awed grief which overwhelmed those of us who are now well past the mezzo del cammin when we realized that all his words had been spoken has had time to subside , and the reaction from that mood of exaltation has left us a little stolid , perhaps , or imperfectly appreciative of the debt which we acknowledged in all its mag - nitude when he was alive .

		It was possible to 60 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, write his obituary from a full heart in
1892	DATE	, while in the present year of grace we have lapsed into semi-forgetfulness of that long-spent emotion .

		As the full heart fails us , however , the clear mind resumes its rightful control , and prepares for its final judgment .

		But in this sense we are still too near the poet to judge him with unclouded sight , to analyze values with nice discrimination , to view him objectively in the right perspective as related to his contem - poraries and the period in which they lived side by side .

		In the case of
Poe	PERSON	, whose birth-year was the same , but who died at the age of forty , we have hardly yet got the proper critical focus ; how much farther we must be from that end in the case of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, who outlived
Poe	PERSON	by forty-three years , and whose productive power was prolonged into extremest age !

		Living , as we do , in the period of reaction that almost always follows upon the death of a great writer , it becomes pertinent to ask how far the reaction has gone , and what will be the position of the poet when both action and re - action -- the vital influence of his presence among men and the yielding to other influences when that presence is withdrawn -- are far-off things , say a hundred years hence .

		The
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' said the other day that '' to few who are under forty does
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	seem a real poet . ''

		The statement is a startling one , surely not to be accepted without examina - tion and qualification .

		But youth is terribly critical , and the poetry that appeals to it must be up to date , and in touch with the current idiom .

		It is not unnatural that a young man should find more poetry in Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	than in
Tennyson	LOCATION	, just as he may sincerely think
Steven	PERSON	- son a greater writer than
Scott	PERSON	.

		Of this latter judgment -- and the former would fit just as well -- Professor Trent recently said : `` It is naive because it illustrates so aptly the innocent and childish propensity to think that what we like much and know well must be great because it greatly impresses us .

		There are many reasons why certain modern writers should impress sophisticated readers more profoundly than old - fashioned writers of far larger calibre can possibly do .

		Unless , however , an author has appealed to all classes of readers through a fairly long period of time , it is merely a sign of enthusiasm , not an exercise of the judgment , to call him great in any absolute sense of the epithet . ''

		Those who make such statements `` mistake -- to paraphrase
Tennyson	PERSON	-- the thin murmur of their little circle for the deep-toned utterance of the world of men . ''

		But we think it likely that the youth of to-day do not care for
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	in anything like the degree in which the youth of the last generation cared for him .

		His phrasing is out of fashion , and his ideas are served up without the condiments demanded by a taste that has been vitiated by the reading of newspapers and popular novels .

		Moreover -- and this is an important matter -- the schools have taken him up , and the blight of the educational commen - tator has mildewed him .

		Now if there is any one thing of which the average boy or girl is more convinced than others , it is that the writers whose acquaintance he makes through the medium of a school course in '' English literature '' are outside the pale of healthy and rational human interests .

		Some tribute of formal respect must be paid them , in deference to the unaccountable prejudices of older people , and they may be allowed shelf-room in the library ; but it would be sheer hypocrisy to pre - tend that they were a source of pleasurable emotion to any person with red blood in his veins .

		Something like this , we imagine , is what the reaction amounts to in the case of
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		He has become a '' British poet , '' like
Milton	PERSON	or another , to receive profuse lip-service , but otherwise to be left out of the reckoning .

		This is the treatment accorded him by the unthinking many ; the discerning few may still find in him one of the strongest spiritual forces of the modern world , but they find it increasingly diffi - cult to persuade the multitude into acceptance of this truth .

		Meanwhile , the process of critical reflection is slowly sifting the mass of his work , realizing the relative values of its several parts , and shaping the final verdict .

		In this process of comparative valuation , some of the work is gaining and the rest losing .

		Certain of the lyrics and idyls have always been seen to have a per - fection too patent to be gainsaid by the most searching criticism .

		But other works -- notably the longer ones -- have had their ups and downs in the regard of serious judges . ''

		In Memoriam '' holds its own , and possibly gains ; the '' Idylls of the King '' are seen to be more faulty than we once thought them ; the beauty and vitality of '' Maud '' are more apparent than they were in the early days ; the dramas , now that we accept them frankly -- except '' Becket '' -- as closet-dramas , have acquired a higher dignity ; the whole mass of the poet 's later work is now felt to possess a richness and a ripeness that were not clearly felt while he was yet alive .

		These tentative suggestions seem to indicate , if but
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 61 roughly , the way in which sober criticism has dealt with the poet during the seventeen years since his death .

		As the poet and the age which he adorned recede from our view , we slowly gain that per - ception of their reciprocal relations from which the final formula of the Tennysonian equation will be worked out .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	has already re - minded us that for about half a century the ex - ample of Tennyson stiffened English poetry into something like immobility .

		Fluid during the romantic period of the early nineteen hundreds , its free movement was arrested by the domina - ting influence of this one poet , who created what seemed to be the type of supreme excel - lence , a form so finished that there was nothing for other poets to do but adopt it .

		Not until the century was nearing its decline was this controlling influence slackened , and the springs of fresh inspiration unsealed .

		It is a fact of tremendous significance that one poet should have had such supremacy for so long a time , and a fact that must loom large in the view of the future historian .

		Seeking to account for it , he will probably rest his case upon the union in Tennyson of a Virgilian perfection of style with a profound understanding of the human spirit and of the problems with which it has to grap - ple in an age of rapidly widening outlook , an age increasingly self-conscious , and bent upon the closest analysis of both nature and human existence .

		It is in about such terms as these that
M. Faguet	PERSON	, in the -- Quarterly Review '' sums up his judgment .

		It has often been said that intelligent foreign opinion is more likely than our own to square with what will be the opinion of posterity , and , with that consideration in view , we translate from
M. Faguet	PERSON	as follows : `` Tennyson represents the meeting in a single man of all the forms of poetry which had shone during the preceding generation ; he profited by all the varieties of imagination displayed and unfolded before his time , collected and unified them in himself , fusing them with his own per - sonality , and expressing them anew in a form strictly his own , and consequently in a perfectly original manner .

		His temperament was such that he could feel very deeply what his prede - cessors had felt ; his talent was to put these sentiments into new frames -LRB- fiction , re very , legend -RRB- ; his art was to invent rhythmical forms which left him in nobody 's debt .

		... He had romantic sensibility , and he expressed it with classical perfection . ''

		For our own part , we should supplement this verdict , adequate as it appears from the artist 's point of view , by pay - I ing tribute to the poet 's thought , which faced ' and penetrated the darkest and thorniest hedges I of the mind , caught at least some glimpses of t the light beyond , and ripened toward the end of the poet 's life into that '' Wisdom heavenly of the soul '' which is knowledge raised to its highest power .

		CASUAL COMMEXT .

		The - scientific imagination '' of Simon * Xew - COMB made the pursuit of astronomy and mathe - matics as fascinating to him , and to many of his readers , as a romance -- if that comparison be not i too absurdly feeble .

		Compared with the stupendous -LSB- mysteries of the stellar universe , what romance is \ worthy of a moment 's wonder ?

		His death ,

		published in
1903	DATE	, will be found to ' contain a most readable account of what he looked back upon as the leading events of his life .

		That book and his novel -LRB- written somewhat in the manner j of
Jules Verne	PERSON	's and Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	's pseudo - scientific imaginings -RRB- entitled u His Wisdom the i Defender '' are his chief contributions to general !

		literature , although some of his severer studies -- i for example , his ' • Popular Astronomy '' and u
Astron	ORGANIZATION	- omy for Everybody '' -- are of a nature to interest any intelligent reader .

		Political economy , sociology , i and finance also engaged his busy pen , and his researches in the construction and use of the tele - scope made him an authority in that department of applied optics .

		What is perhaps his most lasting monument is indicated in the opening sentence of his '' Reminiscences , '' -- ' `` I date my birth into the world of sweetness and light on one frosty morning in
January , 1857	DATE	, when I took my seat between two well-known mathematicians in the office of the
• Nautical Almanac	ORGANIZATION	' at
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	'' The pendulum of popularity has a curious way of swinging backward and forward , now toward glory , and again about as far toward depreciation or even vilification .

		Dickens 's fame , effulgent in his lif etime and for some years thereafter , suffered some - thing like eclipse for a period , but is again radiant as of old .

		Byron 's vogue has had similar alterna - tions .

		Even Shakespeare suffered at the hands of Voltaire a scornful severity of judgment that 62 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, tended to dim his lustre in the polite world for a season .

		George Sand appears at this moment to be one who , after excessive adulation and almost as exces - sive abuse , is again enjoying the changeable world 's favor .

		Zola and the realists would have it that she was lacking in truthfulness , others that she wanted originality , and the '' Parnassiens '' that she was faulty in form .

		Then came the reaction against this reaction , and critics like
Taine	PERSON	,
Brunetiere	LOCATION	,
Faguet	LOCATION	,
Bourget	PERSON	, and
Lemaitre	PERSON	chose to speak in her praise .

		M. Rend Doumic , who may be remembered as the first Hyde lecturer at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1898 -RRB- , and who has recently been elected to the
Academy	LOCATION	, has issued in book form a series of lectures delivered
last winter	DATE	on the author of `` Consuelo . ''

		One paragraph from his closing chapter will indicate the writer 's high opinion of her .

		He says : ''
George Sand	PERSON	's vocab - ulary is often uncertain , her expression lacks pre - cision and relief ; but she has the gift of imagery , and her images are of an adorable freshness , be - cause , having always kept the rare faculty of wonder , she has not ceased to view things with the eyes of youth .

		She has the movement that captivates and the rhythm that lulls .

		She unrolls , with a certain slowness , but without embarrassment , the ample pe - riod characteristic of French prose at its best .

		It is impossible not to liken her to a broad river whose waters flow , limpid and abundant , between flowery banks and oases where the wayfarer loves to tarry and dream deliciously . ''

		• • • A children 's library in its own building is probably nowhere to be seen except in
Cleveland	LOCATION	, where the kindly generosity of a rich man has helped to provide the little ones with a
Day Nursery	ORGANIZATION	, a Free Kindergarten , and a Public Library .

		Years ago
Joseph Perkins	PERSON	, of
Cleveland	LOCATION	, built and equipped the nursery and kindergarten , and last year a son gave an adjoining lot of land to the city , half of the lot to be used as a playground and half to be de - voted by the
Public Library Board	ORGANIZATION	to the purposes of a children 's library .

		The building was opened last
September	DATE	, and in its very attractive reading - room are to be seen shelves on all sides filled with books suitable for young readers and -LRB- an important detail -RRB- all within their reach .

		The purpose of the institution declares itself in every item of its equip - ment and ornamentation , and if the little ones fail to find happiness there they will hardly find it in heaven itself .

		But evidently they are not unappre - ciative .

		With a registered membership of six hun - dred and ninety , the library now circulates more than four thousand books a month .

		A civil-service contest for a librarianship is a novelty soon to be witnessed in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The public library board of the city has determined , after conference with other authorities , to throw open to all librarians in the country the contest for the very desirable position of librarian of the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		The office is one of large possibili - ties for usefulness and distinguished service , and incidentally assures its holder of a very good salary .

		The examination will be held
August 10	DATE	, and unsuc - cessful candidates will not be mortified by the pub - lication of their names .

		The exact nature of the test appears from the following announcement : '' There will be no supervised or assembled examina - tions .

		On the day set for the test candidates will be furnished with a full statement of the conditions surrounding the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, its resources , equipment , and field to be covered ; also a statement of the local conditions as to population , character of the same , and similar information calculated to place before the candidate the problem which con - fronts
Chicago	LOCATION	in the development of its public library .

		With this information before them , can - didates will be requested to reduce to writing a professional judgment of the proper administration of the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		A paper thus pre - pared must be filed with the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	on or before
September 10	DATE	, and must be the original work of the applicant .

		A full statement of education , training , and experience will also be required , sub - ject to careful verification by examiners . ''

		The shameless '' fakes '' of book - agents , and their success in fleecing people who ought to know better , have often been referred to in these columns .

New York	LOCATION	woman who was induced to pay
$ 85,000	MONEY	for an `` extra-illustrated '' copy of a rejuvenated `` plug '' that any reputable dealer could have told her was worth at most but a few hundreds , is fresh in mind through the notoriety given it by some sensational court proceedings .

		But such exposures seem to do little to stop the traffic , -- it may be , rather , that they encourage it by showing how easily the game may be tried by an operator sufficiently bold and adroit , and the enormous profits that come from it when successful .

		The whole dependence of the dishonest agent is of course upon the gullibility of human nature and the almost super - natural splendor of the `` proposition '' which he is able to present to the dazzled vision of his victims . ''

		Fake '' gold-mines or u fake '' book - schemes , the game is much the same .

		A bit of Boston-made slang , fresh from the innocent lips of a little
Boston	LOCATION	girl , will interest the curious student of colloquialisms and their origin .

		It appears that our little maiden of
Beacon Hill	LOCATION	was looking forward with extreme pleasure to a prom - ised outing , and she expressed herself as expecting that when the day arrived she and her companions would '' startle the pigeons from their perch . ''

		Naturally enough , her elders were struck by the strange expression and asked her whence she had got it . ''

		Why , it 's in '
Paul Revere	PERSON	's Ride , ' '' was the ready reply , in a tone of surprise at such ignor - ance .

		The picturesque phrase was adopted by the

Galveston	LOCATION	and
Tacoma	LOCATION	.

		The parentage of much of j our slang , and even of many exclamations con - sidered profane or vulgar , or both , might prove to be no less respectable than this latest example of vigorous and expressive English .

		England 's greatest living novelist , since the death of
George Meredith	PERSON	, is by common consent Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, who has recently entered on his seventieth year .

		Like
Meredith	PERSON	, he waited long for full recognition , and , like
Johnson	PERSON	in his reproachful letter to
Chesterfield	LOCATION	, he could probably tell the public that its homage and its bounty are now too late to serve the end which , if bestowed years ago , they would have so acceptably met .

		But the great public is in this respect like the gods : to those who scorn its charities its arms fly open wide .

		It is gratifying to recall that Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's fame in
America	LOCATION	is of rather earlier date than his recogni - tion in his own country -- another of the many proofs we have given of a certain intellectual alert - ness and a warm-hearted readiness to acknowledge literary ability wherever manifested , even if we do sometimes pirate the products of foreign genius .

		SWINBURNE AND MAUPASSANT .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		I am an interested reader of Mr.
House	PERSON	's letter , in your issue of
July 16	DATE	, quoting from Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's remin - iscences of
Swinburne	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
House	PERSON	corrects the too - picturesque account of
Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	's rescue of the English poet at Etretat in
1870	DATE	.

		Mr.
Edward Wright	PERSON	, in a recent number of '' T. P. 's Weekly , '' gives an ac - count of this accident , and of its sequel .

		The version I have seen is substantially as follows : ' `` I was very young , ' says
Maupassant	PERSON	in one of his rare scraps of autobiography , ' and I was passing -
the summer	DATE	at Etretat .

		One morning about ten o'clock I heard some sailors crying out that a man was drowning by the
Petite Porte	ORGANIZATION	.

		I entered a boat with them , and we rowed to the rescue .

		A swimmer , ignorant of the terrible current that swept by the place , had been caught in it and carried out to sea .

		But before I arrived he was picked up by a fishing smack .

		In the evening I learnt that the swimmer was an English poet , Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		He was staying at Etretat with another Englishman , and I received an invitation to lunch with them the next morning at their chalet .

		I was surprised by the appearance of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	... a kind of fantastic appari - tion reminding me of the figures in
Edgar Poe	PERSON	's tales .

		He seemed almost supernatural , and his body was continually agitated by nervous tremors .

		M ' Human bones were scattered about the tables , and among them was the flayed hand of a parricide .

		Around the room prowled an ape , whose grimaces were unimaginably droll .

		Full of frolic and mischief , it was not an ape , but a silent friend of its masters . '' '

		Some days later I was again invited to lunch by these eccentric Englishmen .

		They bought a monkey from a dealer in wild animals at
Havre	LOCATION	in order to taste what roast monkey is like .

		It was being cooked when I entered the chalet .

		The smell alone upset me , and the frightful savor took from me all desire for meals of that kind .

		I never saw Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	again . ' '' ''

		In ' The Flayed Hand ' Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	becomes a French - man , and he is strangled in the night by the macabre object which hangs in his bedroom .

		But , as has been remarked , the story ... is not as good as the ordinary run of tales in our popular magazines . ''

		I think I am not the only reader of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	who would like to know the source of this strange `` scrap of autobiography , '' and whether the facts bear it out .

		My recollection of the study of
Guy de Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	by
M. Maynial	PERSON	, and of the biographical notes contained in the first volume of the fine new edition of his works issued from the press of the
Imprimerie Nationale	ORGANIZATION	, does not include anything of the kind .

		I should be glad to know whether the incident of the Flayed Hand -LRB- worked over in
Maupassant	LOCATION	's youthful story of that name -RRB- , and that of the monkey-banquet , are to be regarded as au - thentic .

		SHAKESPEARE OR
BACON	LOCATION	?

		-LRB- To the Editor of The
Diax	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		Perhaps no question is being forced upon the attention of students of English literature with more persistence than this : How can we prove that
Francis Bacon	PERSON	wrote the plays that are commonly attributed to
William Shakespeare	PERSON	?

		I desire to call attention to a line of proof which has been strangely disregarded .

		In looking about for a means of conveying to a distant posterity information which he was determined to withhold from those who knew him personally ,
Lord Bacon	PERSON	could not adopt any cipher , any veiled method of communication , which required that an Elizabethan printing-office should do its work carefully and accurately .

		The
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays -LRB- so-called -RRB- swarms with manifest misprints of many kinds .

		These would utterly dislocate and forever conceal any ordinary cipher mes - sage which had been entrusted to the text It is necessary , therefore , that we look at the larger characteristics of the plays in order to find the veiled message that we are seeking .

		In particular , I wish to direct attention to one striking peculiarity which is present in all the plays ascribed to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, with a very few exceptions ; and these exceptions are in them - selves suspicious .

		I refer to the alternation of verse and prose .

		Delius and other scholars have studied this matter in some detail , seeking to find the law which governs this strange fluctuation in the outward form of the dramas ; but they have missed entirely the larger message which I will now indicate .

		What is the natural symbolism of this feature of the plays ?

		Could any interpretation be more natural , more unforced , more certain , than that which I express in the following double equation ?

		Verse + prose + verse + prose = a streak of fat + a streak of lean + a streak of fat + a streak of lean =
Bacon	LOCATION	.

		It will surprise every reader of this communication to learn that , though I have convinced several persons by the above argument that
Bacon	PERSON	wrote the plays in question , yet I myself still cling with a foolish fondness to the older view , and hesitate to become an apostle of the new faith .

August 1	DATE	, CIj * | to § 00ks .

		A
Servant of Humanity	ORGANIZATION	.

		* It is now three years since the first volume of Mrs.
Richards	PERSON	's '' Journals , Life and Letters of
Samuel Gridley Howe	PERSON	'' made at last acces - sible the full history of that remarkable man 's earlier life -- a period which was happily sum - marized in the title chosen for the volume , '' The Greek Revolution . ''

		The title of her second volume , which carries his story to the end -- '' The Servant of Humanity '' -- is equally apt .

		It might , indeed , have been given to both ; from his earliest days the service of humanity was with him a constant , brave , cheerful , absorbing pas - sion .

		One feels , however , a true distinction between the more adventurous and spectacular circumstances of the years when he was busy with the struggle between Greek and
Turk	ORGANIZATION	, Christianity and Islam , liberty and old-world tyranny , and the habitually more quiet sur - roundings of his unwearied efforts at home to alleviate suffering , to illuminate darkness , to lighten the burden of the lowly .

		The first called forth his rare and buoyant aspiration of mind and of spirit ; the second proved it constant , unbroken , unfailing to the very end .

		So , in giving us these two phases of him separately , his daughter , Mrs.
Richards	PERSON	, has done well .

		She has done well , too , in letting him tell his own story ; and she has done particularly well in the matter of self-restraint .

		A work impelled at once by enthusiastic sympathy and filial piety is in danger of fulsomeness .

		From this the volumes are refreshingly free .

		They present historical facts , no doubt , from the extremely definite point of view occupied by Dr.
Howe	PERSON	; they show us his friends and contemporaries from his own angle of vision ; wherefore , they can hardly be accepted as critical history .

		None the less , they are a faithful portrayal of how life appeared , during the ardent nineteenth century , -- the century of Reform succeeding upon Revolution , -- to an impetuous spirit intensely harmonious with the philanthropic aspirations of his time .


Samuel Gridley Howe	PERSON	was born in
Boston	LOCATION	on
November 10 , 1801	DATE	.

		His father was a Jeffersonian Democrat , a fact which probably affected the son 's opinions throughout life .

		were mostly Federalists .

		No state of society and politics could have been more favorable to the growth of deeply implanted conviction , on the part of one ancestrally in opposition , that things are wrong because they are in the hands of the wrong people , and consequently that who - ever is in control of anything ought to be got out of it for the benefit of mankind .

		Dr.
Howe	PERSON	was far too powerful a man -- too practical , too orderly and efficient -- to entertain any such fantastic doctrine of anarchy .

		Throughout the story of his admirable career , however , you feel an undercurrent of assumption that the under dog is the better beast , that whoever has him under may best be removed by a summary pro- cess of thrashing , and that he may more than probably be preserved from dangerous rabidity by a judicious dose of freedom and moral sua - sion , in varying proportions according to the circumstances of his case .

		With some such prepossession , the boy went to school in
Boston	LOCATION	, took his degree at
Brown College	ORGANIZATION	in
1821	DATE	, and became Doctor of Medicine at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1824	DATE	.

		Before the end of that year he had already made his way to
Greece	LOCATION	, urged thereto partly by his enthusiasm for
Byron	PERSON	.

		There , for years , he played his brave part -- surgeon , soldier , knight - errant , friend and helper of a people striving to rise , -- in such manner as the first volume of Mrs.
Richards	PERSON	's work has already set forth .

		His life-work would have been picturesquely and admirably memorable had it ended in
1832	DATE	, when outspoken sympathy with
Poland	LOCATION	got the '' Hero of the Greek Revolution '' for a while into a Prussian prison .

		It is possible , indeed , that the brilliant and daring work of those early years was as fruitful as any he ever did .

		Such spirit as his , infused generously into the atmosphere at once thrilling and stifling of eldest
Europe	LOCATION	, was needful to make
Greece	LOCATION	what
Greece	LOCATION	has become -- living
Greece	LOCATION	once more .

		Distant from us , however , both in time and by the width of
Atlantic	LOCATION	and
Mediterranean	LOCATION	together , the result of that sep - arate period of his life seems splendidly indis - tinct , at least in comparison with that of the long and more coherent years which followed at home .

		There , beyond peradventure , you find his traces clear as ever , now when he has lain a third of a century in his grave .

		So long as the blind stay blind to light , or the feeble-minded to reason , those whom their misery touches will be forever happier for his work and his teach - ings .

		No work or teaching can avert suffering , or level the inequalities of Nature .

		None could have done more than his to alleviate them .

		In
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAi , 65 Mrs.
Richards	PERSON	's new volume , he tells his story for himself .

		The teaching of the blind , the alter - ation -- which he always believed a vital reform -- in the traditional methods of education , the strengthening of the feeble-minded , succeed one another in turn , the new never supplanting the old , but rather adding itself thereto in the sum of a comprehensive philanthropic activity which seems always ultimate until you find it re - doubled and still inexhaustible .

		Such a tem - perament could not have lacked what must seem to some of us vagaries .

		He was as ready to welcome Kossuth as he had been to call into spiritual being the darkened soul of
Laura Bridgman	PERSON	; as passionate in his opposition to slavery , and as relentless in sentiment to those who saw our national agony in other ways than his , as he had been merciful and benignant to idiocy ; and as devout , in his own unfettered way , as if he had never strayed from the fold of orthodoxy .

		He was an ardent advocate of Free Soil in
Kansas	LOCATION	, a devoted admirer of
John Brown	PERSON	, a lifelong intimate of
Charles Sumner	PERSON	.

		He was a leading spirit , the while , in the benefi - cent work of the
Sanitary Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and in that which after the emancipation of the slaves inquired deliberately into the condition and the prospects of the Freedmen ; he was deeply con - cerned with the
Board of State Charities	ORGANIZATION	in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	; and in his old age he did his utmost to help on the Cuban Revolution , and to secure the annexation of
Santo Domingo	ORGANIZATION	to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Through it all , beyond most militant reformers , he kept his friends , or at least retained the cordial respect of those from whose friendship his restless and ardent sense of duty debarred him .

		The title of Mrs.
Richards	PERSON	's final chapter -- '' The Good Knight without Fear and without
Reproach	LOCATION	'' -- hardly seems hyperbolical ; and no one would deny the truth of her simple words : '' On
January	DATE	9th -LRB- 1876 -RRB- his great spirit departed . '' ''

		Great '' seems none too great a word for him , as you lay the volume down .

		Yet the dead ride fast .

		Even in his own time he was not precisely dominant ; in ours his memory is per - haps dim , except with those who knew him , and with those to whom -- as to the readers of his daughter 's pages -- he must always seem still alive .

		Partly , no doubt , this is a matter of the happy accident that his wife -- the most brilliant , accomplished , and beloved woman among the American reformers of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	-- was throughout the years of their union a figure as admirably well-known , in public and in private , as he ; and that , years younger than he , she has survived to our own times , when we may fancy her , in the beautiful ripeness of her unbroken and serene old age , thinking of his seventy-five years as youthful .

		Partly , however , it is surely a matter of the restless comprehen - siveness of his unwavering philanthropy .

		Had he been only the hero of the Greek Revolution , he would have loomed more distinct ; so if he had been only the Savior of the Blind , or the Creator of Reason in the Feeble-Minded ; or only a passionate Abolitionist , or a professional minister to the sufferings of our soldiery .

		The other men of his time were more willing com - pletely to concentrate their powers .

		The secret of his personality lay most of all in the certainty that wherever you found the powers of others concentrated for the welfare of the friendless , there you would find him urging on the work with all the intensity of an enthusiasm mature from the beginning and youthful to the end .

		That which pervades is never that which is most salient .

		One might criticise , beyond dispute .

		By no means all of us are sure that men are wiser than Nature ; that a life devoted to the strengthening of the weak may not prove in the end to have done troublous work by unwittingly weakening the strong .

		By no means all that was best in nineteenth-century
New England	LOCATION	was comprised in its philanthropy ; by no means all the philan - thropists , high on their pedestals to-day , look stainless when you come to scrutinize them .

		Any reader of this volume who knows the period with which it deals , however , is abundantly able to make such comments for himself ; and any to whom the period is strange may turn to these pages with full confidence that they truly set forth what seemed daily truth to a spiritually great man .

		66 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, General
Kuropatkin	PERSON	's appointment to command the Russian army then operating in
Manchuria	LOCATION	.

		It was indeed the irony of fate that elevated
Kuropatkin	PERSON	to this command , because he , more than any other man in
Russia	LOCATION	, had striven to prevent the declaration of war .

		Better than any of his countrymen , he knew that the Empire was not prepared to draw the sword in the
Far East	LOCATION	, and he had sounded repeated warnings to the Tsar that the policy of exploiting
Korea	LOCATION	and ignoring the solemn obligation to evacuate
Manchuria	LOCATION	upon the conclusion of the
Boxer	PERSON	rebellion would provoke the Japanese to arms in defense of their interests .

		Nobody in
Russia	LOCATION	understood so well the military preparedness of the Japanese .

		He had visited the rival Empire and had studied her military and financial con - dition .

		But against his advice the Grand
Dukes	PERSON	, and eventually the Tsar , who were interested in the timber exploitation on the Yalu , persisted in the ways of folly until war became inevitable .


Kuropatkin	PERSON	's commission of command was issued
February 20 , 1904	DATE	-- two weeks after the breaking off of diplomatic relations between the Russian and Japanese governments , and two days after the Russian declaration of war .

		Retiring from the position of War Minister , which he had held for six years , the
General	ORGANIZATION	left
St. Petersburg	LOCATION
March 12	DATE	and joined the army at Liao-yang
March 27	DATE	.

		Nominally , he was Commander-in-Chief of the
Manchurian Army of Operations	ORGANIZATION	; but in reality , until
October 25 , 1904	DATE	, he was subordinate to an officer not actually at the front , being designated as assistant to the Viceroy , Admiral
Alexieff	PERSON	, whose headquarters were at
Harbin	LOCATION	.


March 17 , 1905	DATE	, he was superseded by General Linievitch ; so that the period during which
Kuropatkin	PERSON	was in independent command was limited to approx - imately four and a half months .

		The principal events of those four and a half months were the capitulation of Port
Arthur	PERSON	and the disastrous battle of
Mukden	LOCATION	.

		After the appointment of Linievitch to the chief command ,
Kuropatkin	PERSON	continued to serve in a subordinate position in command of the
First Army	ORGANIZATION	until the close of the war .

		After peace was concluded , in Sep - tember ,
1905	DATE	, he remained in
Manchuria	LOCATION	super - intending the demobilization of the Russian forces , proceeding , upon the completion of this task in
1906	DATE	, to his country seat ,
Sheshurino	PERSON	, in the province of
Pskoff	LOCATION	, where he entered upon a life of strict retirement .

		It was while the work of demobilization was still in progress that the
General	ORGANIZATION	undertook the preparation of his history of the war .

		The task was planned and executed on an ambitious scale .

		Of the four ponderous volumes in which the history was eventually published , the first was taken up with a detailed account of the battle of Liao-yang , written in large part by
Colonel Ilinski	PERSON	, of the General Staff ; the second volume , prepared mainly by
Colonel Bolkhovitinoff	PERSON	, dealt in similar fashion with the battle of Sha Ho ; the third volume , on the battle of
Mukden	LOCATION	, and the fourth , a summary of the war , were written by General
Kuropatkin	PERSON	himself .

		The entire work was suppressed by the Russian Gov - ernment almost as soon as it appeared .

		For - tunately , however , it has been made possible for a translation of the most valuable portions to be given to English readers , in the two volumes at present under review .

		Volume I. of the translation contains the Translator 's Preface , the Author 's Introduction , and the first eight chapters of
Kuropatkin	PERSON	's original fourth vol - ume .

		Volume II .

		contains the remaining four chapters of that book , together with the Intro - duction and
Conclusion of Kuropatkin	ORGANIZATION	's third volume -LRB- discussing the antecedents and the con - sequences of the battle of
Mukden	LOCATION	-RRB- , and two useful appendices .

		The English edition is much abridged , but for the student and the general reader alike it contains decidedly the most valu - able portions of the original history .

		What General
Kuropatkin	PERSON	has sought to do is to interpret the events and results of the Russo-Japanese war in the light of the anterior development and present condition of the Rus - sian Empire .

		His earlier chapters take , there - fore , the form of a running sketch of the salient facts of
Russia	LOCATION	's political , military , and economic history during the two hundred years since
Peter	PERSON	the Great .

		These chapters are suggestive , and on the military side especially valuable ; but they constitute , after all , only a background for the consideration of the principal subject dis - cussed in the book -- namely , the reasons for the Russian reverses and the Japanese successes during the recent war .

		In genuinely illumina - ting and informing qualities , the four chapters devoted to this theme have not been surpassed , and it may be doubted whether the Tsar himself , were he so inclined , could speak more authori - tatively upon the subject .

		The causes of
Russia	LOCATION	's failure in the war are classified by
General Kuropatkin	ORGANIZATION	in three groups .

		The first comprises causes '' independ - ent of the war ministry '' -- the lack of diplo - matic arrangements , such as
Prussia	LOCATION	enjoyed in 1870-71 , permitting the massing of the entire armed force against the enemy , the subordinate
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 67 part played by the fleet , the inferiority of the Siberian and Eastern Chinese railways , and the internal disorders in
Russia	LOCATION	, which affected the spirit of the army .

		The second group of causes includes those dependent on the
War Ministry	ORGANIZATION	, for which officers in the field were not responsible -- the delay in mobilizing the reinforcements for the Far East , the delay in promoting those who distinguished themselves in the field , the deficiencies in technical equip - ment and in the personnel of both officers and men .

		The third group -- those for which offi - cers in the field were alone responsible -- com - prise the absence of a true military feeling among the troops , the lack of determination on the part of commanders of all degrees to carry out the tasks entrusted to them , and the break - down of the organization under the stress of war .

		Viewing the question from the other side , Gen - eral
Kuropatkin	PERSON	considers that the Japanese won in the struggle because of the preponderance of their fleet , their superior acquaintance with the theatre of land operations , their immense advan - tages in communication and the transport of supplies , their intellectual alertness and their readiness to profit by experience . ''

		But the principal thing , '' concludes the writer , '' which gave success to the Japanese was their high moral tone .

		It made victory seem worth any sacrifice , and led directly to that determination to win which characterized all ranks from Commander-in-Chief to private soldier ... One thing is certain : that if the whole army had not been saturated with patriotism , if it had not felt the friendly support of the nation behind it , if it had not realized the supreme importance of the struggle , the endeavors of its leaders would have been in vain . ''

		Broadly speaking , says
Kuropatkin	PERSON	, `` we underestimated
Japan	LOCATION	's power , particularly her moral strength , and entered upon the war far too lightly . ''

		Notwithstanding all of this , it is interesting to note -- and herein lies the predominating argu - ment of the book -- the author 's belief that the war was brought to a premature conclusion , that peace was declared at a moment when victory lay within
Russia	LOCATION	's grasp , when her strength was at its maximum and when that of
Japan	LOCATION	had begun to ebb .

		The larger part of the army in the field is declared to have shared this convic - tion .

		The author maintains , in the first place , that at the time when peace was concluded
Russia	LOCATION	's material forces were steadily growing .

		In evidence of this he cites the fact that during the war the carrying capacity of the Siberian Railway was increased sixfold , that at the end of the war the army , already a million strong , was still growing , and that the state of supplies , stores , and equipment far surpassed that obtain - ing : when war was declared .

		It is maintained , in the second place , that the army had undergone marked improvement in morale , and the author tells at some length of the measures which were instituted during the period of his command to promote the spirit of earnestness and comrade - ship among the soldiery .

		And , finally , the attempt is made , with a certain measure of success , to demonstrate that in
1905	DATE	'' the enemy 's army began to weaken in a moral as well • as a material sense , '' on account of the heavy casualties , the draft system , scarcity of funds , and the indifference to her successes which
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	were beginning to exhibit .

		That , in the midst of these conditions , the serious state of
Russia	LOCATION	's internal affairs and the sluggishness of the Russian people compelled a premature abandonment of the war , is regarded !

		by the author as an unmitigated calamity . ''

		The consequences , '' he writes , '' of making such a peace , by which
Japan	LOCATION	was recognized as
Russia	LOCATION	's conqueror in
Asia	LOCATION	, will have serious results , not only for us but for all of the Powers who have possessions or interests on that con - tinent .

		The ' Yellow Peril , ' the appearance of which has only recently been foreseen , is now a reality .

		Notwithstanding her victorious issue from the war ,
Japan	LOCATION	is hurriedly increasing her i forces , while
China	LOCATION	is forming a large army under the guidance of Japanese officers and on the Japanese model .

		In a very short space of time she and
Japan	LOCATION	will be able to pour an army of more than 1,500,000 into
Manchuria	LOCATION	, which , if directed against us , could proceed to take a great deal of
Siberia	LOCATION	from
Russia	LOCATION	, and reduce her to a second-rate Power . ''

		It is apparent from this , and from other pas - sages that might be cited , that the author expects another war .

		Indeed , he proceeds to point out certain precautions which
Russia	LOCATION	must promptly take if she is to be prepared for the renewal of the struggle .

		She must be in a position inter - nationally to make use of all her troops against the enemy .

		She must have thorough railway communication with the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		She must prepare the waterways of
Siberia	LOCATION	for the carriage of heavy goods in bulk from west to east .

		She must move the army 's base as far as possible from
Europe	LOCATION	into
Siberia	LOCATION	.

		And -- what is most impor - tant , and .

		one may add , most difficult -- she must make ready to carry on a new war , not only with the army but with the whole of a patriotic nation .

		68 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, Stage Plays and Poetical Dramas .

		* Among the plays published during the past winter and
spring	DATE	-LRB- and there have been this year more than usual -RRB- there have been all degrees of excellence .

		Some that need not be named seem to have been good pieces of work for amateur theatricals .

		Nor are such things to be slighted .

		For if one of the requirements of the drama at present be , as so many would have it , an educated theatrical management , certainly another requirement is an educated audience .

		And for an audience to have a good appreciation of the technical side of a play , nothing is better than to have had experience in writing and acting plays .

		So the more that sort of thing is well and intelligently done , the more people are there in the country who will want a good drama , and in time will have it .

		Plays that seem somewhat amateur in character are often excellent things in their own way , even though they do not call for much public notice .

		There are also , it must be added , a number among the year 's publica - tions which can not come under this head , and which still fail of any real excellence , but prob - ably it will be best to pass over all such .

		Of the published plays that are really worth while , there are two kinds .

		One is the usual play , as we may call it -- the stage-play , the play written for the stage and acted with more or less effect .

		Such , for instance , is Mr.
Percy Mac	PERSON	- kaye 's '' Mater , '' acted and published last fall .

		This play should perhaps have received extended notice at the time ; and yet it may be as well that it did not , for though certainly a stage suc - cess , it was even on the stage a good deal of a disappointment , and that disappointment became more definite when the book appeared .

		One regrets not to be able always to admire Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	's work , for his effort is so certainly in the right direction .

		Yet '' Mater , '' although a clever piece -LRB- I feel sure -RRB- in stage technique , and undoubtedly amusing in presentation and in point , did not really come near the possibilities that it made obvious .

		The beginning of the play showed what might have been achieved : the end of the play seemed weak because it did not achieve it .

		The play gave a chance to get beyond the farce it really became , into something * Mater .

		which , while amusing and entertaining , should yet show a reach after things of more account .

		That is the trouble with many American plays nowadays .

		They show at the beginning real dramatic possibility , and then develop into farces or melodramas , apparently because our play - wrights can not conceive their ideas fully , or are unable to carry them out , or perhaps because they feel that the audience does not care for such matters .

		In `` Mater , '' Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	had a fine and original conception .

		He seems to have begun with the notion of presenting the power of a brilliant and poetic but common-sense and human personality in the immense chaos of talk and bombast that prevails in
America	LOCATION	to-day .

		Mater could appreciate all the lyrics of her poetical son and her philanthropic daughter , yet she could go each one better by accomplish - ing through simple common-sense the things they sought to accomplish by exalted rhodomon - tade .

		Surely that was a chance : that is
America	LOCATION	in a nutshell ;
America	LOCATION	is just the place for humanity to show itself among the heroics .

		It was a pity that Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	allowed this con - ception to slip away from him while he pursued a farcical and impossible intrigue between Mater and a stage politician .

		We feel a sense of disappointment which we should not feel if the author himself had not shown us what he might have accomplished .

		No such sense attends the performance or the reading of Mr.
Du Maimer	PERSON	's '' An Englishman 's Home '' ; just the reverse is the case .

		In this play one waits expectant through the terrible tedious - ness of the first act , wondering how any power can relieve such a proceeding from oblivion ; and yet , as the play goes on , one becomes more and more absorbed , and , in going from one interest to a greater , sees that the sordid stupidity of the first act was an absolute necessity to the impression that is aimed at .

		The general point of the play is doubtless widely known : it presents an episode in an imaginary invasion of
England	LOCATION	by some other country , now vaguely mentioned as
Nearland	LOCATION	, elsewhere as the Empire of the North .

		The book bears out well the strong impression of the play on the stage , which comes chiefly from the contrast between the superficial sport-loving household of the English , and the foolish inexperience and ignorant courage of her volunteers , and the energetic business-like way of the
Black Dragoons of Her Imperial Majesty	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a hard hit at English life , -- much of it well-deserved without a doubt , and much of it thoroughly appreciated over there .

		Yet it is not merely a hard hit : the author is an English -
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 69 man himself , and shows clearly the true manli - j ness in the midst of the superficial foolishness , i Indeed , even with the slight and stupid sport - ' mad boys and girls there are good points among the bad ones .

		The typical old
John Bull	PERSON	, who at the beginning of the play is learning to play Diabolo with a book , turns at the end into a lion defending his home .

		But with all the strong and good hidden under the weak and foolish , there is not enough , in the general impression , to cope with the business-like way of doing things , the reckoning with realities , of the foreigners .

		But one need not take the play simply as a criticism , needed or not , upon the English .

		Per - haps the same sort of criticism is needed here , though I think that we in
America	LOCATION	need more the criticism that Mater might have given had she been so disposed , the criticism of a warm heart and a clear head upon our wonderful exhibitions of buncombe and bustle .

		The warn - ing of '' An Englishman 's Home '' may not be particularly necessary for
America	LOCATION	, yet it has a significance wider even than
America	LOCATION	; it has that appeal to human nature itself that , where it is sure and clear , makes a thing great .

		The remarkable power of
M. Rostand	PERSON	, I used to think , was because the courageous Cyrano and the slight Due de
Rostand	PERSON	were both such typi - cal figures , giving us a feeling of kinship either with the man who knew himself to be greater than the world could ever rate him , or else with the man who saw in the world opportunities that were his , and yet were too great for him to master .

		In somewhat the same manner , Mr.
Du Maurier	PERSON	's play has its universal appeal , for everyone can feel the force of this tremendous contrast between the light-hearted superficiality that is content to amuse itself from day to day , and the energetic realism that forges ahead slowly in the line of fact .

		Yet even here such an impression as this would fail to make the play effective were it not that it was well - written .

		And it is a consider - able triumph that without the aid of variation of circumstance and with little of strong char - acter Mr.
Du Maurier	PERSON	has made a play of absorbing interest even to those who dislike the melodramatic fusillades that seem to be neces - sary .

		Not only are the general lines of the play well-conceived , but the details are effectively worked out in character as well as in situation .

		It is true to life and uninfluenced by conven - tion .

Reggie Brown	PERSON	, for instance , instead of being roused by the great crisis to become a hero , remains
Reggie Brown	PERSON	to the end ; his * Except in the end of the play as given on the stage .

		sister
Maggie	PERSON	is full of a desire to help and be of use , but has no single practical idea of what to do .

		All this is realism ; it may be that the spectator will think the realism of the first act too strong , there is certainly no let-up in the dead-level of stupidity exhibited by touch after touch .

		Yet not one touch is wrong , and it is probable that each one is necessary to the con - trast which is the life of the piece .

		It is something of a change to turn from '' An Englishman 's Home '' to Mr.
George Cabot	PERSON	Lodge 's '' Herakles , '' and one may inquire why the two shoidd come into the same article .

		The first answer is that both are dramas ; which some may think as satisfactory as it would be to say that both were books . ''

		Herakles '' is a poetic drama , a drama reminiscent of the Greek , although I am not sure that Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	felt himself much bound by the canons of Athenian tragedy .

		It is , then , not so much a stage-play , but rather a poem , which the poet has chosen to cast in dramatic form .

		I am a little more doubt - fid than I used to be as to how far dramas of this sort are comparable with plays written for the present stage .

		A view of a Greek or a Latin play , which one may easily have nowa - days on some university occasion , -- indeed , a view of an Elizabethan play in Elizabethan fashion , -- is likely to take us so far from all ordi - nary dramatic conceptions that we can not make any sort of comparisons with the plays we are used to .

		One comparison with the acting drama we can make .

		`` We can assure ourselves that '' Herakles '' is a very fine piece of work , and that it makes a strong appeal to noble emotions as a great play should .

		It is full of delightful poetry , to which one will recur over and over again ; but it has also its main appeal , or im - pression , by which we may think of it as a defi - nite whole rather than a mere collection of interesting facts .

		From its main idea , as I understand it , I entirely dissent ; but there can be little doubt that the idea is well conceived and strongly enforced .

		At the very beginning , almost with the first words of the weary poet and the chance-met woman , we are impressed with the idea of something of reality behind the beau - tiful imaginative lines which otherwise might absorb our minds like the figures and costumes and scenery at the theatre .

		We have not space to run through the development , -- the hunger of the world for something finer and nobler than their life yet gives , the appearance of Herakles , restless but full of powers and pos - sibilities , the recognition , and , as we may say , 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, self - recognition , -- but it is foolish to try to give the idea .

		One would only spoil the poet 's con - ception , which one ought to get only as he gives it .

		Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	has taken old names and stories and given them essential reality once more .

		I suppose it is not the reality that they had to the Greek ; but that is a matter of archaeology .

		More to the point is it that in these figures , -- the Poet , the Woman ,
Herakles	LOCATION	,
Creon	ORGANIZATION	, -- we have not merely vital personalities , but person - alities of Life as we know it .

		Not in the cir - cumstance in which we see it , of course ; but then , even in Mr.
Du Maurier	PERSON	's play , the cir - cumstance , though more carefully worked out , is really a minor point .

		It is not life in the form in which we know it , but certainly there it is , with its pulsings and its possibilities , very fine , very wonderful , very
august	DATE	.

		I ask myself now and then how the play would seem on the stage ; and always return to the idea that nowadays we can not appreciate poetry when recited , as those did who could not read .

		I do not suppose Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	had the stage in mind when he wrote ; but that is not important , for everything is good on the stage that people like to see , whether meant for the stage or not , and I would far rather see this than much that is actually meant for the stage .

		And however that be , the poem as read is satisfying to the lover of noble thought and lovely imagery .

		Whether it be really a dramatic development , I can not be so sure ; but still the drama is a remarkable achievement , and one of which we may well be proud .

		There is little room left for a word on Mr.
Martin Schiitze	PERSON	's '' Hero and Leander . ''

		Cast in a less classic form than Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	's poem , more modern in its rendering of the life and color of Greek life , this poetic drama aims at and gives a different impression .

		Lacking , as I must think , the power of conceiving its motive that seems needful to impress strikingly the mind , it yet has very considerable imaginative power , both in its figures and its details , and in the curious directness of its verse .

		With all its modernity , however , it has a classic beauty of clearness and outline that gives it an especial and singular charm .

		These plays are all worth reading .

		Perhaps they interest me too much , as representing phases of current literarj r feeling , to appreciate them quite correctly in and for themselves .

		Still , even without regard to literary feelings and fashions , they certainly have in them much that is well worth while .

Arthur Symons	PERSON	as a Critic * Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	's '' Book of Theory , '' as he calls it in the sub-title , is much more than a new edition of his '' Plays , Acting , and Music '' ; more , I mean , than is implied usually by the words .

		He has omitted , added , and changed , until one who possesses the first edition will feel it necessary , in order to keep up with Mr.
Symons	PERSON	, to own this later volume .

		The volume , moreover , is intended to form one of a series in which the author 's critical method as applied to literature and the arts may be set forth .

		The completion of the plan is not probable , in view of the deplorable news that comes with regard to Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's health : his working days , it would appear , are over .

		At its worst , Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's criticism has an effect of the higher journalism : it is a review , done for an occasion .

		The suggestive paper on
Paderewski	ORGANIZATION	is an example .

		But it is delightful , and not without penetrating appreciation and flashes of eloquence .

		At their best , on the other hand , these brief impressionistic talks on the great things of creative endeavor reveal a poet sensitive to beauty and insistent on testing all Art , subjectively but surely , by the test of aesthetic pleasure and that higher pleasure that is of the soul .

		The pages fairly teem with sug - gestive , stimulating , and brilliant remarks , the style in which they are conveyed being noticeable for its warm sensuous simplicity .

		This poet-critic 's theory is not difficult to state , and it is a sound one , to my mind .

		It may be summed up in two sentences of his own : '' In all forms of art , the point of view is of more importance than the subject-matter '' ; and '' art has to do only with the creation of beauty . ''

		This insures breadth of view , because it escapes the danger of making technic the final word : with
Symons	PERSON	, personality is the precious thing which must cooperate with technic to produce the desirable Beauty .

		And he would include among his artists -LRB- since they make beauty -RRB- the actor , the dancer , and the pianist ; they create what is lovely for an instant , but that is enough , for '' art is concerned only with accomplishment , not with duration . ''

		Mr.
Symons	PERSON	varies in manner according as his subject influences him .

		When discoursing of the drama , he is keen , witty , full of fresh thought ; when music is his theme , he is pre - dominately the poet ; if he discusses painting , the aesthetic seems to the fore .

		THE DIAL 71 his work is suggestive ; that perhaps is the mis - sion of the impressionist in criticism , -- to drop seed-thoughts , to arouse by charm of manner , to make us think .

		I find his book , therefore , helpful and attractive , and am saddened by the reflection that such a man in what should be the full prime of his powers must cease from his lit - erarv labor .

		But Mr.

		The Childhood of the Race .

		*
Leo Frobenius	PERSON	is one of the best-known of German ethnographers .

		His Ur sprung der
Afrikaaischen Kulturen	PERSON	is one of the most suggestive and illuminating of books upon Cul - ture History .

		Preeminently a student of things , he has brought together a remarkable private collection of ethnographic objects , and has dili - gently worked through many European museums to acquaint himself with their contents .

		He has been a special student of primitive warfare , of the bows and arrows of the world , of masks and their use and meaning .

		His studies have centered upon
Africa	LOCATION	, and he has now ruade two great expeditions into the continent -- one into the
Kasai	LOCATION	region of the
Congo Free State	ORGANIZATION	, the other into the
Kamerun	PERSON	.

		The narrative of the earlier of these journeys has been printed , and contains much valuable information and sugges - tion .

		Most of his writings exist only in German , and therefore those who desire the advance of knowledge and interest in ethnographic science , among non-professional readers especially , will welcome the appearance of one of his most pop - ular and least technical works in an English translation . ''

		The Childhood of Man '' appeals chiefly to a popular audience .

		To the serious student or the ethnologist , its value is more suggestive than informative .

		Frobenius is independent and bold to a degree .

		His fellow - workers do not assent to many of his most cherished dogmas , and much of his most brilliant work is viewed with serious misgiving or open hostility by them .

		What he writes is always interesting , often original , and usually deserves considera - tion .

		The alternative title of the book before us states it to be `` a popular account of the lives , customs , and thoughts of the primitive races . ''

		The book consists of thirty-two chap - * The Chtldhood of Max .

		By
Leo Frobenius	PERSON	.

		Phila - delphia :

		ters , essays really , upon practices of savage and barbarous life .

		Some of the subjects presented are discussed in a single chapter ; for the elucida - tion of others , several chapters each are needed .

		This unevenness of importance in the topics treated is a defect in the book .

		There is no serious development of all the phases of the life of lower cultures , but rather the stringing together of a series of disconnected essays .

		Such topics as tattooing , drums , drum-language , skull-worship and head-hunting , ancestor wor - ship and fetichism , secret societies and masks , the path of the sun , early history of war and warlike peoples , are specialties of the author , and their presentation is at once most informa - tive , most suggestive , and most dangerous .

		The greater part of Frobenius 's material is drawn from
Africa	LOCATION	and
Melanesia	LOCATION	; some is from
Polynesia	LOCATION	, some from
America	LOCATION	.

		His best material and his real value in discussion is in the African and Melanesian field .

		He is at his worst in discussing American themes .

		Thus , the chapter upon picture-writing and decoration is a poor rehash of two well-known and easily accessible
Bureau of American Ethnology	ORGANIZATION	papers .

		Were there an object in the chapter , or were the material well used or the matter carefully digested , we should not complain .

		One can but be surprised at
Frobenius	ORGANIZATION	's use of the term '' primitive . ''

		Surely the bulk of the populations upon which he draws most heavily for material are far from primitive .

		The book is illustrated with more than four hundred cuts , mostly of artefacts .

		Dr.
A. H. Keane	PERSON	has edited and translated the work .

		His contributions to ethnology and ethnography are so many and serious that criti - cism seems ungracious .

		It appears to us , how - ever , that he has made an unwarranted and undesirable addition to
Frobenius	ORGANIZATION	's book .

		The author himself would have improved the work by omitting all the American Tndian material ; he is not well acquainted with our field , either as a museum worker or field investigator .

		Dr.
Keane	PERSON	further weakens the book by introducing eight full-page plates reproduced from '' exces - sively rare water-colours belonging to the British Museum . ''

		They are over three hundred years old , u being taken directly from the volume of admirable drawings in water-colours executed by
John White	PERSON	, one of the pioneer settlers in
Virginia	LOCATION	, to which he made five voyages and of which he was , for a short time , made Governor by Sir
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	... '' The pictures are interesting enough in themselves , but they have nothing whatever to do with this book ; they do 72 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, not fit the plan , or the style , or the argument .

		Nor does the information accompanying them as legends help us much .

		The pictures have , per - haps , sufficient interest to warrant their inde - pendent publication with descriptive and explan - atory text , historical citations , references , and the like ; but here they are thrown away .

		It is a pity that Dr.
Keane	PERSON	has not given them to us in the way indicated , rather than in this work .

		Pious Meditations from the Quarter-Deck .

		* Religious literature , reflective and devotional , hardly stands any longer at the bar of general criticism .

		Its standards are too narrow , its purposes too restricted .

		It commends itself , if at all , to a circle which radiates from the same centres of belief .

		Those belonging to another spiritual habitat easily fall into indifference or repulsion . ''

		The Harvest Within : Being Thoughts on the Life of a Christian '' is a work of devout and disjointed meditations , springing from a narrow and inflexible creed .

		It must be chiefly of interest to those who share its convictions .

		One is somewhat surprised to find
Saul	PERSON	among the prophets -- to find Captain
Mahan	PERSON	, who deals with naval affairs so lengthily , inter - estedly , and jauntily , also one of those who hold to and unfold religious impressions in a manner consonant with the ministry .

		Yet , as a matter of fact , such a union is not strange .


John Newton	PERSON	found the deck of a slaver a not unfavorable place for devout reflections .

		Our religious life , like our ships , may be built with compartments .

		We hope in extremity to be saved by opinions carefully divided from our daily activities .

		The chief feature of our faith seems at times to be the quickness and decision with which we can shut it up within itself .

		Naval thought , naval forecast , and a national life to be built up by naval skill , may not be inharmonious with a spiritual world chiefly permeated with the sense of power .

		Napoleon looked at military preparation as the assurance of safety in the circumstances by which he was surrounded .

		He filled the world with violence , and then regarded violence as giving the clue of action .

		tains its footing with the ready exercise of force .

		It is a mistake to suppose that religious beliefs and social beliefs at war with each other can not be entertained in the same minds .

		They may be so separated and so united that they make good deficiencies and give plausible terms of con - duct .

		The incongruity of incongruous things may be lost to the intellect and yet be present in character .

		The progress which religious thought has made , and is still making , lies chiefly in find - ing the medium of communication and interpre - tation between us and the spiritual world more continuous , more empirical ; a bridge on which the feet may continually pass and repass though its two abutments are wide apart .

		The method in religious inquiry has not been unlike that in the early research into the formation of the world .

		A cataclysm was always close at hand ready to explain any change .

		Constructive forces were overlooked or underrated .

		The feeling did not prevail that these forces gave rise to every apparent cataclyism , and that each cataclysm returned at once to these usual activities .

		Religious beliefs have propagated each other , and no need has been felt of a constant reference to some familiar experience open to us all .

		The world , physical and spiritual , lies between us and God , the most undeniable and explanatory proof of his being and government ; the nearest , plain - est , and most constant of his activities .

		This perpetual presence we have dealt with carelessly , as if we had some other and better terms of apprehending him .

		The world , as spiritual as it is physical , spir - itual always and everywhere in formation and development , instead of being regarded as a con - stant revelation , has been looked on as an island on which men have been marooned , to make what gains they can of it .

		The world , the flesh , and the devil have been alike hostile to redemp - tion , and the remedy against them has partaken of the nature of extermination .

		The divine work has been but partially understood , and we have striven to partake of it without being in har - mony with it .

		A partial revelation has received a harsh rendering , and by means of it we have been brought into conflict with the habitual rev - elation which envelopes us with spiritual incen - tives .

		An historic
Bible	LOCATION	,
Hebrew Psalmist	ORGANIZATION	and Prophet , one phase of growth and disclosure , have been employed to limit and arrest the progress to which they were designed to con - tribute .

		They are what they are by appealing to the human mind , and working with it in its own channels .

		We are thought to have rational
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 73 powers sufficient to discover the authority of truth , but not sufficient to understand and grow by the truth itself .

		This is seen in the distrust , extending even to conflict , which grows up between morality and religion .

		Morality stands for the knowledge which , by insight and experience , we come to attain of the relations in conduct which we bear to our fellowmen : the germs by whose develop - ment we are made ready for the
Kingdom of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	.

		Religion often establishes itself on some narrow dogma , as that of justice , and so renders but little heed to the patience , repents ance , and forgiveness finding wav in the social world .

		There is a substitution in thought of God 's righteousness and God 's gifts for our righteousness and gifts ; as if we might have an experience of God 's excellence and favor aside from our own attainment .

		He that truly mag - nifies human power , equally magnifies divine power of which it is the highest expression .

		Our author thinks that what we call '' human hero - ism comes to us because we reject the power that God supplies . ''

		When the human mind acts successfully , when it interprets correctly the divine plan and concurs with the divine method , it is most conspicuously religious .

		It is a strange antagonism which is established between divine wisdom and human wisdom , divine goodness and human goodness . ''

		In nothing , '' says our author , '' was more conspicuous the downward tendency of a recent falling from faith than when the man said of the Sermon on the Mount .

		• These things I accept , not because
Christ	PERSON	said them , but because they commend themselves to my conscience , to my own moral sense . '

		It would be difficult to phrase more pathetically the distinction between human righteousness and God 's righteousness . ''

		When the two cease to be identical , cease to illustrate and sustain each other , the spiritual world will drop into a confusion to which there can be no redemption .

		There is a religion in which salvation seems to consist in saving unbroken its own intellectual connections , and hardly at all in bringing to the world an harmonious extension of every just impulse , every kindly feeling .

		We do not say of this faith that it does no good , or of `` The Harvest Within '' that a considerable share of it is tares which the reapers , in the final gather - ing , will be charged to separate from wheat , for this is the common lot of all human thought ; but we do say that if the tares and wheat are to grow together it would be wiser to sow the purest seed we have .

		The winnowing process of the world takes place in the world itself : the winds scattering the light and vagrant material and letting the heavy kernels fall to the ground .

		We are content to wait for these living agencies to separate , in the future as in the past , the good and the evil which men are still so freely con - founding .

		The city of the Leaning Tourer A valuable addition to the Dent -
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	series of volumes on u Mediaeval Towns '' is one which tells '' The Story of
Pisa	LOCATION	. ''

		Few travellers in
Italy	LOCATION	give to
Pisa	LOCATION	the time that it really deserves .

		Either they stop over one train en route from
Genoa	LOCATION	to
Rome	LOCATION	, or they take a single day 's excursion to it from
Florence	LOCATION	, In either case , there is a tradition that the Leaning Tower and the buildings of its group are ■ all that is worth seeing . ''

		Few , perhaps , realize that
Pisa	LOCATION	is one of the most ancient cities of
Italy	LOCATION	, was famous when
Rome	LOCATION	was but a hamlet , and that it once treated on terms of equality with
Chris	PERSON	- tian Emperors in
Germany	LOCATION	and in
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		with Moslem Soldans in
Bagdad	LOCATION	and in
Alexandria	LOCATION	.

		To deal with this long and varied history -- Pre - Roman , Roman , Lombard , Mediaeval ,
Florentine	ORGANIZATION	, and Italian -- in brief space is not easy , but it has been done successfully by Mrs.
Janet Ross	PERSON	in the opening hundred pages of this volume .

		The parts which the modern traveller will perhaps value most , however , are the three hundred pages that follow , containing the description of the city with drawings by Miss
Xelly Erichsen	PERSON	.

		Besides interesting chapters about the most conspicuous `` sights , '' the traveller will find a great deal usually ignored by the guide - books , especially the history of its palaces and the people who have occupied them from time to time . ''

		No lovelier street can be seen in the whole world , '' wrote a traveller , in the year
1425	DATE	, of the Lung ` Arno ; and although only two or three of the palaces seen by him have survived , his description is almost , if not quite , true to-day .

		For although less picturesque in its buildings than the Lung '
Arno	PERSON	of
Florence	LOCATION	, it surpasses it in beauty of line .

		The Arno itself is a statelier stream here than at
Florence	LOCATION	; broad and full , it has gathered the waters of many affluents and rushes swiftly through the city as if eager to reach the sea .

		Congenial to poets ,
Pisa	LOCATION	has always proved .

		74 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, Our debt to our insect neighbors .

		Professor
John B. Smith	PERSON	, author of '' Our Insect Friends and Enemies '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , has brought his sub - ject home to us in a way that admirably combines the scientific and the practical .

		The housekeeper who wishes to know more about the '' hexapod '' that is troubling her than merely its name , the farmer who wishes to know what insects are helpful and what harmful , and the casual person in search of general information , will all find here what is wanted .

		Having carefully marked off the insect from other animals by defining it as '' a ringed animal with six jointed legs , breathing by means of air tubes or trachea ?

		, '' the author goes on to treat of it in its relation to plants , to other insects -- having regard to that balance of survival so important to man but so little understood by him -- to other animals , to man , and especially to the farmer .

		A final chapter is given to the `` War on Insects , '' and is full of the kind of wisdom that can be assimilated and applied .

		There is a colored plate of the commonest insects as a frontispiece , and the illustrations from microscopic slides , much enlarged , are numerous and plainly marked .

		One might gather from these illustrations that all insects , with their goggly eyes , their bristly legs and horn-like antennae , would be uncomfort - able and dangerous neighbors ; but Professor
Smith	PERSON	assures us that on the whole they probably do more good than harm .

		He says , for instance , that '' were all insect scavengers removed at one time and all dead animal and vegetable material left to other decays , the foulness and noxious odors that would be thus let loose are beyond all description . ''

		As an example of their usefulness in fertilizing plants , he gives the history of fig-growing in
Southern Cal	LOCATION	- ifornia , and shows how '' a new industry , absolutely depending upon a minute hymenopterous insect , was finally established on a firm and scientific basis . ''

		Of the family of insects , he says in his preface : '' Their presence or absence may make all the dif - ference between sickness and health , irritation and comfort , poverty or wealth , or , on the other hand , wealth and poverty . ''

		The service which this book renders in giving us accurate and easily available knowledge on this little-understood subject is ines - timable .

		It may seem a curious thing that a scholar and college professor like Mr.
Harry Thurston Peck	PERSON	should be so prone to leave his academic labors in
Latin	LOCATION	to exhibit himself to the reading public in the guise of a student of anything else .

		His latest contribution to the book - sellers is '' Studies in Several Literatures '' -LRB-

Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The `` studies `` are chiefly from English ,
American	ORGANIZATION	, and French literature , and being lightly and plausibly set forth they may serve to beguile an otherwise idle hour at a
summer	DATE	resort .

		If , however , we desire to estimate them more seri - ously , it will be enough to read the essay on
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		Emerson and
Longfellow	LOCATION	, Professor
Peck	PERSON	thinks , are the greatest American authors , or at least the two Rummages in several literatures .

		who are surest of surviving ; and of the two , he thinks
Emerson	PERSON	the greater , because while Long - fellow has '' beauty and fitness of form ''
Emerson	PERSON	has '' intellectual quality . ''

		We may suppose of the latter , then , that he is worth serious effort .

		But if we look to see what Professor
Peck	PERSON	has to say on
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's intellectuality , we find only that
Emerson	PERSON	has no system of philosophy , that he is a fountain of isolated thought , that he was a champion of intel - lectual freedom , that he gave supreme devotion to the doctrine of an intense individualism , and that he teaches in aphorisms .

		Now as these are matters that everyone is familiar with who has read a text-book of literature , we may ask how a man could proceed to a study of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	knowing less , and if he gained no more what could be the nature of his study ?

		If we may judge from these '' studies , '' Professor
Peck	PERSON	is not a student in the ordinary sense : he is one who picks up commonplaces about people and things , and expresses them in a smart and chirpy style which furnishes his readers a moderate degree of entertain - ment .

		But the knack of using a breezy style for giving distinction to the commonplace , of saying dis - putable things in such a cock-sure way , is one that may be overworked ; and the reader comes to feel that Professor
Peck	PERSON	does push this dependence pretty far .

		Dr.
Charles F. Johnson	PERSON	's `` Shake - A guide to • • `` ... '' m 1 \ Shakespearian speare and his Critics -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- criticism .

		j s a mos t useful book -- a veritable literary
Baedeker	PERSON	.

		It attempts to outline the entire field of Shakespearean criticism , both textual and literary , -- British ,
American	ORGANIZATION	, and foreign .

		No previous work has tried to cover this wide field .

		The judgments of Professor
Johnson	PERSON	upon the vari - ous critics are well considered .

		His own incidental comments upon the many questions that arise are penetrating and valuable , and are choicely expressed .

		The book is evidently the ripe fruit of many years of study and reflection .

		It seems strange , however , that although the work gives much space to Amer - icans the name of
Henry N. Hudson	PERSON	is not men - tioned .

		In accuracy , and in some of the details of book-making , the work is faulty .

		Many titles are incorrect or inadequate ; e.g. , `` the Stationer 's Book , '' '' the New Shakespearean Society . ''

		That an emenda - tion of
Rowe	PERSON	-LRB- p. 88 -RRB- and a reading of a First Quarto -LRB- p. 90J should be attributed to Pope , is perhaps pardonable .

		Graver mistakes are : the statement that ''
Lear	PERSON	is carried from
Leicester	LOCATION	to
Dover	LOCATION	'' ; the omission of '' Love 's Labour 's Won '' from
Meres	ORGANIZATION	's list of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays -LRB- 1598 -RRB- ; and the giving of the name
William Kyd	PERSON	to the supposed author of the lost play of '' Hamlet . ''

		On page 52 a quotation from
Kipling	LOCATION	is dreadfully mangled .

		A chief defect in the book is that the paragraphs cited from the critics and the many passages quoted from Shake - speare himself are not located .

		The latter are often cited because containing typical emendations .

		Since the information given by Professor
Johnson	PERSON	in these cases is necessarily scanty , and is not always entirely
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 75 accurate , the failure to give exact references is unfor - tunate .

		In spite of its defects , the book is cordially commended as a helpful guide to the more important literature concerning
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		illuminating To deliver the Lane Lectures for chapter * on old
1908	DATE	,
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	was for - Greek hutorian * .

		tuna te enough to secure Dr.
J. B. Bury	PERSON	,
Regius Professor of History	ORGANIZATION	in the
University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	.

		The lecturer chose as his general theme u The Ancient Greek Historians '' ; and the addresses are now published in an interesting vol - ume -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Long ago Professor Bury estab - lished a reputation for penetrating criticism and genuine historical acumen , as well as for felicity of presentation ; and all these qualities are manifest in the present work .

		His pen passes illuminatingly from '' The Rise of Greek History '' to the later historians and u The Influence of Greek on Roman Historiography . ''

		The least satisfactory pages are those dealing with Roman writers ; and the lectures as printed would have been little poorer if these had been omitted .

		The most interesting chapters are probably the two on
Thucydides	LOCATION	, where Professor Bury is at his best .

		The index is adequate , and the bibliography nearly so , although the latter might have been enlarged without including negligible studies .

		The volume is appropriately dedicated to Mr.
Gar	PERSON	- diner
M. Lane	PERSON	, ' * who founded the lectureship some years ago in the interests of humanistic study . ''

		Those of us who have followed Professor Bury 's writings , and have also happened to hear him speak , must envy his auditors at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	as we turn these pages .

		The next best thing for those who are inter - ested in the subject will be to read the book .

		Mr.
Thomas Cooper DeLeon	PERSON	, prolific 2
# 2 # # X	MONEY	auth ° r `` d
P %	PERCENT	wright , well known for his `` Confederate Memories , '' his '' Four Years in Rebel Capitals , '' and his '' Life of General
Joseph Wheeler	PERSON	, '' has produced another book of Southern souvenirs and character sketches entitled u Belles .

		Beaux , and Brains of the 60 's '' -LRB-
Dillingham	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Born in
South Carolina	LOCATION	, four years in the Confederate service , and now a resident of Mobile , the author is a thorough Southerner , u dyed in the wool '' and his chatty and attractive volume proves it unequivocally .

		In his very first chapter , in a characteristic protest against Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's un - preposessing picture of the slaveholder , it is pointed out that the brutality toward the negro detailed in • • L ncle
Tom	PERSON	's Cabin '' is all committed by a
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	overseer .

		Life and society in
Richmond	LOCATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	, and elsewhere in the lower latitudes of our broad land , are recalled with many illustrative anecdotes and references to historic events and famous char - acters .

		The portraits scattered through the volume are almost beyond counting , and help to vitalize these pages from a vanished past .

		The book will interest especially those older readers of Southern antecedents who are fond of recalling good old times '' before the war . ''

		Leaves from the life of a Turkish lady '' Haremlik '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is the work of
Demetra Vaka	PERSON	, now Mrs.
Kenneth Brown	PERSON	, a native of
Constantinople	LOCATION	and for a long time a resident in
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		We are told that the book is not fiction , although the Fore - word troubles the reader somewhat by confessing that `` there has been some rearranging of facts . ''

		Mrs.
Brown	PERSON	visited
Constantinople	LOCATION	again after six years in this country , and found her girl friends pro- vided -- for the most part comfortably and happily provided -- with a fraction of a husband apiece .

		She claims to furnish an impartial account of the working of a system which , like other systems , is compounded of good and evil ; but her own conclu - sion , both as to the merits of what she saw and the I manner in which nations and individuals should be allowed to find their way to the light , is evidently expressed in her word to the Turkish '' suffragettes '' : ' • Since you do not like your system , -- although it seems to me admirable on the whole , -- it is only right that you should be allowed to live your lives as you want to .

		Only , you must go about it in a sensible way , and take into consideration the others who are involved in it '' Whatever may be the book 's value as documentary evidence for the sociol - ogist , -- and it is probably not impersonal enough or general enough to give it a great deal of value in that direction , -- it is stirringly written , and two or three little incidents of childhood companionships , in particular , are told almost as prettily as anything of ' the kind in literature .

		From the industrious pen of the Rev. oJthl ` Za ^ me .

		P - H - Litchfield there has appeared a good-sized volume of clerical anec - dotes and legend and history , under the attractive title , ■ The Old-time Parson '' -LRB-
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The same author issued not long ago a well-received work on '' The Parish Clerk , '' and now deems it '' only fair that the occupant of the higher tier of the ' three-decker ' should share his honour . ''

		A friend of the writer placed at his disposal `` a manuscript collection of clerical stories '' which he had been get - ting together for many years .

		Consequently there is no lack of illustrative anecdote in the book ; and as clerical wit is proverbially of good quality , the volume yields abundant entertainment .

		The
Saxon	PERSON	parson and the mediaeval parson have each a chapter , neces - sarily somewhat short , to themselves .

		Chaucer 's u poor parson of a town '' is of course presented in the poet 's own descriptive verse , and '' Piers Plow - man '' is made to furnish a pertinent passage .

		But the chapter on '' The Parson in Literature '' might easily have been extended to include more of the familiar pulpit-founders of fiction .


Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	, for example , has pictured the country curate with a pitiless fidelity that should not be passed over .

		Among the witty parsons .

		Dr. South and
Bishop Wil	ORGANIZATION	- berforce figure conspicuously , and
Robert Stephen Hawker	PERSON	fails not to appear among the eccentric parsons .

		Numerous portraits and other illustrations contribute their share of interest to the volume .

		76 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, Transformation , From the facts of paleontology comes in the world of the evidence which in the last analysis animal life .

		most definitely and cogently attests that in the history of the living things which people the earth there has been an organic evolution or transformation .

		A hook which marshals the data of paleontology and shows their bearing on the prob - lems of evolution is particularly timely in the year when all over the world men are doing honor to the memory of
Darwin	LOCATION	.

		Such a book is
M. Charles Depe	PERSON	` ret 's '' Transformation of the Animal World , '' the latest addition to the `` International Scientific Series '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		In these days when the dominant trend in the investigation of evolution problems is to apply the experimental method , it is refreshing to be brought back once in a while to the literally as well as metaphorically solid evolutionary record afforded by the fossils .

		Broadly speaking , the aim of the present book may be said to be to show , on the basis of the paleontological data now in hand , the phyletic history of the larger groups of animals existing to-day .

		Doing this furnishes the occasion for discussing the probable methods through which the observed transformation of animals may be held to have occurred , and also for outlining briefly the history of opinion on these points .

		Occasionally the translator -LRB-
F. Legge	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- slips up on a technical detail , but in general the style is accurate and pleasing .

		It was high time that someone wrote USSSSSt an out-door book for Midsummer , and the only defect in Mr.
Winthrop Packard	PERSON	's `` Wild Pastures '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is that the title does not indicate the scope and ' character of the work .

		Somewhere in his
Eastern Massachusetts	ORGANIZATION	pasture Mr.
Packard	PERSON	has discovered a spring of words that express , as nearly as it would seem that words can express , the magic of the '' Arabian days '' of
June	DATE	,
July	DATE	, and
August	DATE	.

		Here where the '' cosmos of the wild has wiped out that curious chaos which we call civilization '' he waylays the dawn of
June	DATE	mornings and '' stalks '' the wild grape whose fragrance makes him '' dream of pipes of Pan playing in the morning of the world , while all the wonder creatures of the old Greek myths dance in rhythm and sing in soft undertones , and the riot of young life bubbles within them . ''

		Beside the pasture brook in the hot
summer	DATE	days he gets glimpses of the life of the rock-bass and horn-pout , and in the moonlight nights he watches the witch faces on the hazel-bushes '' detach themselves from the limbs , put on their red caps and sail off across the great yellow disk '' of the full moon .

		He watches the bluebirds and tanagers with as much interest in their moulting as he has taken in their nesting , and is acquainted with the personnel and separate instru - ments of the frog-pond orchestra .

		Through the long
summer	DATE	drought he sees how there is '' in all the pasture people a certain puritanical sternness of de - meanor , a set holding-fast to the narrowing good of life , a tightening of the muscles that are weary with a long strain but may not for the good of the soul loose their firm grip , '' until the first Fall rain releases them from their suffering .

		The book is satisfactory for not attempting too much , and accomplishing what it attempts delicately and well .

		A few draw - ings by Mr.
Copeland	PERSON	help the reader to visualize the text .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		A
Pocket Lexicon	ORGANIZATION	and Concordance to the Temple Shakespeare '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- supplements that admirable edition in a very useful way , besides being independently valuable as an aid to the Shakespearian student .

		It gives us a great deal of matter compressed within the limits of a volume that is in the strictest sense pocketable . ''

		The Statesman 's Year Book '' for
1909	DATE	, edited by Messrs.
J. Scott Keltie	PERSON	and
I. P. A. Renwick	PERSON	, is pub - lished by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is the forty-sixth annual issue of this invaluable book of reference .

		A few economies of space have been effected , and there are matters of special interest concerning the Belgian annexation of the
Congo	LOCATION	, the Constitution of
Turkey	LOCATION	, and new political conditions in
Bosnia	LOCATION	,
Bulgaria	LOCATION	,
Sweden	LOCATION	,
Persia	LOCATION	, and
China	LOCATION	.

		An important addition is found in the section devoted to the Hague Tribunal . ''

		Some
Hidden Sources of Fiction	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Benjamin Matthias Nead	PERSON	, is a small volume printed for private circulation by
Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It turns out to be , after a few introductory paragraphs , a tracing of the indebtedness of Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	, in his '' Seats of the Mighty , '' to the '' Memoirs of Major
Robert Stabo	PERSON	, of the
Virginia	LOCATION	Regiment , '' published in
Pittsburg	LOCATION	in
1854	DATE	.

		A clear case of borrowing is made out , and it would seem that the novelist might appro - priately have acknowledged the source of so many of the incidents of his book .

		Volume II .

		of `` Islandica , '' edited by Mr.
George William Harris	PERSON	, and published by the
Cornell University Library	ORGANIZATION	, consists of a bibliography of '' The Northmen in
America	LOCATION	, '' prepared , mainly upon the basis of the
Fiske	PERSON	collection of Icelandic literature , by Mr.
Halldor Hermannsson	PERSON	.

		Many of the titles are annotated , and the work is a valuable guide to the literature of the sub - ject .

		Much fantastic rubbish is found in this catalogue , which admits vain speculations about
Norumbega	ORGANIZATION	and the old English mill at
Newport	LOCATION	to the company of serious scientific discussions ; but it is all very properly grist for the bibliographer , even if it illustrates nothing more than '' a prodigious play of the imagination , un - restrained by any knowledge of the subject . ''

		XOTES .

		Dr.
William Edgar Geil	PERSON	, who has just returned from his latest journey of exploration , is said to be the first man to have traversed the whole length -LRB- over 1700 miles -RRB- of
China	LOCATION	's stupendous fortifications .

		The com - plete journey is described in his forthcoming book , '' The Great Wall of
China	LOCATION	, '' announced by the
Sturgia & Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		F.
Marion Crawford	PERSON	's last novel '' The New
Gover	PERSON	- ness , '' is described as a story of English country life , and the heroine is a charming girl who masquerades as an ugly , deformed , and shy school-room dragon .

		It is stated that Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	left also the MS. of another
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 77 novel , as well as that of a '' History of the Papacy in the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The first volume of a three - volume '' History of
Rome	LOCATION	in the Middle Ages , '' in which he had collaborated with Professor
Tomassetti	PERSON	, is now in type .

		Simultaneous with the news of the arrival of Lieu - tenant
Ernest H. Shackleton	PERSON	in
London	LOCATION	* came the announcement that his book , giving a full account of his eventful Antarctic expedition of 1907-9 , would be published in
November	DATE	by
J. B. Lippincott Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will be issued in two crown quarto volumes , and illus - strated with color plates and reproductions from photo - graphs taken by the author .

		As a forthcoming instalment in their ''
Shakespeare Library	ORGANIZATION	, ''
Messrs. Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish early in the Fall '' The Shakespeare Allusion Book , '' in two octavo volumes .

		The work will contain all known references , or allusions , to
Shakespeare	PERSON	and his plays before the close of the seventeenth century .

		For the first time these '' allusions , '' originally collected by Dr.
Ingleby	PERSON	,
Miss L. Toulmin Smith	PERSON	, and Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	, will be arranged in chronological order and supplemented with explanatory notes .

		Professor
Frederick Starr	PERSON	, the anthropologist and lecturer at the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, much of whose time is spent in travel and researches in foreign lands , will leave early in
September	DATE	for another extended trip to
Japan	LOCATION	, where , with the aid of native assistants , he will undertake on a large scale the task of investigating and collecting the valuable anthropological , ethnograph - ical , and archieological material contained in Japanese books -- a mass of important matter almost unknown and inaccessible to the outside world .

		An expert pho - tographer will be a member of the party , with whose aid Professor
Starr	PERSON	expects to enlarge our knowledge of present-day
Japan	LOCATION	by making some complete photo - graphic records of its scenery , life , arts and industries , architecture , etc. .

		One of the most important and interesting of the autumn books will be the '' Autobiography of
Henry M. Stanley	PERSON	, '' edited by Lady
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	, for which
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	have secured the American edition .

		A part of
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's notable and adventurous career is told in his famous book , '' Through Darkest Africa '' ; but here for the first time in his own words we have the com - plete story of his life , -- his youth in
America	LOCATION	, his service and experiences in the Civil War , his return to
England	LOCATION	, his early dreams and ambitions , with the narrative of their complete fulfillment .

		We also have for the first time told in his Autobiography and the supplementary narrative , which is made up from his letters , the inner history of many important events and episodes which have not hitherto been made public .

		-- N. Y. Times . ''

		It pulsates with humor , interest , passionate love , adventure , pathos -- every page is woven with threads of human nature , life as we know it , life as it is , and above it all a spirit of right - eousness , true piety , and heroic patriotism .

For its sheer truth it deserves a high place among the novels that deal with American life .

		BRIEFER MENTION 104 NOTES 104 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 105 FIVE FEET OF CULTURE .

		The story of the parvenu who builds a pala - tial home , finds that a library with so many feet of shelving is included in the specifications , and orders it to be filled with books , has often been imagined .

		It is somewhat worn , this jest of stocking a library by linear measurement , but it is fairly expressive of the bewildered state of mind of a person who accepts `` the library '' as one of the necessary adjuncts of the well - appointed household , and who is desirous that the appearance of culture shall not be lacking in his establishment .

		And in fact , the man who has been too busy in acquiring wealth to become a reader might easily do worse than get his bookish furniture in this way .

		An order like this , placed in the hands of a library expert , or a really intelligent bookseller -LRB- for such there are -RRB- , might have unanticipated consequences ; it might open real resources of thought to the owner , hitherto untravelled in the world of books , or it might prove unexpectedly helpful in shaping the minds of the children who are growing up in the house .

		Better far such a selection as this than any the householder would be likely to make for himself ; immeasurably better than any that would result from heeding the pleas of the wily book-agent , with his fraudulent editions de luxe and his subscription sets of standard authors .

		That way lies despair , not so much for the deluded victim as for the friends who wish him well and would gladly give him of their counsel .

		A recent instance of the reduction of literary culture to linear terms is provided by Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's widely-discussed selection of books for a five - foot shelf .

		This is a matter of much human concern ; for it affects , not the plutocrat in his palace , but the toiler in his hovel -- or his flat , to use the modern equivalent .

		Even the most modest example of that ingenious device for cellular housing will afford five feet of shelf - room somewhere , and the half - hundred books that fill it will be so en evidence that a good deal depends upon what kind of books they are .

		TYTien Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	made out his list , he probably attempted nothing more than to indicate , from his ripe educational experience , the sort of books 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, that should be kept near at hand by any person who really wished to come in contact with the best that had been thought and said in the world .

		It was a simple and helpful suggestion , similar to many others of its kind , made without a touch of dogmatism or intellectual arrogance .

		Doubt - less the last thing in the world that Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	meant to do was to sit in judgment upon the world 's literature , or to winnow the wheat from the chaff .

		His was no selection of the '' hun - dred best books , '' but merely the naming of a few that would be serviceable to the needs of the average serious reader .

		Returning to our metaphor , he picked up , almost at ran - dom , a handful of the grains of wheat , know - ing full well that many other handfuls equally nutritive might be collected from the threshing - floor .

		We should not have thought of discussing so trifling a matter were it not for the wide - spread interest and extraordinary comment it has evoked .

		The
summer	DATE	, as is well known , is the '' silly season `` in journalism , and it certainly has been improved to the utmost in the discus - sion of Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's list .

		Some writers have worked themselves up to a state of unwholesome excitement over it , and have called it '' amazing , '' '' astonishing , '' '' ridiculous , '' '' preposterous , '' and such-like names .

		Editors and professors and clergymen have taken its compiler to task and belabored him in a manner that must have excited the venerable Doctor 's wondering sur - prise .

		One indignant Cantabrigian truculently wants to know by what authority the books listed are announced for re-publication under the style of '' Harvard Classics '' -- as if '' Harvard '' were not a name that any tradesman in a free country might apply to a new soap , or a new breakfast food , or a new automobile !

		This disturbance in celestial souls may be accounted for partly by the hot weather , and partly by the same sort of feeling that makes every man sure that he can poke an open fire better than anybody else , or concoct a more appe - tizing cocktail .

		Of course every reader knows , deep down in his own heart , that when it comes to making a list of the best books , he is the only one really competent to do it .

		Those who remember the discussion of Sir
John Lubbock	PERSON	's list , twenty-five years ago , will recall many amusing examples of this species of self-conceit .

		It is the same with anthologies ; and no compiler of a volume of selected poems ever completely satisfied any reader but himself .

		Schopenhauer tells us of a philosopher whose only weakness was that he considered every one of his own beliefs to belong to the store of intuitive knowledge possessed by the entire human race .

		Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's list claims no more than exceptional fitness to keep the reader in line with what is normal and enduring in literature .

		Other lists , equally sound in principle and helpful in use , might easily be put together .

		It is no reflection on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and the
Bible	LOCATION	to find them missing in the present case , -- it simply means that some things may be taken for granted .

		Nor does the inclusion of some work in a special category -- like '' The Wealth of Nations , '' or '' Dr. Faustus , '' or ''
Becket	PERSON	, '' -- mean that other works in these categories are discriminated against .

		And we can see no vital necessity for mirth or satirical comment in the fact that attention is drawn to such obscure writers as
John Woolman	PERSON	and
William Penn.	PERSON	.

		Those who know and cherish these writers will understand ; those who are brought to make their acquaintance will be grateful .

		Any suggestion that tends to encourage the reading of good books deserves praise .

		That the books in Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's list are good books will hardly be denied ; if the present year of grace produces any that will be reckoned , a century hence , to be deserving of inclusion in such a list , it will be beyond most years distinguished by that fact .

		All the galvanism of advertisement and puffery can not keep a book alive if the vital prin - ciple is not in it .

		If we prefer , to take
Ruskin	PERSON	's comparison , the society of stable-boys to the society of kings , we may have it a-plenty ; but we may instead entertain royal guests if we choose , and they await our bidding to '' give us manners , virtue , freedom , power . ''

		There is also much to be said for Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's counsel concern - ing the reading of good books .

		Their contents are not readily assimilated , and every hour spent over their pages requires several other hours of inward meditation for its proper intellectual fruition .

		We see nothing but a plain statement of simple truth in the declaration that a few minutes given each day to the reading of the books named , or of others that have been similarly tested by time , will in the course of years provide the essentials of a liberal education .

		There is no such thing as liberal education in the abstract , and no universal prescription will secure it ; but every individual may acquire by his own efforts the particular liberal education which answers to his individual needs , and Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's recommendation is elastic enough to cover an infinite variety of cases .


1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 85 A MAN FOR WHOM '' WE HA VE A KINDNESS . ''

		It is not only by such losses to the world of letters as were wrought by the recent deaths of
Swinburne	PERSON	and
Meredith	PERSON	that we of to-day are reminded how close we yet stand to that golden hun - dred years of British literature which opened with
Burns	PERSON	and closed with
Tennyson	PERSON	.

		Every month of this present twelve has brought some name to put us in mind of one or another of the great ones of that just-closed era of splendor ; and now
August	DATE	calls back one who markedly was of that brilliant group which dominated the
last century	DATE	's earlier days .

		On the twenty-eighth of this month , a short fifty years ago ,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	died at
Putney	LOCATION	-- where the singer of the M
Atlanta	LOCATION	in Calydon '' and B
Laus Veneris	PERSON	'' breathed his last , only yesterday , as it seems .

		To recall Hunt 's life , however cursorily , is to look again along the half-happy , half-wretched , wholly-careless weeks and months of one who played , if a minor , yet a considerable part in the breaking down of the formalism which had come to rule eighteenth-century verse .

		Keats , as much as any other , shattered for all time the poetic fetters cast by Pope and his fellows ; and
Keats	PERSON	was influenced in his work by none more than by
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	.

		Grant that Hunt 's own lines must be said to , ; trot smartly , rather than fly . ''

		yet to him directly is due not a little of the freedom and lusciousness of • • Endymion , '' -- as was recognised by the surly old H Quarterly Review '' when it first noticed that poem and called its author merelv '' a neophite of the writer of the • Story of
Rimini	LOCATION	. ' '' ''

		To know Hunt was to hold him in reverence and in love , '' wrote Lamb .

		u He is one of those happy souls who are the salt of the earth , '' was the tribute paid by
Shelley	PERSON	, from whose melodious lips fell also the briefer phrase , perhaps best descriptive of the man , u He is constitutionally gay . ''

		* ' We have a kindness for Mr.
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, '' was the more dignified and eminently characteristic way in which
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	saw fit to state a truth that is still a truth ; and
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	, even
Carlyle	PERSON	, have preached to the same text .

		In brief .

		Hunt was such an one as it is good for a work-a-day world to pause and call up before its busy eye ?

		.

		The part he played in the literature of his time was quite important enough to warrant one in using it now as an excuse to think once more of a man of real charm ; amusing at times , pitiable at others , but first and last to be regarded only with a warm and tolerant affection .

		In every word he wrote he stands forth the exponent of a cheery , sentimental optimism ; in every line he penned he poses the personification of some hoped - for future when nobody will be damned or in debt , -- when everything will be but refined beer and skittles .

		Born in a
London	LOCATION	suburb ,
October 19 , 1784	DATE	, he was christened
James Henry Leigh	PERSON	, though the first two names were so promptly dropped as to be now forgotten .

		His father was a decayed planter of Barbadoes , who , while studying in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, married one of the Shewells ; the son showing many a trace of the happy-go-lucky `` West Indian blood , and none at all of the methodical , thrifty little Quakeress .

		The boy was nothing if not impression - able .

		He himself tells the story of the deep effect made upon him by some early memory of the word '' damn . ''

		He longed to voice the syllable and so make it all his own ; and he tells how , a full fort - night after the thought had first lodged in his little head , he retired to the safe solitude of the back yard , where two or three several times he indulged himself in the round-mouthed pleasure of the word , and then , for weeks to come , whenever an aunt or elderly friend would pat him on the head with praise of this or that , he would torture himself with the secret accusation , '' They little think that I 'm the boy who said damn ! ''

		Young Hunt followed Lamb and
Coleridge	PERSON	at the `` Blue Coat School '' -LRB-
Christ 's Hospital	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , studying there for the eight years between
1792	DATE	and
1800	DATE	, and leaving this not attractive summary of the day 's routine : '' We rose to the call of a bell , at six in
summer	DATE	and seven in
winter	DATE	... From breakfast we proceeded to school , where we remained till eleven , winter and
summer	DATE	, and then had an hour 's play .

		Dinner took place at twelve .

		Afterward was a little play till one .

		when we went again to school , and remained till five in
summer	DATE	and four in winter .

		At six was the supper .

		We used to play after it in
summer	DATE	till eight .

		In winter we proceeded from supper to bed ... Our break - fast was bread -LRB- half of a three-penny-loaf -RRB- and water , for the beer was too bad to drink .

		For dinner we had the same quantity of bread , with meat only every other day .

		On the other days , we had a milk porridge , ludicrously thin , or rice - milk , which was better .

		For supper , we had a like piece of bread , with butter or cheese . ''

		This does not seem much on which to feed a
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	, yet young Hunt 's was already cantering , for , a year after his graduation -LRB- he was then only sixteen -RRB- his father published for him a volume of his poems .

		The '' Lyrical Ballads , '' issued three years earlier , had never '' taken '' so far as the reading public was concerned , and Sir
Walter	PERSON	's '' Lay of the Last Minstrel '' was not to see types for four years to come ; '' mouthy ''
Southey	PERSON	and
Samuel Rogers	PERSON	, the latter more banker than poet , were at the moment dividing literary honors ; and so it happened that these very juvenile pieces of young Hunt 's , imitations of Spenser and
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	,
Collins	PERSON	and Gray , ran through three editions , to an accompaniment of popu - larity which can not but seem strange indeed to-day .

		A few years more , and the young man was con - tributing excellent dramatic and literary criticism to u The Traveller , '' a weekly owned and published by bis brother
John	PERSON	, and soon succeeded first by u The News '' and then '' The Examiner , ''
Leigh	PERSON	eventu - ally becoming editor as well as part proprietor of the last named .

		At this time , too , he married
Marianne Kent	PERSON	.

		Their son
Thornton	PERSON	, in the life of his father , has told us that she was the u reverse of handsome '' and `` wholly without accomplishments , `` which might seem a seeking after truth with all filial feeling for - got if we did not have the testimony on the other side of no less an one than
Thackeray	PERSON	to tell us that 86 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	,
Marianne	PERSON	had a pretty figure , fine eyes , and magni - ficent black hair , with the further information that '' she had a strong bent for the plastic arts . ''

		These early years were given up wholly to u The Examiner , '' a daring sheet , strongly showing the influence which the French Revolution had exerted on English letters of the period .

		In
1812	DATE	it pub - lished an article on the Prince Regent , later George the Fourth , calling him '' a fat Adonis of fifty , '' which was bad enough , but the paragraph went on to speak of the future king as '' a violator of home ties , '' '' a debaucher of the domestic hearth , '' '' a companion of demireps , '' with other such phrases equally sure to demand '' official '' notice .

		The Hunts were arrested and brought to trial for libel , and , though defended by
Lord Brougham	PERSON	, were sentenced to a fine of # 500 and two years imprisonment .

		Leigh served his time in the Horsemonger Lane Goal , where he promptly and surely became the fashion of '' the Opposition '' of the time .

		The great
Bentham	PERSON	him - self came out to play shuttlecock ; while
Hazlitt	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	,
Moore	PERSON	and
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Shelley	PERSON	and
Keats	PERSON	, called almost daily , till the whole period , strangely enough , stood to the prisoner as one of the happiest he had known or was to know .

		His family was permitted to be with him ; he was allowed a suit of rooms with a private garden ; his parlor was re-papered for him in a trellised design with blue sky for a ceil - ing ; his books , his busts , and his piano were installed for his greater comfort ; and , above all else , his board and lodging was being cared for by a presumably outraged government .

		For once at least
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	was pestered with no housekeeping cares . ''

		The Story of
Rimini	LOCATION	, '' which he wrote at this time , and which was published soon after his release , was , not unnaturally , the best thing he had yet done .

		Cer - tainly it gave him an acknowledged stand among the writers of the day , whilst its greatest praise is that it so largely influenced both
Keats	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	.

		The five years following his release were devoted in the main to his work for '' The Indicator , '' a weekly not dissimilar from `` The Examiner '' -LRB- though seldom dabbling in politics -RRB- , for which Hunt wrote the best of his essays .

		They were always cheerful , often fanciful , -- '' Some Thoughts on Sleep '' being a typical as well as a delightful example .

		But when they touched upon literary criticism , one sees that the author of '' Stories of the Italian Poets '' is not always to be trusted , in spite of those two sound volumes .

		Hunt loved literature passionately and humbly ; his best friends were books rather than men ; and yet the major part of his criticism is dis - tinctly of a hasty and temporary sort .

		He could , for instance , gush over
Thomas Moore	PERSON	while voicing a disgust for Landor ; he conscientiously placed
Ariosto	PERSON	on a par with
Milton	PERSON	, and thought Pulci the equal of Spenser .

		On the other hand , he was aptly accurate in calling the author of the '' Faerie Queen '' '' the most luxurious '' of English poets ; he saw through
Rogers	PERSON	and
Southey	PERSON	, and had the foresight to name
Wordsworth	PERSON	as the chief poet of his age .

		During this period of his life , Hunt was an intimate at the
Countess of Blessington	ORGANIZATION	's salon at
Gore House	ORGANIZATION	, where the
Albert Hall	PERSON	now stands , till he permitted his too-ready pen to speak of his hostess as ' • a Venus grown fat , '' after which , quite naturally , her famous home no longer opened its doors to him .

		Then -LRB- 1821 -RRB- he went out to
Italy	LOCATION	as a sort of literary attache to
Byron	PERSON	, to whom he had dedicated his ''
Rimini	LOCATION	, '' helping that '' noble Lord '' -LRB- along with
Shelley	PERSON	and
Hazlitt	PERSON	-RRB- to edit his short-lived `` Liberal . ''

		Hazlitt soon ceased to write for the sheet ;
Shelley	PERSON	was drowned ; and
Byron	PERSON	and Hunt quarrelled , the latter returning to
England	LOCATION	-LRB- with Mrs.
Hunt	PERSON	and the many little Hunts -RRB- to write a particularly dis - agreeable and wholly uncalled-for book .

		The rest of Hunt 's days were spent in or near
London	LOCATION	.

		He was at
Highgate	LOCATION	for a time , with its memories of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	; at
Epsom	LOCATION	and at
Brompton	LOCATION	, at
Kensington	LOCATION	and at
Chelsea	LOCATION	.

		With
Kensington	PERSON	his name is inevitably and always associated through `` An Old Court Suburb , '' which must share with `` Imagination and Fancy '' and `` The Italian Poets '' the title of his best work .

		In
Chelsea	LOCATION	, where he lived from
1833	DATE	to
1840	DATE	, Hunt is a figure not soon to be forgotten .

		The little house at No. 10 ,
Upper Cheyne Row	ORGANIZATION	, where
Leigh	PERSON	and
Marianne	PERSON	spent their seven years of `` tinkerdom , '' -- half in rapture at the smell of the lime trees , half in terror as every knock at the door suggested duns and bailiffs , -- lias been described by their neighbor
Carlyle	PERSON	in a para - graph all but classic .

		Who can not see the chairs in that strange parlor halting in their mad hornpipe as the sage enters , with the gypsy-like children playing about in the littered room amongst last week 's papers and the morning 's breakfast fragments !

		Who can - not figure the host , in his tattered flowered dressing gown , offering the caller the one sound-looking chair of all and seating himself on a window-sill , to dis - course , without apology , on literature and the rights of man ! ''

		Pitiable and lovable , '' truly ; to be used `` kindly , but with discretion . ''

		Yet another picture of the man at this time comes in a story of Mr.
Smith	PERSON	, the publisher , who tells of an early morning call which he received from the much-disturbed Mr.
Hunt	PERSON	.

		The night before ,
Smith	PERSON	had paid him for the best of a year 's work , the bank notes totalling #
1000	DATE	.

		Now the author came to ex - plain that these precious notes , left trustingly in the rubbish on the parlor table , had been burned by
Marianne	PERSON	in the only house-cleaning in that estab - lishment of which there is record .

		Could they pos - sibly be replaced ?

		was the anxious question ; and as it was put , the questioner gesticulated wildly with a tiny statue of a naked Psyche , which , in spite of his perturbation and threatened poverty , he had bought from a street peddler on his way to the office .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	thought the matter might be untangled at the
Bank of England	ORGANIZATION	, as he had for - tunately retained a memorandum of the numbers of the notes ; and together the two went down into the
City	LOCATION	.

		There they were shown into a back room in the solemn and unsightly home where `` the old lady of Threadneedle Street '' lives , and seated
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 87 themselves in the silent presence of three venerahle clerks , bending over great ledgers on a green baize - covered table .

		The only light in the room came from a glazed skylight above ; it was silent save for the scratching of those three pens , -- all dreadfully different from anything to which Hunt had been used .

		He stood it as long as he could , and then , slipping quickly across to the table and laying a heavy hand on the shoulder of the nearest clerk , he asked , '' And this is the
Bank of England	ORGANIZATION	?

		And do you mean to tell me that you sit here all day long , writing with that nasty pen in that horrid old book , and never see the blue sky or hear the birds ? ''

		And then
Smith	PERSON	captured the long-haired , wild-eyed man who had been waving that naked goddess before the startled eyes of the prosy employee .

		Does not the whole story eloquently suggest not only Hunt the impracticable visionary , but also that untidy , careless
Marianne	PERSON	, who was forever borrowing this and that and the other from the Carlyles around the corner ?

		The best single stanza Hunt ever wrote , • •
Jennie Kissed	PERSON	Me , '' a very masterpiece of trifling , bears witness to the same humorously pitiful stories ; for ''
Jennie	PERSON	'' was
Jane Carlyle	PERSON	, and the chances are at least even that she kissed the author because he was at last bringing back some of the many articles which his wife had borrowed . ''

		Jennie kiss 'd me when we met , Jumping from the chair she sat in ; Time , you thief , who love to get Sweets into your list , put that in .

		Say I 'm weary , say I 'm sad ; i at health and wealth have miss 'd me ; Say I 'm growing old .

		but add --
Jenny	PERSON	kiss 'd me ! ''

		Hunt died on the 28th of
August , 1859	DATE	, `` just exhausted . ''

		In view of
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's statement that there are not in all of his work twenty consecutive good pages , one may accept the dictum that he was % i a genius in spots '' ; if the phrase may be per - mitted , a not inaccurate idea of his work may be gathered from the Wall Street term that he was • • too extended . ''

		He wrote two religious books , and attempted an historical novel , `` Sir
Ralph Echer	PERSON	'' ; he tried his hand at some half-dozen dramas , only one of which .

		• • A Legend of
Florence	LOCATION	, '' an attempt in the Elizabethan manner , was acted ; while the bulk of his work , setting aside the poems , can be best described as miscellaneous casual essays and critical articles . ''

		He is a devilish good one , '' said ByTon of Hunt , '' quaint here and there , but with the sub-stratum of originality and with poetry about it that will stand the test . ''

		This poetry has not stood the test -- though • •
Jennie	PERSON	Kissed Me , '' u The Glove and the Lions , '' u
Abou Ben Adhem	PERSON	, '' and the sonnet on the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, are exceptions to the statement .

		The brief stanzas which tell the pregnant story of the oriental dreamer not only show Hunt 's high talent for epigram , but are real poetry ; while his finest and most famous line .

		* • The laughing queen that caught the world 's great hands , '' is not only the best nine - word description of Cleopatra , but is embodied in fourteen lines justly held superior to the sonnets on the same subject written in competition with it by
Keats	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	.

		Perhaps three other fragments of his verse may be included with these as of per - manent worth .

		One is the sonnet on u The Cricket and the Grasshopper , '' also composed during the Horsemonger Goal days in friendly rivalry with
Keats	PERSON	; the final six lines of a sonnet-sequence on • • The Man and the Fish '' ; and the poppy stanzas in his u Song and Chorus of the Flowers . ''

		In the second case .

		Hunt achieves what is both Grecian and Jacobian in the lines : • ' Man 's life is warm , glad , sad , ` twixt love and graves , Boundless in hope , honoured with pangs austere , Heaven-gazing ; and his angel-wings he craves : The fish is swift , small-needing , vague yet clear , A cold , sweet , silver life , wrapp 'd in round waves , Quicken 'd with touches of transporting fear . ''

		The stanzas in which the poppies tell their story , too little known , are worth quoting entire . ''

		We are slumb ` rous poppies , Lords of
Lethe	LOCATION	downs , Some awake and some asleep , Sleeping in their crowns .

		What perchance our dreams may know , Let our serious beauty show . ''

		Central depth of purple , Leaves more bright than rose , Who shall tell what brightest thought Out of darkness grows ?

		Who , through what funereal pain , Souls to love and peace attain ' ?

		• ' Visions aye are on us , Unto eyes of power ,
Pluto	LOCATION	's always-setting sun , And Proserpine 's bower ; There , like bees , the pale souls come For our drink with drowsy hum . ''

		• Taste , ye mortals , also ; Milky-hearted , we ; Taste , but with a reverent care ; Active , patient be .

		Too much gladness brings to gloom Those who on the gods presume . ''

		Delightful at its best , Hunt 's verse is trifling as a whole ; there is a ' * feminine quality '' about it , which , however pleasing at the moment , detracts from lasting strength .

		Sentiment too often merges into sentimentality ; mere prettiness too often sup - plants real beauty .

		Hunt was a bundle of contradictions .

		Widely read he was , yet was he no scholar .

		One may not actually term him a thinker , although now and again he voiced thoughts so sweet as to warrant
Allingham	PERSON	in calling him an eglantine .

		At moments he showed unquestionably fine taste , but quite as often was he vulgar .

		His work again and again evidences that delicately light touch which counts for so much , but as like as not it would be employed on tedious sub - jects .

		Beyond all question , he was full of poetry ; equally beyond all question , his verse was full of faults .

		Invariably busy , he accomplished compara - tively little , because he could not accustom himself to what has well been called u the regular drudgery of miscellaneous writing . ''

		Finally , and perhaps 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, as a necessary corollary to the last statement , while he made much money he yet appears the shining example of those men who '' allow '' their friends to help them out .

		In
1844	DATE	he received an annuity of
$ 50	MONEY	a month from the
Shelleys ; three years later	DATE	there came to him a Crown annuity of
$ 1000	MONEY	a year ; twice
Charles Dickens	PERSON	gave benefits for him ; and yet he was always in debt .

		Considerable new light has been thrown upon the reasons for this chronic financial embarrassment , by some letters which have been published only this
summer	DATE	in
London	LOCATION	.

		The letters are written by Dr. Bird , who for many years was the family physician of the Hunts and intimately acquainted with their affairs .

		According to this authority , it was not so much Hunt 's improvidence as his wife 's extravagance and his good-natured indulgence that caused the trouble ; and this explanation seems to be accepted by those best qualified to judge .

		Some new letters of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	have also lately been published , in which the novelist , while not disavowing that his character of ''
Harold Skimpole	PERSON	'' had originally been drawn , in a way , from Hunt , disclaims any intention of portraying Hunt in an unfavorable light , and expresses the sincerest regret that he should have been instrumental in casting a shadow over his friend 's good name .

		Somewhere in one of his delightful volumes , Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	says that life holds for us no examinations at conveniently set intervals , when , as in the days of school and college , we may '' catch up '' ; but however true this is of our own deeds and doings , there is a pleasant exception to be made to his statement through the growing custom of anni - versary commemorations .

		Busied as the presentrday world fitly is with its suffrage debates and stock decisions , its hardy gardens and Oriental problems , its child-raising and canal-digging , its prohibition campaigns and political crises , each year brings to its attention some names of the great ones of an often half-forgotten yesterday , asking a monument for one , a new '' Complete Works '' for another , possibly something approximating an international fair for a third , -- and behold , under the agreeable fiction of modern progress we have gone back to re-read a page or two of the life of a generation more or less ancient from our
Twentieth Century	ORGANIZATION	point of view .

		In that way we do '' catch up , '' -- review some early lessons , revive some dormant friendship .

		Nineteen hundred and nine has led us to a gener - ous share of just this , -- with our mighty
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	, with that antithesis of his ,
John Calvin	PERSON	, with
Darwin	PERSON	and
Poe	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	, and those two so different Doctors , the
New England Holmes	ORGANIZATION	and the
Old England Johnson	ORGANIZATION	; and among the other and lesser ones ,
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	and
Milnes	PERSON	and
Kinglake	PERSON	, we may well give a leisurely hour to
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	.

		No man of his literary era is harder to summarize than he , in a phrase or a page ; but neither is any other of his day more worth our affectionate recalling .


Warwick James Price	ORGANIZATION	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		Our debt to
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	is not to be discharged by any display of centennial fireworks in the shape of birthday orations and magazine articles commemorative of the inimitable Autocrat .

		Those who knew him in life , or who have even seen him on the speaker 's platform and listened to his graceful utterance , whether in prose or in verse , will cherish his memory and will know that if he had never lived American letters and American life would be to-day something different and poorer than they actually are .

		His regard for the polite formal - ities and elegancies , in conduct , in speech , and in writing , was a lesson to his ruder fellow-citizens , and one that we daily and hourly tend to neglect .

		Twentieth-century hurry has in it little of that win - some urbanity which breathes in every page of the Breakfast Table series .

		Years ago a writer in the English '' Quarterly Review '' uttered this timely word : '' Opinions so directly contrary in many respects to the main direction of American move - ment brought
Holmes	PERSON	at one time into disrepute with the more advanced of his countrymen .

		He was accused of attaching excessive importance to con - ventionalities of dress , manners , and speech ; he was charged with using his influence to starve and paralyze literary originality .

		To us it seems that his attitude was abundantly justified .

		The debt which the best American literature and all who in the Old World and the New appreciate its mixture of freshness and refinement owe to
Holmes	PERSON	is very great .

		How great the debt was has not yet been fully recognized by his countrymen .

		When young
America	LOCATION	demanded that the political revolution which separated the Old and New Worlds should have its literary counterpart in a similar revolt ,
Holmes	PERSON	threw all his influence into the opposite scale .

		He urged , with keen satire as well as with the force of example , that even a Republic must recognize the laws of conventional decorum , and that those who enter the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	of the Muses outrage propriety if they ostentatiously flaunt their working-dress . ''

		Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	was the true Brahmin , in his books , in
Beacon Street	LOCATION	, every - where and on all occasions .

		And yet that bright playfulness of humor which so distinguished him renders peculiarly applicable to him
Cicero	PERSON	's words descriptive of another : '' Festivitate et facetiis ... et superioribus et cequalibus sids omnibus prcestitit . ''

		Guessing at authorship is an old and favorite game , which has lately been put in a new form before the readers of `` The Century . ''

		Probably most of those who read in the
June	DATE	number the first of the group of three stories dealing with the superstition of '' Thirteen at Table '' felt rather proud of their literary discernment in at once recognizing Dr.
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	as the author .

		It will be remembered that the stories were published anonymously , but with the statement that each tale was by one of the following writers : Dr.
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	, Mrs.
Margaret Deland	PERSON	,
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 89 Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	.

		The first story , u With the Coin of her Life , '' ranks highest of the group -- a convinc - ing , simple , yet scientific presentation of the mental effect of an idee fixe upon a young girl whose every faculty is concentrated on the determination to be - come a great actress .

		No one who read the story could fail to see the impress of Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	in theme and treatment -- the psychology and pathology of the ' • case , '' the quiet observation , the little touches of reflective philosophy : all plausible proofs -- only it now appears upon excellent authority that Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	did not write the story .

		It is Mr.
Wister	PERSON	who has played a joke on the astute public by a brilliant and most successful masquerade -- slipped into the Hippocratic cloak of the older novelist , and proved it so good a fit that probably few could hon - estly say that they had guessed his identity .

		Of course , according to the rules laid down by
Poe	PERSON	in his `` Purloined Letter , '' the reader should have known the story was not Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's , because he was so obviously and glaringly indicated as its author ; but the wisdom of
Dupin	ORGANIZATION	is not common .

		Shrewd divina - tions of the identity of the two remaining '' thirteen '' story-writers are now in order .

		An INTERESTING ACHIEVEMENT IN BOOK - COLLECTING would be the getting together of all the curiously misprinted Bibles that have appeared in our language during the four centuries and a half that this most popular of books has been issuing from the press at the rate of tens of thousands of copies yearly .

		We have , for example , the '' wicked '' Bible , printed in
1631	DATE	, which omits the negative from the seventh commandment , and which involved the printer in a little unpleasantness with the con - stituted authorities , ending in his reluctant payment of a three hundred pound fine .

		The `` place-makers '' Bible , of
1562	DATE	, is so called from a substitution of I for e in one of the Beatitudes .

		The '' vinegar ''
Bible	PERSON	has a little misprint in the heading of the chap - ter relating the parable of the vineyard .

		A slight typographical error in the sixteenth verse of
Jude	ORGANIZATION	has given us a '' murderers '' Bible , and another trivial slip in the twenty-sixth verse of the fourteenth chapter of
Luke	PERSON	added the '' wife-hater '' Bible in
1810	DATE	to the already long list of similar freaks .

		The `` bug ''
Bible	PERSON	, the `` to-remain '' Bible , the `` breeches '' Bible , and only the biblical specialist knows how many more curious Bibles , are famous in biblio - graphic annals .

		To get them all together -- on a twenty-foot shelf , if that would hold them -- would be an achievement indeed .

		The order of thought and the order of speech must be held to be about the same in the speaker 's mind , however different the arrangement of noun , adjective , verb , and adverb , in different languages .

		In the course of his recent Sorbonne address on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniver - sary of the
Alliance Francaise	ORGANIZATION	,
M. Paul Deschanel	PERSON	said : '' Our language is the simplest , in that it employs the fewest words , and ... one speaks the words in the order in which one thinks them . ''

		Does he , then , seriously believe that Germans and Hun - garians and Patagonians and Chinese transpose and rearrange their thoughts before putting them into words ?

		Merely because he himself says , for ex - ample , '' The daughter of the innkeeper has stabbed the son eldest of the alderman apoplectic with a fork at two tines , '' while a German would announce the same tragic occurrence as , `` The innkeeper 's daughter has the apoplectic alderman 's eldest son with a two - tined fork stabbed , '' does he think himself justified in declaring his to be the only natural and logical arrangement of the words used ?

		In economy of terms , both the German and the Englishman would easily surpass him in this instance .

		The thought and its verbal expression , the psychology of the speaker and the peculiarity of his idiom , are closely correspondent .

		Hence the vast number and variety of languages and dialects , and hence the blessed impossibility of a universal language -- even with all the aid that simple spelling has been deemed capable of giving toward advancing the claims of our own tongue as a Weltsprache .

		A noted scientist 's library is seeking a purchaser .

		The late Professor
Simon Newcomb	PERSON	's books -- a collection rich in works on astronomy , mathematics , and physics , and also containing many publications on economic subjects -- are to be sold either collectively or in parts .

		Before the owner 's death a type-written catalogue was prepared under his direction , and to any intending purchaser a copy of this will be sent upon application to the executor of the estate , at No.
1620	DATE	P Street ,
Washington	LOCATION	, D. C .

		One of the saddest events too often following a fa - mous scholar 's death is the dispersion of that silent company of faithful friends and efficient aids in his studies , his carefully chosen books .

		One can not but hope that Professor
Newcomb	PERSON	's library may find its way , unbroken , either into the hands of some appre - ciative private owner or into the careful keeping and wise handling of one of our larger public or univer - sity libraries .

		The collection contains about 5000 books and
4000	DATE	pamphlets , and includes what is prob - ably the most nearly complete astronomical library in this country , excepting only that of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The proposal for an
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	memorial has not yet taken definite form , but the offering for sale of Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's long-time residence in
Roxbury	LOCATION	points the way to what might prove a very suitable and inspiring form for the memorial to take .

		If only his study could be kept in nearly the same condition as when he and his secretary made it one of the busiest of literary workshops , it would be a spot well worth visiting .

		The library , it seems , has been bequeathed to Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's children , 90 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, to be equally divided among them ; but inducements not wholly of a pecuniary character might be offered to ensure its preservation , nearly intact , in the room or rooms that it has so long occupied .

		The
Aldrich	PERSON	house at
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, the
Whistler	LOCATION	house at
Lowell	LOCATION	, and , to go further afield , the
Johnson	PERSON	house at Lich - field and the Shakespeare house at
Stratford	LOCATION	, have been made to serve as memorials of the most inter - esting and inspiring kind .

		So great-souled a man as Dr.
Hale	PERSON	might well have , and doubtless will have , his name and memory attached to more than one form of literary or charitable or educational enter - prise ; but the preservation of his house as a place of unusual human interest is peculiarly appropriate .

		The public library and the playground con - stitute at this season rival attractions to the young .

		In the Second Annual Report of the
James V. Brown Library	PERSON	, of
Williamsport	LOCATION	,
Pa.	LOCATION	, is a paragraph explain - ing the falling-off in the use of the juvenile depart - ment .

		`` It should occasion neither surprise nor regret , '' remarks the librarian . ''

		In a locality which is as ideal for out-door life as this is , such an amount of reading as was indulged in by the boys and girls last
summer	DATE	can not be regarded as truly desirable . ''

		An insufficient appropriation for book-purchases is given as the undoubted cause of the decline in circu - lation .

		The tax-payer kept his dollar or two that might have gone for new books , and his children enjoyed an extra allowance of fresh air and exer - cise ; therefore all was well .

		But in future it is hoped to make the juvenile department of the library a more formidable rival to the playground , without necessarily impairing the young reader 's health and vigor ... '' The only really native German poet '' is the term -- rather exaggerated , it would seem -- applied by `` Young
Germany	LOCATION	'' to
Baron Detlev von Liliencron	PERSON	, who died last month at the age of sixty - five .

		He was a writer of novels and plays , as well as poems , but is likely to be best remembered for his poems , or for the best of them scattered through four published volumes .

		In the dark hours of the
Franco	PERSON	- German conflict , and in moments of personal sorrow or of serious thought , he showed himself capable of poetic utterance of the most moving sort .

		Also some of his prose works , as especially his Kriegsnovellen , are highly rated .

		It is noteworthy that the German Emperor , who has shown indifference or hostility to many contemporary German authors , was so de - lighted with
Liliencron	PERSON	's war-stories , on first reading them a few years ago , that he ordered a pension to be paid to the poet-novelist as long as he lived .

		Judicious library advertising appears to be regarded as not undignified or in any way repre - hensible .

		The latest report of the
Haverhill	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library describes some methods it has adopted to attract otherwise indifferent persons to its plea - sant rooms .

		Mimeographed lists of recent accessions in Italian literature were sent to Italian clubs and to Italian residents enrolled in the city directory .

		A similar course was pursued with the French inhabit - ants .

		Who that has ever seen a non-English-speaking citizen helplessly fingering the card catalogue of his city 's free library , in the vague hope of chancing upon a title in his own language , can doubt that these lists answered a real need ?

		A '' Useful Arts Bulletin , '' also mimeographed , was from time to time mailed to workmen likely to be interested tn such practical works as it treated of ; and these lists were , in addi - tion , printed in the local newspapers , besides being freely distributed at the library and its branches .

		Many persons were thus prompted to use the library who had before been entirely unaware that it could furnish them exactly the reading matter in which they were interested .

		And this has been the experi - ence of other places besides
Haverhill	LOCATION	.

		SHAKESPEARE 'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		I can not resist replying to the communication of Mr.
Johnson Brigham	PERSON	, in your issue of
July 16	DATE	, in which , speaking of the question of '' The law in Shakespeare '' -- that point on which so many Baconians rest their case -- he illustrates , by the example of
Browning	PERSON	, the theory that a master artist '' may gain sufficient technical lore , even in a difficult field , to astonish his critics . ''

		The method used by the poet in filling '' The Ring and the Book '' with law , for instance , was to get the law from the Book -- that is , from his source .

		In many cases ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has done this .

		In some cases , as in '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' the law was part of the story , if not of the vocabulary of the story .

		But in the majority of cases the law terms
spring	DATE	to the poet 's lips as the most natural words in which to express his ideas .


Richard Grant White	PERSON	, a lawyer as well as a Shakespeare scholar , said : '' No dramatist of the time , not even
Beaumont	LOCATION	, who was the younger son of a judge of the Common Pleas , and who , after studying in the
Inns of Court	ORGANIZATION	abandoned law for the drama , used legal phrases with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's readiness and exactness .

		And the significance of this fact is heightened by another , that it is only to the language of the law that he exhibits this inclination .

		The phrases peculiar to other occupations serve him on rare occasions by way of description , comparison , of illustration , generally when something in the scene suggests them ; but legal phrases flow from his pen as part of his vocabulary , and parcel of his thought . ''

		I will not ask your space to quote illustrations .

		They are everywere available .

		The point I wish to make is , that in Shakespeare the law is not '' got up '' for the nonce , as a modern novelist '' gets up '' his local color .

		It was in the dramatist 's mind , as the phraseology of the
Bible	LOCATION	is in the mind of the
Bible	LOCATION	student , and as the terms of science are in the mind and on the lips of the botanist , the chemist , and the physicist .

Journalistic Wilderness	ORGANIZATION	.

		* For wealth of opportunity to meet men worth knowing and to see events worth witnessing , few walks in life can compare with that of the enterprising and successful journalist .

		Sir
Henry W. Lucy	PERSON	-LRB- he has been knighted since the appearance of his book -RRB- presents , in a volume entitled '' Sixty Years in the Wilderness , '' some extremely readable chapters of personal and professional reminiscence covering nearly half a century of newspaper work , preceded by a period of dull toil in an uncongenial commercial pursuit .

		Emancipation from seven years ' drud - gery in the '' Hide and
Valonia Business	PERSON	, '' as his second chapter is entitled , with opportunity to join the staff of the
Shrewsbury	LOCATION	'' Chronicle , '' must have been a joyful release indeed to the young man who began authorship in his twelfth year with an essay -LRB- still unpublished -RRB- on the less praiseworthy side of King
David	PERSON	's character , followed two years later by a novel -LRB- also unpub - lished -RRB- , with no plot in particular , and succeeded very soon thereafter by some metrical composi - tions that achieved publicity in the Liverpool 4 * Mercury . ''

		Something of the daring and self-confidence of genius early displayed itself in the young journalist 's manner of breaking a road for him - self through the wilderness of newspaperdom .

		Editor and joint proprietor of a weekly paper at the age of twenty , he experienced a rapid series of ups and downs -- chiefly ups -- until an assured position as manager of the parlia - mentary corps of the
London	LOCATION	'' News , '' of which he was afterward for eighteen months editor-in - chief , and later a place on the staff of '' Punch , '' in addition to his other appointments and engage - ments , enabled him very effectually to keep the wolf beyond howling distance of his door .

		Two years ' editorship of the commercially unsuccesf ul u Mayfair , '' and the authorship of numerous magazine articles , two novels , and a number of politically reminiscent books , are also to be placed to his credit .

		A tremendous worker , but one whose execution is rapid and facile , and who -LRB- an important item -RRB- does all his writing through the medium of a stenographer , he has neverthe - less found time for a good deal of play , includ - ing three visits to the L nited States and a trip round the world .

Shirley Brooks	PERSON	began and
Tom Taylor	PERSON	continued in the days preceding Sir
Francis Burnand	PERSON	's editorship .

		Astonishingly small was the amount of schooling enjoyed -LRB- or hated -RRB- by the boy Lucy .

		Before reaching his eleventh birthday -LRB- suppos - ing him to have been born in
1845	DATE	, of which he is not sure -RRB- he was cast adrift to sink or swim , according to his capacity .

		A single para - graph may here be quoted to help explain how it was that this early suspension of pedagogic drill was not the direst misfortune in his case .

		■ One day , whilst still at school , I was sent down to a circulating library in Lord Street -LSB- Liverpool -RSB- , to change a book .

		The volume was <
Percival Keene	PERSON	. '

		As I walked along I looked through the pages .

		Fasci - nated , I began at the beginning and read steadily on , walking through the crowded streets .

		The library was , I think , called the Athenaum , a sombrely respectable place , led up to by stone steps .

		On one of these I sat down and went on with the story .

		When I looked up the aspect of the street was changed .

		Lamps were beginning to twinkle here and there .

		People were hur - rying homeward in a steady stream .

		It was evening , and the hbrary was closed !

		I had been sitting on the steps all through the day , dinnerless .

		But I had fin - ished '
Percival Keene	PERSON	. ' ''

		Among the varied experiences that contrib - uted to the completion of Sir
Henry Lucy	PERSON	's necessarily irregular education , he names a balloon ascent in company with
Fred Burnaby	PERSON	; a descent into a coal mine in
South Wales	LOCATION	, and one into a silver mine in
Colorado	LOCATION	; a voyage in a submarine boat ; and the witnessing of two hangings .

		A short private secretaryship to a railway magnate , and an eight-months ' sojourn in
Paris	LOCATION	to learn the language and habits of the natives , also entered into his peculiar training for journalism .

		But everything is , or ought to be , fish that finds its way into the journalist 's net : and the young man appears to have developed a most acute scent for news and a happy knack of seeing the popularly interest - ing side of all that occurred within his range .

		From his rapid pen-pictures of noted men , with which the book abounds , a passage on
Mark Twain	PERSON	and the attentions shown the great hu - morist during his late visit to
England	LOCATION	is worth quoting . ''

		Amidst a constant succession of honours paid him during his stay in
London	LOCATION	, he counted at highest value the bestowal upon him of an honorary degree by the
Oxford University	ORGANIZATION	and the invitation to dine at the Punch table .

		This last was unique in its way , since the Punch dining-room is ' tiled ' more jealously than a Freemasons ' meeting room .

		Old traditions were pre - 92 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, served to the extent that the dinner was not one of the regular weekly symposia .

		But it was given in the dining - room , at the table on which are carved the names of the staff , going back to the days of Mark Lemon . ''

		The author 's long familiarity with
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	and parliamentarians enables him to give some very interesting descriptions and comparative estimates of the oratorical performances of Dis - raeli ,
Gladstone	LOCATION	,
Robert Lowe	PERSON	,
John Bright	PERSON	, and other giants of debate , whose memorable speeches find few parallels in the more hurried and infor - mal utterances of present-day legislators at
West	LOCATION	- minster .

		As to
Gladstone	PERSON	's peculiarities , we read : '' His manner in speech-making was more strongly marked by action than was that of his only rival ,
John Bright	PERSON	.

		He emphasized points by smiting the open palm of his left hand with sledge-hammer fist .

		Sometimes he , with gleaming eyes -- ' like a vulture 's , ' Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	genially describes them , -- pointed his forefinger straight at his adversary .

		In hottest moments he beat the brass - bound Box with clamorous hand that occasionally drowned the point he strove to make .

		Sometimes with both hands raised above his head ; often with left elbow leaning on the Box , right hand with closed fist shaken at the head of an unoffending country gentleman on the back bench opposite ; anon , standing half a step back from the Table , left hand hanging at his side , right uplifted , so that he might with thumb-nail lightly touch the shining crown of his head , he trampled his way through the argument he assailed as an elephant in an hour of aggravation rages through a jungle . ''

		Contrasted with this we have the parliamen - tary appearance of
Gladstone	LOCATION	's great opponent . ''

		Disraeli lacked two qualities , fading which true eloquence is impossible .

		He was never quite in earnest , and he was not troubled by dominating conviction .

		Only on the rarest occasions did he affect to be roused to righteous indignation , and then he was rather amusing than impressive .

		He was endowed with a lively fancy and cultivated the art of coining phrases , generally per - sonal in their bearing .

		When these were flashed forth he delighted the
House	ORGANIZATION	.

		For the rest , at the period I knew him , when he had grown respectable and was weighted with responsibility , he was often dull .

		There were , indeed , in the course of a session few things more dreary than a long speech from Dizzy .

		At short , sharp replies to questions designed to be embarrassing he was effective .

		When it came to a long speech , the lack of stamina was disclosed , and the
House	ORGANIZATION	listened to some - thing which , if not occasionally incomprehensible , was frequently involved . ''

		A significant note on
Du Maurier	PERSON	, one of the author 's old associates on the '' Punch '' staff , arrests attention . ''

		With failing health , he was apt to be influenced by low spirits .

		Success from a new avenue , sunlit by quite unusual glow of pecuniary reward , came to him too late .

		He never was the same man after he made his great success with < Trilby . '

		I remember one night in the early
summer	DATE	, of the year of his death , dining with us at
Ashley Gardens	ORGANIZATION	, he met an old friend .

		Talking about his next novel ,
Lord Wolseley	PERSON	asked what was the title .

		`` I think , ' said
Du Maurier	PERSON	, with a humorous smile , < I '11 call it '' Soured by Success . '' ' ''

		Written in a brisk and effective style , though with many of the lapses and inelegances of the current journalistic manner , '' Sixty Years in the Wilderness '' is likely to meet with such favor as to encourage the issue of a second volume , already half - promised in the preface to the first .

		Among the inaccuracies , typographical or other , of the book , one finds Mr.
Howells	PERSON	writing to the author a letter from ''
Killery Point	PERSON	, '' which is almost an affront to historic old
Kittery	LOCATION	.

		The frontispiece portrait of Sir
Henry	PERSON	-LRB- a photo - gravure from Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	's painting -RRB- represents the sitter as holding a quill pen in his left hand , nearly in the position for writing .

		Is the pic - ture transposed , or is Sir
Henry	PERSON	left-handed ?

		Perhaps neither .

		Taking Stock of Darwinism .

		* It is a very difficult thing for the average man , who is not a special student of either sci - ence or philosophy , to realize that the Evolution theory is itself constantly in process of evolution .

		The publication of the '' Origin of Species '' fifty years ago led to a literally tremendous disturb - ance in the thought of the world on nearly all subjects .

		Only after a prolonged and bitter struggle did the Evolution idea begin to gain general acceptance .

		In spite of this long
Sturm	PERSON	und Drang period , the acceptance of Evolution , when it finally came , was in the popular mind very largely uncritical .

		In particular there was , and still is , much confusion of thought as to the distinction between '' Evolution '' and `` Darwinism . ''

		The idea that Evolution is Darwinism prevails very widely .

		On this ac - count there is at the present a good deal of dis - turbance in the popular mind over the searching criticisms of Darwinism which have been made in recent years by such men as
DeVries	ORGANIZATION	,
Johannsen	PERSON	, and others .

		On the one hand , one hears anxious inquiries , from those who `` believed '' in
Evolu	LOCATION	- tion on the supposition that scientific research had made it as solid and unchangeable as the rock-ribbed hills , as to whether '' scientists '' are giving up Evolution because it is an exploded doctrine .

		On the other hand come those eager to reopen the old battle with an accession of enthu - siasm and courage engendered by the supposed * Dakwin and

		THE DIAL 93 discovery of a weakening and wavering of the enemy .

		These triumphantly proclaim , and cite published statements in their support , that the scientific world is surreptitiously but not the less actually ' - casting aside the Evolution theory . ''

		It u the writer 's belief that the two books here under review will do much to correct such confusion of thought , by showing in an author - itative and at the same time untechnical and interesting manner what the present state of expert scientific opinion regarding Evolution and Darwinism is .

		Both books are symposia , each containing contributions from a number of different investigators : and both were prepared in connection with great gatherings of scientific men to commemorate the one hundredth anni - versary of the birth of
Charles Darwin	PERSON	.

		In gen - eral , both books have the same purpose .

		In method of treatment , the most noticeable dif - ference is that which arises out of the fact that in one case -LRB- `` Darwin and Modern Science '' -RRB- we are dealing with a collection of essays , while in the other case -LRB- '' Fifty Years of Darwinism '' -RRB- we have a collection of addresses primarily in - tended for viva voce presentation .

		The latter mode of presentation obviously necessitates a somewhat different treatment than can be used in an essay . ''

		Darwin and Modern Science '' is catholic in its subject-matter and cosmopolitan in its author - ship .

		The volume opens with an '' Introductory Letter to the Editor , from Sir
Joseph Dalton Hooker	PERSON	. ''

		This , and the following essay on ''
Darwin	PERSON	's Predecessors , '' by Professor
J. Arthur Thomson	PERSON	, are chiefly of historical in - terest .

		There follows a group of four essays dealing with the several primary factors of organic evolution as conceived by
Darwin	PERSON	.

		These are : M The Selection Theory , '' by the illustrious exponent and developer of that theory , Professor
August Weismann	PERSON	; '' Variation , '' by the Dutch botanist Professor
Hugo de Vries	PERSON	, whose studies of this subject mark the beginning of a new epoch in the investigation of the prob - lem of organic Evolution , just as did
Darwin	PERSON	's fifty years ago ; Heredity and Variation in Modern Lights . ''

		an unusually temperate and well-balanced essay by the leading student of heredity at the present time ,
Professor Bateson of Cambridge University	ORGANIZATION	: • • The Minute
Struc	PERSON	- ture of Cells in Relation to Heredity , '' by one who shares with
Hertwig	PERSON	, Fol and
Van Beneden	PERSON	the honor of having u solved the long-standing riddle of the fertilization of the egrsr .

		and the mechanism of u hereditary transmission , '' Pro- fessor
Eduard Strasburgfer	PERSON	of
Bonn	LOCATION	.

		The next three essays group about the relation of
Darwin	ORGANIZATION	's work to anthropology .


Schwalbe	PERSON	, one of the most eminent of living anthropologists , contributes a critical essay on '' The Descent of Man . ''

		Professor
Haeckel	PERSON	writes on ''
Charles Darwin	PERSON	as an Anthropologist , '' and
J. G. Frazer	PERSON	, of
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, discusses '' Some Primitive Theories of the Origin of Man . ''

		The next three essays deal with the ontogenetic and phylogenetic records of the evolutionary process .

		The titles are : '' The Influence of
Darwin	PERSON	on the Study of Animal Embryology , '' by Professor
Adam Sedgwick	PERSON	of
Cambridge	LOCATION	; and '' The Palaeontological Record , '' the first section on Animals , by Prof. ``
W. B. Scott	PERSON	of
Princeton	LOCATION	, the second section on Plants , by Dr.
D. H. Scott	PERSON	.

		In the succeeding group of three essays there is discussed , from widely different view-points , one of the most fundamental of Evolution prob - lems , namely , the influence of environment upon organisms .

		These essays are : '' The Influence of Environment on the Forms of Plants , '' by Professor
Georg Klebs	PERSON	of
Heidelberg	LOCATION	, known for his brilliant and thorough researches on this subject ; '' Experimental Study of the Influence of Environment on Animals , '' by Professor
Jacques Loeb	PERSON	, the only American worker besides Professor
Scott	PERSON	to appear as a contributor to the volume ; and '' The Value of Color in the Struggle for Life , '' by Professor
E. B. Poulton	PERSON	of
Oxford	LOCATION	, who stands without a peer in the study of animal coloration .

		Following these come three essays by Sir
William Thiselton-Dyer	PERSON	, Dr.
Hans Gadow	PERSON	, and Professor
J. W. Judd	PERSON	, respectively dealing with the problems of the geographical distribution of plants and animals and with
Darwin	PERSON	's service to the science of geology .

		Two essays , one by his son
Francis Darwin	PERSON	, and the other by Professor
K. Goebel	PERSON	of
Munich	LOCATION	, deal with
Darwin	ORGANIZATION	's botanical work .

		The next seven essays have to do with the relation of Darwinism to the so-called '' human - istic '' fields of thought .

		In many respects these form the most interesting part of the book .

		They show more clearly than any of the other essays how tremendous has been the influence of
Darwin	LOCATION	in fields far removed from those in which he him - self worked .

		Thus , an essay by Dr.
Jane Ellen Harrison	PERSON	, on M The Influence of Darwinism on the Study of Religions , '' begins with these words : '' The title of my paper might well have been ' The creation by Darwinism of the scientific study of Religions , ' but that I feared to mar my tribute to a great name by any shadow of exaggeration .

		Before the publication of ' The Origin of Species ' and ' The Descent of Man , ' even in the eighteenth century , isolated thinkers , notably 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	,
Hume	PERSON	and
Herder	ORGANIZATION	, had conjectured that the orthodox beliefs of their own day were developments from the cruder superstitions of the past .

		These were , however , only particular speculations of individual skeptics .

		Religion was not yet generally regarded as a proper subject for scientific study , with facts to be collected and theories to be deduced .

		A
Congress of Religions	ORGANIZATION	such as that recently held at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	would have savored of impiety . ''

		Other essays in this group deal with Sociology -LRB- Bougie -RRB- , Modern Philosophy -LRB- Hoffding -RRB- ,
Phil	PERSON	- ology -LRB-
Giles	PERSON	-RRB- , History -LRB- Bury -RRB- , and Psychology -LRB-
Lloyd Morgan	PERSON	-RRB- , in the relation of these subjects to Darwinism .

		The last two papers in the vol - ume , by Sir
George Darwin	PERSON	and
W. C. D. Whetham	PERSON	respectively , have to do with
Evolu	PERSON	- tion in the inorganic realm ; the subjects are '' The Genesis of Double Stars '' and '' The Evolution of Matter . ''

		It is obviously impossible within limited space to discuss separately each of the essays that make up this volume .

		The eminence of the contrib - utors furthermore makes any commendation of individual essays by a reviewer appear like pre - sumption .

		It can , however , properly be said that the volume as a whole forms a fitting and worthy tribute to
Darwin	PERSON	s memory .

		It is a book that should be on the shelves of every library , whether public or private , which aims to reflect in its choice of books the progress of contemporary thought .

		The aim of '' Fifty Years of Darwinism , '' while in general the same as that of the book just under discussion , is less ambitious .

		The addresses in this volume all deal directly with biological topics in the narrower technical sense of the term .

		These addresses were delivered at a special
Darwin Memorial	ORGANIZATION	meeting of the
American Association	ORGANIZATION	for the
Advancement of Science	ORGANIZATION	, at
Baltimore	LOCATION	, on New Year 's Day of this year .

		The first principal address , which gives the title to the volume , is by Professor
Poulton	PERSON	of
Oxford	LOCATION	, who was the guest of honor of the occasion .

		The address is historical , deal - ing with the changes of opinion and ideas regarding Evolution which have come about since the publication of '' The Origin of Species . ''

		It gains great charm from the wealth of anecdote and personal reminiscence which the author is able to contribute from his long acquaintance with men and affairs in English scientific life .

		The other addresses -LRB- with two exceptions -RRB- deal with the several factors generally held by biologists at the present time to be of primary importance in organic Evolution , and present in summarized and popular form the results of the most recent investigations in those fields .

		A simple list of the titles and authors will suffi - ciently indicate the scope of these essays and vouch for their excellence .

		These titles are : '' The Theory of Natural Selection from the Standpoint of Botany , '' by Professor
Coulter	PERSON	of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	; '' Isolation as a Factor in Organic Evolution , '' by President
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	; '' The Cell in Relation to Heredity and Evolution , '' by Professor
Wilson	PERSON	of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	; '' The Direct Influence of Envi - ronment , '' by Dr.
MacDougal	PERSON	of the
Carnegie Institution	ORGANIZATION	's Desert Botanical Laboratory ; '' The Behavior of Unit Characters in Heredity , '' by Professor Castle of Harvard ; '' Mutation , '' by Dr.
Davenport	PERSON	of the Station for Experi - mental Evolution maintained by the Carnegie Institution ; `` Adaptation , '' by Professor
Eigen	PERSON	- mann of
Indiana University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The last two addresses in the volume are some - what different in character .

		Dr.
Henry Fairfield Osborn	PERSON	writes on `` Darwin and Palaeontology , '' giving an interesting summary of his views as to the method of organic Evolution .

		The closing address is by President
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	, and has the title `` Evolution and Psychology . ''

		Altogether , these make an interesting and val - uable set of papers , and form a notable demon - stration of the flourishing condition of American biological science .

		In every case , the speakers were men who have achieved international rep - utation for the contributions which they have made to the study of Evolution .

		* The title to fame of some characters in history rests partly or wholly on some connection with another of far greater eminence .

		The slighting remark has often been made of
Robert Y. Hayne	PERSON	, that his only title to fame is the fact that he drew from
Webster	PERSON	one of his greatest oratorical efforts .

		The falsity of this assertion is now fully demonstrated by Mr.
Jervey	PERSON	, in his new Life of
Hayne	LOCATION	, which is likely to prove one of the most important contributions of the year to American biography .

		He does this by setting forth the eminent public services of
Hayne	PERSON	, both before and after his debate with
Webster	PERSON	.

The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 95 the industrial development of
South Carolina	LOCATION	.

		It is not difficult to see the relation of the former to the latter .


Hayne	PERSON	's rise was rapid , but not meteoric .

		He had gone the rounds of
South Carolina	LOCATION	politics before being pushed into the
United States Senate	ORGANIZATION	, possibly a little prematurely , at the age of thirty-two , by
John C. Calhoun	PERSON	, who had Presidential aspirations , and wanted
William Smith	PERSON	, a supporter of
Crawford	ORGANIZATION	, replaced by one friendly to himself .

		Though young in years and without Congressional experience ,
Hayne	PERSON	's position in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	was not inconspicuous .

		As a member of the
Committee on Naval Affairs	ORGANIZATION	, he was the author of a bill to establish a naval academy .

		The question of internal improve - ments had been sidetracked by
Monroe	PERSON	, and the Tariff was becoming the dominant issue .

		Con - spicuous among the opponents of
Clay	ORGANIZATION	's bill of
1824	DATE	were
Webster	PERSON	in the
House	ORGANIZATION	and
Hayne	PERSON	in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		Had both died at the close of this session ,
Hayne	PERSON	probably would now be regarded as the greater of the two .

		Just before the fight opened on the Tariff of
1828	DATE	,
Webster	PERSON	entered the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		By this time he was wavering ; consequently the
Boston	LOCATION	merchants , when they desired to be heard against the bill , presented their protest , not to
Webster	PERSON	, but to
Hayne	LOCATION	, to be by him laid before the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the end ,
Webster	PERSON	supported the act of
1828	DATE	.


South Carolina	LOCATION	pointed to economic evils as her reason for opposing the Tariff both in
1821	DATE	and
1828	DATE	.

		As this failed to produce the desired result , she then resorted to another argument , which had been used before with telling effect , unconstitutionality and nullification .

		An effort was made to bring this into play in
1830	DATE	, but the
Union	LOCATION	party was able to stave it off until the act of
1832	DATE	was passed .

		Among the great leaders , the personal equa - tion was not eliminated .


Jackson	PERSON	had come to the Presidency without committal on the Tariff , but naturally had '' low-tariff '' leanings .


Jack	PERSON	- son and Clay were personal enemies : conse - quently , when Clay announced , in
1832	DATE	, that to '' maintain and strengthen the American system , he would defy the South , the President , and the Devil , '' there could be no wavering .

		Unfortunately for the cause of the opposition to the Tariff , but fortunately for the
Union	ORGANIZATION	,
Jackson	PERSON	and
Calhoun	PERSON	also were at outs .

		However much we may differ with
Hayne	PERSON	on Nullification , we must recognize the greatness of the man in his devotion to a principle for its own sake , without being influenced by personal animosities or partisan rancor .

		He had appealed to reason in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, and had failed to stem the Tariff tide .

		He had devoted himself to the interests of
South Carolina	LOCATION	, and he now believed those interests so seriously threatened that an appeal must be made to the final resort ,
Nulli	PERSON	- fication , and possibly to forcible resistance .

		He could do nothing more in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	; conse - quently he resigned , and became Governor of
South Carolina	LOCATION	, -- not simply , as some represent , to make a place for
Calhoun	PERSON	, but because the test of Nullification would be made in
South Carolina	LOCATION	and not in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Jervey	PERSON	thinks that the strong expressions of nationality in
Jackson	LOCATION	's proclamation are only the voice of
Livingston	PERSON	, his secretary of state .

		He also presents some evidence that the President had written strong words of approval to
Hayne	PERSON	for his
State	ORGANIZATION	's - rights views as ex - pressed in the reply to
Webster	PERSON	.

		Certain it is that he expressed no violent animosity for
Hayne	PERSON	, while there is a not very well authen - ticated tradition that he threatened to hang
Calhoun	PERSON	.

		Also , a few years later ,
Jackson	PERSON	invited
Hayne	PERSON	to spend a day with him at the
Hermitage	ORGANIZATION	.

		In view of this , one may be par - doned for wondering if
Jackson	PERSON	would have allowed
South Carolina	LOCATION	to nullify , as he had done in the
Georgia	LOCATION	case , had it not been for his violent hatred of
Calhoun	PERSON	.

		Probably not , -- but who knows ?

		The question of Nullification settled ,
Hayne	PERSON	devoted himself with unremitting energy , for the rest of his life , to the industrial development of
South Carolina	LOCATION	.

		As population spread to the west , the problem of transportation was ac - centuated more and more .


Hayne	PERSON	saw clearly that this must be solved , if the South was to hold her own , Tariff or no Tariff .

		As far back as
1821	DATE	, he appears to have been the first to suggest the possibilities of a steam railroad con - necting
Charleston	LOCATION	with
Augusta	LOCATION	and
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		He now took up the greater problem of cross - ing the mountains and tying the West to
Charleston	LOCATION	.

		His scheme was to cross
North Carolina	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	, and
Kentucky	LOCATION	, and reach
Cincinnati	LOCATION	.

		Again and again he reiterates that one motive of such connection was to tie together with bands of interest the different sections of the country , and so perpetuate the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		The scheme was worthy of a great industrial leader and a statesman .


South Carolina	LOCATION	sub - scribed liberally to the enterprise , as did also
Tennessee	LOCATION	: but difficulties were encountered in
Kentucky	LOCATION	, and
Ohio	LOCATION	did almost nothing .


Calhoun	PERSON	once gave his approval to the plan , and even suggested that he might accept the 96 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, presidency of the road .

		Hayne never made any such suggestion about himself , but was over - whelmingly elected .

		Calhoun soon found objec - tions to the French Broad route , resigned from the directorate , and worked for a route across
Georgia	LOCATION	to the
Mississippi	LOCATION	.

		One motive for this appears to have been a desire to sectionalize the country , tying the interests of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	to the old slave states , and allowing the great
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	to find its outlet through the
East	LOCATION	.

		So great was the opposition to his scheme that
Hayne	PERSON	finally compromised on routes , only to see failure written over his project before his untimely death in
1839	DATE	.

		Concerning the great debate with
Webster	PERSON	, it is not necessary to add much here .

		The notion that
Webster	PERSON	completely demolished
Hayne	PERSON	, once widely current , is no longer so generally accepted .

		Historically , except upon the great absurdity of Nullification and the beneficent influence of slavery ,
Hayne	PERSON	was nearer right than
Webster	PERSON	.

		But herein is to be found the greatness of the latter when con - trasted with the former .

		While
Hayne	PERSON	was harking back to the past , and looking to a written instrument and its contemporary inter - pretation as marking for all time the bounds of development for the nation ,
Webster	PERSON	, perhaps somewhat unconsciously , had turned to the future , and in what on its face was only an apotheosis of the Constitution he really com - pressed into a few glowing sentences the national aspirations of a great people which we are still working out .

		Subsequent history has set its seal of approval on
Webster	PERSON	rather than on
Hayne	PERSON	.

		A word should be said of Mr.
Jervey	PERSON	's book as a bit of historical biography .

		First of all , he should be commended for giving us an entirely sympathetic account of
Hayne	PERSON	, while at the same time condemning one of the great issues for which he fought , Nullification .

		He also deserves praise for set ` ing before us the broad-minded patriot who appeared after his favorite issue of Nullification had been side - tracked .

		Is the undercurrent of hostility to
Calhoun	PERSON	, discoverable throughout the book , to be justified ?

		Perhaps so , because of his mani - festations of littleness toward the main hero .

		The author has made good use of source material , some of which , such as contemporary newspapers , is not readily accessible .

		But in the matter of construction , his work is not above criticism .

		Even his meaning is sometimes rendered obscure by involved sentences and anti- quated punctuation .

		Quotations are very num - erous .

		The author has hardly protected himself against criticism on this score by his defense of
Hayne	PERSON	on the same charge .

		Perhaps a more serious criticism is that he has attempted to delineate a national hero in a setting almost entirely local .

		Even for the period when
Hayne	PERSON	was in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the amount of space devoted to national and local affairs is not well balanced .

		All things considered , however , Mr.
Jervey	PERSON	deserves our thanks for this study of a man who played a conspicuous part in one of the critical periods of our history .

		THE DIAL 97 part of the '' silence in the ether . ''

		Life had become for him an obsessing horror .

		He could no longer bear the '' Awful lot To live with palsied souls and numb Affections !

		Higher courage not With sound of prayer or sound of drum In battle or in martyrdom Was ever shown by saint or knight . ''

		And yet -- strange perversity !

		-- in this very city of dreadful night , in this very
London	LOCATION	with Fleet Street as its epitome , he could find matter for gen - uine poetry , and soar upon the wings of imagination into the purest heavens . ''

		Fleet Street '' is the name of his last volume , and the title of its most impres - sive poem -- a poem which links the bricks of the city in cosmic unity with the rings of
Saturn	ORGANIZATION	.

		The bricks are discontented , albeit an '' Indispensable , an integral Component of the world 's most famous street , '' and continue envious of the rings of
Saturn	ORGANIZATION	, although it is made clear that '' These seeming jewelled zones that shine so bright Are the mere wreck of matter , broken bits , Detached and grinding beaches of barren rock Hung up there as a menace and a sign ; Circular strips of chaos unredeemed , Whirling in madness of oppugnant powers . ''

		Urged to be proud of their `` telluric destiny , '' the bricks reply as with one voice : '' Upon my cubical Content , and by our common mother , I Had rather shine , a shard of chaos , set In
Saturn	ORGANIZATION	's glistening rings , the exquisite Enigma of the night , than be the unnamed , Unthought-of copestone or foundation-stone Of any merely world-distinguished street . '' '

		The application of this parable to the poet 's own case is only too evident .

		The
Crystal Palace	ORGANIZATION	, the railway station , and the automobile , are among the themes which he touches with the gleam of imagina - tion , and he gives us a couple of new '' Fleet Street Eclogues '' in the old fantastic vein .

		But bitterness is the underlying note of his verse , and mordant irony its characteristic method of expression .

		Him - self out of tune with life , he hears only discords and is powerless to effect their resolution . ''

		The Poems of
A. C. Benson	PERSON	, '' in the form now published , are not new .

		The stout volume of more than three hundred pages is a selection from the contents of half a dozen previously published vol - umes .

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	is as fluent a writer of verse as of prose , and his poems are thoughtful , placid , and refined , but not distinguished .

		They may fairly be taken at his own valuation . ''

		I can not sing as sings the nightingale , Frenzied with rapture , big with rich delight .

		Till lovers lean together , passion-pale , And chide the awestruck silence of the night . ''

		I can not sing as sings the tranquil thrush , O'er dewy thicket and untrodden lawn , When early gossamers veil the frosted bush In the chaste freshness of the sparkling dawn . ''

		I can not sing as sings the brooding dove , At windless noon , in her high towers of green , A song of deep content , untroubled love , With many a meditative pause between . ''

		I can not sing as sings the dauntless owl His shout of horror at a dark dead hour : When the hair pricks , and startled watch-dogs howl , And night-bells clamour in the lonely tower . ''

		But I can sing as sings the prudent bee , As hour by patient hour he goes and comes , Bearing the golden dust from tree to tree , Labours in hope , and as he labours , hums . ''

		We may say of this composition , as Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	once said of
Lamartine	PERSON	's `` Le Lac , '' that it is so typically illustrative of the author 's work as to make unnecessary the quotation of any further examples .

		`` Apollo and the Seaman '' is a long poetic dia - logue .

		The seaman , who has recently come ashore , is dispirited at the news that his ship has gone down . ''

		I heard them calling in the streets That the ship I serve upon -- The great ship Immortality -- Was gone down , like the sun . ''

		The god , who in mortal guise is seated with the seaman at an inn , takes up the subject , and works around to the suggestion that the good ship Earth may in the end prove a more trustworthy craft . ''

		O wrestler into consciousness , Stand upon Earth !

		Away !

		Long hath the journey been by night , But roseate breaks the day ; Like a scroll I unfold the mountain-tops And the windings of the bay . ''

		To the seaman 's question , `` Is there a hand upon the helm ? ''

		the answer is thus vouchsafed : '' Weigh thou thine own heart-fires , And her wash of overwhelming dawns And her tide that never tires -- Her tranquil heave of seasons -- flowers -- All that in thee aspires .

		How like an eagle on the abyss With outspread wing serene She circles !

		-- thought rolls under her And the flash from the unseen .

		But if thy former priestly ship Failed of the port assigned , The overwhelming globe takes on Her altar-flame of mind , See that the oils that feed the lamp Fail not . ''

		And so , pursuing his high argument , the god opens the seaman 's eyes to a deeper truth than he has ever visioned before , to the truth of the essential oneness of things , to the realization that a man 's cherished individuality -- which he so passionately hopes will be continued after his death -- is but the product of a fleeting illusion . ''

		Through the death-veil -- looming silvery -- Through the self - veil 's subtle strand , Dawns it not ?

		For that dawn thy heart Hath eye -- shall understand Before its seeing rock-walls melt And cracks the mortal band .

		For when once the whole consummate strength Of thy slow-kindling mind 98 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, Can see in the heart 's light at length All the strange sons of mankind , Then the
Earth	LOCATION	-- that else were but a strait Rock-sepulchre -- is new : Of what account to it is death ?

		It ia glowing , through and through , It moveth , alive with a God 's breath , Translucent as the dew ! ''

		This symbolical poem is vigorous and even rugged in expression , and has a nobility of thought and feel - ing that makes it akin to the ripest work of
George Meredith	PERSON	.

		But the poem forms only a small part of the contents of Mr.
Herbert Trench	PERSON	's significant volume , and other pieces claim our attention .

		The '' Stanzas to Tolstoy '' repeat the teaching of '' Apollo and the
Seaman	PERSON	, '' and we must reproduce one of them . ''

		The Man upraised on the Judaean crag Captains for us the war with death no more .

		His kingdom hangs as hangs the tattered flag Over the tomb of a great knight of yore ; Nor shall one law to unity restore Races or souls -- no staff of thine can urge Nor knotted club compel them to converge , Nor any backward summit lead them up : The world spring wherein hides Formless the God that forms us , bursts its cup -- Is seen a Fountain -- breaking like a flower High into light -- that at its height divides ; Changelessly scattering forth , -- in blaze and shower -- In drops of a trembling diaphaneity -- Dreams the God-breathings momently up-buoy To melt a myriad ways .

		Those dreams are we Chanted from some unfathomable joy . ''

		And still again , in the lyric , '' I Seek Thee in the Heart Alone , '' Mr.
Trench	PERSON	expounds his transcen - dental philosophy . ''

		Fountain of Fire whom all divide , We haste asunder like the spray , But waneless doth Thy flame abide Whom every torch can take away ! ''

		I seek Thee in the heart alone , I shall not find in hill or plain ; Our rushing star must keep its moan , Our nightly soul its homeward pain . '' ''

		Song out of thought , Light out of power , Even the consumings of this breast Advance the clearness of that hour When all shall poise , and be at rest . ''

		It cracks at last -- the glowing sheath , The illusion , Personality ; Absorbed and interwound with death The myriads are dissolved in Thee . ''

		The Meredithian glow and opidence , the Meredithian swiftness of intellectual motion , are evident in these examples , as throughout Mr.
Trench	PERSON	's volume .

		How high is his ideal of the mission of song may be seen in the following '' Stanzas on Poetry , '' in which the muse counsels the singer and exalts his lofty calling . ''

		In thee Man 's choir assembles , and finds tongue !

		Thy soul like
Roland	PERSON	's horn of echoes flung Must seize the mountains that it gropes among , Must strike and must betray the Invisible -- Black peaks that like a crowd of humbled Gods Attend the benediction of the Dawn ! ''

		Sing Valour , from the cradle to the pyre !

		Sing thine own country 's glories , grief and ire ; Hear thou the voice of every greening brier ; And in thy song let all her woods be temples , Her rude heights and calm headlands clothed in foam Nerve thee , and be within thee fortitudes ! ''

		Sing Love , and all that counteth not the cost ; And many a beautiful and unborn ghost -LRB- Even as the ever-widening starry host Steals from the luminous blue gulfs of evening -RRB- Softly shall join your ring of auditors Outside the sitters round the Tavern-fire . ''

		Some reprinted pieces , and a greater quantity of hitherto unpublished verse , are given us in Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	's '' Artemision : Idylls and Songs . ''

		The new matter consists chiefly of three long poems , '' Idylls of the
Huntress	PERSON	, '' picturing the goddess in her character as the implacable foe of earthly passion .

		We will extract a passage from each of the three , beginning with these lines from the tragedy of **
Leto	PERSON	's Child , '' the nymph Callisto transformed into aW `` See here The end of that hot charioteer Who gives the loose rein to that horse That needeth most the bridle 's force !

		Nor boots to tell how Areas grew Mighty hunter , or how he slew Unknowing his mother ; nor how She That loved her still raised her to be A starry wreath when Heaven lies clear : So in the sky men watch the Bear Mount with the shining host , and tell What was Callisto ere she fell .

		And thus sink they who serve Beauty Otherwise than on bending knee , Or dare to quench their fleshly dreams At holy wells , in holy streams To bathe their bodies .

		Beauty is rare And delicate withal , so fair , And thin a fabric , 't is a breath Of God 's , whose prisoning is death . ''

		In '' The Niobids , '' octosyllabics give place to heroic couplets . ''

		Still gazing stood that mother , stricken blind , Rigid in grief that stony is and numb , For that it biteth in and leaveth dumb The lips , and sealeth up the fount of tears : And still , men say , her lonely image rears A marble head among the empty hills , But now ' t is scored about with countless rills Whereby the traveller , hearing all the waters , Knows
Niobe	PERSON	weeps yet her sons and daughters .

		For having pity on that grief so dry , Our Lord Apollo gave her grace to cry : Kinder than She -LRB- whose kindness were to kill -RRB- , The Mistress of the cold nights on the hill ; Whose footfall is the soughing of the trees , And her white splendour seen when moonbeams freeze The bleacht earth huddled lowly on the plain ; Who slays and passes , looking not again ; Who , all too lovely to be loved , still goes Guarding with steadfast eyes her breast of snows . ''

		A stanzaic form is chosen for '' Latmos , '' which is a new version of the myth of Endymion .

		The goddess has spoken her last words to him , and put him to sleep . ''

		With that her pure throat let a little moan That she was made so fair , that all alone Her way must be , until in mortal man That grace of God be given to look upon Beauty for what it is , not what it can Give unto us for sop to batten on .

		THE DIAJL 99 '' So she with light upon her like a wreath Of stars sped on her way with undim 'd breath .

		One little sigh she suffered , such as Gods May know , who watch our footsteps far beneath Their skyey thrones -- envying our abodes .

		Envying our lives of love , perhaps our death . ''

		Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	is also a Meredithian , as we have long since known from his prose ; as a Writer of verse he rather emphasizes the
Meredithian	ORGANIZATION	vice of obscurity then the penetrating Meredithian vision .

		We always welcome the little books of verse that come to us from
Oxford	LOCATION	.

		They are not tumultuous calls from the world of action , but gentle reminders that there still remains somewhere , for those who care to seek it out .

		a world of contemplation in which the fever of life is soothed .

		Such a reminder is offered by Mr.

		• • The azure hive above is bright With swarms of golden bees : They glitter in the
summer	DATE	night Above the plumed trees . ''

		Dear alchemists of light they sing About their heavenly task : They circle on with tireless wing And no respite they ask . ''

		They store their treasure in the skies For those to taste who will : Their songs are full of sweet surprise For those whose lips are still . ''

		We must reprint one of Mr.
Xorthrop	PERSON	's many beau - tiful sonnets , and our choice shall be ' • For Ever , '' because of its harmony of grave diction and ripened thought .

		• • They prate of that eternity that glows Beyond the shadowed barriers we spend Our powers to mount : they tax their hours to rend The veil , whose pattern dark with secret woes Embroils our days and vanquishes repose .

		They tell us that this dusty journey 's end Will bring unending peace and rest to mend The bruised members from terrestrial blows . ''

		Believe them not !

		The hour at hand must reap In joy her own reward .

		To-day is part Of all eternity : the soundless deep Lies under , not beyond .

		The valiant heart Need seek no kingdom o'er the unmapped sea , Discovering here and now his sovereignty . ''

		This is the wisdom of Goethe ; in fact , it is practi - cally a paraphrase of a famous quatrain of ''
Faust	PERSON	, '' '' Thor , wer dorthin die Augen blinzend richtet , '' etc. .

		An

		Impatient seeker of the hidden truth .

		We mourn not thee , but those who call thee slain .

		The wings of morning never droop nor tire .

		Nor light grows weary of her crystal task : The cloud that so obscures man 's high desire Is his own making , and a needless mask . ''

		Upon the altars of thy thought flamed bright The Vestal fires of Truth : thy God was kind .

		Not made with hands ; nor worshipped aright Except in deeds and longings unconfined By barriers man-fashioned , absolute ; Through all thy days the heart 's clear rhapsody In gladness prayed and not one hour was mute : And on thy lips a constant melody . ''

Basque Pyrenees	LOCATION	, a story of simple peasant kindliness amplified in the Wordsworthian manner .

		Other longish poems in the little volume give us further philosophic moral - izings occasioned by rather trivial matters .

		The sonnet on '' The Shelley Memorial '' at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	will best serve us for illustration .

		• • Above him hangs a sapphire-coloured dome Superb with stars : but through the rifted floor Breaks like eternity -- his metaphor -- The light beyond .

		Thus in stirring jog-trot rhythm the poet sings of heroes dead and gone .

		Xow and then he writes in lighter vein , as when he thus discourses of primitive man : ' • He captured the girls he would wed , And clubbed them to keep them afraid ; He worshipped the ghosts of his dead ; He revelled in blood-feud and raid ; The price of slow progress he paid In ages of errors and woes , -- To struggle till evil shall fade Man in the beginning arose .

		Oft didst thou sojourn in
Immanuel	LOCATION	's land Where amid fountains , flowers , and foliage green The Hills Delectable , sun-crested , stand ; Whence by the Shepherds ' glass is partly seen , High o'er the gloomy river 's farther strand , The great Celestial City 's glorious sheen . ''

		Mr.
Frederick John Webb	PERSON	writes of '' Poetry '' in this exalted strain : '' I hold within my hand The gift of vision and song .

		From the twilight , shadowy land , Where spirits immortal long For the touch of an earth-born hand , Come dreams and the
spring	DATE	of song . ''

		I bring , deep in my heart , Passion and passion-won peace ; And visions that never depart , And songs that will only cease When the wayfaring , weary heart Shall rest in the infinite peace . ''

		And in my soul are born Dreams of the splendour of God ; To the soul of a creed outworn , To the soul of the earth-bound clod I call , and the souls , new-born , Are merged in the new-born God . ''

		Mr.
Webb	PERSON	also writes sonnets of exceptional beauty .

		We quote the sextet only of the sonnet on '' Tristan and Isolde . '' ''

		Wounded to death , in throbbing agony , I dream of beauty , where my lips may drink A draught of life , outlasting death 's rude gust ; Beyond the stars , beyond eternity , I hold but love , and leave all else to sink To ancient chaos and unconscious dust . ''

		We must also quote the latter half of '' The End of the Day , '' which is the envoy of the collection . ''

		Though our dream-songs all are flown With the day on golden wing , Yet the seed in morning sown Aftermath of youth shall bring . ''

		In the

		Seven lyrics and fifty sonnets make up Mr.
Lloyd Mifflin	PERSON	's latest volume , called `` Toward theUplands . ''

		The most important of the lyrics is an ode to `` The Thrush , '' in the manner of
Keats	PERSON	.

		The following section fairly carries the burden of the poem 's under - lying thought , and may , without too much violence to the context , be given by itself . ''

		Vain is the wish ! '

		T is not for me To touch thy feet in minstrelsy .

		The world hath need of sterner word Than I , or thou , darling Bird , Could e'er articulate .

		For thou art circumscribed by fate In all thy melody ; The little circle of thy lay , elate , Turns ever round thy mate and thee !

		Thou hast no prescience in thy song And so thou dost not feel The agonies that come from Wrong Dealt unto human weal .

		What canst thou know of deep vicarious pain In bosoms such as ours ?

		Of aspirations daily slain ' ?

		Of javelins in the quivering soul From onset of the worldly powers ?

		What canst thou know of death , and famine 's dole ?

		Or of the rising , world-ensanguined flood , -- ■ The crimson trend of temporal things , While tiger-hearted Kings Lap , with their thirsty swords , the Nations ' blood ? ''

		From Mr.
Mifflin	PERSON	's sonnets it is difficult to make a selection , so many and deserving are the claimants for distinction . ''

		Sunset over Camelot '' may be given for the richness of its imaginative coloring . ''

		Faint , bannered towers of strange magnificence Loom on the verge of evanescent steeps .

		Donjons , dismantled , crumble into moats Of liquid jasper .

		Raised Phoenix-wings Of cloud , burn into life .

		With scarlet scales , Pythons -- whose tongues belch flame -- in dragon-coils Fade in unfathomed antres of the air Whose darkest depths flash splendor ; over all , The encrimsoned Wyverns beat their vans of fire . ''

		So opulent in diction is this poem , that the absence of rhyme is hardly realized .

		The poems which Mr.
Cale Young Rice	PERSON	calls '' Nirvana Days '' fall into '' non-dramatic '' and '' more or less dramatic '' groups .

		The latter group contains the more vigorous work , and we should be glad to quote such a poem as '' In the Flesh , '' for example , did space allow .

		But we must rest content with `` The Soul 's Return , '' a quiet and sincere lyrical meditation . ''

		Let me lie here -- I care not for the distant hills to-day , And the blue sphere Of far infinity that draws away All to its deep , Would only sweep Soothing the farther from me with its sway . ''

		Let me lie here -- Gazing with vacant sadness on this weed .

		The cricket near Will utter all my heart can bear to heed .

		Another voice Would swell the noise And surge , that ever sound in human need . ''

		Let me lie here : For now , so long my wasted soul has tossed On the wide mere Of mystery Hope 's wing alone has crossed , I ask no more Than to restore To simple things the wonder they have lost . ''

		The most important group of Mr.
R. E. Lee Gibson	PERSON	's sonnets is of Mexican inspiration , and ''
Oaxaca	LOCATION	'' is a typical example . ''

		These hills , they say , are veined with precious ores ; Silver and gold their granite hearts contain , Whereof each year , the toil-worn miners drain , Out of the rocks , immeasurable stores .

		Two longer poems , their themes taken from
Chris	PERSON	- tian legend , fill out the measure of Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's vol - ume of refined and unpretentious verse .

		From a professional librarian we expect bookish verse , and Mr.
Harry Lyman Koopman	PERSON	gives it to us .

		with something besides .

		His long titular poem , `` The Librarian of the Desert , '' has for its subject the great library of the
Senussi	PERSON	brotherhood , in the oasis of
Kufra	LOCATION	, in the heart of the Libyan Desert .

		This library was removed in
1893	DATE	, borne upon the backs of several hundred camels , from its more exposed northern location to its present home three hundred miles farther away from danger .

		The following passage describes the journey . ''

		So , day after day For a score of days we press Ever our southward way Though a wilder wilderness , To the region set apart In the desert 's deepest heart To shelter our sacred lore .

		There at last shall we halt , Where the oasis lies enisled In a hundred leagues of sand That surge on every hand .

		By the hot winds driven and piled Barren as ashes or salt .

		But , to the Faithful 's eyes , A blessed bound it lies .

		No foeman shall pass o'er .

		And the Truth forevermore From the desert , as ever of yore , On earth shall be shed abroad ; And the gardens of earth that bloom , The gardens no less shall become Of the holy Faith , and man , In the desert brought face to face H ith the infinite blessing and ban , Shall live in every place As under the eye of God . ''

		The verse contained in Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's ''
Artemis	ORGANIZATION	to Actaeon '' has the qualities to be expected from that accomplished writer .

		In her poems , perhaps more than in her stories , we find great refinement of feeling , sublety of thought , and a diction that will bear close critical scrutiny .

		Intellectualized and spiritualized in a high degree , it provides the satis - faction that may always be got from intercourse with a rich and serious mind .

		These very charac - teristics place it outside the category of poetry in the pure spontaneous sense ; it is too sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought , its artifice is too evi - dent , its song -LRB- as far as it sings at all -RRB- does not well straight up from the heart .

		What we have said may be well enough illustrated by a passage from the titular poem , in which
Artemis	ORGANIZATION	gives Actaeon an elaborate explanation of the dulness of life upon
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	, and of the reasons which prompted her to accept his worship and to slay him for his temerity .

		He has , she urges , no reason to complain , -- '' For immortality is not to range Unlimited through vast Olympian days , Or sit in dull dominion over time ; But this -- to drink fate 's utmost at a draught , Nor feel the wine grow stale upon the lip , To scale the summit of some soaring moment .

		Nor know the dulness of the long descent .

		To snatch the crown of life and seal it tip Secure forever in the vaults of death . ''

		There is more of vitality in the poem which comes a little later in the collection , taking the form of a dramatic monologue spoken by
Vesalius	PERSON	when nearing the end of his days in exile .

		But even these words offer but a pale reflection of life itself .

		Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's verse reveals only the grayer aspects of human existence , and has its being in the shadows . ''

		Age after age the fruit of knowledge falls To ashes on men 's lips ; Love fails , faith sickens , like a dying tree Life sheds its dreams that no new
spring	DATE	recalls ; The longed-for ships Come empty home or founder on the deep , And eyes first lose their tears and then their sleep . ''

		Thus opens the poem called `` Non Dolet . ''

		The title makes a brave pretense , but its irony is too evident .

		Mrs.
Theodosia Garrison	PERSON	's poems offer a refresh - ing contrast to the drab coloring of the pieces just mentioned . ''

		The Joy o ' Life '' is their collective title , and it finds expression in buoyant sentiments set to swinging rhythms .

		• ■ Oh , the Joy o ' Life she calls me from the valley , Oh , the Joy o ' Life she hails me from the height , And her voice is like the thrill of the thrush when noon is still , And her laughter is the lilting of delight .

		I follow through the sunshine and the moonshine -- -LRB- Oh , I have seen the waving of her hand ! -RRB-

		In the paths that know the fleet , flying touches of her feet , At the music of her mocking of command . ''

		A favorite form with this writer is a sort of sym - bolical parable in ballad form , such as `` Stains . '' ''

		The three ghosts on the lonesome road Spake each to one another , ' Whence came that stain about your mouth No lifted hand may cover ' . ' ' '

		From eating of forbidden fruit , Brother , my brother . ' '' '

		The three ghosts on the sunless road Spake each to one another , ' Whence came that red burn on your foot No dust nor ash may cover ? ' '

		I stamped a neighbour 's hearth-flame out , Brother , my brother . '

		Yet on the earth clean men we walked , Glutton and Thief and Lover ; White flesh and fair it hid our stains That no man might discover . ' '

		Naked the soul goes up to God , Brother , my brother . ' ''

		This writer does not avert her gaze from sorrow and evil , but faces them with a brave front and a determination not to be cowed . ''

		God gives the battle to the strong -- His heroes armoured with their might , To those undaunted souls who fling Light laughter to sore suffering And dare to stand , resist , and smite . ''

		This exultant note is the dominant one from begin - ning to end of her volume .

		`` Confession , and Other Verses , '' by
Miss May Austin Low	ORGANIZATION	, again invites us to the mood of mel - ancholy . ''

		Chill is the night : Cold stars Creep from the clouds , and stare Down on the fields afar -- And branches brown and bare . ''

		Chill is my soul : Cold winds
Spring	DATE	from the past , to press Their hands upon my heart , and wake Grief 's unforgetfulness . ''

		Religious musing is an important element in Miss Low 's verse , and supplies what is perhaps its pre - vailing note .

		Miss
Sara Hamilton Birchall	PERSON	, on the other hand , chirps cheerily of the joyous and care-free life in her '' Songs of Saint
Bartholomew	PERSON	. ''

		The sursum corda appeal is heard even in those pieces which admit the existence of a shadowy side of the human pilgrimage , as in these stanzas on `` The Failures . '' ''

		We burn our youth out gaily , And , faith , we had our fun .

		We laughed and dreamed and trusted Luck , And now , at last , we 're done . ''

		The river is our kinsman , Fettered and foul and blue , With his yearning lap at the arches Where the tug-boats elbow through . ''

		One day , when the farce is ended , He '11 give us a friendly bed , When the New Year 's caught us napping With a gray , dishonoured head . ''

		Not yet we '11 claim our lodging , Good cousin , your sheets are damp -- The bitter east wind snatches At the flame of the flaring lamp . ''

		Not yet .

		We '11 risk our fortune , If the game goes up again , We '11 kiss

John McBride	PERSON	-RRB- .

		There are several paragraphs of preface by
M. Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	, a reprinting of the old '' Memoirs upon Louis XVII . ''

		by the
Royalist Eckard	ORGANIZATION	, a hundred pages of extracts from the memoirs of the insane imposter
Naundorff	ORGANIZATION	, an epilogue which supplements the memoirs to the extent of furnishing a biography of the enthusiast , an appendix explaining the circumstance on which the false Dauphins founded their claims and giving an account of the procedure of a dozen more promi - nent pretenders among the hundreds who appeared ; and , finally , the ingenious essay by
M. Joseph Turquan	PERSON	entitled '' New Light on the Fate of
Louis	LOCATION	XVII . ''


M. Turquan	PERSON	, who has found no new evi - dence but has made a earful independent study of the documents that exist , proves -- to his own satis - faction , at least -- first , that the royal child was assassinated in the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	on
January 19 , 1794	DATE	, between eight and nine o'clock at night ; second , that he was buried in the moat at once and secretly ; third , that a child who suffered from an incurable disease was put in his place , and that this child 's death was announced to the world as the death of the
Dauphin	LOCATION	; and , fourth , that the
Dauphin	PERSON	's sister , the Duchesse d'Angeuleme , learned the whole story shortly after her return to
France	LOCATION	, but , having been bound to secrecy by an oath , was careful never to reveal it .

		It would seem that
M. Turquan	PERSON	's evidences are some - what scanty to cover so considerable an extent of territory .

		The book , however , has interest and value as an epitome of a famous historic controversy which has long raged in
France	LOCATION	and found expression in our own country nearly a half century ago in the phrase '' Have we a Bourbon Among Us ? ''

		Two of the longest articles reprinted in the volume -- '' Free Schools in Vir - ginia '' and `` The Golden Hour '' -- are no longer of very live interest in themselves , dealing as they do with the establishment of public education and with the removal of negro slavery ; but as illustrat - ing the growth of the author 's mind and the develop - ment of his skill and power as a writer , they are not out of place .

William Penn	PERSON	, and
Ellen Dana Conway	PERSON	-LRB- the author 's wife -RRB- , are better worth reading for their own sake .

		As a whole , the book impresses one with its writer 's mental and spiritual freedom and dignity , and also with his mastery of a graceful and effective literary style .

		Among the forcible utterances of the article on '' Public Service , '' let us quote the following : '' Whenever a nation makes a conquest , it must live up to it or down to it ; must surround every sub - jugated country with a
Monroe	PERSON	doctrine , ever expand - ing till it involves hostility to the whole world and loss of that free-will which alone can really inherit the earth and enjoy it . ''

		As a reverent free-thinker , a sane and safe radical , and an ardent lover of and seeker for truth at any cost , Mr.
Conway	PERSON	deserves the widest possible reading .

		of a reverent writes is worthy of the attention of Liberahst .

		^ i se rious-minded people .

		He names the volume containing his last religious messages `` No Refuge but in Truth '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Although the beautifully printed book contains less than a hundred pages , yet , like the tiny branches of a loaded fruit-tree , they are richly stored with great thoughts and noble sentiments .

		The nine chapters contain discussions in miniature of such supremely important themes as `` Man and his Destiny , '' `` New Faith Linked with Old , '' '' The Scope of Evolution , '' `` The Limit of Evolution , '' `` The Immortality of the Soul , '' `` Is there a Revolution in Ethics ? ''

		`` The God of the Bible , '' and others .

		The book closes with a brief discussion of '' The Religious Situation . ''

		While there is little that is really original in these beautifully-moulded testimonies , they present many spiritual truths in a very fresh and helpful manner , the frank expression of a fearless mind .

		There is here no traditional or scientific dogmatism .

		To the aged veteran in the service of many high causes , the conclusion of the whole matter lies in this simple statement : '' There is no refuge for us but in truth . ''

		Professor
Smith	PERSON	accepts the doctrine of Evolution , but contends that merely materialistic evolution fails to account for man 's higher nature , which calls for other than physical explanation .

		A hint toward what Evolution fails to explain in man is found in the sentence , '' Beavers are wonderfully cooperative , but they have shown no tendency to establish a church ! ''

		The robust faith of the author is given in these words : '' A plan of which we are ignorant , but of which the end will be good , is apparently our only explanation of the mystery . ''

		Man 's help , and Under the rather to ° ambitious title his hindrances '' The Balance of Nature '' -LRB-
Dutton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- from animals .

		Mr
George Abbey	PERSON	classifies and analyzes the common animals and birds with refer - ence to the harm or good they do to man .

		The classification into '' Insectivorous and Harmless , '' '' Partly Useful and Partly Injurious , '' and ''
Destruc	PERSON	- tive , `` is applied in successive chapters to wild animals , wild birds , water birds , migratory birds , reptiles , and game .

		The author attempts neither to defend nor condemn , but with scientific impartiality tells the story of each creature 's habits and conduct from the standpoint of man 's welfare .

		If any fault is to be found with the author 's sense of justice , it is that while the second part of his book gives directions for trapping or otherwise destroying those creatures that sometimes do harm , no corresponding space is given to directions for protecting and preserving those that do good .

		The third section of the volume is devoted to domesticated animals , and makes many ingenious and amusing suggestions .

		One case is reported in which cats were employed successfully to patrol a strawberry bed and frighten away the birds .

		This was accomplished by placing collars around the cat 's necks , attaching chains to these collars , and allowing the chains , by means of rings at the farther end , to run on wires strung along the aisles of the strawberry beds . ''

		Saucers replete with milk and other evidence of food being supplied , rendered the arrangement complete . ''

		An abundance of cats and a scarcity of strawberries would seem to be implied by this ingen - ious scheme .

		Less fanciful and even more practical suggestions are made which householders and gar - deners might well give heed to .

		The volume is of substantial size , well made , and illustrated with a hundred and fifty '' diagrammatical drawings . ''

		A view of the trained cats doing police duty at the strawberry beds would have been an interesting addition .

		While the volumes add little to what is known of the men or the period , they are good popular expositions of their subjects , and will be found useful as well as readable .

		Especially interesting , in the volume on

Robes	LOCATION	- pierre as to the Revolution -- its causes , conditions , and results ; its leaders , interesting incidents , etc. .

		He was possessed of a single ruling idea , and had a fixedness of purpose , an indefatigable perseverance , that neither fate nor defeat could weaken or destroy .

Holland	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, the greater part of the book being naturally devoted to the vicissitudes of the colony at

		Due honor is paid to
Provincetown	LOCATION	, as the place of our forefathers ' first landing ; and some account is also given of the
Buzzards Bay	LOCATION	,
Connecticut River	LOCATION	, and
Penobscott River	LOCATION	trading posts , with one chapter on `` The Puritan Settlement at
Boston	LOCATION	. ''

		The author is in - clined to see the hand of fate leading these early settlers in their wanderings , and his final chapter he entitles '' A People of Destiny . ''

		In the imme - diately preceding chapter some glimpses are fur - nished of the every-day life of our

		A volume on such a subject could scarcely be expected to be proper literary diet virginibus puerisque ; and although there is perhaps nothing unnecessarily offensive in
M. Turquan	PERSON	's method of handling it , we have chronique scandaleitse from the first page to the last .

		The work is , of course , no more than a compilation .

		Fragments of more or less well-authenticated gossip are regularly sandwiched with cheap comment which strives to be at the same time cynical and respectable ; yet this narrative , in common with everything from M. Tur - quan , possesses the merit that covers a multitude of literary defects -- the merit of being eminently read - able .

		A psychologist might even find it possible to show that this author possesses both the virtues and the faults that make for popularity ; although a moralist might deplore the application of these quali - ties -- in this volume at least -- in a direction so little edifying .

		BRDZFER MENTION 127 NOTES 128 TOPICS UN SEPTEMBER PERIODICALS ... 129 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 129 TEE MOST MONSTROUS FABLE IN THE WORLD One of the most curious freaks of human intelligence is the instinct to attribute any remarkable thing or work to somebody else than the person who did it .

		There are of course occasions when it is right to suspect a '' ghost , '' but men overdo suspicion . ''


Garth	PERSON	did not write his own Dispensary , '' sings Pope , ironi - cally .

		Homer did not write the '' Iliad '' ;
Thomas a Kempis	PERSON	did not write the ''
Imita	PERSON	- tion '' ;
Emily Bronte	PERSON	did not write '' Wuthering Heights '' ; General
Grant	PERSON	did not write his Memoirs .

		As a rule , this instinct has its root in envy .

		Like the aspiring youth who fired the Ephesian dome , the people who possess it , knowing they are incapable of doing anything great them - selves , are determined to take those who can down a peg .

		They do not seem to see that , the works remaining , the wonder remains .

		In the case of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Bacon	PERSON	they only add to the wonder by their inexplicable sugges - tions .

		Bacon wears a massy crown of his own , and to give him
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's would be to create a power out of nature .

		However , it is not necessary to fall back on this instinct of jealousy to account for the Baconian craze .

		The supremacy of Shake - speare 's works themselves has been attacked of late by a good many leaders in literature -- Count Tolstoy , Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, Mr.
Ho wells	PERSON	,
Mark Twain	PERSON	, to name no more .

		The same set or current seems to be drifting others against the man
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		As their arguments , though bizarre enough , are by no means novel , so the answer to them must be a twice-told tale .

		But it seems necessary to make it .

		The one giant obsession of their minds is what they take to be the profound learning displayed in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		Bacon , they say , must have known a great deal more than
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Doubtless in some realms he did .

		But it is admitted by everybody that whoever wrote the plays was a mighty genius .

		Now genius is capable of almost anything , and surely it is capable of the acquisition of mere knowledge , which the dullest , by dint of industry , can attain to .

		And the learning in the plays is by no means 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, what the Baconians imagine it to be .

		They claim , for instance , that these works are evi - dently the productions of a trained and profound lawyer .

		Let us see .

		There is a strong probability that Shake - speare served some time , in his youth , as a law clerk .

		The accusation was brought against him soon after his arrival in
London	LOCATION	.

		Now the law which he is proficient in -- the law of property dealings , actions for trespass and dispossession , the law of commercial intercourse -- is just the kind of law that he might have picked up in a country lawyer 's office .

		And he tosses its terms about as though proud of such new-discovered riches -- as though putting his whole wealth in the show-window .

		Bacon , on the contrary , -- if I may trust my readings of his works , -- seldom uses law-terms or illustrations .

		He writes as one assured of being a classic , who is above business , cant , or slang words .

		Later in life ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's property interests would have confirmed him in a knowledge of this kind of law .

		Thousands of laymen since have acquired a larger stock of knowledge than the writer of the plays need have possessed .

		It is hard to think that a sound lawyer would have based a plot on the preposterous law of '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	. ''

		But of the old law , -- the great law of En - gland , the law that is embodied in
Littleton	LOCATION	's Institutes , a treatise which Sir
Edward Coke	ORGANIZATION	was moved to declare '' the most perfect and absolute work ever written in any science , '' -- of this law ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	knew nothing .

		Making a list of about thirty of the major words and law terms of this work , and going through the
Shakespeare Concordance	ORGANIZATION	, we can find only two of the most common of them .

		Of course , if
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	did not use the law terms he did not discuss the law matter .

		There is another species of law , the law of nations and of kingly inheritance , with which in his historical plays Shakespeare does show ac - quaintance .

		But , as Mr.
Churton Collins	PERSON	has pointed out , the passages where he deals with this are taken mainly from his authorities , gen - erally with only enough change to turn prose into verse .

		Shakespeare is no more responsible for the law of such passages than for the exist - ence of the historical personages themselves .

		As with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's law , so with his other learning -- excepting only his close knowledge of nature and country customs , of which there is not a trace in
Bacon	LOCATION	.

		Shakespeare 's knowl - edge was wide , varied , and vivid ; but it was never exact , minute , scholarly .

		It was , again , such knowledge as a great intelligence would pick up from casual or purposed reading , con - versation , and experience of life .

		There is such a thing as a paralysis of learning ; as witness Gray and Landor .

		Shakespeare 's was the kind which the greatest poets have instinctively aimed at .

		Lowell says that when
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	wanted any facts about antiquity , he would take a ruminating Professor of Greek or Sanscrit aside and quietly milk him .

		No doubt
Shakespeare	PERSON	did the same .

		His knowledge , however , is more flawed and questionable than that of more cautious modern poets .

		Bacon would have shuddered at some of the blunders , historical , geographical , or liter - ary , which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	makes .

		I have read the English version of all of
Bacon	LOCATION	's works , and I can recall no error of grammar in them , as grammar was practised then .

		But , as everybody knows ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's grammar is a law to itself .

		There is , I think , a class feeling growing up among the educated and patrician class against
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		They believe that
Shakespeare	PERSON	did not belong to them , and that
Bacon	PERSON	did .

		As an argument against genius , this is of course an absurdity .

		The two English poets ,
Burns	PERSON	and
Keats	PERSON	, who perhaps come nearest to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in vividness of realization and gift of language were of far lower extraction than he was , and one of them was of practically no book education at all .

		But let us see how the case for gentility stands between
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Bacon	LOCATION	.

		The name of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has certainly a noble sound , and , despite the numerous bearers of it scattered over
England	LOCATION	, most of them in the poorer walks of life , it is at least possible that some remote ancestor may have been of noble blood .

		Shakespeare 's father certainly got a coat of arms .

		Such transactions have always been open to question , but it is purely gratuitous to assert that the Heralds were wrong in grant - ing it .

		No direct attack was made on it at the time , though some other like grants were ridi - culed .

		Even if there had been a query of it , we at this late day could not tell whether this was not due to envy and malice .

		As it is ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is in possession .

		His enemies must prove an ouster , which so far they have not done .

		On his mothers side , fortunately , there is no doubt .

		It is generally conceded that
Mary Arden	PERSON	was of long and gentle descent .

		The genealogist traces her back to
Alfred the Great	ORGANIZATION	.

		Now , what of
Bacon	LOCATION	's descent ?

		His father , Sir
Nicholas Bacon	PERSON	, was a distinguished man , the Lord Keeper of the Seals .

		But his grand - father was a tutor who acquired a Prince 's favor .

		Bacon 's mother 's name was
Cooke	PERSON	.

		Shake -
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 speare and
Arden	PERSON	,
Bacon	PERSON	and
Cooke	PERSON	, -- what a contrast of cognomens !

		Another delusion about
Bacon	PERSON	is that he was from the first a great and powerful nobleman , quite able and willing to fling away such trifles as the Shakespearian plays .

		As a matter of fact he was .

		until the succession of James in
1603	DATE	, a struggling lawyer and courtier , laboring under the disfavor of
Elizabeth	PERSON	and the rivalry of a greater lawyer ,
Sir Edward Coke	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1598	DATE	, when
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	must have been entering into the enjoyment of an income which Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	estimates as equal to 635,000 a year now ,
Bacon	PERSON	was arrested for debt .

		If there is any - thing absolutely established about
Bacon	PERSON	's char - acter , it is that he was greedy in the extreme -- venal .

		He accepted presents from anyone who would give them ; and he took bribes .

		Is it conceivable that such a man would give away works that were mainly responsible for Shake - speare 's princely income ?

		But it is urged that
Shakespeare	PERSON	took no care of his works , -- did not bring out an edition of them .

		Well , neither did
Bacon	LOCATION	.

		The latter was alive when the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	was published with all its horrors on its head -- blunders , omis - sions , bad arrangement .

		Anyone who knows an author 's sensitiveness as to misprints and mis - takes in his published works will accept the fact that
Bacon	PERSON	did not secretly or otherwise exercise any supervision over the folio , as good proof that he had nothing to do with its contents .

		Shake - speare died suddenly , at a comparatively early age .

		His plays belonged to the theatre , and he probably could not have brought them out had he wished to .

		We have said above that the author of the Plays was unquestionably a great genius , and that genius is capable of almost anything .

		Is it more incredible that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, decently born , decently bred , should have been able to acquire the knowledge exhibited in his plays than that a starveling Corsican lieutenant , without money , without friends , should have been able in ten years to make himself master of
Europe	LOCATION	?

		But the chief evidence for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, to those competent to judge , is internal .

		The differ - ence between the minds of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Bacon	LOCATION	, between their tempers , their ideals , as expressed in their works , is as great as between any two men or any two sets of productions in the history of the world .

		They are antipodal .

		It is the contrast between the metaphysical and poetic mind and the historical and scientific mind .

		Lord
Bacon	PERSON	's boast that he had taken all knowledge for his province is ill-founded ; for he evidently knew comparatively little about pure literature , and not much more about pure philosophy .

		He called the metaphysical sciences barren virgins .

		He was a utilitarian , a scientist almost of the modern type .

		He had largeness and greatness in his style , and his dreams of the future of science are grandiose ; but he declined to meddle with the things of the spirit , the emotions of the soul .

		Shakespeare , whether he had much reading in philosophy or not , is meta - physical by bent .

		He throws himself into all emotions and passions , and the great questions of life and death and the hereafter haunt him eternally .

		Lord
Bacon	PERSON	got his death by getting out of his carriage to stuff some snow into a fowl , to see if that would preserve it .

		Perhaps here was the germ of our modern cold-storage sys - tems ; but can we imagine the creator of Hamlet thinking of such a thing ?

		Lord
Bacon	PERSON	left some verses .

		If any critic can believe that they were written by the hand that wrote
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's poetry , then
King Midas	LOCATION	has a lineal descendant .


Lord Bacon	PERSON	, interested in many things , gath - ered together in his Apothegms a large number of witty or humorous stories .

		Some of them are really good ; but they are told in so dry a style , with such an absence of unction or lightness , that we can only think of the creator of Falstaff reading them with despair .

		Lord
Bacon	PERSON	also attempted a romance . ''

		The New Atlantis '' is a philosophical story , whose central idea has merit .

		But dreary abstractions take the place of personages , and there is only the vaguest realization of scene or action .

		One of the most remarkable characteristics of the Plays is their stagecraft -- the knowl - edge of stage effects and stage business which permeates them .

		They have been tested for three hundred years , under all conditions , and have outlived most of the theatre-pieces of the world largely by reason of this skill and knowl - edge .

		It is improbable , to say the least , that anyone but a man intimately familiar with the stage , its methods and secrets , could have wrought this miracle .

		Certainly
Francis Bacon	PERSON	had no such experience .

		But enough .

		The best answer to the
Ba	ORGANIZATION	- conian balderdash is silence .

		And the men most competent to speak have practically adopted it .

		Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	, in his monumental Life of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, gives a paragraph to the question .

		Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	gives it a note of a page or so .

		Mr.
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	does not mention the matter at all .

		Dr.
Furness	PERSON	, 1 believe , has never chosen to discuss it .

		But mischief is being done .

		By 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, constant reiteration the delusion is effecting a lodgment in the public mind .

		The newspapers joke or equivocate about it .

		People think there must be something in a claim which is so dinned in their ears .

		If
Lord Bacon	PERSON	had made any claim to the works , if any contemporary or writer in the next generation had hinted at it , there might be a case stated --
Lord Bacon	PERSON	might have an arguable interest in the works .

		But nothing of the sort happened .

		It was reserved for the last sixty years to unearth this mare 's nest and exploit it with an expenditure of ink and paper which makes it the most monstrous fable of the world .

		The intolerable injustice of the attempt made to rob one of the world 's supreme bene - factors of his reputation and glory does not seem to strike anyone .


Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		Echoes of the
Tennyson	PERSON	centenary cele - bration , just passed , are many and diverse .

		The most interesting contributions to the occasion come from those who knew
Tennyson	PERSON	and are able to give some personal impressions or recollections of him .

		Of this number is
Colonel T. W. Higginson	PERSON	, who visited the poet at
Farringford	ORGANIZATION	in
1872	DATE	, and now for the first time gives -LRB- in the
Boston	LOCATION	ft Transcript '' -RRB- an account of the event -- he having conscientiously refrained from publishing it heretofore by reason of an assurance he had given his host that he had not come for the purpose of gathering literary material .

		But the narrative has not spoiled by keeping .

		Mr.
Higginson	PERSON	describes the poet as '' the very most un - English looking man '' he had yet encountered , and adds : '' He was tall , high-shouldered , careless in dress and in attitude , yet most striking and com - manding in figure .

		With an unusually high and dome-like forehead , he had beneath it brilliant black eyes and tangled grayish hair and beard , which , as I find recorded in my diary , ' gave him rather the air of a partially reformed Corsican bandit or else an imperfectly secularized Carmelite monk than that of a decorous and well-groomed English citizen . ' ''

		After a momentary dissatisfaction at failing to per - suade his visitor to smoke with him in his study , the host led the way to the garden , where the two '' sat down beneath a large tree , and he talked quite freely about his own books , reciting little passages here and there .

		He reminded me , '' says
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	, `` of descriptions of ``
Wordsworth	PERSON	, whom I had never seen ; that is , of a man rather too isolated in his daily life and too much absorbed in his own fancies .


Lord Houghton	PERSON	, his lifelong friend , said to me after - wards , '
Tennyson	PERSON	asks unmixed flattery . '

		This I should not venture to say ; but I observed that when speaking of other men , he would mention as an important trait in their characters the fact whether they liked his poems or not .

		Lowell , as
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	evidently thought , did not appreciate him .

		Perhaps this distrust is a habit of all authors , and it was only that
Tennyson	PERSON	spoke out , in a rather childish way , what others might have kept back . ''

		Much more serious than the amiable weaknesses depicted by Col - onel
Higginson	PERSON	are some faults of character brought out in an article on '' The Human Side of Tennyson '' in '' The Bookman '' for
August	DATE	.

		The writer charges not only that the poet sometimes showed `` selfish - ness and perhaps ingratitude , '' but had '' a strong vein of coarseness '' in his nature .

		An incident given in illustration is not very convincing -- one which the writer thinks `` has never before been printed , '' whereas it has been in print for twenty-five years or more , although in its present form it is so badly told that the effect is changed and the point well-nigh lost .

		The story , which many of our readers doubt - less have heard or read , is that of a somewhat heated discussion between
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Carlyle	LOCATION	, in which the former had driven the irascible hero - worshipper into a defence of the hated
Norman Conqueror	PERSON	and his depredations upon English soil ; to which
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	had retorted by giving pretty forcible expression to his notion of what would have happened to the invader '' if he had come around my premises with your d -- d doctrine that might makes right . ''

		In other words , that was a game that two could play at .

		Tennyson 's expression was energetic , even fierce ; but it did not necessarily imply coarse - ness , any more than the execution of the savage threat would have indicated coarseness in a man who stood as the defender of his home and land .

		More astonishing still is the same writer 's statement , made without qualification of any sort , that '' when
Longfellow	PERSON	first visited Tennyson the Englishman entertained him for an hour or more with the nar - ration of obscene stories . ''

		This is certainly going pretty far in the study of '' personality . ''

		It has been said that
Lincoln	LOCATION	, in his fondness for story - telling , did not always draw the line at delicacy ; but we have never heard that he could tell `` obscene stories '' by the hour to a perfect stranger and a gentleman of obvious refinement and distinction who was his guest .

		The chances are that the
Longfellow	LOCATION	incident has been greatly exaggerated and distorted , and does not at all warrant the sweeping statement that in
Tennyson	LOCATION	was to be found '' a strong vein of coarseness that belonged to the very nature of the man . ''

		... The tragedy of Victor
Hugo	PERSON	's daughter is recalled by the preparations now in process for a grand Hugo celebration this month in
Paris	LOCATION	, on the occasion of the unveiling of a new statue of the French author by
Rodin	ORGANIZATION	.

		The day chosen is the 26th , the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of '' La Legende des Sihcles '' ; and among other fes - tivities there will be a revival of '' Le Roi s ' Amuse '' at the Com ^ die Francaise , where a box will be re -
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 117 served for
Adele Hugo	ORGANIZATION	, the poet 's daughter , whose tragic and mysterious history rivals in interest any romance of her father 's .

		In her girlhood she was kidnapped -- so the story runs -- and carried away from her home in the isle of
Guernsey	LOCATION	.


Europe	LOCATION	was searched in vain for her by the distracted parents , hut after several months they received word of her from a different and unexpected quarter .

		In the streets of
New York	LOCATION	a girl had been found wander - ing alone and apparently demented , answering all inquiries with `` I am the daughter of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, '' and nothing more .

		She was sent back to her home , but with wide-staring eyes she remained dumb to all questioning as to her disappearance , except to repeat the assertion of her parentage .

		Never wholly re - covering her reason , she has lived a life of gloom and solitude in her father 's villa , occasionally visit - ing
Paris	LOCATION	to witness from the back of a darkened box one of his plays , but having no friends and receiving no visitors .

		... The scope of a city library 's beneficent activities is acknowledged to be wide , despite the occasional indulgence on the part of some less wise librarian , or children 's librarian , in what may rea - sonably be judged to partake of foolishness and trivi - ality .

		A good example of vigorous and effective energy exerted in various legitimate directions is furnished by the
Free Public Library of Newark	ORGANIZATION	.

		New Jersey . ''

		The work of the library , '' writes Mr.
Dana	PERSON	, in his latest report of progress , '' is not confined to the lending of books .

		The main build - ing is far more spacious , relatively to the size of the city and the number of volumes , than any public library building in the country -- to say nothing of its advantages in conveniences and attractiveness ; and through the generous policy in regard to its use which the trustees have adopted and the city has approved , this building has become a centre for no small amount of literary , philanthropic , art , science , civic , and general educational activity .

		This is shown in a measure by the gatherings for mutual and public welfare and improvement held here in
1908	DATE	, which reached a total of 662 , with about 22,106 in attendance ; and by the 15 exhibits of the year , with an attendance of 30,000 . ''

		Especially noteworthy is the
Newark	LOCATION	system of numerous branches and deposit stations , there being in all now 324 such centres of distribution for the convenience of book-borrowers ... Misspelling among the educated , or the sup - posedly educated , is apparently on the increase -- thanks , it may be , to the passing of the '' spelling bee '' and to the crowding of the school curriculum with a multitude of studies unknown and undreamt - of by our sturdy ancestors ; and thanks also , perhaps , to the present movement for phonetic spelling , which the indolent are tempted to interpret as '' spelling as you please . ''

		In a statistical analysis of the spell - ing of his students , Professor
William B. Bailey	PERSON	of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	makes some startling revelations .

		Of 171 essays written by seniors and juniors , only twenty - five were orthographically correct , while fourteen per ` cent contained each ten or more misspelled words , and one heterographic genius achieved thirty - one mistakes of this sort .

		There were 443 mis - spellings in all , and six especially troublesome words were '' separate , '' '' superintendent , '' '' governor , '' `` committee , '' `` comptroller , '' and `` privilege , '' the last masquerading as privalege , privilige , priviledge , privelege , privilidge , and privaledge .

		Certainly the later years of a course in a great university are not the occasion for remedying the deficiencies of ele - mentary studies in the common schools .

		HI fares the school , to latest fads a prey , where courses multi - ply and the three R 's decay .

		• • • The artistic aspect of things , it is encourag - ing to be assured by Mr.
Henry T. Bailey	PERSON	, of the national
Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	, is not altogether eclipsed in this money-making country by the com - mercial and industrial and practical aspect .

		In a statistical account of the millions that go every year for art and art instruction , it appears that a round million is spent in subscriptions to art periodicals , and half as much in the support of our
summer	DATE	art schools .

		Two millions and a half are received yearly by private schools of fine and applied art , and about the same amount by teachers of art in other schools and colleges .


Massachusetts	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	take the lead in every branch of art education , but the other States are moving forward rather than backward in this department of liberal culture .

		Unworked Shakespearian mines still await the delver in Shakespearian lore , despite the tons of literature that the immortal dramas have already inspired .

		A recent Danish work , by Mr.
August Goll	PERSON	, on '' Criminal Types in Shakespeare '' is spoken of as possessing interest of a novel kind .

		Its author , failing to find in
Lombroso	LOCATION	and in studies of actual criminals the data he desired , resorted at last to the imaginary but ever-living types of rascality to be met with in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's pages ; and the results of his researches ought to be especially wel - come at this time , if only as proof that in Shake - speare 's works we do , after all , possess something more than a puzzle-book of ciphers and cryptograms .

		A faithful portrait-painter of the North American Indian is treating his readers to pen - pictures of the vanishing redskin 's manners and customs , of a sort that greatly contents many of us to whom
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	's artificial and impossible Indian and conventional and hackneypd plots are unbear - able .


Mark Twain	PERSON	's well-known strictures on the author of the Leather-stocking tales conspicuously fail to apply to Mr.
Frederick R. Burton	PERSON	, author , musician , and composer , who has lived among the Ojibways , studying their music and their morals , their character and their traditions , and whose `` Red - cloud of the Lakes '' -LRB- as in a lesser degree also his earlier '' Strongheart '' -RRB- is a noteworthy production , full of high purpose and absorbing interest .

		COMMEMOBATIOXS OF
EDGAR ALLAX POE	PERSON	.

		* It is not too much to say that most of the books and critical articles on
Poe	PERSON	published in this his centenary year have been a negligible quantity .

		This has been true of what has ap - peared in French and English reviews , as well as of what we have written in
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's own gas - lighted
Philistia	LOCATION	.

		The romance of the life was written by the poet himself , and by those ear - lier admirers for whom he wore a green halo .

		Then came the Griswolds and their like , on the one hand ; and , on the other , extravagant ad - mirers and apologists like Mr.
Didier	PERSON	.

		Last of all came the opportunity of the critical biog - rapher , whose privilege it is to clear the life of its legends and to arrive at its facts .

		This is just what Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	essayed to do some years ago , in his memoir of Poe contrib - uted to the '' American Men of Letters '' series ; and in the new two - volume biography which he calls `` Personal and Literary '' he takes several steps further in the same direction : seeking to represent a
Poe	PERSON	who was neither hero nor superman nor scoundrel , merely a man of un - questioned intellectual force , of keen analytical powers , of intense if never very varied imagin - ation , -- a man lacking only in that fine some - thing that may or may not accompany genius , moral strength .

		The enlargement of the memoir which he wrote more than twenty-five years ago has given Professor Woodberry the opportunity to include here an increased quantity of material descrip - tive of that sad career .

		We realize more than ever how the poet 's life was forever embarrassed and troubled , and with what a whole soul
Poe	PERSON	could cry out , '' To coin one 's brain into silver , at the nod of a master , is , to my thinking , the hardest task in the world . '' ''

		Most wretched men Are cradled into poetry by wrong : They learn in suffering what they teach in song . ''

		And yet it is not solely in biographic detail * The Life of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	, Personal and Literary .

		Published under the
Auspices of the University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	.

		New York :
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		that Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	's memoir has been enriched in the rewriting .

		Thus , in the earlier biography the name of
Hoffmann	PERSON	does not so much as appear ; while in the first of the two new volumes several pages are given to an ex - amination of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's possible debt to or kinship with the German romancer .

		Professor Wood - berry is skeptical here . ''

		It is essential , '' he writes , '' to show
Poe	PERSON	's contact with
Hoffmann	PERSON	before that time , '' the time , that is , of the pub - lication of '' The Visionary , '' in
October , 1833	DATE	.

		He adds : `` This contact could not have been direct ; it is as little likely to have been in French -LSB- sic -RSB- , the only translation at that time being of the date 1830 , issued at
Brussels	LOCATION	, and
Poe	PERSON	's chances of encountering it being remote indeed .

		What he knew of
Hoffmann	LOCATION	, there - fore , may safely be referred to magazine notices of that writer and other German romancers ...
Hoffmann	PERSON	was at most only one of many contemporary influences playing upon
Poe	PERSON	's receptive and pliable genius , and the knowledge
Poe	PERSON	had of him must have been of the slightest , as none was available except through
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Scott	PERSON	, who had brought him forward in
1827	DATE	in English reviews . ''

		Carlyle 's article on the German novelists belongs , all the same , to the year
1825	DATE	; nor does Pro- fessor
Woodberry	PERSON	note the fact that as early as
1824	DATE	there appeared in
Blackwood	LOCATION	's a transla - tion of '' Die Elixiere des Teufels , '' sometimes associated with ''
William Wilson	PERSON	'' ; that in
1826	DATE	`` The Lost Reflection '' -LSB- `` Die Geschichte vom Verlornen Spiegelbilde '' -RSB- figured in the ``
Boston Athenaeum	LOCATION	, or Spirit of the English Magazines '' ; and that in the same year no less than three of
Hoffmann	ORGANIZATION	's tales appeared at
London	LOCATION	in trans - lation , ''
Das Fraulein von Scudery	PERSON	, '' ''
Das Ma	PERSON	- jorat , '' `` Meister Floh . ''

		The biographer refers to the four - volume translation of
Hoffmann	PERSON	pub - lished at
Brussels	LOCATION	in
1830	DATE	, as the first French translation .

		Publication of the well-known Loeve-Veimars version of the tales was none the less begun at
Paris	LOCATION	in
1829	DATE	-LRB- to be concluded four years later -RRB- ; and publication of a transla - tion by Toussuel was begun in the year
1830	DATE	.

		To suggest that
Poe	PERSON	's opportunities of knowing
Hoffmann	PERSON	were at least larger than Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	leads his readers to suppose , is , how - ever , very far from claiming that Poe '' was mis - placed in
America	LOCATION	... a German born out of due latitude , a
Hoffmann	PERSON	come into the world in a land of alien ways and spirit . ''

		The earlier memoir , as has been suggested , is the basis of the two volumes now published -- their more or less fleshy skeleton .

		In mod - ernizing his former work , Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	has found it necessary to modify very few of his opinions ; he has , however , dealt more fully
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 119 with the question of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's weaknesses and with the controversial aspects of his subject , -- for he has everywhere used a greater amplitude of detail .

		The study of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	gains , by this method , as a record of fact , as a repository of much useful information : here , be it confessed , rather than in firmness or proportion .

		Professor Wood - berry seems to have found it impossible to incorporate all of his material in these volumes : each volume is swelled by undigested notes in the form of appendices , along with various pieces justicatives and unpublished letters .

		As an encyclopaedia of the professional and private adventures of
Poe	PERSON	, this new memoir is indeed of the highest value .

		It is Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	's modest suggestion that while • • there will be other lives of Poe '' he will be content '' to have here edited with care the materials for his life , '' making easier the way of the future '' ideal biographer .

		* ' This sen - tence has phrased the final criticism of the book before us .

		A newspaper paragrapher has justly enough remarked that some critics know better what
Poe	PERSON	drank than what he wrote .

		Chacun son gout .

		Some find the details of a poet 's amours no less attractive .

		We have had minute ac - counts of * • George Sand and her Lovers , '' of ''
Rousseau	PERSON	and the Women he Loved , '' ad nauseam .

		In
Poe	PERSON	's case this kind of interest centres upon his relations with the various '' poetesses , '' both before and after
Virginia	LOCATION	's death .

		It is true that no one in recent years has questioned the fidelity of
Poe	PERSON	to his child - wife .

		One of Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	's chapters is , then , devoted to
Helen Whitman	PERSON	.

		It will be remembered that the
Rhode Island	LOCATION	poetess was one of the two women whom
Poe	PERSON	asked to marry him in the period of his widowerhood .

		It seems a great pity that these matters ever became the subject of controversy or even of discussion .

		They reflect no credit on any side -- though the scandals which mischief-makers have sought to weave around them have fallen flat enough .

		In giving his account of Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	, and in quoting
Poe	PERSON	's letters to her , written in the year
1848	DATE	, the biographer has been obliged to follow the incomplete and garbled versions of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's letters supplied by
Ingram	PERSON	.

		Now , however , we have '' The
Last Letters of Poe	ORGANIZATION	to
Sarah Helen Whitman	PERSON	, '' edited by Professor
Harrison	PERSON	, and published '' under the auspices of the Uni - versity of
Virginia	LOCATION	. ''

		Professor
Harrison	PERSON	writes that in foreign countries it is the custom to celebrate the jubilee of a distinguished author by a Festschrift , '' or Literary Memorial of some kind containing unpublished data , original research , or memorabilia of a notable kind '' ; and that '' it seemed appropriate that the Alma Mater of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	should carry out this graceful custom in honor of his Hundredth Birthday . ''

		The memorial volume is hand - somely printed , and very scrupulously prepared from the original manuscripts ; its text is pre - ceded by a reproduction of the unfamiliar miniature of
Poe	PERSON	painted when he was aged twenty-six -- the earliest known portrait .

		It is none the less difficult to share Professor
Harrison	PERSON	's enthusiasm for these letters , that '' rival the ' Sonnets from the Portuguese ' or the letters of
Abelard	ORGANIZATION	and Heloi ` se in interest and eloquence . ''

		Their issue serves at least to emphasize the inaccuracy of the portions of these '' Last Letters '' previously reproduced -- to emphasize certain inaccuracies even in Pro- fessor
Woodberry	LOCATION	's book .

		Words altered by the meddlesome
Ingram	PERSON	; passages suppressed without indication of the fact ; mistaken dates , -- these remain to be corrected in the reprinting of the fourteenth chapter of this latest biog - raphy .

		Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	attributes also to Miss
Anna Blackwell	PERSON	, and not to
Miss Lynch	LOCATION	, the description of Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	given to
Poe	PERSON	before his meeting her , referred to by him in his letter of
October 1 , 1848	DATE	, which is repro - duced in part -LRB- undated -RRB- on pages 266 -- 267 .

		These are matters of detail , however ; the biog - rapher 's general statements remain true enough . ''

		Poe had made up his mind , '' is the conclusion , '' to adopt Mrs.
Shew	PERSON	's advice , and to try to save himself in what she had declared the only possible way , -- marriage .

		He meant to extri - cate himself from his poverty by marrying a woman with property .

		This was his practical plan , wholly aside from his entanglement with any particular woman ; but he worked it out under the conditions of his temperament .

		He had found romantic attachments consistent with his previous marriage , and he did not consider them inconsistent with his wooing .

		He was irre - sponsible '' ; and , besides , `` the contact of such abnormal natures as
Poe	PERSON	and Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	was full of danger . ''

		There is every reason to accept Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	's affirmation that his attack upon some of the questions raised here was rather against his will -- that it is only the circumstance that so many lies have been told that makes it worth while to tell the whole truth .

		As far as these last matters go , they only remind us of what Ik Marvel wrote , -- words quoted in The Dial .

		only a few months since . ''

		He was never the 120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, same again '' after the loss of
Virginia	LOCATION	-- the culmination of his troubles . ''

		It were better , perhaps , if the story of it all had never been told . ''

		Had good taste been used from the be - ginning , it never would have been told .

		Yet , since part has been repeated , it is well that we should now have it all out and done with .

		And if the story is not , even to-day , complete , it is as fully documented as it is ever likely to be .


Warren Barton Blake	PERSON	.

		A Famous Chapter in Amerkan Politics .

		* Professor Ray 's book on the origin of the repeal of the
Missouri Compromise	ORGANIZATION	treats of so important a subject , and brings together so much new contemporary newspaper evidence , that it will be of great interest both to the pro- fessional student and to the intelligent reader of American history .

		In a speech at
Atchison	LOCATION	,
Kansas	LOCATION	, during the fall following the repeal of the
Compromise	ORGANIZATION	, Senator
Atchison	PERSON	claimed for himself the credit of having originated that measure , asserting that he had required that
Douglas	PERSON	should either resign the chairmanship of the
Senate Committee	ORGANIZATION	on Territories or bring in the bill .

		Atchison was reported to be under the influence of liquor when he made the speech , and his claim has usually been regarded by his - torians as the braggadocio of a drunken man .

		Professor Ray finds in it , however , the key with which to unlock the mystery of the origin of the Repeal .

		By way of background to his narrative he gives an account of the movement in
Missouri	LOCATION	politics which resulted in the retirement of
Benton	LOCATION	from the
United States Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first attempt to defeat
Benton	PERSON	was made by the
Calhoun	PERSON	faction in
1844	DATE	; but the attempt failed .

		The opposition to
Benton	LOCATION	next showed itself in
1847	DATE	.

		The Bentonites carried through the
Missouri	LOCATION	legislature a series of resolutions affirming the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise .

		The oppo - sition replied with counter-resolutions denounc - ing the Compromise and asserting that the right to prohibit slavery in a territory belonged exclu - sively to the people thereof , and could be exer - cised only when forming a
State Constitution	ORGANIZATION	.

		These resolutions , defeated in
1847	DATE	, were car - ried in
1849	DATE	.

		Benton immediately issued an '' Appeal '' from the instructions contained in * The Repeal of the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise : Its Origin and Authorship .

		By
P. Orman Ray	PERSON	, Ph.D. .

		Cleveland :
The Arthur H. Clark Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		them , and replied in a famous speech at
Jef	LOCATION	-
ferson City	LOCATION	, the substance of which he repeated throughout the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The issue was the val - idity of the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise ; and on this issue
Benton	PERSON	was defeated for reelection to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1853	DATE	, the
Richardson	PERSON	bill for the organ - ization of
Nebraska	LOCATION	as free territory passed the
House	ORGANIZATION	, but failed in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	,
Atchison	PERSON	supported the bill , despite its recognition of the validity of the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise , explaining afterward that he did so at the urgent request of a colleague .

		Imme - diately thereafter ,
Benton	PERSON	began a campaign to secure his own return to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	as
Atchison	ORGANIZATION	's successor .

		As a platform , he de - clared for a
Central Pacific Railway	ORGANIZATION	and the organization of
Nebraska	LOCATION	as a free territory , and appealed to Western land-thirst by asserting that
Nebraska	LOCATION	was immediately to be opened to set - tlement .

		Atchison retorted by an appeal to the pro-slavery sentiment of
Missouri	LOCATION	, declaring that he would not vote for the organization of
Nebraska	LOCATION	as free territory .

		Meanwhile the Wyandott Indians organized the Provisional Government of
Nebraska	LOCATION	, and mass-meetings in
Missouri	LOCATION	and
Iowa	LOCATION	memorialized
Congress	ORGANIZATION	for the organization of the territory .

		This was the situation when the first session of the thirty - third
Congress	ORGANIZATION	met .

		Professor Ray has done good service in show - ing that the
Nebraska	LOCATION	issue was forced upon
Douglas	PERSON	by frontier conditions , and that the issue between a free and a slave territory , between affirming and repudiating the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise , had already been made in Mis - souri .

		He has also shown that
Douglas	PERSON	's prior interest in the organization of
Nebraska	LOCATION	was less than has been supposed , and he has collected newspaper comments that indicate that
Atchi	PERSON	- son 's connection with the Kansas-Nebraska bill was greater than has been supposed .

		Further than this we are unable to follow him .

		We can - not think that
Atchison	PERSON	was in any real sense the author of the repeal of the
Missouri	LOCATION	Com - promise .

		The issue of organizing
Nebraska	LOCATION	was made in
Missouri	LOCATION	by
Benton	LOCATION	.

		The bill for its organization was introduced in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	by
Dodge of Iowa	ORGANIZATION	, and was referred to
Douglas	PERSON	's committee .

		Atchison very probably urged
Douglas	PERSON	to repeal the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise .

		The two are represented by one newspaper to have been personal friends .

		It is not at all probable that
Atchison	PERSON	could have displaced
Douglas	PERSON	as chairman of the
Committee on Territories	ORGANIZATION	, even had he desired to .

		His influ -
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 121 ence in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	was slight compared with
Douglas	PERSON	's , and his position as President pro tempore was due solely to his seniority of ser - vice .

		The force of the claim that he made in his speech at
Atchison	LOCATION	is broken by the very slight claim that he made in his earlier letter of
June 5 , 1854	DATE	, and in his later speech at
Platte City	LOCATION	in
February of 1856	DATE	.


January 4 , 1854	DATE	,
Douglas	PERSON	introduced his celebrated report and bill .

		It must be remembered that he did not originally intend directly to repeal the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise , but to leave the status of the pro- posed territory as to slavery in abeyance or in effect to the decision of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor Ray brings out the interesting fact that various newspapers had already urged that the Compromise of
1850	DATE	repealed that of
1820	DATE	.


January 16	DATE	,
Dixon	PERSON	of
Kentucky	LOCATION	forced
Douglas	PERSON	's hand by moving a direct repeal .

		Professor Ray thinks
Atchison	PERSON	may have inspired
Dixon	PERSON	's motion ; but this is pure conjecture , and there is every reason to think that
Dixon	PERSON	acted inde - pendently of outside influence .

		Atchison was associated in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	with the radical Southerners ,
Mason	PERSON	,
Hunter	PERSON	, and
Butler	PERSON	, who accepted
Calhoun	PERSON	's doctrine that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	could neither prohibit slavery in the territories nor allow their inhabitants to do so .


Douglas	PERSON	's bill , both as originally introduced and as subse - quently recast in the Democratic caucus , em - bodied the doctrine of Popular Sovereignty , and this was as much opposed to the
Calhoun	PERSON	theory as it was to the
Missouri	LOCATION	restriction .

		Atchison can not therefore be regarded as the author of a measure which was fundamentally opposed to his own theories , however much his influence may have contributed to bring it about .

		Pro- fessor Ray finds confirmation of his theory of
Atchison	PERSON	's authorship in a partisan speech made by
Francis P. Blair	PERSON	, Jr. .

		in
Missouri	LOCATION	, in
1854	DATE	, and in
Parker	PERSON	's '' Secret History * ' written in
1880	DATE	.

		But there is no probability that
Blair	PERSON	could have had inside information in regard to the history of the repeal , and
Parker	PERSON	's article , written thirty-six years after the event , when the author was seventy-six years of age , gives no clue to the source of his information .

		Moreover , the '' History is so inaccurate upon other points as to preclude its being regarded as a serious authority upon this one .

		The question as to what was
Douglas	PERSON	's motive remains very much the same as before .

		It is necessarily a matter of pure conjecture , since there is no particle of evidence bearing upon it .

		His primary purpose probably was to secure the success of the bill , since the fate of the
Richardson	PERSON	bill had shown that
Nebraska	LOCATION	could not be organized under the
Missouri	LOCATION	restriction .

		His most probable secondary pur - pose seems to have been to compromise opposing opinions in his own party with respect to slavery in the territories .

		There is a significant sentence in
Douglas	PERSON	's private letter of
November 11 , 1853	DATE	, to
Walker	PERSON	and Lamphier : u The party is in distracted condition , and it requires all our wisdom , prudence , and energy to consolidate its power and perpetuate its principles . ''

		The Whig party had been destroyed by the
Compro	PERSON	- mise of
1850	DATE	, and similar destruction threatened the Democratic party .

		Northern Democrats insisted upon the power of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to prohibit slavery in the territories , and Southern Demo - crats denied it .

		Douglas undertook to com - promise the opposing opinions by referring the question to the inhabitants of the terri - tories , as suggested in
Cass	LOCATION	's
Nicholson	PERSON	letter .

		Northern Democrats accepted the compromise upon the theory that the inhabitants could act during the territorial period , and Southern Democrats upon the theory that they could not act until the territory was admitted as a
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		By this expedient ,
Douglas	PERSON	actually postponed the disruption of the Democratic party until
1860	DATE	; but the political necessity of sustaining the Dred
Scott	PERSON	decision involved him in a logical absurdity from which there was no escape .

		The preservation of the party might ultimately redound to
Douglas	PERSON	's advantage ; but Professor
Johnson	PERSON	has shown that , so far as his presiden - tial aspirations were concerned , he was under no necessity of currying favor with the South .

		Professor Ray devotes an appendix to the contention that the organization of
Nebraska	LOCATION	was not bound up with the question of the route for a
Pacific Railway	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this opinion we can - not agree with him .

		The question involved too many interests to make it possible to interpret the vote from the standpoint of any one of them .

		The
Senate	ORGANIZATION	vote on the
Richardson	PERSON	bill , however , indicates that the two measures were closely con - nected ; and the
House	ORGANIZATION	vote is not unfavorable to the same view .

		In
New York	LOCATION	, opinion was divided .

		The
Erie	ORGANIZATION	canal interest favored a northern route for the
Pacific Railway	LOCATION	, and prob - ably voted for the organization of
Nebraska	LOCATION	.


New York City	LOCATION	capital was invested in
Panama	LOCATION	steamship lines , and was promoting the construc - tion of the
Panama	LOCATION	railway ; and on that account it was opposed to any trans-continental railroad , and to the organization of
Nebraska	LOCATION	.

		New Orleans capitalists were promoting the
Tehuan	PERSON	- tepec Railway , which they expected would give 122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, their city the advantages which are now antici - pated from the construction of the
Panama Canal	ORGANIZATION	.

		They were also opposed to any trans-continental line .

		Apart from the Tehuantepec project , the interest of
Louisiana	LOCATION	in the proposed
Southern Pacific Railroad	ORGANIZATION	was slight , since it was to pass to the northward and terminate at
Charleston	LOCATION	, S. C .

		The two
Louisiana	LOCATION	votes in the
House	ORGANIZATION	for the
Richardson	PERSON	bill may have been intended as a diversion from the
Southern Pacific Railroad	ORGANIZATION	, which at the time seemed to be almost upon the point of construction .

		Only one Texan vote was cast in the
House	ORGANIZATION	against the
Richardson	PERSON	bill ; but
Texas	LOCATION	had but one other representative at the time , and he may have been absent or from some other cause prevented from voting .

		The remarks of
Dodge	ORGANIZATION	upon the
Douglas	PERSON	bill indicate that the division of
Nebraska	LOCATION	into two territories was made partly as a result of the desire of the
Iowa	LOCATION	delegation that the
Pacific Railroad	LOCATION	should pass through their State .

		Douglas was estopped , both before and after the passage of his bill , from bringing out the connection between the organization of
Nebraska	LOCATION	and the northern route for the
Pacific Railroad	ORGANIZATION	.

		If he emphasized the importance of the northern , or rather the cen - tral , route , he antagonized his friends in the South .

		If he favored a
Chicago	LOCATION	terminal , he sacrificed the interests of his constituents in
Southern Illinois	LOCATION	and laid himself open to the charge of favoring his own private interests .

		If he favored a
St. Louis	LOCATION	terminal he sacrificed his own interests and those of his
Northern Illinois	ORGANIZATION	constituents .

		The dual nature of
Douglas	PERSON	's
Illinois	LOCATION	constituency was his greatest difficulty .

		It was one reason for his attempt to find middle ground on the subject of slavery , and for his silence on the subject of the
Pacific Railroad	ORGANIZATION	.

		That he was alive to the importance of the latter is indicated by his writing
Walker	PERSON	and
Lamphier	PERSON	before the Session began : '' The Pacific Rail - road will also be a disturbing element . ''

		Professor Ray anticipates criticism on ac - count of the length of the quotations in his text ; but we are thankful for all of them , as they throw new light upon various phases of the
Nebraska	LOCATION	struggle , particularly upon the conference with
President Pierce	ORGANIZATION	.

		We think Professor Ray attaches too great importance to the recollections of
W. C. Price	ORGANIZATION	.

		Men who have outlived their influence habitually exaggerate their earlier exploits .


James Madison Cutts	PERSON	, described as
Douglas	PERSON	's ''
Boswell	PERSON	, '' was his father-in-law instead of his son-in-law .

		Pro- fessor Ray might have remarked that although
Benton	PERSON	was defeated , his campaign for free territory saved
Missouri	LOCATION	to the
Union	LOCATION	during the Civil War .

		We dislike to criticize the typography of the book , but we can not refrain from mentioning that the printing of notes at the foot of the final pages of the chapters , apart from the text and even without any related text , gives the volume a somewhat unsatisfactory appearance .

		Yet his '' Great Actors of the

		Fully half of the volume treats of the actors and actresses of the latter country , two-thirds of the remainder being allotted to
France	LOCATION	, and one-third to
England	LOCATION	.

		Were Dr.
Mantzius	PERSON	a German , this dispro - portion might be more comprehensible .

		Being a
Dane	PERSON	, he has possibly been influenced unduly by his country 's neighbors .

		An Anglo-Saxon is likely , however , to challenge the justice of devot - ing fifty-three pages to
Schroder	ORGANIZATION	and fifty-five to
Konrad Ekhof	PERSON	, while dismissing
David Garrick	PERSON	with a paltry thirty-six .

		Lekain , too , is but casually mentioned ; and
Talma	PERSON	, although he made his debut in
1787	DATE	and won renown in
1789	DATE	, is included among the great actors of the eighteenth century only by a remote mention .

		If , in his allotment of space , Dr.
Mantzius	PERSON	appears biassed , his failure to recognize the Italian theatrical art of the eighteenth century is negligent , to say the least .

		True , the title of this volume is '' Great Actors of the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	'' -- and in
Italy	LOCATION	, the theatrical art of that period is distinguished by dramaturgy rather than histrionism .

		THE DIAL 123 first true note of nationalism heard in the
Peninsula	LOCATION	since
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's time .

		The scenario being then subordinated to the play , the actor to the dramatist -- Dr.
Mantzius	PERSON	, himself an actor , resents perhaps this dethronement of his craft ; yet , granting there were no Italian actors in the eighteenth century worthy to be dubbed great , it is nevertheless apparent that , until Goldoni sent young Collalto -- trembling at his own transformation into a human being -- unmasked and in plain clothes upon the stage of the S. Angelo Theatre at
Venice	LOCATION	to speak written lines , there had been no actors in
Italy	LOCATION	at all , if the actor be differentiated from the masked buffoon who for centuries had extemporized Italian comedy .

		If
Antonio Sacchi	PERSON	,
Cesare Darbes	PERSON	, and their colleagues , are small when compared with
Garrick	PERSON	and
Schroder	ORGANIZATION	, it is because of the smallness of the Italian tradition requiring the acting of human parts in masks and grotesque clothes ; yet the very commedia dell arte , which is responsible for this stilted tenet , was the mine from which
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, and to a lesser degree
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, drew comic plots .

		In a previous volume Dr.
Mantzius	PERSON	indicates the influence of the unwritten farces upon the comedy of other countries , yet dismisses Goldoni with a sentence .

		In the volume of which we are treating , the creator of the Italian realistic comedy , the man who first sent Italian buffoons upon the stage unmasked to speak written lines , is mentioned only as the author of plays , trans - lations of which were acted in
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		In our author 's defense , it is but just to quote from Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	's Introduction to his voluminous work . ''

		It will be observed , '' says the English critic , '' that Dr.
Mantzius	PERSON	does not profess to write a history of the Drama , but of ' Theatrical Art . '

		In other words , he studies literary developments only in so far as they are affected by and , in their own turn , react upon the actual processes of representation . ''

		The Goldoni period in
Italy	LOCATION	is assuredly one in which a literary development affects the '' actual process of representation . ''

		Dr.
Mant	PERSON	- zius 's failure to give it consideration is , to stig - matize it mildly , an oversight .

		Moreover , as a history of French and English acting in the eighteenth century , his volume is somewhat deficient .

		As an account of the German actors of the period -- their lives and their art -- it is , however , a valuable addition to dramatic litera - ture ; yet
Lessing	PERSON	and
Goethe	PERSON	and
Schiller	PERSON	are slighted equally with Goldoni .

		Among dramatists ,
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, who played but an insignificant part in the theatrical history of his own country , alone is treated as a literary man whose work had '' a lasting effect upon the actual process of the representation of plays . ''

		In this '' History of Theatrical Art '' during the century of
Schiller	PERSON	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Lessing	PERSON	,
Goldsmith	PERSON	,
Sheridan	PERSON	,
Goldoni	LOCATION	,
Marivaux	ORGANIZATION	, Beau - marchais , and
Alfieri	PERSON	, he is the sole dramatist whom Dr.
Mantzius	PERSON	honors with a chapter .

		Apparently the only reason for giving him this undue prominence lies in the fact that he upheld the rights of actors as he did those of others he believed incapable of upholding their own , or possibly because he was publicly crowned at the Comedie-Francaise . ''

		Voltaire , recois la couronne Que l'on vient de te presenter ; II est beau de la me ` riter
Quand c'est	ORGANIZATION	la
France	LOCATION	qui la donne . ''


France	LOCATION	gave it .

		That is
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's chief reason for meriting his dramatic laurel crown .

		The Frenchman 's critical ability , however , is far keener than that of his Danish chronicler , for it was Voltaire who acclaimed Goldoni as '' Painter and son of nature -- the Italian Moliere ! ''

		If the historical acumen of Dr.
Mantzius	PERSON	is occasionally dimmed and his sense of proportion dwarfed by Germanic influence , he is never - theless a painstaking student who has made the history of his craft his life-work .

		In being a gatherer of valuable information rather than a historian lies his chief merit , there being a lack of order in his presentation of facts , which makes him at times difficult to follow .

		Still , his work is almost monumental ; indeed , it should find a place in the dramatic alcove of every library , for in no other single work has so much information concerning the stage been brought within reach of the student and thoroughly in - dexed .

		It is , however , a chronicle of actors and acting , rather than a history of theatrical art -- a work in which one may trace the story of the various schools of acting , the development of the various forms of theatres , by reading assidu - ously between the lines .

		One seeking a knowl - edge of the history of the stage from both a dramatic and histrionic point of view will find Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	's single volume on '' The Development of the Drama '' a clearer and safer guide than the five volumes from Dr.
Mantzius	PERSON	's pen which have appeared in English translation .

		Of the latter , '' Great Actors of the Eight - eenth Century '' is perhaps the most entertain - ing , but the least analytical .

''

		The Introduction , dealing with professional dramatic art in

		More of the `` Eternal Feminine . ''

		* If the reader of Mr.
Reich	PERSON	's book on '' Women through the Ages '' is already famil - iar with the author 's previous work in socio - logical and anthropological research , he will be prepared to find in this study of womanhood much valuable data and some philosophical acumen , together with scattered passages so extreme and iconoclastic , and representing views so distorted by prejudice , that they will arouse resentment and often justify ridicule .

		In his preface Mr.
Reich	PERSON	disclaims any preten - sions to writing a history of Woman , but rather he has given '' a number of more or less inter - esting notes on the condition and influence of women in a few centres of Western civilization . ''

		The query comes to us , Why should there be a separate history of Woman , since , as Mr.
Reich	PERSON	asserts , she represents more than half of human - ity , and her influence must be included in all general histories of civilization ?

		The two volumes consist , in large part , of collated notes upon the customs , dress , marital status and other conditions of women , from early Egyptian and Assyrian history down to the present aspects of social life in European countries and in
America	LOCATION	.

		The method in the earlier chapters is encyclopaedic , drawing from such standard sources as
Erman	PERSON	,
Rawlinson	PERSON	,
Wilkinson	PERSON	, and
Maspero	PERSON	's '' Dawn of Civiliza - tion . ''

		The pictorial element is more marked in the treatment of Greek and Roman women .

		The author con - trasts ^ the noble women of early
Greece	LOCATION	, in the days of small kingdoms , with their successors under Imperialism .

		Here he gives the first note of challenge , which is sounded with loud assurance in the last chapters of the second volume : `` Just as Imperialism in modern times has , in its excessive form , produced the domi - nating , almost masculine , women of
America	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, and in its milder manifestation the retiring and somewhat lifeless English woman , so in .

		ancient
Greece	LOCATION	this same force occasioned the unrestricted freedom and undisputed ascend - ancy of the Spartans as opposed to the rigid exclusiveness and dependent inferiority of the Athenian woman . ''

		The book relates many stories , both authentic and apocryphal , of Roman matrons .

		A few heroines --
Cornelia	PERSON	,
Aurelia	PERSON	, and others -- are chosen for types of women whose learning was tempered by devotion to their family and country , in contrast with the later degenerates with a compulsive desire for excitement and notoriety .

		The essay on Roman life is admir - able in condensation and effectiveness .

		After two or three dull chapters on mediaeval women in palaces , harems , and convents , there fol - lows a fine pen-portrait of

Andrew Lang	PERSON	in his `` Maid of
France	LOCATION	'' -- of the patriotic zeal , the spirituality and magnetic courage , .

		which impelled this mystic maiden to become the deliverer of
France	LOCATION	in a crucial period .

		The tendency toward idealism in the study of
Joan of Arc	ORGANIZATION	is in contrast with the stern , unsparing censure of Isabella of
Spain	LOCATION	, '' a fanatical agent of priest and monk . ''

		Mr.
Reich	PERSON	is not the first historian to shatter the pretty picture of Isabella pledging her jewels to
Columbus	LOCATION	, and to substitute the vision of her cruelty to Jews and Moslems .

		Women of
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	are con - sidered chronologically from the periods of the Tudors and Stuarts to the French Revolution and the Empire . ''

		A queen often typifies the women of her country and time '' is an axiomatic statement which precedes special emphasis upon the traits and influence of

Mary Stuart	PERSON	, Queen
Anne	PERSON	, and
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	.

		There are no new interpretations of character , but the phrasing is sometimes terse and force - ful , as thus : ''
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	was wilful , capricious , and captivating , with enough unrea - sonableness to ruin any monarchy . ''

		With a striking sentence of amusing simile , Mr.
Reich	PERSON	1909 . -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 125 diverts attention from the amorous , intriguing women of the French court , and the brilliant hostesses of the salons : ** To turn to the English woman of the eighteenth century , after contemplating her French sister of the same period , is like eating a penny bun after enjoy - ing a delicate eclair . ''

		The repressive influ - ences of
England	LOCATION	made the women insular and dull , with a few exceptions like the Duchess of
Marlborough	LOCATION	,
Lady Montagu	LOCATION	, and
Fanny Burney	PERSON	. ''

		Literary Women of the Nineteenth Cen - tury '' are treated briefly , and very inadequately , in a single chapter .


Jane Austen	PERSON	and the Brontes meet with approbation ; but it is a cause of amazement to the author that
George Eliot	PERSON	'' should have acquired such a reputation in
England	LOCATION	, one so infinitely surpassing that of her infinitely more gifted husband ... She developed the German dry-as-dust system in relation to English fiction ; she provided a tin - selly , besmudged perversion which she induced the fiction-reading public credulously to regard as a mediaeval Florentine romance . ''

		To Mr.
Lewes	PERSON	should be accredited all the inspiration of
George Eliot	PERSON	's best work , says Mr.
Reich	PERSON	; * l the feeble didacticism and verbosity are her own . ''

		George Sand is treated yet more cava - lierly , as '' an unworthy vampire , who sucked the vitality out of at least two great men --
Alfred de Musset	PERSON	and
Frederick Chopin	PERSON	. ''

		The limits of his space , the breadth of his theme , and his personal sympathies have visibly restricted and hampered Mr.
Reich	PERSON	.

		There is no effort to consider , except incidentally , the many women of later centuries who have won honor in art , music , science , or on the stage .

		However difficult it must have been for him to '' pour gallons into a pint measure , '' he has placed few restrictions on his space -- or on his animus -- in the last two chapters of the work , '' Feminism of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	'' and • • Women in
America	LOCATION	, '' in which he pronounces anathemas against the '' bold , assertive , ' defem - inized ' woman of modern life , who is clamor - ing and scheming for ' emancipation . ' ''

		Quite apart from the question of suffrage , there is gen - eral recognition of the fact that under present political conditions women can forward many reform movements of much value to society .

		Mr.
Reich	PERSON	, however , holds very positive views on the usefulness -- or , rather , the uselessness -- of such efforts toward moral betterment . ''

		It is in the West , '' he says , M that the only move - ment comes , a movement -- at its mistaken best -- which makes a crusade against prostitu - tion , alcoholism , and war ; all of which must exist as hideous necessities , and which , if they could be swept away , would in their disappear - ance utterly upset the balance of civilization . ''

		There are many besides women who will dissent emphatically from this unjust disparagement .

		In his book '' Success among Nations , '' pub - lished five years ago , Mr.
Reich	PERSON	devoted his final chapter to expressing his convictions regarding the inferiorities of
America	LOCATION	in general , and especially of the '' hyper-educated '' dashing American woman .

		For five unbroken years , he tells us , he lived among us ; but he surely was unable to arrive at broad and just interpretations of our social conditions .

		In this later work he says that he has `` been treated to wall-shaking criticism on account of ignorance and wilful mis - representation , '' but he insists upon expanding and emphasizing many of his earlier strictures .

		American women seem to him distinct from the genus as found elsewhere , as '' unwomaned , '' '' Amazonian , '' without spontaneity or elemental talent , and with '' sensational '' and unreasoned energy .

		In previous essays , as well as in the present book , he has discovered an antagonism , k ' a latent contempt , '' heaped by American women upon the men , who are represented as '' male Cinderellas '' and '' mere lamplighters in the orchestra of life in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		With a vehement '' Horribile dictu ! ''

		the author asserts that the climax of vices in the American woman is her prevailing '' humour - ousness '' at the expense of her '' enamel and morning-dew . ''

		This '' humorousness '' will find free scope for its exercise in reading critically Mr.
Reich	PERSON	's chapters on American women of to-day .

		Many of the passages are so perverse that they can not be taken seriously .

		Mr.
Reich	PERSON	has seen and faithfully portrayed certain kinds of women in American life , of both higher and lower social strata ; but he has no warrant for generalizing their deplorable qualities as na - tional traits .

		We will quote a paragraph from what he has to say on this subject . ''

		I am quite aware of the fact that hundreds of thou - sands of American women are hard-worked house - keepers and mothers and wives .

		All these hundreds of thousands of American women , de facto devoted to nothing but to the cares of their homes , do not in the least invalidate my thesis .

		While the mere external or material fact of their hard work inside their homes is undeniable , yet they too are potentially as hostile and indifferent to their homes , husbands , and maternity , as are such of the American women whom here I take to be the type of American womanhood .

		I mean this : whenever a woman of the States does devote her prin - cipal attention and labour to her home , she does so be - cause , owing to the insufficient income of her husband , 126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, she is absolutely compelled to do so .

		But let that hard - working and apparently home-loving American woman learn of a substantial increase in her husband 's income , and all her potentialities will at once step out into con - crete reality , and she will become , from one day to another , nothing but a pleasure-ridden and sensation - ridden frequenter of all bazaars , lectures , operas , exhi - bitions , ' crazes , ' and an eager purchaser of the ' latest ' costumes , jewellery , books , and furniture .

		The French bourgeoise will , in nineteen out of twenty cases of such a sudden improvement in her husband 's income , alter not an iota in the manner or method of her life ; in her the potentialities of the • shining stunner ' and sensa - tionalist are very feeble indeed .

		In every woman in
America	LOCATION	they are stronger than any other propensity .

		This is why I am disinclined to admit any real exceptions with regard to the type of womanhood in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		-LRB- Vol .

		II. , p. 260 . -RRB-

		The value of Mr.
Reich	PERSON	's work is marred by passages like this , which reveal narrowness of view and prejudice ; otherwise it would be an authoritative contribution to sociology .

		No distinct chapter is given to German women , yet the author by incidental references shows favor - itism toward them , as typifying his model of womanhood .

		In comparing the prediction of the Goncourts ' Journal , regarding the inspira - tion of American women , with their failures , he says : '' The same Goncourts , in the same part of their invaluable Journal , speak of the Alle - mande or the German woman as one who can and does rouse in man the more ideal senti - ments .

		Well , it is
Germany	LOCATION	and not
America	LOCATION	that has , in the last thirty years , made the most remarkable conquests . ' '

		The two volumes are tastefully produced , and illustrated by thirty-six well-selected reproduc - tions of paintings , sculptures , and photography .

		The five following chapters , `` Naval Preparation , '' `` The Opening of Hostilities , '' '' Events of

		The book presents a brief statement of a few chief events , with more extended discussion of their causes and significance .

		The introductory chapter , entitled '' Perspective , '' is a rapid review of the work of preceding historians who dealt with the same events , from
Madame de Stael	ORGANIZATION	to the microscopic specialists of the twen - tieth century ; with the conclusion that the earlier writers distorted the facts , while our contemporaries are inclined `` to establish beyond question the pre - cise shade of the colour of

		Then fol - lows a simple , readable , and thoughtfully discussed narrative , that is not so radically different from other succinct histories of the period as the critical preface might lead one to expect .

		The volume ends with a chapter headed '' Art and Literature , '' containing
Fabre d'Eglantine	PERSON	's explanation of the months of the Revolutionary Calendar , with their correspond - ence to the months as we have them ; as well as several poems of the period , principally from the pen of Andre '' Ohenier .

		There is no effort made to reconstruct theology , but rather to enrich and de - velope human life .

		The purpose at work here goes deep : to reach the heart and arouse an earnest desire for the spiritual life .

Winter	DATE	season . -RRB-

		BOOKS OF T HE CO MING YEAH .

		Perhaps the most notable characteristic of our full classified list of publishers ' announce - ments of new books , published elsewhere in this issue , is afforded by the great variety and interest of the biographical category .

		A good biography of an important person is the most satisfactory kind of a book .

		It may have all the interest of the best type of fiction , with the added interest that comes from our conscious - ness that it is the portrayal of a real rather than of an imagined life .

		Readers of the next few months may revel in this form of literary enjoyment , since all tastes seem to have been provided for .

		From
Boccaccio	PERSON	to
G. B. Shaw	PERSON	, from
Joan	PERSON	of Arc to
John Bigelow	PERSON	, the chrono - logical gamut is run ; the frivolous are remem - bered with gossippy memoirs , the sober with lives of statesmen and actors and men of af - fairs and men of letters .

		One could not go far astray in searching among these forthcoming biographies for '' the book of the year , '' and in fixing upon the '' Retrospections of an Active Life , '' by Mr.
John Bigelow	PERSON	.

		This wonderful old man , now completing his ninety-second year , with an intellect whose keenness is no whit dulled by age , has told his life-story , with reflections upon a historical period quorum pars magna fv it .

		in three volumes that can not fail to be of ab - sorbing interest to all American readers .

		It does not seem likely that any other publication of the year can have quite so strong a claim upon our attention .

		For a fair second , we may men - tion Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	's '' Life and Art of
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	, '' which we trust may be far from the last work of its veteran author , now freed from the bondage of ignoble journalism .

		Long may he continue to praise whatever is of good report in the drama , and to castigate the stage corrupters of public morals !

		Among biographies of famous Englishmen we are to expect one of
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	written by himself , of Sheridan by Mr.
Walter Sichel	PERSON	, of Lecky by his widow , of
Richard Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
Edward Thomas	PERSON	, and of Lord Kelvin by Mr.
Silvanus P. Thompson	PERSON	.

		Among Americans , there will be a
Grover Cleveland	LOCATION	by Mr.
George F. Parker	PERSON	, a
Stephen A. Douglas	PERSON	by Mr.
Clark E. Carr	PERSON	, and a
J. D. Whitney	PERSON	by Mr.
Edwin T. Brewster	PERSON	.

		A life of
Bach	ORGANIZATION	by Sir
Hubert Parry	PERSON	, and one 170 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, of Verlaine by
M. E. Lepelletier	PERSON	, may be given as a continental makeweight to these English and American examples .

		Among works of history , the following seem to us particularly alluring : '' The Birth of
Modern Italy	LOCATION	, '' a volume of papers by the late
Jessie White Mario	PERSON	; ''
Garibaldi	PERSON	and the Thousand , '' by Mr.
George M. Trevelyan	PERSON	; '' Men and Manners of Old
Florence	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
Guido Biagi	PERSON	; '' The Great French Revolution , '' by Prince
Peter Kropotkin	PERSON	; '' Society and Politics in Ancient
Rome	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
Frank F. Abbott	PERSON	; and '' The Foundations of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- which will probably turn out to be political and social philosophy rather than history -RRB- , by Mr.
Houston Stewart Cham	PERSON	- berlain , that distinguished English scholar who writes his books in German , to be afterwards translated into his own tongue .

		In the field of literature , the publication of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's Journals seems to be the most im - portant single announcement .

		They are to be edited by Messrs.
Edward W. Emerson	PERSON	and
Waldo Emerson Forbes	PERSON	, and will be precious documents indeed .

		Volumes of essays that will find eager readers are '' The American of the Future , '' by Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	; ''
American Prose Masters	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
William C. Brownell	PERSON	; '' The Mystery of Education , and Other Academic Performances , '' by Professor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	; '' The Spirit of
America	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	; '' Essays on Modern Novelists , '' by Professor
William L. Phelps	PERSON	; `` Masters of the English Novel , '' by Professor
Richard Burton	PERSON	; and collections of papers by
Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Richard Watson Gilder	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two important works of cognate interest are Professor
Gildersleeve	PERSON	's '' Hellas and
Hesperia	LOCATION	, '' being lectures on the vitality of Greek studies in
America	LOCATION	, and Pro- fessor
Mahaffy	PERSON	's '' What Have the Greeks Done for Civilization ? ''

		being a
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	lecture course of
last winter	DATE	.

		The poet usually avoids the puff preliminary , and it is our experience every year that the most vital poetry comes almost unheralded .

		The announcements at hand , however , include volumes by Mr.
Percy Mackaye	PERSON	, Dr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	, Mr.
Charles E. Russell	PERSON	, Mr.
Richard Le Gallienne	PERSON	, Professor
Richard Burton	PERSON	, Mr.
Madison Cawein	PERSON	,
Miss Louise Imogen Guiney	PERSON	,
Miss Josephine Preston Peabody	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Florence Earle Coates	PERSON	.

		We are glad to note that '' Dido , Queen of
Carthage	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	, is promised for early publi - cation , and that the poems of Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	are to be brought into a newly col - lected edition .

		In the wilderness of promised fiction there is one cheerful resting-place provided by Mr. De Morgans new story , characteristically entitled '' It Never Can Happen Again . ''

		We are not likely to have another novel '' equally as good , '' although we make the suggestion with a certain hesitation , being fresh from the late
summer	DATE	surprise of '' The Old Wives ' Tale , '' and re - calling two or three other recent delightful examples of the unexpected .

		We may also entertain `` great expectations '' of such books as ''

		THE DIAL 171 THE BOOKS FR OM Q UEER STREET .

		There is an indefinable something about the books from Queer Street that always betrays them .

		Just as the mentally unbalanced reveal their unsteadiness of equilibrium by their gait , their gestures , a turn of the head , a glance of the eye , so the writings of the eccentric , the obsessed , the more or less insane , have a tone or a style or an atmosphere that unfail - ingly distinguishes them from the books from
Ortho	ORGANIZATION	- dox Avenue .

		The favorite topics of our eccentric authors , our writers born with a screw loose somewhere in the brain 's mechanism , are the famous insoluble prob - lems of all ages , such as the squaring of the circle , the doubling of the cube , the trisecting of an angle , the invention of perpetual motion , the finding of the philosopher 's stone , and so on ; while also the upset - ting of accepted theories , like the law of gravitation or the sphericity of the globe , is undertaken again and again with a zeal truly religious .

		A first cousin to the passion for humbling Newton to the dust is the frantic eagerness to strip Shakespeare of his honors .

		In recent years still another class of peculiar books has made its appearance -- the products , or by-products , of the H new psychology , '' the works of writers indulging in somewhat too beatific visions of the unlimited powers and possibilities of the human mind .

		To touch briefly on the last class first , its authors affect a vagueness of expression , a floridity of style , and a free use of neologisms , that rarely fail to impress and overawe the reader of unscholarly habit and inexact thinking .

		In a recent work that pro- fesses to be `` a relation of the observations and experiences of a philosopher and poet in the spirit world , '' communicated by thought-vibrations to an earthly scribe , there is much said about harmonial relations with the infinite , spiritual radiations , aural surroundings , incarnate and excarnate souls , vice - gerents of the Great Oversold , and other like sub - limities .

		Amid much that is excellent and suggestive in its way , a few characteristic sentences , a little baffling to the plain reader , may be quoted as rhetor - ical examples .

		u The polarization of all spiritual aspirations in consciousness precedes illumination and the unfolding of the theocracy . '' ''

		Why should I not sit at the feet of wisdom , and learn from the vice-gerents of the Great Oversold , whose radiations permeate every part of an infinite universe , in whose effluences these , my desired teachers , had become partakers of that whereof I had not attained ? ''

		The writer more than once struggles unsuccessfully with the difficulties of u attain '' and '' obtain , '' and what preposition , if any .

		to use with each ; he attains of and obtains to , which is sad to the grammarian .

		He also splits his infinitives with a ruthlessness that would sorely disturb the serenity of a purist , and ordinary words are shouldered out of the way to give place to terms not yet vulgarized by any maker of dictionaries .

		Somewhat as the ancient Greeks dis - guised the terrors of the furies and the horrors of the night under propitiatory euphemisms , this writer elaborates a graceful periphrasis when referring to death .

		A friend of his , instead of dying as men have commonly been in the habit of doing , '' passed out from his always rather delicate frame , and , after a short time in a semi-conscious condition , awoke to the reality of being . ''

		A distinguishing mark of the class of literature to which the above-cited work belongs is its dogmatic tone , its '' cocksureness , '' its sublime disregard of all opposing evidence or proof . ''

		To doubt would be disloyalty , to falter would be sin , '' is the writer 's motto .

		From an article on '' True Occultism , '' pub - lished in a reputable monthly that has an honored place in ' *
Poole	PERSON	's Index , '' we take a passage that fairly stuns one with stiffly dogmatic affirmations . ''

		Occult philosophy teaches , first of all , that man must be .

		The doing is of secondary import .

		Only as he is , can he rightly do .

		The hidden wisdom of the Sphinx and
Isis	ORGANIZATION	is the same .

		Is-is -LRB-
Isis	ORGANIZATION	'' , Be-Be , 1 1 am that I am , ' sums up the secret of all life ; and when one knows this law , the powers long hidden in his being will arise and crown him king . ''

		Note the splendid audacity with which the writer cuts the etymological knot of the real meaning and derivation of the Egyptian goddess 's name !

		The famous deriva - tion of '' King Jeremiah '' from u pickled cucumber '' is not more admirable .

		A little dip into a well-known book by a well - known apostle of new or newest thought brings up the following : '' Just behind the seen and material human organism there is a sensuous mind , the most outward and fleshly of the immaterial part , which pertains especially to the body and acts directly upon it .

		Next within is the intellectual zone , and still deeper , in the innermost , is the spiritual ego , the divine image . ''

		This recalls
Swedenborg	PERSON	's confident assertion that '' The human mind is distinguished into three regions : the highest , which is also the inmost , is called celestial , the middle spiritual , and the lowest natural '' and makes us wish that we too were privileged to know and to declare , without need of evidence or argument , some of these sublime and awful truths .

		A favorite illusion of the producers of eccentric literature is that all the colleges and universities and learned bodies the world over are the victims , the voluntary victims , of error , and are banded together to suppress the truth and to crush all who would be its proclaimers .

		A writer in the magazine already cited , moved to utterance by a sense of the wrongs of the laboring classes , and a conviction that he has discovered the remedy , thus expresses the matter : '' Those who have consumed their days in prayer - ful learning , whose nighdy tapers have waxed dim in the examination of the subtlest problems and the broadest measurements of human society , should they forsooth not be wiser than the unread weak - lings of their generation ?

		... Verily , verily .

		And yet the mob is right , and the scholars are the sci - olists . ''

		The Rev.
Edward Dingle	PERSON	, in concluding his remarkable work entitled '' The
Balance of Physics	ORGANIZATION	, 172 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, the Square of the Circle , and the
Earth	LOCATION	's True Solar and Lunar Distances , '' which appeared in
London	LOCATION	nearly twenty-five years ago , devoutly exclaims : `` To the Lord be all thanksgiving , who has kept my intellect and the directing of its thoughts sound , while seeking to deliver his word from the exulting shouts of his enemies and the seducers of mankind ! ''

		Immensely flattering to one 's self-love is it to imagine oneself the chosen depositary of secrets , whether mathematical or physical or celestial , un - revealed to the rest of mankind ; and if one is only sufficiently determined and sufficiently deaf to reason , there is no reason why there should ever be any rude awakening .

		But faith will falter at times , and then there comes a shrill note of anger , or a blustering attempt to mask one 's fear that , after all , the other side may be in the right .

		These depart - ures from the placidly self-confident tone are quite natural and excusable when the circle-squarer or the flat-earth champion has spent life and substance in unavailing efforts to convert the rest of the world .

		A bulky volume -LRB- whose name and authorship refuse to come forth from the mists of the past -RRB- essaying to prove the absurdity and even iniquity of the wave theory of sound , and vehemently denouncing
Tyndall	PERSON	,
Helmholtz	PERSON	, and other teachers of the hated doctrine , had some vogue in rural communities , and especially among the back-woods ministry , about thirty years ago .

		Again and again were Messrs.
Tyndall	PERSON	,
Helmholtz & Co.	ORGANIZATION	driven into a corner , put into a hole , held up to scathing ridicule , and shown to be the veriest bunglers and blunderers in science .

		Forgetting one 's lessons in elementary accoustics , and accepting the author 's premises and sharing his animus , one could not but find the book delightful reading ; so gratifying is it to be right , in a minority of two , while all the rest of the world is wallowing in a bog of hopeless error and wilful delusion .

		Next to being the author of a prodigiously successful and world-famous book , what could be more glorious than to be the author of a book that is right where all other books have been wrong , and whose sales are suppressed by the united exertions of the con - federated enemies of truth ?

		One of
John Fiske	PERSON	's last and best contributions to magazine literature was an article on '' Some Cranks and their Crotchets , '' in which he pointed out some of the stigmata or witch-marks of crankery as they are found in books .

		His experience as assist - ant librarian in the
Harvard	LOCATION	library had made him acquainted with many works that well illustrate the wide difference between the delicious drollery of the wise man and the earnest nonsense of the fool .

		We laugh with the one writer and at the other .

		In nothing does the crank more quickly and surely betray his obliquity of vision , when he rushes into print , than in his utter failure to see the humorous aspect of things .

		His is the terrible seriousness of the little child that can not smile when it is in earnest .

		If one wishes to make sure that one 's books shall never be classified by the library cataloguer with u insane literature '' -- or , as
Fiske	PERSON	considerately decided to style it out of regard for the feelings of those abnormal authors who are still with us and are in the habit of consulting library catalogues , '' eccen - tric literature '' -- it would seem to be only necessary never to be so tremendously in earnest as to lose the power of laughing at oneself .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		Present-day tendencies to mysticism are discernible in many quarters .

		The recent
Congress of Psychology	ORGANIZATION	at
Geneva	LOCATION	has been considering the psychology of religion and theology , and Professor
Harold Hoeffding	PERSON	of
Copenhagen	LOCATION	declared that the things most important for us to know are unknow - able , essentially mysterious , and that the search for ultimate reality leads inevitably to mysticism .

		One of the most talked-of and most original of modern thinkers , the French philosopher
Bergson	PERSON	, shows de - cided mystical leanings .

		The mysterious and the wonder-compelling are leading motives in the current , drama , as may be seen in recent plays by Messrs.
Barrie	PERSON	,
Hauptmann	PERSON	, and
Maeterlinck	PERSON	-- in ''
Peter Pan	PERSON	, '' `` The Sunken Bell , '' and `` The Blue Bird . ''

		All sorts of more or less fantastic and mystical cults are in vogue , though to name them might be thought invidious .

		This is called a scientific and practical and calmly critical age ; but the more strenuous the efforts of the scientist to lay bare naked reality , to demonstrate exactly what the ultimate particle of matter really is , the more is he baffled and per - plexed and forced to take refuge in the non-material realm .

		To learn that the atom is , after all , probably nothing but a system of pulsations , or a mode of motion , or a centre of mysterious forces , is about as definite as the old answer to the question , What is matter ?

		-- never mind ; or , What is mind ?

		-- no matter .

		The degradation of words , the gradual descent in the scale of dignity and respectability of certain adjectives and nouns and verbs and adverbs , with the constant necessity of finding or coining other terms to fill the vacancies , is a subject of more than philological interest .

		Is it because familiarity breeds contempt , that words are so continually losing caste ?

		or is the unceasing change to which every living language is subject simply one illustration of the Heraclitean doctrine that all things are in a state of flux ?

		The latest section of the Oxford English Dictionary , containing words beginning with S as far as Sauce , embraces an unexpected number of these discredited or shabby-genteel terms ; and , what is worthy of note , these terms are more than likely to denote moral qualities . ''

		Saintly '' and '' sancti - monious '' are now , in common speech , of uncompli - mentary significance .

		By their side are to be placed a long array of adjectives , once denoting none but laudable attributes , but now much the worse for wear .

		Even adjectives indicative of intellectual preeminence easily assume undesirable implications .

		`` Sapient '' and in a lesser degree '' sagacious '' readily lend themselves to the uses of satire .

		After all , our language is much like the Chinese : tone of voice or accent has to show in what one of various possible senses our words are used .

		AN ENTIRELY NEW EDITION OF THE Encyclo - pedia Britannica is announced for next year .

		This eminently national work , as solid and substan - tial and authoritative as the
Bank of England	ORGANIZATION	or the
London	LOCATION	4 ' Times , '' is now almost a century and a half old , and its latest reissue took place twenty or more years ago , so that very naturally it fails to meet the demand for up-to-date information on such subjects as wireless telegraphy , radioactivity , aeronautics , pragmatism , psychotherapy , and various others .

		An encyclopaedia , like a library catalogue , is no sooner issued than it is out of date , its disease of senectitude becoming more and more acute with each passing year ; but though librarians have in a measure mastered the difficulty of the catalogue by adopting the ever-expansible card system , no publisher has yet undertaken to supply the world with encyclo - paedic learning in card-catalogue form , nor is it a form likely to commend itself to the public .

		Must , then , the next-to-the-last edition always be thrown away as so much useless lumber ?

		A report , almost too good to be true , is circulating that in this instance the
Britannica	LOCATION	's publishers will take back the ninth edition in considerable part-payment for the tenth -- though one might suggest that it would be better to accept the purchaser 's affidavit of pro- prietorship in the earlier edition and save the freight thereon , which might go toward diminishing still further the reduced rate at which the new work is offered to owners of the old .

		THE TRAVEL-TALE AS A FAVORITE FORM OF LIT - ERARY hoax furnishes food for reflection .

		Just at present , when the civilized world is absorbed in details of the exploration of the

		The love of fairy tales does not die out with the shedding of the milk-teeth .

		The advantages of a layman 's point of vtew , in literature , in art , and even in matters more severely technical and special , is often unquestion - able .

		Detachment and impartiality are not easily maintained by those in the thick of the fight .

		Mr.
Bernhard Berenson	PERSON	, the well-known art critic , on reading a letter by an American painter harshly criticising Titian and
Tintoretto	PERSON	and the Venetian school in general , is reported to have expressed an emphatic opinion on the impossibility of being at the same time a great artist and a competent critic of art .

		The painter , said he , `` gets so thoroughly in the habit of his own manner and form , his own way of seeing things , that when he looks at the work of other men all he notices is that they do n't paint as he does .

		He is more narrow-minded in his criticism even than a layman who knows nothing about the subject . ''

		In the field of letters ,
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	's famous assault on
Rossetti	PERSON	-LRB- '' The Fleshly School of Poetry '' -RRB- is an instance of narrow and unjust criti - cism of one writer 's work by another .

		And there are many others .

		No man who is himself in the arena , helping to stir up the dust , can command a clear view of his competitors .


Lord Bacon	PERSON	as a writer of verse ought as - suredly to have had no great difficulty in keeping his own identity from getting mixed up with that of a certain author of sundry plays and sonnets that have since acquired fame .

		On the whole , few readers of unbiased minds will find any difficulty in subscribing , with the author of the article , to
Spedding	PERSON	's opinion that there are probably '' not five consecutive lines in either

		For

		A FEROCIOUS VOCABULARY OF PEACEFUL SPORTS has been gradually developed by those enthusiastic attendants at baseball games whose vivid emotions at sight of a three-base hit or a neat double-play or a left-handed catch of a red-hot liner find all ordinary idioms too tame for tolerance .

		No wonder the foreign reader of our newspapers thinks us a most blood - thirsty people in our way of playing the great Amer - ican game , when he finds that a baseball nine is calmly referred to as having devoured its opponents ; a base-runner dies at second , or expires on third ; another is nailed at the plate , or is thrown out in trying to steal second ; and a pitcher may receive so terrible a lacing that one marvels how he can ever muster courage to play again .

		In a compara - tively sober and sedate journal of recent date , we find the baseball section headed thus : ' * More Meat for Tigers -- Find Yankees Toothsome Morsels for
Sunday	DATE	Feast . ''

		The extensive and varied termin - ology of the game is enough to puzzle and daunt the uninitiated , leading him to expect something far more elaborately barbarous than a Spanish bull-fight , and perhaps as terrifying as an old-fashioned execu - tion with preliminary torture and final dismember - ment .

		• • • An American scholar 's study of
Sterne	PERSON	-LRB- we refer to Professor
Wilbur L. Cross	PERSON	's '' Life and Times '' of that author -RRB- is meeting with gratifying success in the country of
Sterne	ORGANIZATION	's birth .

		Some time ago the supply of the book furnished by the Mac - millans for English consumption was reported all sold out , which in the sluggish
summer	DATE	season is convincing proof of the book 's worth as an interest - awakener .

		Being the first important work on its subject since Mr.
Percy Fitzgerald	PERSON	's two-volume biography of
Sterne	PERSON	, published in
1864	DATE	, and being moreover from the pen of an American , it was only natural that the book should excite curiosity ; and it is pleasant to learn that its purchasers do not appear to complain that they have failed to receive their money 's worth .

		In this connection , and as an additional evidence that Americans look upon the great English writers and their literary productions not by any means as alien to themselves , we are glad to receive word that the custodian of the ceme - tery where
Sterne	PERSON	was buried affirms that most of the visitors to his grave are from the
United States	LOCATION	.

		A new definition of culture , to be added to the dozen or more that almost everybody can recall or invent , comes from President
Hadley	PERSON	.

		His defi - nition , or rather his latest definition , makes culture '' the opposite of absorption in the obvious , '' the low - est plane of the obvious being reached in pleasures arising from the gratification of the animal nature . ''

		The obvious , '' he explains , '' is that which gets in our way -- the thing we can not help seeing in its full size .

		The cultivated man or woman is the one who in the various fields of life ... values in proper proportion the things which are unseen , or at best very imperfectly seen , by the less trained vision . ''

		These words of wisdom are timely and reassuring .

		Business is looking up , prosperity is reviving , the autumn will see '' bumper '' crops of various cereals , and without this reminder from President
Hadley	PERSON	we might for a moment have forgotten the tempo - rality of the seen and the eternity of the unseen .

		The life of library books may seem short to one observing how quickly they become shabby , how soon they have to be rebound , and how inevitably the most popular among them require replacing at brief intervals .

		But it must be remembered to what wear and tear a reading community subjects its library books .

		The latest report of the
Galesburg	LOCATION	-LRB- 111 . -RRB-

		Public Library states the size of its collection as 36,930 volumes , and its circulation as 152,277 for the year , besides a reference-room record of 43,127 books consulted .

		These bare statistics are rich in significance to one familiar with library business .

		Nevertheless , pressure should be brought to bear on publishers and printers and book-binders to give more attention to the physical durability of their product .

		The two-mill tax for public libraries is not exactly a princely allowance for that highly important branch of our educational system .

		In the current report of the
Nebraska Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, President
Haller	PERSON	, of the
Omaha Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, pleads for a higher maximum levy , espe - cially for small towns .

		Three years ago , as he points out ,
Iowa	LOCATION	passed a law permitting cities and towns with a population of six thousand or less to levy a tax of three mills on the dollar for public library support .

		Kansas also has taken a similar step .

		It is encouraging to note the interest of
Nebraska	LOCATION	's foreign population in public libraries .

		The Bohemians have clubbed together and bought seven hundred volumes in their language , and have presented the collection to the

end of the century	DATE	.

		Now at length , nine years after the seal of secrecy has been removed , his only surviving child -LRB- his second daughter ,
Charlotte	LOCATION	,
Lady Dorchester	LOCATION	-RRB- publishes a two-volume compilation from the '' Recollections , '' pieced out with extracts from the diary and other papers , giving the work the same title as that chosen by her father for his privately-printed reminiscences .

		The present work is confined wholly to the earlier period of
Lord Broughton	PERSON	's life -- the period of his intimate friendship with
Byron	PERSON	, the records of which furnish the most import - ant portions of the material .

		As
John Cam Hobhouse	PERSON	-LRB- the name by which he was called until his father 's death in
1831	DATE	-RRB- , he is well known to all who are familiar with
Byron	PERSON	liter - ature , especially from his profuse annotations of ''
Childe Harold	PERSON	. ''

		He was
Byron	PERSON	's fellow - collegian and fellow-traveller , the confidant of the poet in his unhappy matrimonial venture , and executor of his last will and testament .

		His acquaintance was , in fact , extensive among all the celebrities of his time -- literary , social , political , diplomatic , military .

		A single para - graph in his diary , describing a ball at the

		way , and when he speaks he has the same retraction of his lips as that worthy baronet .

		His face is of a deadly pale , his jaws overhanging , but not so much as 1 had heard .

		His hair is short , of a dark , dusky brown .

		The lady in the Tuileries told me the soldiers called him notre petit tondu .

		He generally stood with his hands knit behind him or folded before him .

		Three or four times he took snuff out of a plain brown box ; once looked at his watch , which , by the way , had a gold face , and , I think , a brown hair chain , like an English one .

		His teeth seemed regular , but not clean .

		He very seldom spoke , but when he did , smiled in some sort agreeably .

		He looked about him , not knitting but joining his eyebrows .

		He caught my eye , and soon withdrew his gaze , natur - ally enough the first , I having only him to look at , he having some thirty thousand .

		As the front of each regiment passed he put up the first finger of his left hand quickly to his hat to salute , but did not move his head or hat .

		He had an air of sedate impatience ... I did not see
Napoleon	PERSON	equally well at all times , but stood , during the whole review , close to him , gazing at him through hats and a musket or two on tip-toe .

		I positively found my eyes moistened at the sight of the world 's wonder -- the same admiration of great actions which has often made me cry at a trait of Greek or Roman virtue caused this weakness . ''

		He continues to describe the '' gratification and melancholy delight '' with which he viewed '' the man who has played the most extraordinary , gigantic part of any human being in ancient and modern times . ''

		Among the many interesting characters that figure in these pages are Lord and Lady Mel - bourne , the parents of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	's minister , with their vivacious and refractory daughter-in - law , Lady
Caroline Lamb	PERSON	, the alleged original of five heroines of fiction before Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	revived her fame in the character of Lady
Kitty Ashe	PERSON	.

		The tender relations supposed to have existed at one time between Lady
Caroline	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	are of course known to all the world , but the poet 's friend appears not to make this delicate affair a subject for comment in his diary and reminiscences , so far as they are now pub - lished .

		One brief entry , however , records that '' Lady
Caroline Lamb	PERSON	is come to town and is in mischievous activity , '' and another page has the characteristic utterance from that lively lady that truth is '' what one thinks at the moment . ''

March 21 , 1814	DATE	, it ap - pears that

Byron	PERSON	, whom I love more and more every day , not so much from his fame as his fondness -- I think not equivocal , for me -- introduced me , at her desire , to Lady Mel - bourne .

		Whether from habit or not I know not , but 176 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, she trembled when she spoke to me .

		She certainly , as she says of me , does owe me an ill turn for preventing her son from losing a bad wife .

		1 told her a fib to please her about her son being popular in
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		Byron took me home in his carriage , and I sat with him an hour . ''

		A contemporaneous judgment of
Byron	PERSON	's poetry , together with a glimpse of the poet 's own opinion of his work , is afforded in this passage : '' The great success of '
Childe Harold	PERSON	' is due chiefly to
Byron	PERSON	's having dared to give utterance to certain feelings which every one must have encouraged in the melancholy and therefore morbid hours of his existence , and also by the intimate knowledge which he has shown of the turns taken by the passions of women .

		He says himself that his poems are of that sort , which will , like everything of the kind in these days , pass away , and give place to the ancient reading , but that he esteems himself fortunate in getting all that can now be got by such a passing reputation , for which there are so many competitors . ''

		There is an unmistakably human quality in a passing reference to the
Edinburgh Review	ORGANIZATION	's praise of
Byron	PERSON	as a first poet of the day . ''

		Rogers called and said to him , ' How will
Scott	PERSON	like this ?

		and how will
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	like this ? '

		-- all the time thinking of himself .

		Campbell and
Scott	PERSON	mutually hate and abuse each other . ''

		Mr.
Hobhouse	PERSON	was , it seems , an eye-witness of
Byron	PERSON	's famous exploit of swimming the
Helles	PERSON	- pont , of which the poet says in ''
Don Juan	PERSON	'' : '' As once -LRB- a feat on which ourselves we prided -RRB- Leander , Mr.
Ekenhead	PERSON	, and I did . ''

		Here is Mr.
Hobhouse	PERSON	's account of the incident : '' We left -LSB-
Smyrna	LOCATION	-RSB- in the Salsette frigate , Captain Bathurst , and went by
Mitylene	PERSON	-LSB- sic -RSB- to the Dardanelles .

		Byron and Mr.
Ekenhead	PERSON	swam across the
Hellespont	ORGANIZATION	to-day .

		Ekenhead performed this feat in an hour and five minutes , and
Byron	PERSON	in an hour and ten minutes .

		They set off two miles above
Europe Castle	LOCATION	, and came out at least a mile below the Dardanelles . ''

		The chief interest of course attaches to the personal reminiscences of
Byron	LOCATION	, which are so plentiful in these volumes .

		The accounts of
Byron	PERSON	's marriage and subsequent matrimonial difficulties will be turned to by many readers .


Hobhouse	PERSON	was present at the marriage cere - mony , of which he gives many piquant details .

		When he wished the bride many years of hap - piness , she replied , '' If I am not happy it will be my own fault . ''


Hobhouse	PERSON	, himself still a bachelor , felt as if he had '' buried a friend . ''

		In the closing chapter -- a long one -- he gives an extended account of `` The Byron Separation . ''

		Into the details of this much-discussed affair we can not enter .

		To those who care for the kind of matter furnished in abundance by this authoritative and doubtless important chapter , it will prove most interesting , as will also the appended letters having chiefly to do with
Lord Byron	PERSON	's affairs .

		Of somewhat lesser interest are the introduc - tory notes furnished by the English publisher -LRB- Mr.
John Murray	PERSON	, whose ancestor , of the same name and calling , is said to have made a living , and something more , out of
Byron	PERSON	's works -RRB- and
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	.

		These prefaces are short , it is true , and tell us little of importance ; but they gracefully prepare the way for the leading char - acters of the book .

		The portraits , though few , are a welcome addition to the text ; and the printing and general style of the volumes are all that the most exacting could desire .

		Unavoid - ably , there are here , as in all published diaries and reminiscences and letters , many paragraphs and even pages that record matters of small importance ; but they are doubtless more neces - sary for the total correct impression than the reader at first realizes .

		However , if Lady
Dorchester	LOCATION	should feel encouraged to continue her editorial task and make public further records of her father 's long life , the events of his later years might , one would judge , be advan - tageously compressed into far less bulk than they occupy in the writer 's chronicle .

		Consid - erable omissions , it is evident , have been made in compiling these first two volumes .

		A sequel of some sort , long or short , is what they now seem to demand .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		A Naturalist in
Southern Mexico	LOCATION	.

		* Travel books about
Mexico	LOCATION	are almost too numerous .

		The man who makes a three weeks ' trip into the country on a Pullman car often feels impelled to write a book .

		He knew noth - ing of
Mexico	LOCATION	when he started , nothing when he returned ; but somehow or other his impres - sions and criticisms and advice get into print .

		Of such books there are more than plenty .

		But now and then it happens that a traveller really visits some little-known region of
Mexico	LOCATION	, for some specific and interesting purpose ; and from him a book is welcome .


Hans Gadow	PERSON	's `` Through
Southern Mexico	LOCATION	'' is such a book .

		He has travelled widely through the less-known parts of our neighboring republic , and has conducted investigations of so serious and interesting a character that his narrative abounds in new and curious matter .

		Few fields are more interesting to the natur - * Through

1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 177 alist .

		The keen investigator is sure to discover valuable unknown material .

		A single American collector ,
Pringle	PERSON	, has made known a fourth of the recognized flora of
Mexico	LOCATION	;
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	has per - haps doubled the list of known mammals ; out of two hundred and twenty-seven species de - scribed in Meek 's '' Fresh - water Fishes of
Mexico	LOCATION	, '' more than fifty were discovered or named by the author ;
Wheeler	PERSON	and Tower find the entomological field almost untouched .

		No wonder that students are turning to
Mexico	LOCATION	, and that such interesting narratives are appear - ing as
Baker	PERSON	's `` Naturalist in
Mexico	LOCATION	'' and
Beebe	PERSON	's '' Two Bird Lovers in
Mexico	LOCATION	. ''

		But neither
Baker	PERSON	nor
Beebe	PERSON	went far off of beaten tracks ;
Gadow	PERSON	did .

		His specialty was reptiles and batrachians ; his greatest interest was in the species distribution of animals and plants with reference to their environmental conditions ; his field was the tropical forest and mountain coun - try of the States of
Vera Cruz	PERSON	,
Oaxaca	LOCATION	, and
Guerrero	PERSON	.

		His neighbors , when he was at work , were such Indian tribes as the Mixtecs and Zapotecs , and the much less known Mazatecs and Juaves .

		He camped for days on the great mountain Citlaltepetl -LRB-
Orizaba	LOCATION	-RRB- , the highest in
Mexico	LOCATION	, whose towering snow-cap , popularly known as '' El Pico , '' is the finest landmark in the Republic , and his observations there on alti - tudinal distribution are exceptional in interest and value .

		While the work is a narrative of personal travel and experience , the author dis - cusses many curious topics , such as the features of the tropical forest , coral snakes and warning colors , rattlesnakes and the evolution of the rattle , four-eyed fish , etc. .

		The author gives a necessary caution in his preface . ''

		Care has been taken to mention the various creatures at the time and place that we observed them .

		The country swarms with life , and yet days may pass without a glimpse of any - thing worth relating , and the best finds are made unexpectedly . ''

		A striking illustration of this fact is given .

		The author had stopped at Pre - sidio station , in the State of
Vera Cruz	PERSON	, and was out searching . ''

		Whilst rambling along the edge of the forest we became conscious of a noise , at first resembling the mut - ter of a distant sawmill ; but on our reaching the other side of a cluster of trees , this sound grew into a roar , like that of steam escaping from many engines , mingled with the sharp and piercing scream of saws .

		It came from a meadow containing a shallow pool of rainwater .

		In the wet grass , on its stalks , and on the ground , hopped about hundreds of large green tree-frogs ; nearer the pond they were to be seen in thousands , and in the water itself were tens of thousands ... The din was so great that it was with difficulty that we caught the remarks that we shouted , although we were standing only a few feet apart ... Now the grassy pool , where the frogs were closest , was about thirty yards square -LRB- 900 square yards -RRB- ... and each square yard held from fifty to one hundred frogs -- many square yards certainly held several hundred each .

		At the lowest computation this gives 45,000 frogs ; ... supposing there were only 20,000 females , each spawning ... only 5000 eggs ... the total would amount to one hundred million eggs .

		The spawn literally covered the ground and water thickly .

		But the greatest surprise awaited us on the following morning , when we went to photograph the scene .

		There was not a single frog left ; the water had all evaporated , and the whole place was glazed over with dried-up spawn . ''

		Though this was one of the commonest of the tropical Mexican frogs ,
Gadow	PERSON	saw in all the rest of his month 's field-work only eight or ten specimens !

		While his original observations are of the highest interest , and an actual contribution to knowledge , Dr.
Gadow	PERSON	makes rather frequent slips in Spanish , and in statements of common - place things and conditions .

		Thus , he uses the word plantanos for platanos , which is the general name for bananas and plantains ; he repeatedly uses the word bejugo -LRB- a vine or liana -RRB- for bejuco ; and he gives chicla for chicle .

		He should surely not mention a '' cathedral '' at
Orizaba	LOCATION	.

		And he falls into an ordinary tourists ' blunder in speaking of '' pigskin '' bottles for pulque .

		These are relatively small matters .

		Dr.
Gadow	PERSON	's book is a valuable contribution to
Mexicana	LOCATION	, because he went where few have gone , and did what none have done .


Frederick Starr	PERSON	.

		The
Study of Modern Exgeish	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Unlike a large majority of recent books on the English language , the work on Modern English by Dr.
Krapp	PERSON	of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	can abund - antly justify its existence .

		It has a point to make worth making , and it makes it well .

		While the very reverse of provincial , it is a book that could hardly have been written any - where but in
America	LOCATION	, its note throughout being frankly and refreshingly democratic .

		Its con - clusions , therefore , are not likely to find full favor with the creators of artificial '' authority , '' or with academic conservatives in general .

		But to all who believe in the sometimes forgotten thesis that language is made for man , and espe - cially to teachers of English whose tendency to grow dogmatic is increased unconsciously by the * Modern English .

Scribner	PERSON	' a Sons .

		178 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, dogmatism of their text-books , the saneness and calm cogency of such a chapter as that on '' English Sounds '' should be both helpful and welcome .

		The book is attractively printed , and , for a first edition , is commendably free from textual errors ; '' ealde '' for ealdan -LRB- p. 95 , 1 .

		2 -RRB- and '' starbord '' for starboard -LRB- p. 190 , 1 .

		2 -RRB- are rare instances .

		Coming to statements of fact , one is inclined at times to question , at others to take positive issue .

		It is true -LRB- p. 147 -RRB- that '' too is the stressed form of which '' to '' is the frequently un - stressed ; but why say that '' of '' is the unstressed form of which '' off '' is the stressed ?

		The facts of stress are of course as stated , but why couple in this fashion words that phonetically have not an element in common ?

		Again -LRB- p. 199 -RRB- , in the illustrations of verbs usually intransitive be - coming transitive , `` to walk a horse '' is well chosen .

		In '' to walk the streets , '' '' to jump a fence , '' however , `` the streets '' and '' a fence '' seem essentially -LRB- logically , as Doctor Krapp would put it -RRB- to be adverbs ; nor in '' I walk the deck my Captain lies '' is there anything of a transitive nature in the verbs .

		Finally -LRB- p. 254 -RRB- , '' habit '' -LRB- meaning dress -RRB- is listed among the French words brought into contem - porary English .

		What about '' Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy '' ?

		A more serious indictment must be brought against the style of the book .

		There is no reason why scientific prose should fail in euphony or be wasteful of a reader 's powers , and such faults are especially to be condemned when language is the theme ; let us give to our German philologists a monopoly of the lumber - ing and the harsh .

		Speaking generally , our author is sounder in his grammatical principles than in his rhetorical practice ; we doubt , though , whether he would give deliberate approval to these sad examples of the cacophonous : -LRB- p. 171 -RRB- '' The contemporary imperfectly educated per - son '' ; -LRB- p. 220 -RRB- '' two historically clearly distin - guishable strands '' ; -LRB- p. 293 -RRB- '' are generally unmistakably determined '' ; -LRB- p. 123 -RRB- `` only approximately correctly . ''

		Again , to use a technical terminology ^ the style is faulty in its collocation of correlatives : -LRB- p. 32 -RRB- `` Since instruction in English was no longer given in the schools , but only in French '' ; -LRB- p. 35 -RRB- '' In Chaucer we have one who was not only a consummate artist in the use of language , but one also who ... could sound ... '' Should it be argued that these faults are venial , if indeed they are faults at all , and that the English - speaking public grows less and less insistent on the niceties of arrangement and of sound , it may be answered that some of the rules of rhetoric -LRB- all the valid ones , says
Spencer	PERSON	-RRB- are grounded in the conserving of energy , and that the prin - ciples of such conservation do not derive their authority from the judgment of majorities .

		Some of those principles , let us make bold to say , strike their roots deep down into ethics .

		Even if the faults thus far referred to are rhetorical peccadilloes , the following sentence -LRB- p. 138 -RRB- is nothing short of a rhetorical crime : '' The pronunciation , however , still persists as a survival in the speech of old-fashioned people , and , since they are always slower in arriving at imitative innovations than the educated , it per - sists also in the speech of the ' ignorant ' and ' uneducated . ' ''

		One reaches the end of the sentence before discovering fully that his inevi - table reference of '' they '' to '' old-fashioned people '' has thrown him from the track of the thought .

		It is neither good sense nor good morals for an author thus needlessly to exhaust his reader 's time and patience .

		But these are surface failings .

		The book itself is an exceptionally good one , and will doubtless be read widely and with profit .

		Memoirs of a
Royalist Exile	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Memoirs are oftenest read because of the importance of the role played by their writer , and occasionally for the evidence they furnish toward the settlement of some interesting his - torical question .

		Neither of these uses render noteworthy the '' Recollections of the Baron de Frenilly . ''

		He was not a distinguished man , although he attained a certain prominence during the Restoration among those who were '' more royalist than the king . ''

		He wrote his memoirs so late in life , and when separated so completely from the means of verifying what recurred to his mind , that his testimony can not be accepted upon any matter requiring exact - ness of statement .

		And yet these '' Recollec - tions , '' once begun , will probably be read to the last page , and if read will not soon be forgotten nor regarded as without historical interest .

		The reason is that
Frenilly	PERSON	had an artist 's sense for the ; value of every stroke in the portraits that fill his pages ; his memory notes with the vividness of a fresh impression the characteristics of the changing phases of • Recollections of the

		THE DIAL 179 society from the Old Regime to the Restoration ; and his wit is quick and keen , and as free from artificiality as a bubbling
spring	DATE	.

		His peculiar quality is a frankness , full of surprises , astound - ing in its comprehensiveness , only to be ex - plained if we believe him when he says , '' My story is a secret , a disclosure made only to myself , '' written to divert weary hours of a long exile from
France	LOCATION	after the overthrow of
Charles X. Frenilly	PERSON	was not of the old nobility , but belonged to one of the families of the haute Jinance .

		His uncle , of whom he was heir , was administrator-general of the royal domain , and his father had been receiver-general of the appan - ages of the
Count of Artois	ORGANIZATION	in
Poitou	LOCATION	and
Angou	LOCATION	- mois .

		These financial families had an identity of interest with the nobility , and no noble detested the Revolution more heartily than did the young Frenilly .

		But he was unwilling to emigrate .

		He looked back upon the emigration as '' a painful sacrifice followed by a loyal dupery , '' and declared that '' it alone , and not decrees , destroyed the nobility . ''

		During the Terror he lived on one of his Touraine estates , although occasionally he came to
Paris	LOCATION	.

		He was on the
Rue St. Honore	ORGANIZATION	when the cart passed which bore
Dan	PERSON	ton to the scaffold .

		In that cart was also
Herault de Sechelles	ORGANIZATION	, ex-member of the Com - mittee of Public Safety , who , when an officer of the old Parlement of
Paris	LOCATION	, had received Frenilly as an advocate , and whom his mother had once regarded as a desirable husband for his sister .

		Although at one time during the Directory he was on the point of entering the service of the government , he took no part in politics until the Restoration , when he became a pamphleteer for the Ultras .

		Toward the close of
Villele	ORGANIZATION	's administration , realizing that in current estima - tion a '' peerage was equivalent to a dowry of a million , and my son would soon be twenty-four years of age , '' he asked that his name be included in the rumored creation , but was chagrined to find there were so many on the list .

		With a few exceptions they were '' the flower of
France	LOCATION	.

		... But this did not excuse them from the crime of being seventy-six . ''

		Frenilly had a sense of humor as well as a keen wit .

		A play of his was accepted at the Vaudeville , but '' before half the first scene had been played I said to myself , ' Oh !

		but this is execrable ! '

		The public was of the same opinion , and , whilst my friends kept applauding , hissed with all its strength .

		I ended by heartily hiss - ing myself ; for the further the play progressed the more convinced I was that the people were !

		right . ''

		Afterwards he went to a dinner where wreaths of triumph were awaiting him , and told his adventure with such relish that everybody joined him in the laughter .

		His description of the beginning of the over - tures which led to his marriage is an example of his manner of telling his story .

		His notary said to him in
1800	DATE	: '' ' Sir , you must think of marrying .

		I have a match to propose to you -- a widow . '

		I made a grimace . '

		Young , ' he added .

		I smiled . '

		And who possesses a very fine estate near
Paris	LOCATION	. '

		I listened . ''

		The '' Recollections '' are also full of amusing anec - dotes .

		One relates that an officer after a battle was supervising the burial of the dead , and thinking he saw some of the bodies move , in - formed the grave-diggers . ''

		Let them be , sir , '' replied one of the men ; '' if we listened to them , not one of them would be dead . ''

		Frenilly 's portraits are entirely without malice , although this would be a poor solace to some of the passing subjects of his pencil -- for example , to that farmer-general ,
M. Delahante	PERSON	, who was '' at bottom an excellent person , '' although he was '' a tall , bony , square-shouldered man , with a dry , hard , vulgar face , and who smelt of money a mile off . ''

		He speaks of the Academician Bailly with appreciative warmth , adding , however , these sentences , a propos of his election as mayor of
Paris	LOCATION	: '' His modesty capitulated , he thought himself a great man , and he became ridiculous .

		Heaven had granted him a wife who was exactly proportioned to his entre - sol in the Louvre : a good housekeeper and nurse who adored him , a talkative , common , ignorant , stupid woman ... Behold her through a stroke of the wand , seated in an immense gilded salon thronged with citizens and courtiers , and you may imagine what a powerful auxiliary she was to the sarcasms which were already showering upon her poor husband . ''

		His contempt for
Talleyrand	LOCATION	breaks out in the description of the festival of the
Federation	ORGANIZATION	,
July 14 , 1790	DATE	, when `` this little bishop , a dis - solute and lame atheist and gambler , was the only person that could be found to say that famous high mass in the open air , and which the heavens seemed to take pleasure in drown - ing every five minutes by torrents of rain . ''

		Frenilly 's mother thought
Lafayette	LOCATION	a hero , but he called him a
Gilles Cesar	PERSON	, in which , by the way , he agreed with
Talleyrand	LOCATION	's estimate .

		The chief historical interest of the memoirs belongs to the descriptions of social life before the Revolution , the coming of which Frenilly thought was foreshadowed by an abandonment of the good old customs .

		His account of the training of a boy for social duties is especially 180 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, clear , and includes an amusing interview with
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	.

		The reorganization of society during the Directory is also illustrated with curious details .

		It should be remarked that the trans - lator has been able to an unusual degree to pre - serve the liveliness of the original .

		M. Chuquet has added valuable biographical notes upon the many personages mentioned by Frenilly .

		wound in the heel that makes him limp for the rest of his life .

		The story up to this point is very engaging , and the boy 's character as well ; for Mr.
White	PERSON	understands boy psychology , and
John Barclay	PERSON	is an authentic example of his kind .

		He holds our sympathies while he struggles for an edu - cation , and while his first heart flutterings seem to promise a sentimental development of the plot .

		But the author is not for sentiment , except as an acces - sory , and we gradually become aware that
John	PERSON	's chief aim in life is to be money-getting .

		As a boy , he makes us uncomfortable by his sharp practice , and the older he grows the more the soul shrivels up within him .

		The bulk of Mr.
White	PERSON	's novel is de - voted to describing the process by which
John Barclay	PERSON	becomes one of the wealthiest men in
America	LOCATION	.

		His success is brought about by shrewd farsightedness , absolute unscrupulousness , and the wholesale corrup - tion of courts and legislatures .

		He is , in short , the typical bogey-man of the muck-raking magazine .

		This part of the story is so overloaded with detail as to be unsuff erably tedious .

		Fortunately , the book also makes us acquainted with many other people , more humanly interesting ; for it offers an epitome of the life of
Sycamore Ridge	ORGANIZATION	, as the town grows from its very beginnings into a sizable city .

		The many characters are thrown together in the novel much as they are thrown together in life , and there is little evidence of artistic plan or grouping .

		The writer 's knowledge , powers of observation , and pointed style impart a considerable degree of interest to his story , despite its amorphous structure .

		He affects , with imperfect success , the confidential manner of
Thackeray	PERSON	, and indulges in homily or reminiscence as his vagrant fancy bids .

		The proper moral of such a story is that the millionaire hero should find his wealth dust and ashes , and this moral Mr.
White	PERSON	properly points .

		But he makes rather a mess of the rich man 's change of heart ; there is much pathos and little verisimiltude in the account of his regeneration .

		Mr.
John Reed Scott	PERSON	, forsaking the imaginary kingdoms and fair princesses with which his inven - tion has hitherto entertained us , now gives us a story of our own time and country , entitled '' The Woman in Question . ''

		The woman is a beautiful creature who lives a secluded life in rural
Virginia	LOCATION	, where she is discovered by the hero when he deserts city for country in order to take possession of the ances - tral estate which he has recently inherited .

		She is a woman with a past -LRB- which provides the element of mystery -RRB- , and her past confronts her when the hero brings a house party to his new home , for one of his guests turns out to be the man whom the heroine had married when a mere girl , and from whom she had afterwards fled in disgust .

		She pre - tends , when she meets him , that he is a total stranger to her ; and her self-possession is such that he is puz - zled , for it is ten years since they parted , and both nature and art have changed her appearance .

		By means of a stratagem , however , he makes sure of her identity , and then , being a thorough-going

		THE DIAL 181 villain of melodrama , he seeks to use his knowledge for purposes of blackmail .

		Already an embezzler , his plight is desperate , and the only way out of it is for him to get killed , which he does to the satisfac - tion of all concerned .

		Thereupon the hero claims possession , and his plea does not go unheeded .

		It makes an ingenious and interesting narrative , light - hearted -LRB- except for the underlying tragedy -RRB- , and gracefully related .

		A new writer and almost a new subject claim our attention in Mr.
Eugene Paul Metour	PERSON	's tale of romantic adventure in
North Africa	LOCATION	, entitled '' In the Wake of the Green Banner . ''

		It is a story of our own days , of the French occupation of
Morocco	LOCATION	, and of factional Moorish strife .

		Vivid in coloring and brilliant in description , it is the work of a writer who has first-hand knowledge of his subject -- knows it , in fact , almost too well for the reader 's comfort , who would like to have the political situation more fully explained , and who is in danger of much be - wilderment at the strange local vocabulary .

		The opening chapters , describing
Marakesh	ORGANIZATION	and its capture by a fanatical Moslem horde , with the con - sequent massacre or expulsion of the French , are much the best of the book ; if their promise were fulfilled in those that follow , the story would be a strong one indeed .

		But from the time when the little band of persons in whom we are interested make their escape from the city , and enter upon their toilsome journey through the desert , the story has little plan or coherence .

		From that point on , it is a chain of loosely-linked episodes , leading to noth - ing in particular but a good deal of fighting and the final escape of the leading characters .

		It is weak also in its delineation of these characters .

		Neither the Corsican hero , the French - American heroine , nor her American artist-cousin is distintly realized from within ; in this respect , the author has been more successful with some of his native types . ''

		The Plotting of
Frances `` Ware	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
James Locke	PERSON	, has for its hero a Polish patriot who works against the Russian government , and meets the usual fate of such conspirators .

		We first meet him on a Siberian convict-train , from which he makes a daring escape .

		Many months later , he turns up in
Turkestan	LOCATION	, a wild-eyed refugee , and there wins sym - pathy and protection from an American archaeologist engaged in scientific exploration .

		Professor
Ware	PERSON	's companion in this expedition is his sister ,
Frances Ware	PERSON	, who is so fascinated by the refugee that she gives him her heart .

		Presently he negotiates suc - cessfully the dangers of the Russian frontier , reaches safety in
Paris	LOCATION	, and there , after
Frances	PERSON	has also returned , persuades her into a marriage .

		The scene then shifts to
Warsaw	LOCATION	, whither the couple go in dis - guise , ostensibly to regain possession of certain property , but really -LRB- although the fact is concealed from the wife -RRB- to take part in a new and desperate conspiracy .

		The plot fails , the hero becoming the victim of treachery , and the heroine being saved through the efforts of the British consul .

		It makes a straightforward and highly interesting story , swift and logical in movement , and not too harrowing to our feelings , for the hero 's weakness and deceitful - ness are apparent enough to us -LRB- although the hero - ine sees only the lovable aspect of his character -RRB- , and we feel sure that he will be succeeded after a proper interval by the above-mentioned British consul .

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's posthumous story , '' The White Sister , '' belongs to the Roman group of his novels , and a Saracinesca is among the lesser figures .

		It is the story of a young woman , reared in the most conservative and clerical circles , and supposed to be the daughter of Prince Chiaromonte .

		The sudden death of the latter reveals the fact that
Angela	PERSON	is without legal rights , and that , instead of inheriting title and fortune , she is a nameless pauper .

		She is affianced to an officer who is too much a gentleman to be influenced by this revelation , save to the dis - play of greater tenderness and determination to make her his bride .

		But his departure upon a mil - itary expedition to
Africa	LOCATION	is soon followed by the report of his death in a skirmish , and there is noth - ing left for
Angela	PERSON	but to take the veil .

		She has been for some time a nun when it transpires that her lover was not slain , but has been held in captivity for several years .

		When he makes his escape and returns , a difficult situation is created ; for
Angela	PERSON	can not forget her love , yet is irrevocably vowed to the religious life .

		But it seems that there is a way out of even so desperate a difficulty as this , and a way that approves itself to so good a Catholic as Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	.

		There seems to us a touch of casu - istry in the reasoning , but the author speaks by the card , and it is certainly a relief to our feelings to learn that the highest ecclesiastical authority is willing to intervene for the purpose of bringing the lovers together .

		Mr.
Ernest Oldmeadow	PERSON	's '' Antonio '' presents a similar case of conflict between religious obligation and earthly love , but with a different issue , and with a degree of psychological power far beyond anything that was ever in Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's reach .

		This is a story of
Portugal	LOCATION	, dated from
1835	DATE	onward .

		It is the time of the suppression of the monasteries by a corrupt and unscrupulous government , and the in - terest centres around a Benedictine abbey overlook - ing the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Antonio has just been made a priest when the news of the spoliation is received , and a band of soldiers comes to the abbey gates to enforce the decree of dispossession .

		Sadly and sol - emnly the abbey folk file forth into a world suddenly grown hostile , and seek new retreats in distant lands , Antonio alone remaining in the neighborhood .

		He has taken a great resolve ; he has determined to devote his life to reclaiming the abbey for the ser - vice of God and to restoring its ancient glories .

		The remainder of the book tells how this purpose is ful - filled after many years of toil and trial .

		Beginning in the humblest way , and keeping his secret close , he gradually acquires land and becomes a vine - grower .

		Slowly but steadily his enterprise prospers , and , despite many privations and heartbreaking 182 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, disappointments , he sees the goal a little nearer with every year .

		The great trial of his constancy conies when the abbey is bought by an Englishman who brings his household to live there for a time .

		The new owner has a daughter , and Antonio engages in a desperate spiritual conflict to prevent his love for her from breaking down his resolution .

		In the event soul triumphs over sense , the work of redemp - tion goes on , the abbey is reclaimed for its sacred purpose , and the woman , chastened by years of grief and renunciation , becomes a Sister of the Visitation .

		It all stands in striking contrast to Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's story , which is seen to be the veriest brummagem when brought into comparison with the pure gold of this study of the spiritual life .

		The above is but a brief and barren outline of one of the most masterly and moving books of fiction that are often to be met with .

		It is a book of the deepest human interest , glowing in color and rich in emotion .

		Its scene , moreover , lies so far from the beaten track that a distinct element of novelty is thereby added to its other and nobler qualities .

		A variant upon the case of Hamlet is offered by Mr.
Warwick Deeping	PERSON	's '' Mad
Barbara	PERSON	. ''

		This is a novel of the later years of the Restoration , when Popish plots haunted the minds of Englishmen , and the fussy Mr.
Samuel Pepys	PERSON	kept the diary which has been the delight of all succeeding generations .

		We mention both these subjects because both are woven into the fabric of Mr.
Deeping	PERSON	's narrative ; the worthy Mr.
Pepys	PERSON	figures in several scenes , and the undoing of the villain results from his implica - tion in a Catholic conspiracy .

		Aside from these historical trappings , the story is simply good melo - drama .

		Barbara 's father is slain mysteriously , and the daughter vows vengeance upon his murderer .

		Her only clew is a fragment of gold and pearl orna - ment which she finds on the spot where the body of her father is discovered .

		This she treasures , and bides her time .

		But when she thinks she has found the man from whose garment the ornament had been torn , he is no other than the returned soldier of for - tune to whom she has already given her heart in secret .

		Nevertheless , she would have taken his life had she not learned just in time that the garment belonged to his father , whose guilty liaison with her mother had made him the murderer .

		After an un - successful attempt upon the life of the real offender , she is confined , on the pretext of madness , in a lonely castle , whence she is rescued by her lover under circumstances of great peril .

		This is evidently the material for an exciting tale , and the author has used it to excellent effect .

		A melodramatic tale of conspiracy and freeboot - ing , of plot and counterplot in
South Africa	LOCATION	, is given us in Mr.
Ridgwell Cullum	PERSON	's '' The Compact . ''

		The scene is
Bechuanaland	LOCATION	, and the time is set in the years following the British concession at
Majuba	LOCATION	.

		The fate of the country hangs in the balance , for the British government has not formally claimed it , and is supine in the protection of its settlers , while German influences are secretly at work to gain con - trol .

		This is the historical setting of a drama which has three leading characters :
Elwood	PERSON	, the strong silent man who thwarts the conspirators , Chalmer , their agent and ally , and the woman whom both men had loved in
England	LOCATION	.

		She had been pledged to Chalmer , who had gone to
Africa	LOCATION	, and sent no word thereafter .

		Believing him dead , she had married Elwood without loving him , and come to live with him in
Bechuanaland	LOCATION	.

		She is startled when Chalmer appears upon the scene , and renews his suit , but she has come to love her husband at last , and has only scorn for the man who had once had a claim upon her .

		If Elwood could have known this , there would have been no story to write , still less a compact to give it a title .

		For this compact , forced upon Chalmer by
Elwood	LOCATION	, is , in brief , that in a year 's time the one of them whom the woman does not love shall put himself out of the way .

		As the time of fulfilment draws near , the situation grows tense with excitement , and the discovery of their reciprocal love , made by husband and wife at the last moment , is delayed until we stand upon the very brink of a tragedy .

		Then , by an ingenious device ,
Chalmer	PERSON	meets his deserved fate without entailing a moral responsibility upon either husband or wife .

		The preacher of high ideals , caring little for the dogmatism of the Christian church but filled to over - flowing with its spirit , set down in the midst of a sodden community -LRB- preferably rural -RRB- , and slowly leavening the lump of its corruption by his clear - eyed activity , -- this is a theme that has engaged the attention of many novelists -LRB- mostly women -RRB- , and often lends itself to effective dramatic treatment .

		The preacher is usually a young man , and his strug - gle against the spiritual sluggishness , if not the actual immorality , of the town in which he is settled proves despairingly difficult .

		The details of his life are criticised by scandal-mongers ; he goes in for social betterment , and is told that he had better preach `` the simple gospel '' ; he exposes the fester of hypocrisy , and becomes the victim of abuse and ma - licious intrigue ; he runs afoul of the local magnate and braves his wrath , but finds his position endan - gered ; in the end he conquers all the forces of sullen opposition , and reaps the fruit of his weary labors in the secure affection of a quickened and regenerated community .

		We have followed this programme through the pages of many novels , and we follow it once more in '' But Still a Man , '' for which Miss
Margaret L. Knapp	PERSON	is responsible .

		The story is unfolded with quiet impressiveness , never resorting to sensational trickery , and having few moments of dramatic tension .

		But it gains a strong hold upon us by its naturalness , its earnestness , its variety of character and incident , its gleams of poetry and humor , and its clear , unaffected style .

		The development of the minister 's own character is not the least admirable feature of the novel , and his love affairs -LRB- when we have once got our bearings -RRB- add noticeably to the interest which we take in his activities .

		The scene is not too definitely fixed : it seems to lie somewhere in the
Western Reserve	ORGANIZATION	.


1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 183 The collapse of the great bridge at
Quebec	LOCATION	pro- vides a striking climax for Miss
Anna Chapin	PERSON	Ray 's story of '' The Bridge Builders . ''

		This tragedy of engineering is not used as a mere picturesque adjunct to the story , but is brought into vital relation with the characters concerned , and described with a wealth of technical detail that is rather surprising when we consider the sex of the author .

		The social setting is in part provided by the tourist hotels of the ancient city , and in part by the inner circle of the aristocratic life of
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		The heroine is a refreshing apparition from
Arizona	LOCATION	, and there are two heroes -- one , a young man of letters from the States , the other an older man who is the scion of one of the most distinguished families of the city .

		Both men are of such fine types that our satisfaction in the success of the one is considerably embittered by our share in the other 's disappointment The characterization of these three persons , and of at least half a dozen lesser figures , is distinctly success - ful , and the simple plot of the narrative is kept well in hand and firmly guided to its logical outcome .

		The style is admirable , the product of good taste and a cultivated mind , and the book is written from intimate knowledge of the scenes and social condi - tions which it portrays .

		It is the sort of book that may be read with much quiet satisfaction .

		Miss
Susan Glaspell	PERSON	is a new writer , and one from whom much may be expected , if it is legitimate to base such a judgment upon a first book .

		The belief that love sanctifies suffering , and may make the blackest of tragedies seem bearable , finds poignant expression in `` The Glory of the Conquered . ''

		The man is a biologist of world-wide fame , whose re - searches are directed toward the discovery of an effective treatment for cancer .

		The woman is an artist with whom promise is well on the way to fulfil - ment .

		Both are intense natures , and when they love it is with all the intensity that has hitherto been dis - played in their devotion to science and art .

		A short term of unreasonably happy wedded life is vouch - safed them , and then the tragic fates take a hand .

		In the course of a laboratory experiment , the man 's eyes become infected , and his sight is destroyed .

		After the first shock of the castrophe has been out - lived , the woman forms a great resolve .

		She will abandon art , and devote herself to science , not to become herself an investigator , but merely to acquire the technical knowledge and expertness that shall enable her to provide the eyes for her husband 's interrupted work and make it possible for him to go on with it .

		All this she plans and performs in secret , and is just ready to announce her preparedness to take up his work , when he dies from an attack of appendicitis .

		It will be seen that nothing is spared our feelings in this narrative , and nothing but the richness and tenderness of the author 's sympathies makes it tolerable .

		Even in the outcome , the shat - tered life of the woman is somehow pieced together , and a hopeful chord is sounded at the close .

		A sort of moral victory is wrought out of what seems to be utter defeat , and the lesson of the soul 's invincibility is triumphantly enforced .

		The scene of this moving story is set in and about the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, but nothing is attempted of the nature of personal portraiture .

		A sweet and wholesome tale of life in
New England	LOCATION	in the years of the Civil War and after is given us in '' Poppea of the Post Office , '' by Mrs.
Mabel Osgood Wright	PERSON	.

		The heroine is a foundling child , left at the door of the village postmaster one stormy night .

		Widowed some ten years earlier , and bereft of his own child , he welcomes the stranger infant as a gift of providence , and makes her legally his own .

		It is a fortunate act , for she grows up into a winsome girl , and becomes the joy of his life .

		The mystery of her parentage is not disclosed until near the end of the book , when it transpires that she is the legitimate daughter of the local magnate , born after his wife , outraged by his conduct toward her , has left him and gone abroad to die .

		It is a simple story , and one that has frequently been told , but this present version need not suffer in the comparison with others , for it is appealing in sentiment and unfailing in charm .

		Nor is it without the diversifi - cations of humor , of a vivid portrayal of provincial customs and modes of speech , and of relationship to the larger life of the nation in the period dominated by impressions and memories of the great struggle for the preservation of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its love story is no less charming than all the rest , and is exquisitely fitted into the general complication .

		Mrs.
Wright	PERSON	is to be heartily congratulated upon her excursion into the paths of story-telling .

		Miss
Lottie Blair Parker	PERSON	's '' Homespun '' is one of those rambling stories that are much more concerned with racy characterization than with the development of a coherent plot .

		It gives us an intimate picture of the life of a
New England	LOCATION	town --
Columbia Corners	ORGANIZATION	-- with its individualized types , its gossip and scandal-mongering , its petty local issues , and its quaint vernacular .

		There is a great deal of homely human nature in the book , and an unfailing fund of humor .

		The plot , as far as there is one , centres about a protracted lawsuit between two brothers con - cerning the partition of the farm left them by their father .

		The younger generation is chiefly repre - sented by two lads , a petted '' model '' youth who is in reality a thoroughgoing hypocrite and rascal , and a youth of a very different sort who is thrown upon his own resources and '' makes good '' both with the world and with the young woman who stands by him in spite of all evil report .

		The story is pleasantly sentimental and entertaining throughout .

		Is character determined by heredity or by environ - ment ?

		This is the problem set in ' • The Whips of Time , '' by Miss
Arabella Kenealy	PERSON	, and illustrated by an ingeniously contrived and striking instance .

		An unscrupulous physician exchanges the infant children of two of his patients in a
London	LOCATION	hospital .

		One of them is the child of a notorious criminal ; the other belongs to a highly respectable family .

		In perform - ing this shocking experiment , the physician is actu - ated by the desire to refute the claim that a child of 184 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, criminal antecedents will dev elope in accordance with its inherited predispositions .

		He confides his secret to a fellow-physician , who is duly horrified , but keeps silent about it because the wrong has been irremedi - ably done .

		This is the prologue of a story which really begins more than
twenty years later	DATE	.

		The confidant , now retired from practice , takes up his residence in the country , and finds himself in the very place where the criminal 's child who has been foisted upon an unsuspecting family should now be living .

		He determines to identify the child and learn how the experiment has turned out .

		For a long time his suspicions are fixed upon the wrong person , and he does not discover his mistake until after a long and complicated development of the plot .

		When the mystery is cleared up , both of the exchanged chil - dren are found living in the neighborhood , and the controlling influence of heredity is demonstrated beyond any question .

		The story is not a pleasant one , but its mechanism is skilfully put together , and it is made the vehicle of a strong human interest .

		When a novel is heralded as the '' prize mystery story '' of a newspaper competition , we do not expect much from it beyond artificiality and excitement . ''

		Love 's Privilege , '' by Miss
Stella M. During	PERSON	, is such a tale and has the qualities demanded by the conditions of such a competition .

		It has also an unexpected element of literary excellence , showing that style and mystery are not altogether incompat - ible in such a production .

		The scene of the story is an English country estate ; its substance is a murder which proves properly baffling until some three hun - dred pages have been devoted to its complications , when it all becomes absurdly simple .

		On the whole , the book provides entertainment of a slightly higher quality than the motive for its writing would lead us to anticipate .

		Napoleon 's attempted invasion of
England	LOCATION	has always been a tempting theme for the romantic novelist , and Mrs.
R. S. Garnett	PERSON	's `` The Infamous John Friend '' is at least the third book to deal with it during the past year .

		It is also one of the best of the many treatments that have been given to the subject , exhibiting a close acquaintance with the social and political conditions of the period , and developing a fairly original plot in a thoroughly interesting manner .

		It offers us the novelty of a hero who is utterly unscrupulous , a spy and a traitor , plotting to deliver his country to the enemy , yet is a devoted husband , a sympathetic figure in many other relations as well , and in some respects a high - minded gentleman .

		When he receives his deserts in the end our emotion gets the better of our logic , and we can not become quite reconciled to the igno - minious execution of a man of such heroic quality and personal charm .

		The question may be raised as to the right of a novelist thus to set sentiment at odds with the requirements of justice , but that does not save our feelings from being harrowed in this particular instance .

		Several historical figures --
Napoleon	PERSON	,
Pitt	PERSON	,
Fox	ORGANIZATION	, and Mrs.
Fitzherbert	PERSON	-- appear in the course of the narrative ; and there is much vivid description of society in
London	LOCATION	and
Brighton	LOCATION	, of smugglers ' haunts on the coast of Kent , and of the doings of French spies .

		There is also a charm - ing and spirited heroine , worshipped with all proper humility , and eventually won , by a not very satis - factory hero .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		Briefs on New Books .

		From the author of '' The Romance A great inventor x f g t j „ d „ Th ^ f the his life and work .

		Reaper there now comes another book of the same industrial-romantic character , entitled ``
Cyrus Hall McCormick	PERSON	: His Life and Work '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		Mr.
Herbert N. Casson	PERSON	has here not only expanded the
McCormick	PERSON	chapter of his earlier work on the Reaper , but he has also dili - gently collected and very attractively presented much historical and statistical matter concerning the development of agricultural implements and the recent rapid increase in the world 's wheat production , an increase made possible largely by
McCormick	ORGANIZATION	's inventive genius helped on by his imitators and competitors .

		So important , indeed , is wheat made to appear in the world 's history that one is almost persuaded that a nation 's consumption of white bread is an accurate gauge of its civilization .

		The life and personality of the great inventor are ade - quately set forth , with many interesting details of his services to his chosen city ,
Chicago	LOCATION	, and his benefactions to religious and other enterprises , of which the founding and upbuilding of
McCormick Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	and of '' The Interior '' news - paper are well-known examples .

		The author makes an occasional error of fact -- as when , in his excel - lent survey of early nineteenth-century industrial and mechanical achievements , he speaks of Fulton as having '' died at forty , plagued and plundered by imitators , '' whereas the inventor of the steamboat lived to the age of fifty and was commercially not unsuccessful in his main undertakings .

		Appropriate illustrations are provided for the book , depicting the great inventor , scenes in his life , the Reaper in suc - cessive stages of development , and views of harvest - ing , primitive and scientific , in various parts of the world .

		The word Reaper always begins with a capital in Mr.
Casson	PERSON	's chapters , as it does in this notice ; and the reader must admit that the machine itself is an invention of capital importance , and its story one of unusual interest .

		r > , , it '' The lives of the world 's greatest men
Robert Fulton	ORGANIZATION	i j • • and his Hudson are commonly enveloped in a mist ot river steamboat .

		f a b -RSB- e an -LRB- j legend .

		Robert Fulton 's achievements have come down to us with a rich accompaniment of hearsay tradition which makes him an extremely interesting character , but a some - what apocryphal one .

		It has been left to his great - granddaughter ,
Miss Alice Crary Sutcliffe	PERSON	, to write the first full and authentic account of this variously gifted man , with the aid of letters and other unpub -
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 185 lished material now first collected and scrutinized for biographical purposes .

		M
Robert Fulton	PERSON	and the ` Clermont ' '' is the book 's title -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and the story is adequately told in some three hundred small pages of large print , with many illustrations of novel interest and considerable appended matter .

		While chief prominence is given to
Fulton	LOCATION	's
Hudson River	LOCATION	achievements , many less-known particulars of his life and work are detailed ; for example , his early steamboat essay on the Seine several years before the
Hudson River	LOCATION	demonstration , and his numerous other inventions besides the steamboat -- a marble-cutting machine , a flax-spinning machine , a double inclined plane for canal use .

		a contrivance for twisting rope , an earth-scoop , a cable-cutter , the panorama , the submarine torpedo boat , and a number of other less important devices .

		In reading the earlier portions of this interesting work , one is not surprised to find that
Fulton	LOCATION	was a high-spirited and forever restless boy , with more of vital energy and uncontrollable impulse than could well find vent .

		This fine `` souvenir of the Hudson-Fulton celebra - tion . ''

		as the publishers call it , is timely , and fills a gap in American biography .

		A part of the material of
Miss Sutcliffe	ORGANIZATION	's volume has appeared in `` The Century Magazine , '' but it is well worth its produc - tion in this expanded and more permanent form .

		inside view * of The resignation of
Marshal Mac	ORGANIZATION	- French politics
Mahon	PERSON	as President of the Republic in the Republic .

		of
France	LOCATION	, on
January 30 , 1879	DATE	, closed the series of victories of the French repub - licans over their monarchist adversaries --
Legiti	PERSON	- mist ,
Orleanist	LOCATION	, and
Napoleonic	ORGANIZATION	.

		This incident falls about halfway in the period covered by the fourth and final volume of M. Hanotaux 's '' Contemporary
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The dominant impression left by the narrative comes from the striking contrast between the aims of the political struggle that pre - ceded this event and the character of the movement that followed .

		The first concerned the very struc - ture of the central government ; the second was es - sentially an effort to formulate and carry into effect a programme of genuine republican reorganization .

		The questions and the leaders of the first phase now seem to belong to a purely historical past ; while those of the second phase seem , and in some cases are , the questions and leaders of to-day , or at least of yesterday .

		We read of speeches by
Brisson	PERSON	, by Freycinet ,
Ribot	PERSON	,
Meline	PERSON	, and Clemencean ; while
Broglie	PERSON	,
Simon	PERSON	, and
Laboulaye	PERSON	are heard rarely or have disappeared from the stage .

		The Ferry laws brought up the same problem of liberty of instruc - tion which the legislation of
1901	DATE	raised again .

		In explaining the arguments urged during the contro - versy , M. Hanotaux condemns
Simon	PERSON	's appeal to the analogy of the liberty of the press as simple sophistry , because '' for the spoken doctrine in class instruction refutation and even discussion is impossible . ''

		And he adds that this question of liberty of instruction must be settled on the broader considerations of '' prudence , tolerance , and humanity . ''

		It is apparent that he regards
Gambetta	PERSON	's phrase , '' clericalism is the enemy , '' as containing more truth than the ordinary electioneering cry .

		He seems to counte - nance the idea that if the elections of
1877	DATE	had favored the `` conspirators '' of the 16th of
May	DATE	, the clerical element would have dragged
France	LOCATION	into a war for the regstablishment of the temporal power of the papacy .

		As an ex-minister of foreign affairs , the author 's treatment of all matters connected with diplomacy necessarily has unusual weight .

		Not only does this apply to the study of the clerical question , but to the chapters on the Russo-Turkish War and the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		In preparing these the author has made large use of unpublished autobio - graphies , particularly the memoirs of Count
Schou	PERSON	- waloff and the '' Sovenirs '' of
Caratheodory Pacha	ORGANIZATION	.

		All the way through , the point of view is influenced by the recent dSnouement of the Balkan affair , the success of
Austria	LOCATION	backed by
Germany	LOCATION	in the defin - itive annexation of
Bosnia	LOCATION	and
Herzegovina	LOCATION	.

		This is the reason why he believes that
England	LOCATION	in
1878	DATE	, while supposedly opposing the Russian advance on
Constantinople	LOCATION	, was actually '' pulling the chestnuts out of the fire '' for the Germans .

		Bismarck looked on complacently while
Salisbury	PERSON	and
Beaconsfield	PERSON	did the hard work .

		The volume closes with the downfall of
Gambetta	PERSON	's ministry and his death .

		Gambetta is evidently its hero ; but M. Hanotaux feels his greatness more than he makes the reader feel it .

		This volume , like its predecessors , shows qualities of style which remind the reader that the author is a member of the Academy , but occasionally the habit of epigrammatic expression merges in a fondness for obscure Delphic utterances .

		TTie principles and practice of modern advertising .

		It was hardly supposed , a generation ago , that psychology and advertising had very much in common ; but now it is asserted by expert advertisers that much of their success is due to their knowledge of psychologic laws .

		This , we take it , is another way of stating that they must understand human nature and study the work - ings of the average human mind ; and in that sense it is quite true .

		This is preeminently the adver - tising age ; and books on the subject are rapidly accumulating .

		In '' The Art and Science of Adver - tising , '' by Mr.
George French	PERSON	, bearing the imprint of French ,
Sherman & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Boston	LOCATION	, those interested will find an expert treatment of the subject from the pen of one practically familiar with the printing and advertising arts .

		That Mr. French by no means underrates the importance of his subject is evident from the outset '' We know , '' he affirms , '' that it -LSB- i. e. advertising -RSB- offers the most exalted opportunity , '' the widest and most fertile field for human endeavor .

		We know that the advertiser is one of the greatest of popular educators , and one of the chief promoters of human happiness , as well as the greatest of busi - ness builders . ''

		Later he says : `` It is easier to write an article for the
Century Magazine	ORGANIZATION	than it is to write a fifty-word advertisement as it should be written . ''

		One almost expects him to assert , in his 186 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, enthusiasm , that it is easier to be a great poet than a successful advertisement-writer ; that
Lawson	PERSON	is greater than
Longfellow	LOCATION	.

		The book 's many re - productions of meritorious advertising designs are attractive and striking , but the author 's repeated assertions of the vital elements in good advertising become somewhat wearisome .

		His style , like an effective advertisement , should be concise -- although there are advertisers who rely on everlasting repeti - tion to sell their goods .

		The book represents much practical experience as well as study of its subject , and contains many helpful hints and suggestions for workers in this busy field of modern commercial life .

		A gay pageant Bio g ra P h y > like histor y > ma y be writ - of English scenes ten anew for each succeeding age and characters .

		an -LRB- j g am a f re shness and reality and meaning not to be found in the earlier records .

		This is well illustrated by Mr.
Frank Frankfort Moore	PERSON	's volume of biographical studies entitled `` A Georgian Pageant '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , and dealing with certain nota - bilities of the reign of
George the Third	ORGANIZATION	.

		No less an authority than the late Professor
J. Churton Collins	PERSON	stands sponsor to the book ; or , more exactly , its chapters are the outgrowth of certain conversa - tions with and encouraging words from that eminent scholar .

		It seems to have been largely to rectify sundry Boswellian perversions of truth that the writing of the book was undertaken .

		Especially zealous is the author in defending his illustrious fellow-countryman ,
Oliver Goldsmith	PERSON	, against Bos - well 's charges of absurd vanity and petty jealousy and general inferiority .

		One is glad to believe with Mr.
Moore	PERSON	that
Goldsmith	PERSON	's humor was beyond the range of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	's comprehension , and that thus it was the Scotchman and not the Irishman who played the fool .

		But when we are further asked to believe that the so-called bull , a familiar Hibernicism , is in reality wit disguised as stupidity for the mystification of the slow-witted , we become incredulous .

		The incidents related in these agreeable chapters are set forth with the alluring art of which Mr.
Moore	PERSON	, as a novelist , is so accomplished a master .

		Even where he is not convincing he is suggestive and original .

		The book is excellent reading and well illustrated .

Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- comprises in one substantial octavo volume the cream of the older work , and about the same quantity of equally rich skimming from the years since its publication .

		As managers of the old Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	's Theatre in
London	LOCATION	, and afterward of the
Haymarket	LOCATION	, as stanch supporters of the standard English drama , and as the first to dispense with the not too reputable '' pit '' and to devote the entire programme to a single play , these gifted and enterprising actor-managers , now resting on their laurels , have deserved well of the theatre-going public .

		Among other memorable matters , the book describes the turbulent dissatisfaction of the ground - lings when they found , on the opening of the re - modelled
Haymarket	LOCATION	, that their peculiar domain had been appropriated to the uses of a higher class of patrons .

		Of famous contemporary actors and actresses , and other persons of note , the writers have many an agreeable or amusing story to tell .

		For liveliness and variety , the book is one of the best of its kind .

		It is fully illustrated and indexed , and is well printed .

		m .

		~ f i - f ■ Mr.
Francis Grierson	PERSON	, perhaps better Ways of life in , , , ' / '' , r A , the middle West known in the world of music than in fifty years ago .

		t -RCB- ie wor id f letters , has written out some of his boyhood memories of prairie life in
Illinois	LOCATION	, of his first sight of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	at
Alton	LOCATION	, and of his later and longer sojourn in
St. Louis	LOCATION	-- all in the eventful years from
1858	DATE	to
1863	DATE	.

		`` The Valley of Shadows '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the rather puz - zling title of the book , which is happily less gloomy and forbidding in its varied contents than in its name .

		Some of its quaint characters -- as the silent
Kezia Jordan	PERSON	, the rustic philosopher `` Socrates , '' and
Elihu Gest	PERSON	the '' load-bearer '' -- are well drawn and move across the scene with a very human gait .

		Others are less substantially real , and the veil of imagination and weird romance thrown over them is never lifted .

		Despite the frequent conversations reported in detail , and other minute particulars , the reader is seldom gripped by a sense of startling reality , but sees all things through the subduing medium of a softly-tinted haze .

		That is the writer 's art , however , and not to be quarrelled with .

		A chapter on
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	gives merely an ac - count , and not an unmistakably first-hand account , of the closing bout in the great Lincoln-Douglas debate of
1858	DATE	, when the writer was but ten years old and probably not awake to the significance of the occasion .

		The book is attractively printed , and its short chapters have an inviting appearance .

		The fact of Mr.
Grierson	PERSON	's foreign birth and rather cos - mopolitan course of life gives to these impressions of his a certain peculiar value and interest .

		An aid to the B ?

		th the CoUe g e Student ° f P olitical understanding of science and the general reader who our government , desires to understand the actual work - ings of our government will find much that is useful in Professor
Paul S. Reinsh	PERSON	's '' Readings on Amer - ican
Federal Government	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is a large volume of 850 pages , with a brief index and an analytical table of contents .

		In sixteen chapters about 125 selections are given on such subjects as the Executive , the Treaty-Making Power , the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	,
Conference Committees	ORGANIZATION	, the Organization and Rules of the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	,
Financial Legis	ORGANIZATION	-
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 187 The world 's most famous fortress .

		lation , the Departments , Legislative and Adminis - trative Problems , the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, the
Foreign Service	ORGANIZATION	, the
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	, the Courts , and
Central	ORGANIZATION	- ization and Changes in the Constitution .

		As the editor says , '' the materials contained in this book are selected almost without exception from the spoken or written work of men actually engaged in the business of government -- presidents , legislators , administrative officials and judges . ''

		The collection is confined to very recent material , little of it dating further back than
1895	DATE	.

		This method of selection makes the book more valuable as a help to the under - standing of actual governmental conditions of to-day .

		Professor
Reinsh	PERSON	's volume contains much useful information that can be found in no formal descrip - tion of the American government , and will prove most useful as an aid to an understanding of its rather complex operations .

		Fortress , palace , and prison , the Tower of
London	LOCATION	has gathered about itself more memories , darkly tragic and tragically romantic , than any structure reared by the hand of man .

		In a lavishly illustrated vol - ume entitled `` The Tower of
London	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr.
Charles G. Harper	PERSON	, who already has to his credit more than a score of books of historic and antiquarian interest , tells the story of this monument of kingly power and magnificence and cruelty and weakness .

		An introduction , giving a brief history of the building as a whole , is followed by chapters that present in detail a full account and description of its several parts , with abundant reference to noted prisoners once lodged within its walls , and to the famous crimes and conspiracies and rebellions that furnished occupants for its cells and dungeons .

		Some of the horrors of old-time torture and execu - tion are also revealed , while two chapters reproduce many elaborate stone-carvings to show how the weary captives sometimes beguiled the long hours by perpetuating their tragic memory or the memory of those dear to them .

		Recent removal of certain restrictions has opened the Tower more extensively and freely to visitors than ever before , and this latest guide-book to its many points of historic interest is timely and valuable .

		The evident care and study that have gone to its making place it on a high level among books of its class .

		Notes .

		Three new volumes in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Library of Living Thought '' are the following : '' Christianity and Islam , '' by Dr.
C. H. Becker	PERSON	; `` The Origin of the
New Testa	LOCATION	- ment , '' by Dr.
William Wrede	PERSON	; and '' Jesus or
Paul	PERSON	? ''

		by Dr.
Arnold Meyer	PERSON	.

		The following new volumes are added to '' CrowelTs Modern Language Series '' : '' Dornroschen , '' a playlet by Miss
Emma Fisher	PERSON	; '' One Thousand Common French Words , '' selected by Mr.
R. de Blanchaud	PERSON	; and `` Exer - cises in French Conversation and Composition , '' by Mr.
Gustav Hein	PERSON	.

		A descriptive account , copiously illustrated , of the '' Wild Flowers and Trees of
Colorado	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
Francis Ramaley	PERSON	, is published at
Boulder	LOCATION	,
Colorado	LOCATION	, by Mr.
A. A. Greenman	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
P. Blakiston 's Son & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have published a second revised edition of '' A Text-Book of Physics , '' edited by Mr.
A. Wilmer Duff	PERSON	.

		Each of the seven sec - tions of this thoroughly modern treatise is the work of separate specialists , the editor 's contribution being the section upon mechanics and the properties of matter .

		The splendid work in the investigation of tropical diseases that has been carried on for several years in the
Wellcome Research Laboratories	ORGANIZATION	, as a part of the work of the
Gordon Memorial College	ORGANIZATION	at
Khartoum	LOCATION	, is freshly called to our notice by the third Report of that institution , now at hand .

		This handsome quarto of nearly five hundred pages , with hundreds of illustra - tions , many of them colored plates , is a monument to an enterprise of the highest import to human welfare , of interest not only to physicians , but to biologists , folk - lorists , and anthropologists as well .

		The
Togo	LOCATION	Publish -
ing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, are the American agents for this and the preceding reports .

		The death of a biographer of English royalty comes to our notice in the recent decease of Sir
Theodore Martin	PERSON	, who was born in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	ninety-three years ago .

		A lawyer by profession , but in his later life more occupied with literature , he produced an elaborate '' Life of the Prince Consort '' that won him a knighthood and also the warm regard of his Queen , whom he made the subject of a reminiscent volume entitled '' Queen
Victoria	PERSON	as I Knew Her , '' issued only last year .

		His essays in poetry and poetical translation , in literary criticism , and in other departments of letters , as well as his various activities of a different sort , have made him long a familiar figure in
London	LOCATION	life .

		Several new text-books of literature are ready for the school year now opening . ''

		A Primer of American Literature '' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Abby Willis Ho	PERSON	was , is a simple affair , a companion to the author 's similar manual of English literature .

		A much more elaborate work , and one especially notable for the variety and interest of its illustrations , is the '' English Literature '' -LRB-
Ginn	PERSON	-RRB- of Dr.
William J. Long	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Long	PERSON	's definition of a text-book is good : `` A storehouse , in which one finds what he wants , and some good things beside . ''

		There is an unexpected freshness in his treatment , and his book is effectively planned .

		Bibliographical notes are appended to the several chapters , and provide many helpful hints .

		The appearance in
England	LOCATION	of a new and definitive edition of the works of
Henry Seton Merriman	ORGANIZATION	will draw renewed attention to the writings of the brilliant author whose shrouded personality still remains un - veiled .

		The preface to the first volume , just issued by
Messrs. Smith	PERSON	,
Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, respects faithfully the deceased novelist 's wish to speak to the public only in his books and under his pen-name .

		Not even the dates of birth and death are given , although it is now no secret that he was born about
1860	DATE	, and was therefore in his early forties when he died in
1903	DATE	.

		His real name too ,
Hugh Stowell Scott	PERSON	, is known to many .

		The first four of his published novels , and also the later , '' Dross , '' are not to be included in this edition , being regarded by their author as of inferior quality ; but these are obtainable , or accessible , in
America	LOCATION	.

		`` The Slave of the Lamp '' opens the series as repub - lished , and will be followed by a dozen -LRB- a baker 's dozen , it appears -RRB- of the subsequent stories .

		188 THE DIAJ , -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, AXNOUSCEMBNT JLlST OF FALL , BOOKS .

		The classified list given below as the prospective output for the coming Fall and
Winter	DATE	season con - tains about
1400	DATE	titles , representing over forty lead - ing American publishing houses .

		These announce - ment lists , carefully prepared from the earliest and most authentic sources especially for our pages , have for many years been a special feature of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	; and their usefulness and interest , to both the book trade and the book public , have long been recognized .

		They not only show at a glance what books are com - ing out in any department of literature , but form a complete summary of the principal publishing activ - ities of the year .

		All the books entered are new books -- new editions not being included unless hav - ing new form or matter .

		Some of the more inter - esting features among these announcements are commented upon in the leading editorial in this number of The Dial .

		Considerations of space make it necessary to carry over to our next issue the categories of '' Education '' and '' Books for the Young . ''

		THIS Book is sent forth without the name of either author or translator .

		Some reason for this is set forth in the Preface , which at once whets the appetite for the narrative which follows .

		It is an intensely vital , self-revealing docu - ment -- one in which the writer , like
Rousseau	PERSON	or
Amiel	PERSON	, seeks to tell the whole truth about himself , sparing nothing , condoning nothing .

		In an easy , smooth-flowing style , and through the medium of a story which at times grows highly dramatic , the man lays bare the secrets of his soul .

		`` The whole man in his simplicity and earnestness appears in this book , '' says the translator . ''

		But we shall let him speak for himself .

		He knows better how to do it , than we . ''

		NOTES 241 ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS -LRB- additional -RRB- 242 TOPICS LN OCTOBER PERIODICALS ... 247 a-IST OF NEW BOOKS 248 THE THEATRICAL UPLIFT .

		As the theatrical season opens , there is a bow of promise in the skies , arching from one shore of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to the other , the sign of a new spirit in the direction of stage affairs in the English-speaking world .

		It is a sign only , and almost everything remains yet to be done , but never before have there been so many indica - tions that the English theatre is on the point of realizing its responsibilities , and of becoming the ally of education and art and morals .

		For a good many years a few idealists have been hammering at the nail of the endowed or sub - sidized stage , and it seems at last to have been driven in firmly enough to support our hopes , provided we are reasonably modest in their statement .

		The elementary propositions that the theatre may be made a worthy educational agency , and that , as such , it should no more be expected to pay its way than the college or the church , the public library or the art museum , appear to have been grasped by a number of minds sufficient to form a working - nucleus for the propaganda that has hitherto existed only on paper .

		The accretion of converts to this cause needs only to go on for a few years more at the present rate , and there will be enough serious theatres in actual operation to provide the skeptical with a convincing object-lesson .

		We have no idea that the theatre of commerce , devoted to the frivolities and vulgarities that best pay their exploiters , will be put out of business by the new development , for , as
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	says , '' Es muss doch solche Kauze geben , '' but we do foresee the time when in our larger cities it shall be possible to find some playhouse to go to for genuine spiritual refreshment .

		Looking first at the transatlantic aspect of the situation , we note that the war on the censor - ship goes merrily on , and that the doom or the radical transformation is in sight of a svstem that proscribes such dramatic masterpieces as '' The Cenci '' and ''
Monna Vanna	PERSON	, '' while tol - erating every form of debasing and brutalizing stage entertainment .

		Then there are the two new repertory theatres that are actually about to open their doors in
London	LOCATION	, one of them under the management of Mr.
Herbert Trench	PERSON	, the other under the joint direction of Mr.
Charles Frohman	PERSON	and Messrs.
G. Bernard Shaw	PERSON	,
Gran	LOCATION	- 220 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	ville
Barker	PERSON	,
J. M.Barrie	PERSON	, and
John Galsworthy	PERSON	.

		These two enterprises show that '' the public within the public , '' to use Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's phrase , has at last found practical recognition , and that the serious play-writer may be encouraged to engage in dramatic composition without keeping one eye squinted toward the box-office .

		There seems to be no reason to doubt the good faith of the men in charge of these new undertakings .

		Their official pronouncements may be illustrated by a few quotations .

		Mr.
Frohman	PERSON	says : '' A repertory theatre should be the first home of the young dramatist .

		I beg of him to be done with the the - atrical , and write only of a life that he really knows ... I want to interest the good play-goer , not once or twice a year , in what is being done at my theatres , but once or twice a mouth In my opinion there are now in this country a number of people sufficiently large to be called the public , who wish to delight in the drama as an art . ''

		These sayings have the right ring , and so have such utterances as these from Mr. Trench : '' It is hoped that the new management will be able to give the most generous opportunities to young English dramatists ... Under our new system it will be possi - ble to produce masterpieces by dramatists of the first rank which would never see the light in a long run .

		The play of ideas will be varied also by selections from the best revived modern plays , and by classical plays . ''

		We are indebted for these '' kernel '' quota - tions to an article by Mr.
Edward Garnett	PERSON	, whose own opinion is thus voiced : '' The old view that the theatre is merely a place of amuse - ment is giving way , slowly , but none the less giving way , to the idea that the theatre is one of the most potent instruments we possess for the aesthetic , mental , and moral instruction of the citizen . ''

		This is a truism to anyone even super - ficially acquainted with the history of culture , but our English theatre has sunk to so low an estate during the last half - century that the state - ment will come to many with the force of a refreshing novelty .

		The vicious influences of the star system , the long run , the syndicated control , and the supine catering to low forms of taste , have so operated to bring the theatre into contempt that its repute will not easily be restored , even with the best of will and the most ample resources .

		But a fair beginning has been made , and our confidence now has something to which it may cling .

		Coincidently with these foreign undertak - ings , the New Theatre of
New York	LOCATION	is about to open its doors .

		Of the two factors necessary to the success of such a venture , money and intelli - gent direction , the former , at least , is not lacking , for the building and grounds are said to repre - sent an initial expenditure of
three million dollars	MONEY	.

		As for the other factor , the names of those directly in charge , as well as the names of those who are supporting the enterprise , are of a nature to claim respect .

		Whether the danger that comes from a multitude of counsellors will be avoided remains to be seen .

		There is a cer - tain element of danger also in a too lavish material equipment , and it is possible that the financial path has been made too smooth .

		The directors disclaim any leanings toward precios - ity , and do not intend to frighten the public away by a too austere idealism .

		They do not aim to produce plays '' too bright and good for human nature 's daily food . ''

		The New Theatre is not , they say , `` to be made a school for the select few , wherein a dull or tedious play of merit will be kept upon the stage for the pur - pose of instructing its patrons , but a playhouse for the public at large . ''

		They further say that they hope to make the institution '' as distinctly democratic and civic as is the Comedie Fran - caise . ''

		This is all very sensible , and the early announcements indicate that various tastes are to be consulted .

		The first five plays to be given are ''
Antony	PERSON	and Cleopatra , '' '' The School for Scandal , '' Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	's '' Strife , '' and new works by two young
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	graduates , Mr.
Edward Knoblauch	PERSON	, who wrote '' The Shulamite , '' and Mr.
Edward Sheldon	PERSON	, who wrote '' Salvation
Nell	PERSON	. ''

		One evening a week is to be given to the performance of standard operas of the lighter sort .

		An import - ant point is that the company , which includes many actors of assured reputation , will visit other large cities for short engagements after the twenty-four weeks ' season in
New York	LOCATION	is at an end .

		This gives the enterprise a truly national significance .

		Finally , a word should be said about the pro- gramme of Mr.
Donald Robertson	PERSON	and his
Chicago	LOCATION	company of players .

		This modest organ - ization , inspired by a director whose aims are the highest and whose devotion to his art is abso - lutely pure and disinterested , has already done two years of successful missionary work , and now enters upon a third with high hopes and fair promise .

		The
Chicago	LOCATION	season will consist of thirty
Saturday	DATE
night	TIME	performances , beginning early this month .

		They will be given upon the stage of
Fullerton Hall	ORGANIZATION	at the Art Institute , with better facilities than were available there last year .

		The other days of the week will be spent in outside engagements , and the object - lesson will be repeated in many distant commu - nities .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	has projected , as before , a cosmopolitan programme of singular interest .

		His English classics are to be
Sheridan	PERSON	's '' The
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 221 Critic , ''
Browning	PERSON	's `` The Return of the Druses , '' Shelley 's '' The
Cenci	PERSON	, '' and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's '' Timon of
Athens	LOCATION	. ''

		The two latter plays are practically unknown to the modern stage , and
Shelley	PERSON	's great tragedy , forbidden in the poet 's native country by the censor , has had only the single -LRB- private -RRB- performance given it by the
Shelley Society	ORGANIZATION	about fifteen years ago .

		The first American performance will be distinctly an event .

		Ten continental dramas , new and old , are included in this fascinating programme .

		The classics are
Calderon	PERSON	's '' Mayor of Zalamaya , '' Moliere 's '' Tartufe , ''
Marivaux	ORGANIZATION	's '' Le Jeu de 1 ' Amour et du Hasard , '' and
Alfieri	PERSON	's ''
Saul	PERSON	. ''

		The modern examples are
Echegaray	PERSON	's '' The Stigma , '' Sudermann 's '' Gliick im
Winkel	PERSON	, '' Heijerman 's '' Links , '' van Eeden 's '' Ysbrand , ''
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's u H aermaendene paa
Helgeland	PERSON	, '' and
Bjornson	PERSON	's u De Nygifte , '' the earliest of his social studies .

		This extraordinary list of mas - terpieces will afford a hitherto unexampled opportunity for acquaintance with the best in dramatic literature ; that all these works are presently to be seen in actual stage performance in the English language is a fact that seems too good to be true .

		ON TEACHING LITERATURE .

		All sciences and special branches of knowledge can be taught , because they are limited in their nature and have definite rules and methods ; but to teach literature is a good deal like trying to teach life itself .

		One can only know life by instinct and experience .

		A class in literature must be a good deal like an aviary in which someone is endeavoring to introduce order and discipline .

		The birds ' minds are so various , the air-paths and the perches are so numerous and alluring , that the drill-master can hardly help having a hard time .

		The converse of the rule about toadstools and mushrooms is true of students : if books bore or poison you , you are not a reader ; if you can digest them , you are .

		The born reader , even with the slightest learning , has an almost infallible instinct .

		He or she will never make the mistake of Charles
Lamb	PERSON	's Stamp Collector , who asked him if he did not think
Milton	PERSON	was a great poet .

		He or she will never exasperate you by sug - gesting that the last novelist has put the world 's literature into eclipse .

		But the born diviners are few , and the majority of students need guidance and are willing to accept it .

		If it ever fell to my lot to conduct a class in literature .

		I think I should begin by placing in every pupil 's hands a copy of Leigh Hunt 's little compila - tion , u Imagination and Fancy . ''

		The Introduction to this work is of no great value , -- or , at least , the ideas in it can be better gathered from their originals in
Coleridge	LOCATION	.

		But the selections form a small body of the most intensely poetical pieces and passages in the language .

		And Hunt , by his system of italiciz - ing the most perfect phrases and expressions , by his notes of ungrudging admiration , is continually at the student 's elbow , to explain , illumine , make vivid , the wonders of the text .

		It would be a poor pupil who , from the study of such a work , would not come to realize that literature is a fine art -- that its medium is words , and that these words are capable of melodies , harmonies , tints , colors , tone , and sculptural outline in infinite and almost ineffa - ble combination .

		The power of rendering by lan - guage the exact qualities of things , of giving in essential extract the forms and hues of life and nature , and of hinting at the interrelation and spir - itual significance of these matters , is the primary concern of literature .

		With some poets and prose writers , expression is all in all ; and with many readers it is so fascinating that they care for noth - ing else .

		From these studies in the near and the minute , I should jump my students at once to the considera - tion of the large and the remote .

		I should place before them , using English translations or recensions , the great early epics of earth 's different races -- the Icelandic sagas , the Niebelungenlied , the Celtic legends , and the great Hindoo epics .

		These works differ greatly in their qualities of expression , in their verbal felicity .

		The Niebelungenlied , perhaps the largest canvas of human action ever painted , is done in a rambling , garrulous style , in a jog-trot metre .

		The Icelandic sagas are terse and vivid , but they are travellers ' tales , having little ordered art , and being the germs of poems rather than full poetic works .

		The Irish and Welsh legends have had an immense amount of art spent upon them in their varied recen - sions , and they are often splendidly beautiful in detail ; but in them the genius of the race has seemed to lack balance and measure .

		The same thing may be said of the Hindoo epics .

		But all of these works have in common greatness of design and creative fire ; and it is as necessary that the student of literature should get it into his head that these qualities are admirable as that he should learn to appreciate perfect form .

		They one and all shadow forth a world that is based indeed on our world , but rises above this like a mirage .

		They project figures that bear the semblance of humanity , but are larger , more tremendous , more significant than merely human characters .

		They involve the cosmogonies -- the hopes and fears , the thoughts and intuitions , of mankind in its freshest stage of imagination .

Oct. 1	DATE	,
Cuchulain	PERSON	's single-handed fight against an immense army .

		Such creations , while they are projections of single characters , have the concentrated signifi - cance of types .

		They compare with the figures in modern novels , which are also pictures of humanity , as gold coins compare with hank notes .

		These may have the same face value , hut the notes soon become dirty and torn , and are discarded ; whereas the coins keep their lustre and edge and intrinsic value for centuries .

		After the lessons of form and the lessons of design had sunk into my pupils ' minds , then , and not until then , I should put before them accepted master - pieces of literature in which creation and execution go hand in hand .

		It is unnecessary to enumerate them -- and , indeed , for school purposes a small selection from any one of the three supreme poets , Homer ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, or Shakespeare -- would be sufficient to indicate what literature can do at its best .

		In any one of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's most perfect plays , for instance , what faculties , what qualities , what mira - cles of vision and execution , combine to produce the total effect !

		No single gift is there , but a complex of powers which it would be a fascinating though perhaps not very useful study to unravel and separate .

		Absolute realization , transcendent power , -- these are the main goals of literature .

		Speech , in its commonest use , is an ever-recurring miracle ; but as used by the great masters to rival the concrete , to realize the abstract , to fix fleeting nature and life , it is the wonder of wonders .

		And the creative power of design , which on the basis of nature and life builds the empires of the imagination , is even more god - like .

		Something analogous to this division of literature exists in painting .

		From the first , artists seem to have been separated into two opposed camps : those who could realize , render , paint ; and those who could draw , design , tell stories .

		The one body was mainly concerned with the rendering of planes , modified of course by tint and color ; the other was chiefly interested in expressing ideas by means of lines .

		The Greek paintings that have come down to us in vase decorations are of the latter class ; they have purity of line and tint , but they do not seek to reproduce nature , and they do illustrate legends and express ideas .

		The great Greek painters , how - ever ,
Zeuxis	PERSON	and Apelles , were , if we may trust the legends about them , Tenderers .

		They sought to imitate nature ; they painted what they saw .

		In more recent times , Angelo ,
Raphael	PERSON	,
Tintoretto	ORGANIZATION	,
Poussin	LOCATION	,
Reynolds	PERSON	,
David	PERSON	, and a great part of the English school , were designers , illustrators .

		And on the other side ,
Titian	ORGANIZATION	,
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	,
Velasquez	PERSON	, nearly the whole Dutch school , and
Gainsborough	PERSON	, were painters , reproducers of nature .

		Both kinds of art are legitimate , -- they are equally important , but it is curious that those who can paint despise design , while those who can design rarely render with the felicity and perfection of the others .

		It is the difference between the sensuous and intellectual faculties of man .

		There is no such decisive separation of these faculties , no such war of armed camps , in literature as in painting .

		It is difficult to use words at all without conveying ideas or telling a story -- without exhibiting some quality of design .

		Here and there a poet or a prose-writer has succeeded in striking out impressions of nature , or rapturous musical tones , to which it is difficult to attach a coherent meaning .

		Perhaps
Coleridge	PERSON	's ''
Kubla Khan	PERSON	'' and
Poe	PERSON	's '' Ulalume '' are the supreme examples , in our liter - ature at least , of such scenic or atmospheric rendi - tions .

		They may signify anything or nothing .

		On the other hand , writers who have anything at all to say have usually been able to say it in more or less felicitous words .

		But the distinction remains between the two orders of minds ; it is symbolized in the two opposed pairs ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Schiller	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	and Shelley .

		Some writers pass through all the phases of the two gifts .

		Shakespeare began life intoxicated by words and images .

		He yielded himself up as a pure medium for life to express itself -- as a mirror to reflect all the hues and objects about him .

		Grad - ually the intellectual predominated , and at the top of his career he seems almost to have disdained the vehicle of language , and , like
Velasquez	PERSON	at the last , '' painted with the will alone . ''

		The same progres - sion is observable in
Milton	LOCATION	, from the sensuousness of his earlier poems to the severe outlines of the ''
Samson	PERSON	. ''

		But to return to my class of students whom I left hanging in the air .

		There are two more matters I should like to impress upon them : first , the import - ance of the individual , the personal , in writers or creative artists ; and , second , the universality or con - stant recurrence of the master-moods of mankind which seek expression in literature .

		The writer 's personality constitutes his originality .

		It is what he adds to the common stock .

		It is what differen - tiates him from others .

		No two artists can have the same view of human life or nature ; no two are started with exactly the same impetus , or meet with the same resistance .

		As a result , their work , down to the very motion of their prose or verse , is different .

		Hereby it comes that we would recognize a scene of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's or a passage of
Milton	LOCATION	's if we met them in the middle of the desert of
Sahara	LOCATION	.

		All art worth the name has this quality of uniqueness , of singularity .

		But on the other hand , as the main experiences of mankind are , after all , limited in number , are com - mon to all , it comes about that literature must repeat , reiterate , recast , the same matter .

		The joys , hopes , sorrows , fears , aspirations and despairs of men must reappear in new guise in every age 's art .

		Hence the parallels , similarities , revivals and imitations in liter - ature .

		The same general conditions compel the same kind of work .

		The Athenian drama , rising out of the heroic period of the Greek race , based upon religion , patriotism , art-zeal , finds itself echoed in the great English and Spanish theatres .

		The courtly verse of the Augustan age is parallelled by that of the epochs of
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		and
Queen Anne	ORGANIZATION	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The tribute to the memory of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	on the recent bicentennial of his birthday -LRB- Septem - ber 18 -RRB- , was no noisy demonstration , but an appro - priate recognition of his still-living influence in our life and thought .

		He is now very little read , it is true : but he has left a few phrases and maxims that promise to abide . ''

		To point a moral or adorn a tale '' falls glibly from the tongue of thousands who have never heard of `` The Vanity of Human Wishes , '' and many an untoward happening is spoken of as eclipsing the gayety of nations , with no suspicion on the speaker 's part that he is quoting
Johnson	PERSON	's allusion to the death of
Garrick	PERSON	.

		Of course it is his life and personality , as transmitted to posterity by the faithfulest of biographers , that we cherish ; and the influence of his character will long outlast his writings .

		The bicentennial cere - monies began at
Litchfield	LOCATION	,
September 15	DATE	, with the formal opening , by
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	, of a Johnson memorial exhibition , followed on the next day by a lecture from Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	, and in due course by the
Johnson	PERSON	anniversary supper and a special ser - vice in the cathedral .

		A more elaborate commemo - rative dinner in
London	LOCATION	is planned for
October	DATE	, when Mr.
Thomas Seccombe	PERSON	, Prior of the
Johnson Club	ORGANIZATION	, will act as toastniaster .

		An exhibition of Johnsoniana at the British Museum is also among the possibilities .

		In the publishing world , a bicen - tenary edition of
Johnson	PERSON	's poems , with an intro - duction by Mr.
William Watson	PERSON	, is promised by Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	, who also brings out a tempting volume entitled '' Dr.

		Caustic criticism of the English censor of plays has of late enjoyed free vent in connection with the sittings of the
Parliamentary Commission	ORGANIZATION	appointed to consider the functions of that worthy guardian of stage morality .

		Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, leading the attack , pelts the unhappy Mr.
Redford	PERSON	with characteristic epigrams .

		The censor seems to the author of u Man and Superman '' to be a sort of anarchist : law is what one expects to get from a magistrate , but from the censor of plays one gets only the chaos of that official 's mind . ''

		The more the censorship is improved , '' is Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's lament , '' the more it will stop the immoral play , which from my point of view is the only play worth writing ... I am a conscientiously immoral writer '' -- from which assertion it was later developed that by '' im - moral '' was meant nothing worse than u uncustom - ary . ''

		Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	, another outspoken critic of the censorship , is reported as affirming that u the censor keeps serious drama down to the level of his own intelligence , and does not even pretend to keep the lighter drama up to the level of his own morality . ''

		Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	assails the censor in a terrific example of his well-known involved syntax , and then calms down sufficiently to add , in plain language : '' We rub our eyes , we writers , accustomed to freedom in all other walks , to think that the cause has still to be argued in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		Ought we to rejoice or to mourn that we have in
America	LOCATION	no offi - cial censor over whom to make merry and to wax epigrammatically sarcastic ?

		The vogue of the old-fashioned novel shows signs of revival .

		After an over-abundance of quick - lunch fiction , and the mental dyspepsia such hastily - gobbled fare is apt to produce , the leisurely many - course dinner -- the orderly romance divided and subdivided into parts and books and chapters , and proceeding from proem to climax and from climax to conclusion with something of the unhasting slow - ness of life itself -- is a welcome relief and a restful change .

		Not yet have we in this country or
England	LOCATION	reverted to the novel issued in monthly or quarterly parts , after the manner of
Dickens	PERSON	's and
Thackeray	PERSON	's longer stories ; but in
France	LOCATION	one of the literary successes of the past few years has been
M. Romain Rolland	PERSON	's ``
Jean Christophe	PERSON	, '' now in its seventh volume and in the third year of its instalment pub - lication , with no sign of satiety on its readers ' part .

		Long novels are not lacking in current English and American fiction , such as Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	's deliberately-moving tales and some of Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	's and Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's books ; but our publishers are wary about issuing them in any but the single - volume form .

		The prevalent English views and ten - dencies in this matter are discussed very pertinently elsewhere in this issue by our
London	LOCATION	correspondent , Mr.
Clement K. Shorter	PERSON	, whose letters are hereafter to form a regular feature of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	.

		Choosing books for a public library is pleasant work for the choosers , but their wisdom is sure to be sharply challenged if the library con - cerned is situated in any wide-awake and independent community .

		More difficult still is it to select books , not for any particular public library , but for the average or the typical or the ideal public library .

		The annual ' • Best Books of the Year '' issued by the
New York State Library	ORGANIZATION	-- the exact title of the current number is `` A Selection from the Best Books of
1908	DATE	'' -- illustrates the impossibility of suiting all tastes in what is partly at least a question of taste .

		224 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, A list of 250 of last year 's books , marked in such wise as to indicate their several degrees of import - ance for the large , the medium , and the small public library , has been drawn up by the book board of the
New York State Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		In any such list it is easy enough to point out noteworthy omissions and com - missions , so to speak .

		Messrs.
Chesterton	PERSON	and
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	are both coldly excluded .

		Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's '' Realities and Ideals '' receives no mention .

		Dr.
W. Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	's ``
Ian Maclaren	PERSON	'' fails to appear .

		Even Captain
Amundsen	PERSON	's '' Northwest Passage '' is not deemed of sufficient importance to have a place in the list .


Christina Rossetti	PERSON	's `` Letters '' and Dr.
Schouler	PERSON	's '' Ideals of the Republic '' are also among the slighted .

		On the other hand , we have '' The Cat and the Canary '' and '' Anne of Green Gables '' -- and so we will not yet despair of the republic .

		... The usefulness of the newspaper beading - boom in libbabies is seriously questioned .

		Such a room is more than likely to be pretty well filled at all hours of the day and evening , especially the latter ; but what class of readers are found there , and what lasting or even momentary good are they deriving from their attendance ?

		A little mental and emotional titillation , perhaps , from the perusal of the reported crimes and casualties of the last twenty-four hours ; a little rest , in many cases , from the rigors of less comfortable loafing elsewhere ; a little slumber , it may be , as the head bows in ap - parent study over the capacious sheet ; and now and then a chance to chat surreptitiously , and to the greater or less annoyance of near neighbors , with an old crony .

		To better uses than these , no doubt , a few serious readers do put the room and its read - ing matter ; but hear for a moment what has been the
Brooklyn Public Library	ORGANIZATION	's experience after withdrawing or curtailing these newspaper privi - leges . ''

		On account of the large increase in attend - ance in the Periodical and Newspaper Reading Room the Chief Librarian recommended to the Trustees that the daily papers be no longer placed on open file .

		This was carried into effect , and , to the surprise of many , there has been practically no complaint on the part of the public , but instead an expression of satisfaction at the change .

		There has been a noticeable increase in women readers . ''

		As a means of raising the standard of reading , and also of readers , this simple and economic move has its commendable aspect .

		The
Globe Playhouse of Shakespeabe	ORGANIZATION	's
London	LOCATION	has long been a thing of history and tradi - tion only , and its site is now occupied by a brewery .

		On the 8th of this month a memorial tablet , to mark as nearly as possible the site of the old theatre , said to be the first built in
London	LOCATION	, will be unveiled by Sir
Herbert Beerbohm	PERSON	Tree .

		The
Shakespeare Reading Society	ORGANIZATION	, of which the eminent actor is president , took the initiative in
this matter eighteen months ago	DATE	.

		Dr.
William Martin	PERSON	, F.S.A. , has designed the tablet , which shows in relief Bankside in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's time , the Globe Playhouse occupy - ing a central position , with the Thames and
London	LOCATION	Bridge in the background , and a medallion bust of Shakespeare in one corner of the tablet .

		The inscrip - tion reads : u Here stood the
Globe Playhouse of Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, 1598-1613 .

		Commemorated by the
Shakespeare Reading Society	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	and by subscribers in the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	and
India	LOCATION	. ''

		Destroyed by fire in
1613	DATE	, the theatre was rebuilt in
1614	DATE	, and it is this second structure that is com - monly associated with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's name although he had nothing to do with it .

		The mural tablet will be affixed to the wall facing Park Street .

		The libbabian 's complex duties are far re - moved , in their range and variety and increasing difficulty , from the old-time conception of them as consisting merely in the careful custody of a collec - tion of books , the occasional loan of a desired volume , and the checking of the record when it is returned .

		A single paragraph from the latest
Brooklyn	LOCATION	Public Library Report will convey a hint of what modern librarianship means .

		Of the branch libraries we read : '' The area which each branch library is sup - posed to serve is being studied from a sociological point of view ; statistics of population , nationality , religion , wealth , congestion of population , public schools , labor unions , fraternal organizations , etc. , are being compiled .

		Note is being made of classes of the community which the library does not reach ; of classes of literature in which the branch appears to be weak , or overstocked : of means that have been found efficacious in extending the influence of the library , and of plans that have not met with success . ''

		The
Brooklyn Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, one of the largest and most active in the country , has now twenty-five branches , including the five new Carnegie buildings added last year , four stations , and one library for the blind , and four hundred and sixty-five travelling libraries .

		, .

		.

		A pbodigiously pbolific stoby-wbiteb for boys and , between whiles , for adults has laid down his busy pen forever .

		George
Manville Fenn	PERSON	, who died recently in his seventy-ninth year , was a veri - table prodigy for fertility of imagination and literary productiveness .

		His stories for boys and novels for older readers numbered well over a hundred ; prob - ably he himself could not have told how many he had written .

		He also contributed more than a thousand short tales and sketches to the magazines .

		With
George A. Henty	PERSON	, the boys ' historical novelist , he shared the favor of the book-reading youngsters of his own country , and to a large extent of ours also .

		They had the confidence of parents as safe guides for their boys through the enchanted land of heroic adventure .

		And now that the two
Georges	PERSON	are gone , who can fill their places with their sorrowing readers ?

		No one , of course ; but other favorites will arise for other generations , and the store of innocent enjoyment in wholesome and hearty juvenile fiction

		A poet 's romance that is just now attracting the attention of those who are fond of happily-ending love-stories comes to our notice from across the

Adeline Maureen Pring	PERSON	, of
Howth	LOCATION	,

		Thus has the author of `` The Year of Shame '' given additional expression to his interest in and sympathy for

LONDON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		The whole book-trade of
England	LOCATION	has been very considerably agitated during the past three months by the question of the six-shilling novel and its future .

		It has long been insisted that for this country the sum of six shillings was too much to pay for a work of fiction that might be read in a few hours .

		It is true , of course , that not many years ago new novels were published here at five times the price , -- that is to say , in three volumes for thirty-one shillings sixpence .

		That system of three volumes had much to be said for it : the full story of the rise and growth of the three-volume novel has never been told .

		* '' Waverley , '' for example , the first great popular novel of the
last century	DATE	, was only in two volumes .

		Some of Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	's romances appeared in three volumes , and others in four volumes .

		Thackeray 's `` Vanity Fair , '' after it had been issued in parts , came out in one volume , although ''
Esmond	PERSON	'' appeared in two .

		Dickens 's novels , as we know , usually appeared in monthly parts .

		It was nearer our own day that the three-volume novel became an institution , and all book-collectors con - sider themselves happy if they possess certain of the novels of
George Eliot	PERSON	, the
Brontes	LOCATION	, George * The story of its rise and growth , and of its
fall	DATE	, was told very entertainingly by Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	in The Dial for

		--
Edr	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Dial .

		Meredith , and , more recently , of Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	and Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, in the three-volume form of their first editions .

		But before its final ex - tinction , the three-volume novel , although it was delightful for reviewers on account of its large type , had become an encumbrance to the booksellers and a burden to the libraries .

		It survived , apparently , because the late Mr.
Charles Edward Mudie	PERSON	, who ran the greatest circulating library in
London	LOCATION	, had entered into a compact with three publishers of many novels in their day .

		--
Tinsley	ORGANIZATION	,
Bentley	LOCATION	, and
Hurst & Blackett	ORGANIZATION	, -- by which he undertook to subscribe for a certain number of the novels issued by these firms .

		This arrangement considerably handicapped many of the younger publishing houses ; and it was Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	who gave a death-blow to the system , by the publication of a novel of Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	's in the six-shilling form .

		Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	has been destined , in this present year , to lead yet another movement in the direction of change , with what final result it is not possible at present to speak with any certainty .

		A few months ago Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	, in a speech addressed to book - sellers , declared that it was obviously unfair that a novel of forty thousand words should be sold at the same price as a novel of one hundred thousand words .

		Therein he gave a hint of a scheme that he was about to put into practice .

		There is no doubt that the custom of producing novels of few words for the same price as long novels was having a demoralizing effect on the book-trade .

		The worst examples that I can recall are a story by Miss
Olive Schreiner	PERSON	, and another by Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	This last , I may add , was issued as a six-shilling book in spite of a protest from the author .

		Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	, then , has launched his new scheme ; and again Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	is the hero .

		His latest novel , '' The White Prophet , '' which consists of one hundred thousand words , has been issued in two volumes for four shillings .

		Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	has followed this by two short novels , in single vol - umes , at two shillings each .

		In a few weeks we are to have , in the same series , Mr.
William De Morgan	PERSON	's '' It Never Can Happen Again , '' in two volumes , for six shillings net , -- this being a story of two hun - dred thousand words or more .

		As our booksellers are to get six shillings net for Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	's book , instead of the four shillings sixpence for which they usually sell a six-shilling novel , Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	will do very well if he sells as many copies as under the old system .

		So far , this second attempt at a revolution has not succeeded with the purchasers of fiction .

		Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	's novel '' The White Prophet , '' is '' hanging fire . ''

		As far as I can gather , thirty thousand copies were sold to the English market , and ten thousand to the colonies ; but inquiries among booksellers make it clear to me that the public have not shown their usual alacrity in purchasing Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	's book .

		This has been attributed in some quarters to a dislike of the two - volume form ; in others , to the many severe reviews which Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's novel has provoked .

		I am more 226 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, disposed to attribute it to the fact that the novel has appeared serially in the '' Strand Magazine , '' and that Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's readers are , in the main , readers of that excellent publication .

		However , Mr.
Caine	PERSON	has congratulated himself on the fact that , after all , despite the critics -- whom he calls '' dead-heads '' and '' hangers-on '' -- he has sold more copies of his novel in the book-shops during this season than any other author .

		That does not seem a very remark - able fact , for no other author of any importance has published a novel in
August	DATE	or
September	DATE	.

		Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's reference to '' dead-heads '' is doubt - less connected with the `` review copy . ''

		Every
London	LOCATION	publisher has to give away at least a hun - dred copies of each of his novels , if he wants them to be widely reviewed .

		With other books he can keep the number down to sixty or eighty , and in some cases to forty ; but no publisher would dream of sending out less than a hundred copies of a novel to the multitudinous newspapers of
London	LOCATION	and the Provinces .

		Mr.
Caine	PERSON	has always demanded from his pub - lisher a much more extended generosity than this .

		With one of his earlier books , he sent nine copies to a single newspaper .

		Every member of that journal received a present of one .

		Doubtless he intends to alter this in the future , and I should not be at all surprised if he takes the course that has long been adopted by Miss
Marie Corelli	PERSON	, and refuses with his next novel to send any copies to the newspapers for review .

		Miss Corelli , however , always took care that one or two good reviews of her books should appear .

		I particularly recall that
Lord Burnham	PERSON	received a copy , with a request for a notice in the '' Daily Telegraph , '' and that the notice was forth - coming .

		At the present time , when Miss
Corelli	ORGANIZATION	publishes a new novel several of the newspapers buy copies in order to furnish their readers with reviews .

		It may be admitted that Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	is one of the fortunate writers who can do precisely what is done by
Miss Corelli	ORGANIZATION	.

		Both novelists appeal to a huge non-literary class , and are not under the same conditions that guide the great majority of our authors struggling to obtain a public .

		Were pub - lishers to refuse to send books for review as a general practice , the authors -- and particularly the male authors -- would become frantically hysterical .

		I have referred to Mr.
William De Morgan	PERSON	's new novel , '' It Never Can Happen Again . ''

		Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	is a wonderful man , a little bit like the late Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	in appearance , with a kindly face and keen piercing eyes .

		He is a de - lightful talker , and enjoys the success which has come to him so late in life , -- for he was sixty-seven years of age when his first novel , ''
Joseph Vance	PERSON	, '' appeared .

		He had b ^ en an artist in a particular kind of tile during the intervening years , and had led a life of much happiness , although , perhaps , not of too much prosperity , alternating between a studio in
The Vale	LOCATION	,
Chelsea	LOCATION	, opposite the home which Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	once occupied , and
Florence	LOCATION	, where he wintered for his health year by year , until the day Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	published ``
Joseph Vance	PERSON	. ''

		The book , had only been submitted to one previous pub - lisher ; so even here he was fortunate .

		Each of his three novels , so far , have been great successes , in spite of their extraordinary length .

		Will the fourth novel be as successful in two volumes as the three others have been in one ?

		is the question .

		I hope so , on many grounds ; for I think Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	's two-volume form is very charming .

		Meanwhile it is worthy of notice that there are more six-shilling novels coming out this season than ever before .

		The
Macmillans	ORGANIZATION	, the Methuens , all our leading publishers of fiction , are sending them out in large quantities .

		A number of new pub - lishers have come upon the scene , and these also are running the six-shilling novel .

		One firm , named
Mills & Boon	ORGANIZATION	, has sent me a great many lately ; while another publisher , Mr.
Andrew Melrose	PERSON	, has delighted me with one particular story , '' The Wood -
Carver	PERSON	of ` Lympus , '' by
Mary E. Waller	PERSON	.

		Mr.
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	and Mr.
A. E. W. Mason	PERSON	have been spending some time together among the Swiss mountains at
Zermatt	LOCATION	.

		Whether or not this means collaboration in a new play , I can not say .

		So far , Mr.
Mason	PERSON	has not had any of Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	's won - derful success as a playwright , although his novels have grown in popularity with the years .

		Three of our most popular novelists have just finished new stories .

		Mr. and Mrs.
Egerton Castle	ORGANIZATION	are calling their next novel '' The Panther 's Cub , '' while Mr.
Anthony Hope	PERSON	entitles his `` The Second String . ''

		Mr.
Anthony Hope	PERSON	has not , I think , been doing as good work lately as in the days when he published that fine romance '' Rupert of Htmtzau , '' and that powerful piece of analysis , '' Quisante . ''

		Let us hope that '' The Second String '' will be of the old quality .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		IN COMMENDATION OF A RECENT NOVEL .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		As far as I have been able to find opportunity to compare my own judgments of current literary produc - tions with those of The Dial , I have usually felt much comforted by a general correspondence .

		When I have had any disagreement , it has been that The Dial is inclined to generosity in its judgments .

		This , however , is not only agreeable to readers but safe for the critic , since it is far better that a contemporary should think too well of companions than that posterity should con - clude that one thought too ill of them .

		But in the last issue of The Dial I find an opinion of a recent novel that seems to me not only incorrect in the measure assigned according to scale but also unfair in the scale employed .

		To this novel , '' A Cer - tain Rich Man , '' is accorded the first mention in a series of reviews .

		I read that novel carefully more than a month ago , and I have been reflecting upon it ever since .

		Your reviewer has seemed unable to get out of bis mind two facts , with which he chooses to handicap the
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL • 227 author .

		He insists upon remembering that
William Allen White	PERSON	has written boys ' stories , and therefore credits him with much success in treating the early life of the hero ; and he insists upon remembering that Mr.
White	PERSON	is also a publicist , deeply concerned with the modern trend in political and economic matters , and somewhat pessimistic in his utterances .

		In consequence , the reviewer seems to suggest that the novelist is juve - nile and even naive , sensational and even denunciatory , in his representation of the grown man .

		Let me confess that upon opening the novel I expected to find it as the reviewer says it is .

		I intended to read it in an evening .

		But I did not find it superficial or sensational , juvenile or narrow .

		I spent a week reading and re-reading it , and still think the time well employed .

		The great novelist sits like a justice in court , atten - tive , silent , in white ermine ; and he means to see things as they are .

		When , in his final deliverance , the novelist makes the reader feel that he would be glad to have such an eye see what is good in himself and such a voice tell it , but sorry to have him note and report what is evil , the novelist has succeeded , for he has con - vinced his reader .

		Such is the impression made upon myself by the author in this instance .

		No mere maga - zinist can do this , though the power to do it should not be a disqualification for magazine - writing !

		Probably if
John Barclay	PERSON	is a caricature the novel will ultimately fail .

		In a general way , it reminds one of ■ Vanity Fair '' and of '' The Rise of
Silas Lapham	PERSON	. ''

		It spreads a broad canvas and paints many figures upon that canvas ; professional critics may say that it paints too many .

		But at the same time it does attempt to tell every phase of the process by which
John Barclay	PERSON	, thinking that he rose , actually fell .

		It may be that many intimate relations with persons of great wealth -- by blood and circumstance -- have caused qualities in themselves and events in their affairs to seem natural to me that seem unnatural to persons who have not had this fate .

		Yet it is just at this point that I most heartily approve of the portraiture of the `` certain rich man . ''

		The novelist does not fall into the demagoguery of asserting or even suggesting that
John Barclay	PERSON	is the typical rich man .

		I can put my finger now upon men whose characters and careers have been notably h '' e his .

		I have seen souls shrivel as his shrivelled .

		I have seen fortunes made in the same tricky , absurd , painful and yet proud way ; and 1 have seen rich men with hobbies bike
John	PERSON	's organ-playing , and in their senescence converted as he was .

		And yet I concede that if in a year or two public opinion in respect to this novel calls John improbable , then the novel may prove , like so many others , apparently ephe - meral .

		If so , it will be for two reasons : that the American reading public does not know some of its rich men , and fails to see how much larger is the novel than a simple life-story of one man .

		Even so , I believe that '' A Certain Rich Man '' will soon or late come to permanence for a great quality inadequately emphasized by your reviewer .

		There is a sweet purity in its women and in some of its men that is true to human nature at its best , the kind of human nature that of right belongs in novels .

		Whether we live in such fashion ourselves or not , we admire and love most of the lesser folks in this history .

		The Culpep - pers are not new , but they are charming .

		The mother of
John Barclay	PERSON	has a Greek quality of aloofness and of supremacy .

		Unfortunately , few modern novelists care to present these beautiful and gracious characters .

		The reviewer suggests that there are some dull pages in this book .

		So they may be discovered in
Hawthorne	LOCATION	and in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	.

		There are traces of artificiality at times , but that is a fault to be shared with
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	.

		One does sometimes hear a sound as of '' pumping , '' and it is disagreeable .

		But
George Eliot	PERSON	worked hard for some effects in ways that are still audible . ''

		There is none perfect '' is as true to-day as it was yesterday .

		Homer himself nods .

		It seems to me that the American reading public will take this book seriously and declare it one of the greatest novels of our soil .

		I hope so , for I believe that it will do good as a work of art , not merely as a disguised polemic .

		This is only one man 's opinion , but I hold it strongly enough to write it out , and if need be to defend it .

Jenny Daequin	PERSON	, some interesting evidences that the lady considered Me ` rime'e 's letters her own property to an extent that allowed her , as
M. Faguet	PERSON	phrases it , to issue '' quelques petites secondes editions . ''

		Thus , in a letter dated

		Daequin : `` On m ' a prete le pamphlet de men confrere Villemain , qui m ' a paru d'une platitude extraordinaire .

		Faguet and
Lefebvre	PERSON	assure us that such transplanta - tions are numerous in the

		A Latter-Day English Naturalist .

		* For combined intensity and purity of pas - sion ,
Richard Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	has been compared with Shelley ; for originality in observation and expression , and for a certain wayward inde - pendence united with an unmistakably English quality of sentiment and opinion , he has been likened to
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	.

		But these compari - sons are of little help ; like all men of genius ,
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	is unique , and to be understood he must be studied in
Ins	ORGANIZATION	own books and in his recorded habits and pursuits .

		Such a study of him , more elaborate and sympathetic than has before been undertaken , has now been made by Mr.
Edward Thomas	PERSON	in his '' Richard Jefferies : His Life and Work , '' a substantial octavo , well illustrated , and pro- vided with a bibliography , a map , and an index .

		As a biography , and also a critical study , the book has merits which neither Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	's '' Eulogy '' nor Mr.
Salt	PERSON	's excellent study of the naturalist possesses .

		In short , this new life of
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	is not super - fluous .

		There was oddity if not genius on both sides of the
Jefferies	PERSON	family : the father is called '' a funny-tempered man , full of unexpected likes and dislikes , '' and the mother is described as '' generous , but irritable and queer . ''

		The elder
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	was fond of horticulture and floricul - ture , and was an adept in judging timber , whether felled or standing ; while his wife was noted for her excellent butter and cheese .

		It was on the small farm managed by this able couple , at
Coate	ORGANIZATION	, parish of
Chisledon	LOCATION	, in
Wiltshire	LOCATION	, that
John Richard Jefferies	PERSON	-LRB- who in manhood called himself simply Richard Jefferies -RRB- was born on the sixth of
November , 1848	DATE	.

		His schooling , at
Swindon	LOCATION	and elsewhere near home , was cut rather short by the necessity or the advisability of his earning his own living .

		At seventeen we find him doing hack-work for the 44
North Wilts Herald	ORGANIZATION	, '' -- '' reporting , correct - ing manuscript and proofs , with a spice of reviewing and an unlimited amount of conden - sation . ''

		Thus he described his journalistic duties in a letter to an aunt .

		He wrote verses , too , with some music in them , and love stories distinguished , as the biographer says , for '' much facility and exuberance of trashiness . ''

		literary undertakings , historical and antiquarian essays and novels , followed in a few years ; and then came those rural sketches , contributed to various
London	LOCATION	periodicals , which were after - ward collected into volumes and now constitute the work for which chiefly he is known and admired .

		At about the age of twenty-seven he began to find himself , and the would-be novelist became gradually transformed into the student and interpreter of nature .

		Before he became absorbed in the book of nature , young
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	was a great reader of printed books .

		Percy 's '' Reliques of Ancient Poetry '' was a favorite of his when he was fifteen , and there were at
Coate Farm	ORGANIZATION	many other old books accessible to him , and many more at his grandfather 's house in
Swindon	LOCATION	.

		The '' Odyssey '' was much read by him in trans - lation ; also ''
Don Quixote	PERSON	, ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's poems , and
Filmore	PERSON	's '' Faust . ''

		An old Ency - clopaedia was a mine of wealth , and it often lay open before him , especially at the article on
Magic	ORGANIZATION	.

		Strangely enough , White 's '' Stlborne '' remained unknown to him until near the end of his life .

		Here let us introduce the biographer 's picture of young
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	in his fretful days of ferment and vague desire . ''

		But however bitter the days of poverty , loneliness , misunderstanding , and constraint , the time when he was sixteen and seventeen had probably as great sweetness as bitterness , since the two go together in their extremes at least as much at that as at any other age .

		They say that , though he often carried his gun , he was less and less fond of shooting after he was fifteen or so .

		Yet he would still bring home a snipe on a frosty day , or a jay 's wing in the
spring	DATE	from
Burderop	LOCATION	.

		He hung about on stiles by
Maxell and Great Maxell	ORGANIZATION	fields , on the footpath to
Badbury Lane	ORGANIZATION	, or by the brooks , or on the Reservoir , or on the Downs , and dreamed and thought .

		With his finger on the trigger , he `` hesitated , dropped the barrel , and watched the beautiful bird , ' and • that watching so often stayed the shot that at last it grew to be a habit . ' ''

		The sensuousness of his ardent nature was free from grossness .

		An early passage in the biog - raphy calls attention to his delicacy of taste and sensibility . ''

		`` The Story of My Heart , ' ■ The Dewy
Morn	PERSON	, ' and all his later books , are full of proofs of his exquisite physical sensitiveness ; but the physical was always akin to the spiritual as the flower to the perfume .

		His tastes were delicate .

		He smoked little ; and he was a small drinker , taking not even a glass of porter for his dinner unless his reporting had been heavy .

		His sense of touch seems to have a soul of its own .

		To touch the lichened bark of a tree was to repeat his prayer for deeper soul - life ... The spirit exalted this sensuousness ; the senses preserved the sweetness of the spirit In another nature , senses so opulent , especially if aided by an im -
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 229 perfect love , might have wrought their own destruction .

		But in Jefferies the senses perform always and only the functions of the sold , and the purity of his passion equals its fearlessness in whatever swoons and energies time may bring . ''

		The meaning of the last clause is a little obscure ; and the biographer still remains tantalizingly vague when he goes on to illustrate the courage and spirit that went with this exquisite delicacy , by telling of a long fight the young man had with a soldier , in which '' he held his own ; but as they were shaking hands at the end , his enemy struck a treacherous blow that sent him home with a broken nose . ''

		However , there are other and better evidences in his life-story that
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	was no molly-coddle , and our liking for his books and himself need be dimin - ished by no want of respect for his sturdiness of character .

		In
1874	DATE	Jefferies was married to Miss
Jessie Baden	PERSON	, of
Day House Farm	ORGANIZATION	, and the two lived for a short time at the
Coate	PERSON	homestead , then for two years at
Swindon	LOCATION	, and after that on the outskirts of
London	LOCATION	, where the open fields and the green woods were not too far away , and the publishers , the bookshops , and the libraries were sufficiently near .

		Here may be given a part of our natu - ralist 's doctrine of right living , as put into the mouth of his M Gamekeeper at Home . '' ''

		• It 's indoors , sir , as kills half the people ; being indoors three parts of the day , and next to that taking too much drink and vittals .

		Eating 's as bad as drinking ; and there ai n't nothing like fresh air and the smell of the woods .

		You should come out here in the
spring	DATE	, when the oak timber is throwed -LRB- because , you see , the sap be rising , and the bark strips then -RRB- , and just sit down on a stick fresh peeled -- I means a trunk , you know -- and sniff up the scent of that there oak bark .

		It goes right down your throat , and preserves your lungs as the tan do leather .

		And I 've heard say as folk who work in the tan yards never have no illness .

		There 's always a smell from the trees , dead or living .

		1 could tell what wood a log was in the dark by my nose ; and the air is better where the woods be .

		The ladies up in the great house sometimes goes out into the fir planta - tions -- the turpentine scents strong , you see -- and they say it 's good for the chest ; but , bless you , you must live in it .

		People go abroad , I 'm told , to live in the pine forests to cure 'em : I say these here oaks have got every bit as much good in that way . ' ''

		Besides the book just quoted from , mention must be made of those other '' country books '' that constitute
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	's best claim to remem - brance , -- ' • Wild Life in a
Southern County	LOCATION	, '' * ' The Amateur Poacher , '' '' Round About a Great Estate , ' - h Nature Near
London	LOCATION	, '' M The Life of the Fields , '' `` The Open Air . ''

		and the posthumous '' Field and Hedgerow . ''

		In auto - biographic value '' The Story of My Heart '' comes first , while M The Dewy Morn '' and '' Be vis : the Story of a Boy '' afford insight into the writer 's mind and heart .

		The struggle with incurable disease during the last six years of
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	's life , and his early death in
1887	DATE	, make a sad story .

		Why this man of the open air and the fresh fields , of high thought and noble purpose , should have fallen a victim to the foul malignancy of an abdominal abscess , is one of the baffling mys - teries .

		The persistency with which he held him - self to his work , dictating to his wife when he could no longer hold a pen , is touching to read about , and was wholly worthy of him .

		But the regret grows that he could not have been spared to the present time -- he would be only sixty - one if he were alive now -- when he might well be doing his best work and writing from a wealth of experience and observation that would make even the best of his now extant productions seem of inferior quality .

		Faults of irrelevancy and carelessness and repetition might have been cor - rected , occasional dulness avoided , and a more unflagging human interest imparted to his page .

		From Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	's closing chapter , containing a recapitulation of the life and work of
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	, we select a final quotation . ''

		He enjoyed , simply and passionately , his own life and the life of others , and in his books that enjoyment survives , and their sincerity and variety keep , and will keep , them alive ; for akin to , and part of , bis gift of love was his power of using words .

		Nothing is more mysterious than this power , along with the kindred powers of artist and musician .

		It is the supreme proof , above beauty , physical strength , intelligence , that a man or woman lives ...
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	' words , it has been well said , are like a glassy covering of the things described .

		But they are often more than that : the things are for - gotten , and it is an aspect of them , a recreation of them , a finer development of them , which endures in the written words . ''

		This , and more like it , is a bit fantastical and forced , and it illustrates Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	's chief fault as exhibited in his book : he is not seldom vague and fanciful and obscure , and one doubts whether he always clearly knows what he is try - ing to say .

		But much could easily be pardoned in so good a biography as he has given us .

		In the appended Bibliography , space might well have been spared for last year 's English and American republication -LRB- with colored plates -RRB- of '' The Open Air '' and '' The Life of the Fields , '' especially as some other reprints are noted .

		Among the portraits in Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	's book are three of
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	, two of his father , two of his mother , and one of his paternal grand - mother -- all full of character .

		230 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, On the Spiraeity of the Cosmos .

		* The ponderous work on '' Design in Nature , '' by Dr.
J. Bell Pettigrew	PERSON	, is probably the most extensive and serious single contribution to humorous literature which has appeared in recent years .

		It stands unique at this day and age .

		To find its peers , in respect of both matter and manner , one must go back to the period when the '' Bridgewater Treatises '' flour - ished .

		For the task which the author sets him - self is no less than '' to trace design , order , and purpose in the inorganic and organic king - doms , especially the latter . ''

		In order to do this he gathers together in the space of some 1400 well-printed quarto pages , elaborately illus - trated with about
2000	DATE	pictures , a most extra - ordinary collection of miscellaneous intellectual junk .

		One passes with absolutely no logical con - necting links from the morphology of protozoa to a discussion of methods of artificially produc - ing electricity ; from the distribution of seeds to the movements of the stomach ; from water - spouts to
Kant	PERSON	's Kritik and Greek archaeology ; and so on indefinitely .

		As an example of the possibilities in the way of the inclusion in one book of a great range of absolutely unrelated topics , it leaves
Disraeli	PERSON	's '' Curiosities of Liter - ature '' far behind , and presses close on the dic - tionary and the encyclopaedia .

		In his reasoning the author is naive to a de - gree .

		He confuses absolutely definiteness of structure with '' design . ''

		To him anything which has a definite structure is by virtue of that fact proof of `` design '' in the theological sense of the word .

		Since most things in the universe do have a definite form and structure , the wonder really is not that our author devoted three quarto volumes to illustrations in support of his thesis , but rather that he did not find it necessary to use thrice thirty-three .

		In partic - ular , Dr.
Pettigrew	PERSON	was impressed by the uni - versality of spirals in the cosmos .

		You have them -LRB- to take some of the illustrations given -RRB- in waterspouts and whales , goats and gizzards , moths and men , and in a vast variety of other things inorganic and organic .

		Whence we are to conclude that spirality is a divine inspiration , and that we have here a proof of design .

		♦ Design in
Nature	ORGANIZATION	.

		Illustrated by Spiral and other Arrangements in the Inorganic and Organic Kingdoms as exemplified in Matter ,
Force	ORGANIZATION	, Life , Growth , Rhythms , etc. , especially in Crystals , Plants , and Animals .

Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The utter absurdity of this spiral philosophy is evident if the author 's general method of reasoning is stripped of all unnecessary verbiage and set forth in a series of simple propositions in the directly personal style cultivated through - out the book .

		Thus we have : 1 .

		In the inorganic world many things have a spiral form or structure -LRB- proved by pages of text and illustrations -RRB- .

		2 .

		Many plants and animals show a spiral form or structure in some of their parts or organs -LRB- likewise proved by copious illustration in text and figures -RRB- .

		3 .

		When you think about this apparent coincidence it seems very remarkable , -- now doesn t it , really ?

		4 .

		The longer I -LRB- the author -RRB- think about it , the more remarkable it seems , and the less a coincidence .

		In fact , I feel it to be a very deep and precious thought , quite beyond the ability of my mind to fathom .

		5 .

		Therefore -- laus Deo !

		-- it is not a coincidence , but a direct proof that Evolution is a snare and a delusion , and that nothing in the universe can '' be explained as apart from pre - arrangement , design and a Designer . ''

		Such a method of argumentation takes one back to the good old days when a similar kind of reasoning was able to '' prove '' that the sun moved in an earth-centred orbit .

		It is as mediaeval as any cathedral .

		Seriously , it is a matter for sincere thankful - ness that the time is forever past when such a book as this can exert any significant influence on the thought or action of men .

		Mankind is perhaps more truly and deeply religious to-day than ever before .

		But men are educated , too .

		It is not demanded any more that to consort with Religion one must forswear Reason .

		One can only have respect for the enormous amount of labor that must have gone into the prepara - tion of these volumes ; they represent nearly a life-time 's work .

		Yet at the same time one can - not but feel it a pity that this labor should have been so largely wasted , because of an entire misconception on the author 's part of what has been the effect on human thought , and on the outlook of men on life , of the tremendous advance of science during the last fifty years .

		The day has passed when anyone can persuade men to a belief in a Higher Power by arguing that the Creator shows His infinite wisdom by fashioning men and corkscrews on the same plan .

		THE DIAL 231 The
Domestic Life of Richard	ORGANIZATION	``
Wagner	PERSON	.

		* Mr.
Houston Stewart Chamberlain	PERSON	, in his remarkable book on the Life and Works of
Wagner	PERSON	, divides that life into two equal parts .


Wagner	PERSON	was born in
1813	DATE	, during the agitations accompanying the close of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's stormy career ; when that sun set , a new one arose in a more extended and beneficent sphere .

		He died in
1883	DATE	, having attained his three-score and ten in the full vigor of his powers .

		Men are now generally agreed that M Parsifal '' shows no decline of creative energy or artistic skill .

		Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	considers his first thirty-five years as his Lehrjahre ; his Meisters ` hqft fills the remainder of his allotted span ; his Wander period is an irregular and interrupted time , which terminates with the definite settlement at
Bayreuth	LOCATION	.

		Wagner himself is authority for the state - ment that a man of exceptional abilities should not marry young ; and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is seem - ingly of the opinion that '' a young man married is a young man marred . ''


Wagner	PERSON	was united in wedlock to
Christine Wilhelmina Planer	PERSON	, an actress , in
1836	DATE	, when he was twenty-three years old ; she was probably a few years his senior .

		She seems to have been an admirable woman enough , and while she had various stage engage - ments she never reached any real distinction in her art .

		Her early opportunities for educa - tion were limited , and her intellectual develop - ment quickly reached the line beyond which she refused to go .

		She was not of a sympa - thetic disposition , and she had nothing of the diplomacy which is capable of transforming a difficult situation into a triumph of her own cause .

		The case is a sufficiently clear one .


Wagner	PERSON	, the exceptional man of his place and period , has an exceptional law and method of intellectual development .

		The wife , with the best of inten - tions , is unable to keep the pace ; she at length falls hopelessly behind , and her pain and dis - appointment fail of the alleviation which they demand .

		His letters to her show the husband in an habitual mood of amiably meeting various complaints , pacifying evident distress , attempt - ing to come to terms wherever possible .

		The trouble was not one that could permanently be allayed ; on the contrary , the passage of the years could only augment it .

		Wilhelmina belonged to those who found the New Opera beyond their * Richakd to Mm * Wagxer .

		comprehension , and she allowed her appreciation of her husband 's life-work to wane ; he makes heroic attempts to bring her peace , but the gulf between them only widens .

		With conditions such as these , the inevitable of course enters on the scene .

		The controversy that raged about the composer brought him partisans whose loyalty intensified with the prog - ress of the contest .

		Wagner himself had no doubts about his position and purposes ; the bitter utterances found in his letters are thus to be explained .

		In comparison with the extra - ordinary idea of the opera which dominated
Wagner	PERSON	, the work of his contemporaries appeared to him in many ways a degradation of the art .

		His innovations penetrated into all the departments of music .

		He was also the first great man to prove himself great in both music and drama .

		His plays , as such , are distinct additions to stage literature of the first rank .

		During his years of struggle and misunderstand - ing , he needed friends and helpers ; he found them , and he grappled them to himself with hooks of steel .

		The influence that now makes itself vital in the composer 's experience differs toto coelo from that of ''
Minna '' Wagner	PERSON	, the wife ; more and more , as the letters show , the serious intentions of
Wagner	PERSON	are omitted from his communications with her .

		The indications of decreasing sym - pathy are plain .

		With
Mathilde Wesondonck	PERSON	, however , the exact reverse is the fact .

		During his life at
Zurich	LOCATION	,
Wagner	PERSON	had met the
Weson	PERSON	- doncks , and a close intimacy ensued ;
Mathilde Wesondonck	PERSON	, a writer of plays and poems , enjoying the wealth and distinction which her husband had given her , became the friend of the great musician , and entered deeply into his labors and intentions .

		The contrast between the letters written to the two women is very great .

		Living habitually on the same plain with the composer , associating intimately with him in his artistic and intellectual pursuits ,
Frau Wesondonck	PERSON	understood his genius and foresaw his ultimate triumph .

		Mr.
Ashton Ellis	PERSON	, the translator of the newly-published letters of
Wagner	PERSON	to his wife
Minna	PERSON	, has strong words to say on the dignity and purity of this friendship .

		Into `` W agner 's enlarging theory of his work , into his many and vigorous defences of his innova - tions , into his readings in philosophy , his ab - sorption in the views of
Schopenhauer	LOCATION	, where his wife wholly lost sight of him ,
Mathilde Wesondonck	PERSON	entered as a guide and mentor , and , with a woman 's swift intuition , was often at the goal before
Wagner	PERSON	found himself there .

		232 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, The situation was no doubt critical , and
Minna Wagner	PERSON	had but little capability for dealing with it .

		The wife died in
1866	DATE	; but before that time the rupture with her husband was complete .

		Meanwhile ,
Wagner	PERSON	had passed into a period of spiritual revolt .

		The pessimism of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, the study of Oriental Mysticism with its denial of the reality of the world , the profound -LRB- at first -RRB- appreciation of Wagner by Nietsche , led to the consequences which were naturally to be expected .

		The Superman lives in a realm that is beyond morals ; the conventions and scruples that limit other men are not for him .


Wagner	PERSON	had his reasons for placing himself with the Zoroasters and Napoleons of the world .

		The relation with
Cosima Wagner	PERSON	, however , did not begin until after the death of
Minna	LOCATION	; and it terminated institutionally , which was in conso - nance with the life at
Bayreuth	LOCATION	, and the serene close of a checkered career .

		The letters of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	constitute a history of his intellectual life astonishing and unique .

		No one has more freely expressed him - self in this form .

		The letters to
Minna	LOCATION	show him in the intimate relations of the family ; the letters to
Mathilde Wesondonck	PERSON	display his hopes , his aspirations , the highest flights of his intelligence ; the letters to Liszt his artistic strivings and theories ; those to
Uhligand Fischer	PERSON	and
Heine	PERSON	, his vicissitudes and conflicts and triumphs as a musician .

		The exceptional man , the genius ahead of his time , the builder of the next advance , can here be studied in his own words and at close range .

		Here are human documents of inestimable value .

		The letters often exhibit
Wagner	PERSON	in moods of gayety , and they are full of expressions of affection .

		This is from
Dresden	LOCATION	: `` That 's just the waj !

		I have been obliged to sus - pend writing a whole day ; but you know it of old ... Lindenau called again , and the
Rottorf	PERSON	, who greatly dislikes my being disturbed when at work , mistook the Premier Minister for a vagabond , and denied me to him ; the poor man had to depart , leaving behind him a couple of lines , in which he begged me to call on him as soon as possible .

		The
Rottorf	PERSON	was frightened out of her wits when she learnt that it had been the Minister ; whilst I had to dress and make off to him myself .

		He had shown my composition to the
King	PERSON	, and the latter had sat down to the piano at once , played it straight through , and expressed his great delight with it ... '' If you could only see me in my lovely
summer	DATE	cos - tume !

		It 's a perfect joy ; only I made a bad choice with the violet gloves , for when I pulled them off for the first time , and was pointing with my finger on the bill of fare , the waiter bounded back in horror for my whole hand looked just like a gigantic violet , the gloves had shed their dye so . ''

		Here is a skit written on his birthday : '' ' T was in the lovely month of
May	DATE	, That Richard
Wagner	PERSON	burst his shell ; Therein had he prolonged his stay His best friends think it were as well . ''

		The nature of the difficulty between the hus - band and '' wife is indicated by the following : '' When I came home profoundly vexed and agitated by some new annoyance , a fresh mortification , another failure , what did my wife bestow on me in lieu of com - fort and uplifting sympathy ?

		Reproaches , fresh re - proaches , nothing save reproaches !

		Homekeeping by nature , I remained in the house for it all ; but at last , no no longer to express myself , convey my thoughts , and receive invigoration , but to hold my tongue , let my trouble eat into my soul , and be -- alone !

		This eternal restraint under which I had lived so long already , and which never allowed me to let myself quite go , on one side , without occasioning the fiercest scenes , weighed me down and wore away my health .

		What is the bodily tending you by all means lavished on me against the mental needed for a man of my inner excitableness ?

		Does my wife remember , perhaps , how coldly she once prevailed upon herself to nurse me on a bed of sickness a whole week without affection , because she could not forgive me a hasty expression before my illness ? ''

		A series of concerts which he conducted in
London	LOCATION	gave him little satisfaction .

		About this he writes as follows , in his bitterness against conditions in the world of music there : '' The concert itself put me out to the last degree .

		I ca n't go into everything that annoyed me at it ; enough to say , the one thing lacking is that I should have to conduct '
Martha	PERSON	' again ; such a programme came very near it .

		While conducting an aria from the ' Huguenots ' and a miserable overture by Onslow -- an Englishman -- I was seized by such disgust and remorse , that it got the better of me , and I made up my mind to demand my definite discharge next day . ''

		His friends dissuaded him , over a supper , from this step .

		He tells his wife this , and continues : '' So be easy about me ; I sha n't have so severe an attack of the dumps again , I hope .

		But it was the most idiotic concert of them all ; a mawkish symphony by one of the directors ; then a fearfully tedious nonett by
Spohr	PERSON	; a completely insignificant overture by
Weber	PERSON	, which -- to make things worse -- had to be give da capo , as I had conducted it too finely ; to conclude , the trashy overture by Onslow .

		Neither did the symphony in A go so well as at
Zurich	LOCATION	by a long way ; such an English orchestra simply is not to be worked into an ecstasy ! ''


Wagner	PERSON	, in a Preface to a publication of his plays -- the Flying Dutchman ,
Tannhaeuser	LOCATION	,
Lohengrin	LOCATION	, -- had made some frank statements in regard to his early marriage , to which
Minna Wagner	PERSON	, perhaps naturally , objected .

		He thus defends himself : '' Now see , dear child , when I wished to give people a notion of the genesis of my works , and consequently of my psychological development , I could not pass over such a momentous crisis in my life as that which attaches to our union , without remaining unintelligible .

		It would have been foolish and entirely opposed to my real object , if I had sought to narrate our love-tale at full
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 233 length ; all I required was just a few brief strokes to indicate an episode of some importance , which , for that matter , occurs in the life of many , nay , of most men , and need be only briefly touched because one presup - poses that everyone knows well enough what here is meant ; to wit , the necessary consequences of a youthful marriage contracted at the behest of passion , without calm consideration of outer circumstances , against all obstacles and objections raised by that practical common - sense which foresees trouble . ''

		Of the translation of these letters , made by Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	, nothing but good can be said ; it is of course what we have a right to expect from so practised a hand .

		Occasionally the translator attempts the , exact reproduction of a German idiom in his English , with the result of leaving the reader who is unacquainted with the foreign tongue in doubt as to what is meant .

		In his own notes and prefaces he seems to attach the blame -- if this is at all to be suggested -- to the wife in greater degree than to the husband ; but here every reader must come to his own conclusions .

		Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	has done heroic work in presenting
Wagner	PERSON	to the English-speaking public ; he has made a rendering of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's elaborate writings in prose , he has reproduced the voluminous and accepted Life by
Glasenapp	ORGANIZATION	, he has translated the various volumes of letters already published , and he promises a volume of the familiar letters to
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's blood relatives .

		His prefaces and notes are illuminating read - ing ; his discipleship is tempered by a sense of historical proportion , and with varied sympathy for the many conflicting interests involved .

		The students of
Wagner	PERSON	must count him among the chief of those who , like Glasenapp ,
Muncker	ORGANIZATION	,
Wolzogen	LOCATION	,
Tappert	PERSON	,
Chamberlain	PERSON	, have done their best to report the Master aright to posterity .

		The publishers have made two fine volumes , with interesting portraits .

		The books contain what is needed to make their reading easy and profitable to the scholar .

		Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	has just forwarded to Messrs.
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	, for use in their forthcoming complete subscription edition of her works , an interesting introduction to '' The History of
David Grieve	PERSON	. ''

		The scenes of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's norels are almost all taken from actual places which the author has known and loved .

		Thus , a visit to a farm on the Kinderscout furnished the material for the opening chapter of ``
David Grieve	PERSON	, '' a season spent at
Hampden House	ORGANIZATION	in
Buckinghamshire	LOCATION	gave the original of Mellor Park in ''

		From Arctic Ice to
Irish Summer	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Although the recent achievements claimed by
Cook	ORGANIZATION	and
Peary	PERSON	have thrown the exploits of other Arctic explorers into temporary eclipse , there is room for such a book as '' Conquering the Arctic Ice , '' by Mr.
Ejnar Mikkelsen	PERSON	, one of the most recent of Arctic voyagers , whose story now appears for the first time in print He and
Ernest de Koven Leffenwell	PERSON	were on the first
Baldwin	PERSON	-
Ziegler	PERSON	expedi - tion in
1901	DATE	, and at that time resolved to organize an expediton of their own .

		Various difficulties , how - ever , prevented their carrying out their plans until
1905	DATE	.

		In that year these young men , assisted finan - cially by many friends -- notably the Duchess of
Bedford	LOCATION	, the father of Mr.
Leffenwell	PERSON	, the
Royal Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	, and the American Geograph - ical Society -- fitted out a small ship , and in
1906	DATE	started northward to prove or disprove the theory that land existed north of
Alaska	LOCATION	, and to explore
Beaufort Sea	LOCATION	.

		In the
spring of 1907	DATE	, after the wrecking of their ship the u Duchess of Bedford '' during the previous hard winter , they organized an extended ice-trip which partly attained the object of their search .

		Having ascertained that the deep water close to the Alaskan coast precluded any land to the northward , at least not within such a distance of the coast as could be reached with dogs and sledges over the pack-ice , the author , hard driven by many accidents , returned to civilization by way of
Alaska	LOCATION	, fairly satisfied with the results of his strenuous efforts .

		His companion remained in the North to pursue further scientific studies .

		Mr.
Mikkelsen	PERSON	's sledge journey of three thousand miles is said to be the longest ever made by an explorer .

		His story is simply and modestly told , and will be read with interest especially for its account of the natives whose characters and customs he had abundant opportun - ities to study .

		Those who are in the habit of regarding these natives as a low type of savages will do well to turn to Mr.
Mikkelsen	PERSON	for enlightment , A large number of illustrations , many of them made from photographs taken by members of this party , add to the interest and verity of the work .

		234 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, entitled his book on
Alaska	LOCATION	a '' Handbook . ''

		It is a handbook in so far as it gives in a condensed way the widely scattered and reliable data concerning our far northwestern possessions ; but it is more than a compilation , for it has the enlivening and absorbing interest that comes from a first-hand observation of the land described .

		General Greely is peculiarly fitted to write just such a book .

		His extensive experience and travel in
Alaska	LOCATION	make him almost our sole authority on the diverse conditions existing there .

		He has made six visits to
Alaska	LOCATION	, has twice traversed the great
Yukon Valley	ORGANIZATION	, visiting Fairbanks and Prince
William Sound	PERSON	twice , and
Nome	LOCATION	thrice .

		Moreover , as the highest military commander on two occasions , and as the supervisor of the
Alaskan Military Telegraph System	ORGANIZATION	of 4500 miles of land lines , with submarine cables and wireless stations , he has had unusual opportunities to gather data of his own , and to weigh the information gathered by other scientists and tourists .

		Hence there is an accuracy in his details about the resources , products , and attractions of
Alaska	LOCATION	, and an illuminating touch in his descriptions of the aspects of social , industrial , educational , commercial , political , and agricultural life there .

		Twenty-seven chapters of text , eight maps showing
Alaska	LOCATION	in relief , with views of the timber lands , the mining districts , and the ranges of the larger Alaskan animals , and twenty-four full - page illustrations from unusually good photographs , present
Alaska	LOCATION	in all its varied aspects .

		There is hardly a page that will not enlighten the reader , and there are few that will not surprise him with some novel information .

		How many persons know , for instance , that
Alaska	LOCATION	is not arctic in its climate ?

		The extremes of latitude and longitude in
Alaska	LOCATION	find their parallel in
Europe	LOCATION	between
Norway	LOCATION	and
Sicily	LOCATION	and from western
France	LOCATION	to central
Russia	LOCATION	.

		It is interesting to note , too , that the coldest month of the year at
Sitka	LOCATION	-LRB- 31.4 degrees -RRB- closely corre - ponds with the coldest month of
St. Louis	LOCATION	-LRB- 31.6 degrees -RRB- .

		But it has not always been so .

		`` The rigors of the past climate are strikingly illustrated by the great depths to which the ground is frozen .

		In the
Nome	LOCATION	region a shaft has been sunk 120 feet without reaching ground free from frost , and near
Dawson	PERSON	the earth was found frozen to a depth of 200 feet . ''

		General
Greely	PERSON	has performed a task , in writing this handbook , that will be of great ser - vice to tourists and prospectors , and will do much to remove our general ignorance about
Alaska	LOCATION	.

		Miss
Elizabeth Bisland	ORGANIZATION	and Miss
Anne Hoyt	PERSON	, masquerading as u Jane '' and '' Peripatetica , '' went to
Sicily	LOCATION	as seekers for the dead body of a great civilization , using their Theocritus oftener than their
Baedeker	PERSON	, and waiting in the cold springtime for the coming of Persephone `` laden with leaves and flowers and the waving corn . ''

		Every step they took stirred up wraiths of myths and history , and reminded them of Proteus rising from the sea , and of old
Triton	ORGANIZATION	blowing his wreathed horn .

		The theatrical scenery of
Taormina	LOCATION	, the bones and stones of
Syracuse	LOCATION	, the temples of ancient
Girgenti	PERSON	, '' the nicest place '' in
Sicily	LOCATION	, and the land of Goethe 's '' das Land , wo die Citronen bliih ` n , ''
Palermo	PERSON	, were visited in turn , -- not in the Cook-dug channel manner , but in the leisurely fashion that befits the well-read and curi - ously inclined traveller .

		In many places in their charming book , u Seekers in
Sicily	LOCATION	, '' the authors strike the true Pagan note , though they are not always inclined to believe all they see and hear .

		The ear of Dionysius , for instance , is tested for them by their guide in large and vibrant tones ; but when they try the '' whispering ear '' in flat American tones , the echo fails .

		When they have proved the power of the wonderful ear by using a staccato voice ,
Peripatetica	LOCATION	reflects , after the manner of Words - worth , '' that one has to address life like that if one is to get a clear reply -- to address it crisply , definitely , with quick inflections .

		Level , flat indefin - iteness will awake no echoes . ''

		Thus seriousness and playfulness go together in this happy visit to the fields of old renown , and provide a very readable book of travel .

		A unique feature of the book is the designs upon the cover and at the heads of chapters .

		Each design is some tribal totem of the original inhabitants of
Sicily	LOCATION	, which are still considered tokens of good luck .

		To readers who are inclined to associate books on
Greece	LOCATION	with ruins , excavations , inscriptions , and monuments ,
Miss Mabel Moore	PERSON	's volume entitled '' Days in Hellas '' will be a pleasing surprise .

		Miss
Moore	PERSON	finds
Greece	LOCATION	a lively place in the midst of ancient glory .

		With a kindly feeling toward modern
Greece	LOCATION	, and a reverential respect for the past , the author views that land with a curious com - mingling of the ancient and the present times .

		Mount Pentelcos , for instance , is seen with its `` twice-scarred brow , '' the one scar caused by the emissaries of
Pericles	LOCATION	, the makers of the
Parthenon	LOCATION	, and the other scar made by '' Al armor Limited , '' a modern company engaged in supplying the world with Pentelic marble .

		The delineation of Greek character leaves little to be wished for , in spite of the modest statement in the author 's preface that `` the present volume is not offered in any sense as a study of Greek life or Greek character . ''

		Aliss Aloore has satisfied us that the lay reader who enjoys a medley of Greek life , with its gods and heroes mixed with its modern aspects , more than he does a treatise on archaeology , will find pleasure in this charming book .

		Mr.
Edward Hutton	PERSON	, the author of '' In Unknown Tuscany , '' and his friend Air .


William Heywood	PERSON	who annotated the book , are , according to
Air	ORGANIZATION	.

		Hutton , very different in temperament and had very different intentions in visiting Mont ` Aminta in
Central Italy	LOCATION	.

		For
Air	ORGANIZATION	.

		Heywood , '' the fact was everything ; for me it was little compared with the right expression of what I myself felt and saw . ''

		Hence Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	dreams his dreams and sees his visions of the extra - ordinary beauty of the land , while Mr.
Heywood	PERSON	, out of his abundant knowledge of Sienese history , gives a base and a substance to the book by way of noting the more prosaic historical facts .

		Legendary
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 235 lore , villa life , feudalistic tales and fanatical fictions , all of which abound in
Tuscany	LOCATION	-- a land which few know well and none can comprehend -- appeal to the author , who recounts his story in a style more graceful and easeful than is usually found in books of travel .

		Tuscany is a desolate land , says the author , but it `` possesses a marvellous and virile beauty beyond almost any other part of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		How well we have loved and understood the almost femi - nine loveliness of
Umbria	LOCATION	, for instance , or the laughing country about
Florence	LOCATION	, the lines of the hills there as expressive as in a picture by
Sandro Botticelli	PERSON	... Here alone we may find , if we will , something of the profound and passionate beauty of
Castile	LOCATION	, the virility of the desert , the mystery and tyranny of the sun . ''

		Of the ways of the people of the mountains , Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	writes in a manner that makes the reader for the time a traveller in unknown realms ; and when the book closes with the life - history of
David Lazzaretti	PERSON	, the new Messiah , the reader is prone to believe in all that has been written of the martyr of Mont ` Aininta and to dis - regard all the cold facts recorded by historians and note-makers .

		Eight color and twenty-four monotone illustrations afford a sympathetic undertone for the book .

		Notwithstanding
Henri Beyle	PERSON	's statement that `` la belle Touraine riexiste pas '' that
Touraine	PERSON	is a mere figment of the brain -LRB- a disparagement which can only be matched by a similar paradoxical assertion about Yarrow by
Wordsworth	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr.
Frederic Lees	PERSON	and a companion found a tangible though evan - escent Touraine that furnished an enjoyable
summer	DATE	for them , and provided Mr.
Lees	PERSON	with sufficient ma - terial , historical , legendary , picturesque , and archi - tectural , for his very charming book entitled `` A Summer in Touraine . ''

		Few travel books afford more pleasant entertainment than this delightful sketch of sojourns among the castles and chateaux of
Central France	LOCATION	.

		Blood-stained
Blois	LOCATION	.

		royal
Amboise	LOCATION	, treasonable Loches ,
Chinon	ORGANIZATION	,
Luynes	LOCATION	, Tours , and stainless
Chenonceaux	LOCATION	, with its tales of
Diana of Poitiers	ORGANIZATION	,
Mary Stuart	PERSON	,
Gabrielle	PERSON	and
Francoise de Mercoeur	PERSON	, of youth and love and poetry , are among the many places visited and described .

		Even the old story of the treasure of
Monti	PERSON	e ` sor is retold in a fascinating way .

		Though the author in his preface says that the initial purpose of his book is to pro- vide '' intellectual baggage '' for tho '' e who purpose to travel in the Indre-etrLoire and the adjoining departments of
France	LOCATION	, we can not permit him to classify his book as a mere guide-book .

		Yet anyone who wishes to read up on the splendid old buildings of the Touraine district , and wishes to know how to make the trip by motor-car or otherwise , will find the volume of unusual interest and value .

		The fire - side traveller too will find that Mr.
Lees	PERSON	's account is so accurate and vivid , and his style so pleasing , that he can travel con amove with the author .

		Twelve illustrations in color , over fourscore other illustra - tion * , and an excellent map , enhance the beauty and usefulness of the volume .

		Mr.
Stephen Gwynn	PERSON	is well known for his several worthy literary activities and for his keen interest in all that pertains to
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		Of his own native
Donegal	LOCATION	he has written charmingly , almost poeti - cally ; and hence one reads the title of his latest book , `` A Holiday in
Connemara	LOCATION	'' with pleasurable anticipations .

		As a member of the Royal Com - mission , Mr.
Gwynn	PERSON	went to
Iar Connacht	ORGANIZATION	to gather facts for a detailed statistical account of the eco - nomic and social conditions of the most congested part of
Ireland	LOCATION	; but he spent many hours following the streams for fish and the byways for ancient lore .

		Hence his book gives us a medley of land-lore , folk - lore , and fishing-lore , with a dash here and there of economic wisdom .

		It is not unlikely that the author considered it unwise to write too fully of the actual conditions of the country , as information on that subject will be presented to
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	in a more prosaic form .

		Two salient points are made by Mr.
Gwynn	PERSON	, however , regarding the conditions in this lamentably poverty-stricken district .

		First , remit - tances from
America	LOCATION	chiefly suffice to keep the inhabitants above ground ; and secondly , a sweeping redistribution of the population must be made before
Ireland	LOCATION	will thrive .

		Had Mr.
Gwynn	PERSON	written more chapters like those on M
Killary	PERSON	and Loug na Fooey , '' '' Sunset on Killary , '' '' On the Shores of Lough Mask , '' and ' * Iorras Mor , '' he would have enter - tained the reader with his truer talent -- the power of vivid description .

		For in this picturesque though melancholy country the people are more picturesque than in most parts of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		The illustrations in the book are well chosen , and typical of the land and the people .

		Another book on
Ireland	LOCATION	, dealing with the eco - nomic rather than the picturesque features of the country , is given us by Mr.
William Eleroy Curtis	PERSON	, the well-known traveller and correspondent .

		In the
summer of 1908	DATE	Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	visited
Ireland	LOCATION	at the instance of a syndicate of American newspapers to investigate the economic evolution going on in that land of poverty and happiness , and now publishes the results of his observations in his book entitled '' One Irish Summer . ''

		Unlike many writers who are called upon to deal with the dry facts of the `` dismal science '' of economics , Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	has the faculty of making statistics and formal information assume a not unpleasing aspect .

		Moreover , he is so well-informed on his subject from an historical point of view , and has so thoroughly assimilated his knowledge , that he is by no means dependent on dry facts and figures to give light and warmth to his discussions .

		Though the study of the redemp - tion of the people from poverty is Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	's pri - mary theme , he is not amiss in studying
Ireland	LOCATION	as a land of story and humor , of beauty and pleasure , and of native traits and customs .

		His three months in the country appear to have furnished him abund - ant opportunity for going everywhere and writing about everything likely to interest the student of Irish affairs , or the casual trifler who lands at
Queenstown	LOCATION	and scurries round to
Cork	ORGANIZATION	,
Killarney	LOCATION	, 236 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	,
Dublin	LOCATION	,
Belfast	LOCATION	, the

		No one who has ever vis - ited the
Green Isle	ORGANIZATION	will be disappointed in reading this book , and no one who contemplates a visit there can find a better introduction to it .

		Recent Fiction .

		* Unhappily named and ungainly in appearance , filling nearly six hundred pages of close typography , opening in a way that promises to tax the reader 's endurance , and concerned from beginning to end with mean or commonplace characters , not one of whom is tricked out with the attributes that are com - monly thought necessary to arouse sympathy and retain interest , '' The Old Wives ' Tale , '' by Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	, is nevertheless a remarkable work of fiction , a book of such sincerity , truthfulness , and insight as to make the ordinary novel seem hope - lessly shallow and artificial by comparison .

		Coming to us unheralded in the slack season , it proves to be the most significant novel of the
summer	DATE	, and prob - ably of a much longer period .

		The
Staffordshire	LOCATION	i town of
Bursley	LOCATION	, typical of the provincial life of mid-England , is the place , and the time is the stretch of years from the middle to the
end of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		The stage-setting puts before our eyes a draper 's shop in the central square of the town , and here our attention remains fixed , save for the single shifting of the scenery which gives us
Paris	LOCATION	for a contrast .

		The proprietor of the shop is a bed-ridden paralytic ; his wife is a masterful person who directs the business with the help of Mr.
Povey	PERSON	, the shop - assistant , and a dependency of ansemic virgins .

		There are two daughters in the household , children when the story opens , old women toward the close , and it is with the history of their lives that the book has to do .

		Constance , the elder , marries Mr.
Povey	PERSON	, and in due course , the parents having died , takes over the management of the business , is widowed in middle life , and left with an idolized son who is nowise persuaded to follow in the footsteps of his ancestors , but developes strange modern tastes and propensities .

		Sophia , the younger daughter , has a more checkered career .

		Unlike her meek and self - effacing sister , she has a passionate nature that impels her to a disastrous adventure .

		The cheap charms of a commercial traveller engage her girlish fancy ; she carries on a clandestine correspondence with him , and finally elopes .

		less wealth , and the eloping couple go to
London	LOCATION	, with
Paris	LOCATION	as their final objective .

		Marriage is no part of his plan , but he is forced into it by
Sophia	LOCATION	's obstinate refusal to go any farther than
London	LOCATION	ex - cept with a legally constituted husband .

		Several years of pleasure-seeking follow ; then , on the eve of the Franco-Prussian war , he is at the end of his resources , and deserts his wife , who has long since lost all her illusions .

		She has a long and serious illness , through which she is nursed by a kind-hearted creature -- a woman of the half-world -- whose charge she has accidentally become .

		After her recovery she undertakes the management of a pension , and maintains it successfully during the months of the sipge and the commune .

		Frugality and practical good sense -- the inheritance of her stock -- serve her in this crisis ; her affairs prosper , she enlarges her operations , and when her health gives way in middle age , she sells her hostelry to a syndicate , and finds herself a woman of leisure with a comfortable for - tune .

		All this time she ' has been dead to
Bursley	PERSON	and her family , but one day the relationship is acci - dentally reestablished , and she goes to
England	LOCATION	to visit her sister , also comfortably retired from busi - ness .

		The visit grows into a stay , and for some ten years the two old women share their old home .

		Then
Sophia	PERSON	learns that her husband is not dead , but is just at the point of ending a wretched and poverty-stricken life ; she hastens to his last refuge , and finds only his dead body .

		She has thought of him only with disgust for many years , but this shock nevertheless proves fatal .

		Constance , now left alone , does not long survive , and the family is ex - tinct , save for her son , whom the world has not taken at his mother 's appraisal , and whose colorless exist - ence makes no appeal to our curiosity .

		Such is the outline of a book which the author describes as '' a novel of life . ''

		This it is in a very exact and human sense .

		Just life , real and un - adorned , a futile affair for all concerned , is what is portrayed in its pages .

		It is life viewed with micro - scopic vision , described with absolute fidelity , dis - torted by no trace of caricature , and commented upon , as we pass from phase to phase , with grave , sardonic , sometimes almost savage , irony .

		There is not a char - acter in the book that is ennobled or glorified by the devices dear to the romantic novelist ; there is no alluring heroine and no conquering hero , there is no indulgence in empty rhetoric , and there is no appar - ent effort to heighten either motive or situation .

		Yet with all this restraint , or perhaps just because of it , the final impression is deep and the resultant force overwhelming .

		As the figures pass before our eyes , and their lives one by one gutter out , we are made to know them better than we know most of the human beings of our actual acquaintance .

		This is true not only of the half dozen chiefly concerned , but also of the minor figures in almost equal degree .

		If we were transported by some magic carpet to mid -
Victorian Bursley	PERSON	, we should have the advantage over their neighbors in our intimate acquaintance with these people .

		THE DIAL 237 stand
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	's men and women , and the great French novelist never shaped more authentic creations .

		The coloring of this novel is hy no means as drab as this or any outline would seem to indicate .

		It is ani - mated and even vivacious , for the most part cheerful in tone and shot through with gleams of humor .

		Its texture is so finely wrought that it is not to be read by leaps and bounds without serious loss .

		It extends to nearly a quarter of a million words , and few of them are superfluous .

		If it be censured for defect of ideality , it must be praised all the more for shrewd - ness , for accuracy of observation , and for the deep note of human sympathy which only the most care - less of readers could miss .

		Moreover , although in its essence it is impressive of the futility of the average life , we gather this message only in our reflective moments of semi-detachment ; we do not brood over it , any more than do the characters themselves .

		To them , life is an affair of ups and downs , no doubt , but it is also too closely packed with immediate inter - ests to permit of their viewing it in broad perspective .

		The author will probably be charged with pessimism , but one has only to contrast his method with that of a genuine pessimist like Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	to realize that the term is hardly elastic enough to cover both cases .

		The readers of Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	's `` Halfway House , '' who made the acquaintance of
John Senhouse	PERSON	in that charming book , will be glad to have further intercourse with him in the pages of u Open Country . ''

		The new book is not , however , a sequel , since its action is placed several years earlier , and it is a little disconcerting , with fresh memories of the romance previously unfolded , to realize that he had previously been entangled in the sentimental complications now revealed .

		He is the same strenuous individualist and apostle of the simple life that we learned to know before , and he flouts conventions with the same reck - less unconcern .

		The young woman in the present case is named
Sanchia	LOCATION	, and 6he proves plastic stuff for his moulding .

		He becomes her accepted guide , philosopher , and friend , and she turns to him in all her perplexities .

		But when he would play the lover also , he discovers that she has put his teachings to such practical purpose that she throws herself into the arms of a very different sort of man , incidentally possessed of an inconvenient wife .

		This does not seem to matter seriously to the emancipated
Sanchia	LOCATION	, and she does not even require him to save appear - ances by obtaining the divorce that might be his for the asking .

		Upon learning what the outcome of his philosophy , thus applied , has been ,
Senhouse	PERSON	once more devotes himself to his self-appointed task of adorning the wa ^ te places of
England	LOCATION	with exotic blooms .

		The author styles this extravagant inven - tion '' a comedy with a sting , '' but having consider - ately told us , in the earlier novel of a later day , how Senhouse found consolation , the ' • sting '' does not do a lasting hurt to our feelings any more than to .

		those of its victim .

		The philosophy of our individ - ualist hero is set forth in his talks with
Sanchia	LOCATION	, and more formally in his letters to her .

		It is always a plausible philosophy , and in many respects a sound one . ''

		He could pare off detail and accident so nearly that the straight bold outline of conduct lay plain to be seen , stretching far and ahead of her like parallel lines of railway over swamps .

		To talk with him was to be taken on to a windy height and shown the world of men mapped out below you , accidentals blurred away , only the salient things sharply defined . ''

		There is more than a bitter kernel of truth in his indictment of our boasted modern civilization .

		• ' If we act individually like maniacs , as I 've been telling you we do , we act in the masses like the hosts of Midian .

		Until war -- to name but one public vice -- is spoken of in the terms we now use to reprobate drunkenness , or gluttony , or the drug-habit , I decline to recognise that we are civilized at all .

		But , so far from that , we devastate the heathen ; we exhaust ourselves in armaments ; we cause the flower of our youth to perish for all-red maps ; we still teach diplomats to lie and politicians to cadge for votes like the street-boys for coppers ; we thieve at large , brag the great year through , bluster , howl at other people pla \ ing games for us ; lift pious hands -LRB- to a heaven we do n't believe in -RRB- at our rival 's enor - mities ; we cant and vapour -- out upon us !

		and what for ?

		For two things only ,
Sanchia	LOCATION	, for two things which are fatal to real civilization -- that money may be easy and that labour may be saved . ''

		This is the substance of
Senhouse	ORGANIZATION	's social philosophy -- an obviously Ruskinian gospel -- and his religious notions are akin to those of
Faust	LOCATION	, piercing to the very emotional root of the whole matter . ''

		Herr Doctor wnrden da katechisirt , '' for Sanchia shares Margaret 's curiosity upon the sub - ject , and her questions evoke from him the lengthiest and soberest of his epistolary confessions .

		`` True Tilda , '' by Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	, is the story of a girl of ten or thereabouts , a child acrobat in a travelling show , and a boy of about the same age , whom she rescues from an orphanage where he is cruelly treated , and carries off with her in a search for his lost father .

		The clues are of the slenderest , and instinct rather than reason keeps them in sight , but they lead to the right spot , which is an island in the
Bristol	LOCATION	channel .

		The wanderings of the two children constitute a veritable Odyssey , leading from
London	LOCATION	to the western sea by canal boats , travelling caravans , and river barges .

		There is a pursuer -- the
Reverend Glasson	PERSON	of the orphanage -- but he is outwitted and outdistanced , and
Tilda	ORGANIZATION	has the satis - faction of uniting her protigS with the parent who had not known of his existence .

		There the story ends , with a hint that something interesting will happen when the children grow up .

		Although a book about children , it is distinctly designed for their elders to read , and is one of the happiest of the author 's whimsical inventions .

		Tilda is a constant joy and refreshment , and her adventures make us acquainted with a great variety of eccentric and amusing people , figured for us as from
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's own world .

		So much humor , entertaining adventure , and unconventional life is not often packed within a single pair of covers .

		Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	Portal Hyatt gave us last year '' The Little Brown Brother , '' a vigorous story of the
Philippines	LOCATION	, displaying considerable acquaintance 238 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, with native life and character , but unfortunately committed to the '' white man 's burden '' theory .

		In '' The End of the Road '' he deals with the '' big black brothers '' of
South Africa	LOCATION	, not without sym - pathy , but from the viewpoint of one who takes it for granted that all means are justifiable which have for their end the replacement of an inferior by a superior civilization .

		Still , the native question is not uppermost in this new novel , for the chief struggle is between two types of white civilization -- the old agricultural type , whether Boer or English , and the new mining and industrial type .

		More briefly stated , it is the struggle between the road and the railroad .

		The hero is a transport rider , one of the pioneers who pushed the road northward toward the
Zambesi	LOCATION	, a man who has lived upon the road most of his life , and who views with distrust the growth of the rail - road and the development of the mining compound .

		He is an Englishman of gentle origin , and meets his fate when a young Englishwoman , an archaeologist 's daughter , comes across his path .

		He follows her to her English home , makes her his wife , and tries to settle down in an English country town .

		But the plan does not make for happiness ; the old Wander - lust seizes upon him , and the story ends , as it began , in
South Africa	LOCATION	, whither the wife has consented to return .

		The story is well worth reading ; its simple plot is effective , and its figures and scenes have reality .

		Modern
Egypt	LOCATION	, with its complicated politics and its cosmopolitan society , offers a tempting theme to the novelist .

		It was exploited a year or so ago by Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	in '' The Weavers , '' which make much of its melodramatic possibilities .

		But for genuine melodrama , which finds no coloring too violent and no situation too absurd , we must award the palm to Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	, whose `` White Prophet '' distances all possible competitors .

		This compound of preposterous politics and sickly sentiment deals with the career of a religious fanatic , who becomes the leader of the forces of Egyptian nationalism , preaches to the astonished ears of Islam a gospel of universal brotherhood -LRB- including the fellowship of Christians -RRB- , and is defeated by treachery when just about to realize his dream of
Egypt	LOCATION	for the Egyptians .

		This fantastic narrative may be imagined as of the past or the future , as the reader pleases .

		Despite his denials , Mr.
Caine	PERSON	has given us figures that must be identified in part with historical characters .

		His consul-general is Lord Cromer with a difference , his '' white prophet '' is a new
Mahdi	PERSON	with something of the old iu his make-up , and his other puppets fre - quently recall men who have been connected with the English occupation .

		But both characters and hap - penings , although separately identifiable , are jumbled in a composite grouping which is the author 's own .

		The probabilities are not for this sensation-monger .

		His heroine is made to seek out the prophet , whom she believes to have slain her father , and actually to marry him that she may learn his secrets and betray him to the government .

		She is to know the slayer by a missing finger , but does not discover that the prophet 's fingers are all on his hands until after she has been his wife for some weeks .

		Nor does he all this time suspect her of being an Englishwoman !

		Really , there are some limits to the credulity of the most guileless of revellers in romantic fiction .

		When the prophet 's plans come to naught , and he discovers his wife 's treachery , he not only forgives her , but divorces her in the summary
Mohammedan	DATE	fashion , in order that she may rejoin her English lover .

		This lover , who is the son of the consul-general , and an army officer of high rank , has so sympathized with the prophet as to disobey orders , assault his superior , and flee from
Cairo	LOCATION	to escape punishment .

		Dis - guised as a Bedouin sheikh , he becomes the prophet 's confidant and special emissary , and upon returning to
Cairo	LOCATION	is taken for the prophet himself , and is nearly executed by the order of his own father .

		His identity discovered , he is court-martialed and sen - tenced to death for insubordination ; an appeal is then made to the clemency of the king , who not only pardons him , but raises him to the chief command of the army in
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		At this juncture , Mr.
Caine	PERSON	considerately calls a halt upon his invention , and we close the book with a gasp .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		Briefs on New Books .

		Readers of Mr.
Brady	PERSON	's '' A Mission - ; i ^ Z / , '' ar - y in the Far Wert '' and Bish ° p
Talbot	PERSON	's '' My People of the Plains '' will enjoy reading the somewhat similarwork entitled '' A Bishop in the Rough '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		John Sheep - shanks , now the Right Reverend , the
Lord Bishop of Norwich	ORGANIZATION	, spent his ` prentice years in laudable missionary work in the great Northwest of
Canada	LOCATION	, visited the land of
Brigham Young	ORGANIZATION	, labored in the Sandwich Islands , in
China	LOCATION	, and elsewhere in
Asia	LOCATION	, and kept , during the years from
1859	DATE	to
1867	DATE	, a journal , which is now edited for publication by the
Reverend D. Wallace Duthie	ORGANIZATION	.

		Both the journalist and the editor have done their literary work well , and the book makes capital reading , -- much better , we fancy , than is usually found in the journals of present-day missionaries .

		Pleasant pictures of our own Western land as it appeared nearly three-score years ago , descriptions of the wild fastnesses of
British Columbia	ORGANIZATION	and of the customs of the unspoilt Sandwich Islanders , and lucid expositions ot the state of
China	LOCATION	when the door was only beginning to swing on its international hinges , are some of the distinctive features of the book .

		However austere the present Bishop of
Norwich	LOCATION	may be , -- and one detects a bit of this quality in his extended preface dealing with the
Established Church	ORGANIZATION	, -- he certainly was not with - out genial humor and breadth of spirit when in his earlier days .

		Probably the most interesting incident in the book is that in which the author , on the invita - invitation of
Brigham Young	ORGANIZATION	, preached in the great Mormon Tabernacle at
Salt Lake City	LOCATION	.

		The scene
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 239 is thus described : '' Next
Sunday	DATE	the Tabernacle was the scene of a singular spectacle .

		Never before or since has an Anglican priest preached to the Assembly of Mormons ; never , perhaps , in the his - tory of the church has one of her ministers testified before a community of heretics .

		Before him were 3000 people , all men , heads of families , mainly from his own country , ' mostly earnest and fanatical , swallowing eagerly the wildest stories and most extravagant doctrines , whatever is put before them by the Prophet and his crew . '

		Behind him on the platform sat the apostles and elders .

		The President 's chair was empty , but as the preacher began to speak he was aware of someone moving near him , and saw
Brigham Young	ORGANIZATION	himself on his knees , pushing a cushion toward his feet , having remembered the custom to use one for kneeling . ''

		John of
Norwich	LOCATION	was doubtless great in spiritual strength in those days , and even in his great age his strength has apparently not diminished .

		His book testifies that he learned the world at first hand , digested his knowledge with gusto and fervor , and that he was able to keep a lively journal which vividly recalls for us the stirring events of his active life .


Three years and a half ago	DATE	, when C JX * # 3L .


Macedonia	LOCATION	was having those lively times that formed a part of the pre - liminaries to much more recent and more momentous events in Turkish history , Mr.
Albert Sonnichsen	PERSON	, scenting blood and gunpowder from afar , made his way into the very heart of the turbulent district , and , donning bandit costume , enjoyed for eight months the intimate acquaintance and comradeship of out - laws .

		`` Confessions of a Macedonian Bandit '' is the title he now gives to the story of his rough-and - tumble experience , and as a picture of people and conditions unfamiliar to most readers the book has decided merits .

		Those who remember the author 's '' Ten Months a Captive among Filipinos '' will find the same readable style in this later narrative , together with more of the pulse-quickening , hair - raising element of dangerous adventure and narrow escape .

		From the last chapter , which contains the bandit 's own story of the memorable capture of Miss Stone , we quote the following indignant outburst from Hristo Tchernopeef , '' the bad man , '' chief of the kidnapping party : '' What greasy hypocrites they are , the smug diplomats and editors and the clergy , with their hanging jowls and rotund bellies !

		Yes , brigands we are .

		They allow our women and small babies to be outraged and slaughtered , and when we ask them for help , only to stop it , in the name of
Christ	LOCATION	, they give us soft , lying words .

		And then , when we give one of their women a few months ' worry and discomfort , which we more than share with her , only to give us the means to save a million women from death , or worse , we are brigands . ''

		As a view of brigandage from the inside , Mr.
Sonnich	PERSON	- sen 's story has elements of novelty and of human interest .

		The pictures , from photographs taken chiefly by himself , one infers , are many and good .

		A lack is felt in the absence of any preliminary or supplementary chapter to acquaint the forgetful or ignorant reader with the political conditions bearing on the narrative , and to explain more clearly how and with what ostensible purpose the writer gained so speedy access to the companionship and confidence of the brigand chiefs .

		Finally , either a glossary defining the local terms used , or a condescending willingness to use English equivalents , would have been appreciated by the plain reader .

		The book is published by
Messrs. Daffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

Svante Arrhenius	PERSON	, Director Speculations ``'' ''`` ■ '' • • r. i i ■ , on the life of of the JNobel institute in
Stockholm	LOCATION	, the
Universe	ORGANIZATION	.

		j s p er haps the foremost theorizer of the present day in the domain of the evolution of the universe .

		His latest work , translated into En - glish by Dr.
H. Boras	PERSON	, with the title , '' The Life of the Universe '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- , is comprised in two coat - pocket volumes , and gives a succinct account of cosmogonic speculations from the earliest ages to the present time .

		The 124 pages of Volume I. treat of the ideas on the origin of the universe which were held by primitive peoples , by ancient civilized nations , by early philosophers -LRB- chiefly Grecian -RRB- , and finally by the group of more modern thinkers up to and including the contemporaries of
Newton	LOCATION	.

		All this is told in an interesting way , though crowded with details .

		The second volume opens with a brief sketch of the theorizing from
Newton	ORGANIZATION	to
Laplace	LOCATION	.

		This period is especially characterized by the subjection of cosmogonic theories to mathe - matical tests .

		While the well-known Laplacian hypothesis of the nebular evolution of our own sys - tem , and -LRB- by inference -RRB- of other systems , was estab - lishing itself to the exclusion of former notions , the science of physics was making wonderful strides .

		The revelations of the spectroscope , the discoveries of radioactivity and of the radiation pressure of light , -- indeed , a mass of modern research in the atomistic domain where physics , chemistry , and biology meet on common ground , -- have led to very considerable modifications of former cosmo - gonic speculations .

		To these modifications Dr.
Arr	PERSON	- henius devotes the bulk of his second volume .

		Such topics as the maintenance of solar radiation , the results of collisions of cosmic bodies , and the origin of life on the
Earth	LOCATION	, are sketchily treated .

		Finally , the author defends himself from the charge that such philosophizing has no practical value , by asserting that the progress of science tends ever to the elevation of humanity and the spread of the principles of universal brotherhood .

		Appreciation When Dr -
Samuel McChord Crothers	PERSON	of a genial writes about Dr.
Oliver Wendell	PERSON	humorist .

		Holmes , he is pretty sure to be worth reading -- even better reading for some of us than Mr.
Gilbert Chesterton	PERSON	on Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Crothers	PERSON	's ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' article on `` The Autocrat and his Fellow-Boarders , '' with the addition of eleven '' selected poems '' -LRB- including , of course , the '' One - 240 THE DIAL -LSB-

Hoss Shay	PERSON	, '' '' The Height of the Ridiculous , '' and '' The Chambered Nautilus '' -RRB- , and a frontispiece portrait of the poet-essayist , forms a neat little volume -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , convenient for the pocket , the hand , and the eyes .

		It takes a thief to catch a thief , and it takes a gentle humorist like Dr.
Crothers	PERSON	to seize upon and set luminously before us the distinctive traits and qualities of that earlier master of gentle humor , the ever-delightful Autocrat .

		Here is one way in which , near the end of his essay , the author characterizes Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	's mind : '' Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	perfected the small stereoscope for hand use .

		The invention was typical of the quality of his own mind .

		The stereoscope is ' an optical instrument for repre - senting in apparent relief and solidity all natural objects by uniting into one image two representa - tions of these objects as seen by each eye separately . '

		The ordinary prosaic statement of fact presents a flat surface .

		The object of thought does not stand out from its own background .

		We look through the eyes of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	and we have a stereoscopic view ... The stereoscopic mind makes an abstract idea seem real . ''

		One further quotation : after pointing out that '' The Autocrat of the Breakfast - Table '' was not easy to write , as no good book is , the author advises the writer who is unusually fluent to `` take warning from the instructions which accompany his fountain-pen : When this pen flows too freely it is a sign that it is nearly empty and should be filled . ''

		Apart from the natural affinity between two cognate minds , Dr.
Crothers	PERSON	may well take an additional interest in
Holmes	PERSON	as the son of a former minister of the
First Church	ORGANIZATION	in Cam - bridge -- the very pulpit now occupied by himself .

		A book holding so much good in so small compass as this centennial study of the Autocrat is not met with every day .

		An uncommon In the old Westphalian city of Her - tvpe of royal ford , there flourished in the days of womanhood .

		fa e Lutheran revolt an ancient con - vent which somehow escaped the common monastic fate of suppression and was made part of the new reformed rhgime .

		Herford was '' protestanized , '' and remained for three centuries longer the refuge of luckless ladies and distressed princesses .

		Among the abbesses of this '' Protestant nunnery '' is num - bered a lady of Stuart blood ,
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, princess
Palatine	LOCATION	, granddaughter of
James I.	PERSON	and maternal aunt of George I .

		The biography of this abbess has recently been written by
Elizabeth Godfrey	PERSON	under the title '' A Sister of Prince Rupert '' -LRB- John Lane -RRB- .

		It is not a stirring story that the author has to tell -- the dramatic element is almost wholly wanting ; still , the story , because of a deep human interest , proves very attractive .

		Like so many of her Stuart kins - folk ,
Elizabeth	PERSON	was not a stranger to adversity : she was born just before her father , the ''
Winter King	PERSON	, '' accepted the fatal Bohemian crown ; her early years were spent in exile in
Brandenburg	LOCATION	and
Holland	LOCATION	; poverty was an almost continuous guest at her mother 's home .

		But , unlike the other Stuarts , she lived her life in comparative freedom from political strife and intrigue ; hers was the quiet life of philo - sophic study and religious contemplation .

		It is this intellectual phase of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	's life and character that the author particularly emphasizes .

		Little space is given to family troubles and dynastic disap - pointments , but much to her friendship for
Descartes	PERSON	and her interest in his philosophic teachings .

		Some attention is also paid to the general question of higher education among women in the
seventeenth century	DATE	.

		As a contribution to history , the biography does not take high rank ; for the Princess
Elizabeth	PERSON	did not accomplish much of enduring value either in the political or in the intellectual field .

		Yet the world can not fail to be interested in a princess who refused to exchange her religious faith for a crown ; who enjoyed the society of '' literary ladies '' ; who patronized Quakers and Quietists .

		As a study of the intellectual currents of the seventeenth century ,
Miss Godfrey	LOCATION	's work has considerable interest ; but most of all it will be appreciated as a faithful and sympathetic picture of an unusual type of royal womanhood .

		In a compact little volume of a hun - # S ™ Sl .

		dred and twenty-five pages , entitled ``
India	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr.
J. Keir Hardie	PERSON	, the Labor leader in the British Par - liament , records the impressions and information gathered by him from a brief sojourn in that per - turbed land .

		The core of the book lies in its views regarding
India	LOCATION	'' before taking and after taking '' British treatment .

		The conclusion is , in the words of
Burke	PERSON	when discussing a similar problem in which the American Colonies were concerned , that '' everything given as a remedy to the public com - plaint has been followed by a heightening of the distemper . ''

		This distemper of the nation , asserts Mr.
Hardie	PERSON	, is now practically beyond the control of the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	, and all because the superimposed Governors have failed to recognise the natural power of the highly-educated natives . ''

		A very little statesmanship , inspired by a very lit - tle sympathetic appreciation of the situation , could easily set things to rights . ''

		When British officials are restrained from acting on official boards of which they are not even members ; when the councils for villages are popularly elected and are held respon - sible for the collection of taxes ; when collectors and other permanent officials are not made chairmen of any boards ; when promotion for the natives from
the Provincial Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	to the
Indian Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	without the red-tape requirement of going to
London	LOCATION	to take the examination for promotion , -- when these reforms are established , says the author , peace and prosperity will come to
India	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Hardie	PERSON	has not , we may say , assimilated all his information gathered in his two months ' stay in
India	LOCATION	, but he has written a book that will interest and instruct everyone who is interested in
Great Britain	LOCATION	's major problem .

Harold Murdock	PERSON	, a
Boston	LOCATION	of the great banker and man of letters , is well Botton fire .

		equipped to rehearse the story of
Boston	LOCATION	's great fire of thirty-seven years ago , and he tells it admirably in epistolary form , naming his book '' 1872 : Letters Written by a Gentleman in

Paris	LOCATION	, Describing the Great Fire . ''

		The volume is issued in a sumptuous limited edition -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- with many illustrations both of
Boston	LOCATION	before the fire and of scenes in the burning or already burnt district .

		The woodcuts and litho - graphs transport the reader to that good old time when
Boston	LOCATION	streets were even more crooked and narrow and tangled than at present ; and the letters , with their skilfully feigned appearance of having been hurriedly written while the ruins were still smoking , maintain the illusion .

		But as Mr.
Mur	PERSON	- dock was only ten years old at the time of the fire , he could hardly have seen and done all that the supposed letter-writer chronicles as his part in the tremendous drama .

		However , there is no attempt to deceive or to mystify .

		The author appends his list of authorities , with other explanatory and illus - trative matter , and one must admire the skill with which he has used his material .

		A sharp contrast with present municipal conditions is revealed in the statement that at the time of the fire u the city fathers were for the most part men of standing and responsibility in the community , and

Bernstein	PERSON	's '' Evolutionary Socialism : A Criticism and Affirmation '' ; the other two are ■ The Substance of Socialism '' and ''
Karl Marx	PERSON	: His Life and Work , '' both by Mr.
John Spargo	PERSON	.

		Popular interest in Mars , aroused by the planet 's recent opposition , makes timely Professor
Percival Lowell	PERSON	's latest book , ■ The Evolution of Worlds . ''

		In this volume , to be published shortly , Professor
Lowell	PERSON	discuf ^ s not only the possibility of human beings living on Mars , but the whole problem of the beginnings of the universe as we see it .

		Dr.
William Edgar Geil	PERSON	, author of '' The Great Wall of
China	LOCATION	, '' announced by the
Sturgis & Walton Com	ORGANIZATION	- pany , is starting upon a new expedition into the interior of
China	LOCATION	, one principal object of his trip being to make 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, a study of the relation of American and European residents in
China	LOCATION	to Chinese life and to international questions and relations .

		Mr.
Maxfield Parrish	PERSON	, one of the most popular of present-day illustrators , has lately made a series of twelve drawings of scenes from the stories of the '' Arabian Nights , '' and they will be published this month in a book called `` The Arabian Nights : Their Best - known Tales , '' edited by Mrs.
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	and Miss
Nora Archibald Smith	PERSON	.

		Miss
Agnes C. Laut	PERSON	's '' Conquest of the Great North - west , '' which has already , in the ten months since its publication , made a considerable reputation for its author , was purchased by Messrs.
Moffat	PERSON	,
Yard & Company	ORGANIZATION	at the sale , last month , of the Outing Com - pany 's publications .

		The author is now engaged in writing a second work , carrying the story from the period thus covered down to measurably modern days .

		Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's much-discussed lecture on that subject of perennial interest to all the world , and on which nearly all the world holds more or less decided opinions , Religion , is published in full in the
October	DATE	number of '' The
Harvard Theological Review	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The amount of vehement denunciation and warm praise that this latest of Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's public utterances has called forth is prob - ably inversely proportional to the accuracy of the critic 's knowledge of what the speaker really said .

		In a pub - lished letter to one of his assailants he mildly remarks : '' I venture to think that the opinion of the lecture which you have formed on the basis of a few inaccurately reported scattered sentences out of an address which took an hour to read , might be modified if you read the full address . ''

		An old subscriber of the
London	LOCATION	'' Athenaeum '' writes to deplore the omission from that sterling literary journal of the
Autumn	DATE	and
Spring	ORGANIZATION	lists of forthcoming books , which he regards of the greatest value in ena - bling readers and students to keep track of the books that are expected in their special fields , as well as affording a survey of all the various forms of literary activities of the approaching book season .

		Readers of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	need not be told how carefully this feature is covered in its pages -- as shown by the extended lists in its preceding and present issues ; but they can have little conception of the labor and care involved in collecting the advance information needed and present - ing it in proper form .

		These lists have long been a regular and distinctive feature of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	, and the appreciation of the public satisfies us that the care and labor are well expended .

		The publishing rights to a number of important books , on the list of The Outing Publishing Company have been acquired by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who will hereafter issue the titles over their imprint .

		These include two books of unusual interest which have not yet been put on the market , -- '' The Conquest of the
Missouri	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Joseph Mills Hanson	PERSON	, and '' Ships and Sailors of Old Salem , '' by Mr.
Ralph D. Paine	PERSON	, which will be issued at once .

		The books already published include Mr.
Clarence E. Mulford	PERSON	's two stories , '' Bar 20 '' and '' The Orphan . ''

		Mr.
Ralph D. Paine	PERSON	's '' Greater America '' and `` The Stroke Oar , ''
Zane Grey	PERSON	's `` The Last of the Plainsmen , '' Mr.
Dillon Wallace	PERSON	's '' The Long Labrador Trail , '' and two practical books ,
Sando	PERSON	's '' American Poultry Culture '' and
Massey	PERSON	's '' Practical Farming . ''

		Messrs.
McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have also recently acquired the publishing rights in Mrs.
Katherine Yates	PERSON	's well-known
Christian Science	ORGANIZATION	stories for children .

		Announcements of Fall , Books .

		The length of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	's annual list of books announced for full publication , contained in our last -LRB-
Sept. 16	DATE	-RRB- issue , made it necessary to carry over until the present number the following entries , com - prising the full Educational and Juvenile announce - ments of the season .

		`` A powerful novel on a great subject . ''

		--
Philadelphia	LOCATION	In - quirer .

		The work of one of the greatest modern English novelist .

		Its vivid theme is that situation involving two men and one woman which some one has aptly called `` the eternal triangle . ''

		From the first page the reader realizes that he is in the hands of an author of notablepower , and he yields to the full measure of the entertainment that the author provides .

		The development of the story is unexpected , and it glows with the dramatic fire of a true masterpiece . ''

		It is masterly , a really profound study of motive and char - acter .

		Like '
Tess	PERSON	of the D'Urbervilles , ' it deals boldly with the problems of passion , and may offend in this way , but , like that book also , it is essentially dramatic , a searching exposition of human nature under the stress of conflicting emotions . ''

		-- The Outlook . ''

		Possessing that quality of interestingness indispensable to a good story , ' Trespass ' has something more ; it goes deeply into the great soul of a man to whom nature has denied a great body or even a great ambition , yet to whom she has given the opportunity to prove himself one of the few lovers that have ever existed in the world whose love can withstand every shock , even to the faithlessness of the loved one .

		It is brilliantly written , with an analysis of character so keen that the very souls of the three who dominate the book are laid bare .

		The characters are no drawing-room puppets , but real men and women .

		NOTES 290 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 290 THE REVIVAL OF PAGEANTRY .

		The academic suburb of
Chicago	LOCATION	known by the name of
Evanston	LOCATION	has not hitherto been thought of as a focus of romantic possibilities .

		Known far and wide as a community in which sober and godly lives are led , as a university town in which the student of divinity tempers by his decorous example the riotous instincts of the normal barbarian collegian , as a burgh propped by the moral bulwarks of prohibition and Methodism ,
Evanston	LOCATION	has long been the symbol of the prosaic and the pedestrian .

		It is true that a pestilent beast popularly styled the '' blind pig '' -LRB- Sus ccbcus -RRB- has been thought to infest its obscurer regions , and has even , report says , been tracked to its lair by expeditions of zealous zoologists ; but all this may be only a fable , devised by those malicious minds that are always impelled to detraction by the spectacle of the upright and the exemplary .

		But the
Evanston	LOCATION	of these latter days has taken on a riot of color and spectacular effect that has made its more staid inhabitants rub their eyes with wonder at this unprecedented blossoming of artistic fancy .

		To speak plainly , there has been revealed in those parts a pageant of the historical
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, judiciously mingled with devices for enticing shy coins from their hiding-places -LRB- in the sweet name of charity -RRB- , and graciously countenanced and even abetted by the best suburban society .

		Already the modest town is being styled the American
Bayreuth	LOCATION	, and is bearing its new honors with the proud conscious - ness that they have been deserved .

		In the matters of picturesque stage-setting and poetical effect , the pageant has been in the capable hands of Mr.
Donald Robertson	PERSON	and Mr.
Thomas Wood Stevens	PERSON	, whose quality in this sort was exhibited last
spring	DATE	when the Renaissance pageant was given at the
Art Institute of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such poetry as Mr.
Stevens	PERSON	knows how to write for an affair like this , recited with Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's art , goes far toward redeeming the inevitable amateurishness of such a performance .

		Nor is material lacking in the history of the great
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		We are the heirs of a romantic tradition which begins with the French seekers for the
South Sea	LOCATION	, goes on with the dissolving view of a French trans - formed into an English civilization , includes 272 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, the heroic exploit of
George Rogers Clark	ORGANIZATION	, and comes down to things as diversely interesting as the Blackhawk War and the Wigwam that made the fortunes of President Lincoln .

		A sequence that includes , besides
Clark	PERSON	and Lincoln , such men as
Marquette	LOCATION	,
La Salle	LOCATION	,
Tonty	LOCATION	, and
Pontiac	LOCATION	, that makes us acquainted with explorers and saints , with the heroes of both military and civic life , is anything but poverty-stricken in its ap - ' peal to the imagination .

		How admirably Mr.
Stevens	PERSON	has put his ma - terial to poetic use may be illustrated by the following quotation : '' Peaceful the Black-Gown came , we welcomed him .

		He taught his faith ; we listened and we loved , For he was patient , brave , and kind .

		He lives In drowsy annals of our winter nights .

		But those who followed in the Black-Gown 's trail Brought harsher magic and a hopeless war .

		Seeking the paths that we had never trod They searched the blue horizons for some grim And desolate issue to forbidden seas ; They spoke to us of mysteries , shoulder-wise As they with tireless footsteps hastened on .

		La Salle , and Tonty of the Iron Hand , Great Captains in this idle paleface quest , Came hither long ago , and claimed the ground For some old king beyond the sunrise .

		These Were strong-heart men , these finders of the way Who hunted the great rivers to their ends , -- Stern foes , whom fear could never shake .

		Behold Wan children of the sheltered lodges , these Who faced the mystery with dauntless eyes And trod our trails out with intrepid feet , The Captains of the white man 's outer march . ''

		The
Evanston	LOCATION	pageant has been , of course , but a small affair in comparison with the recent doings on the
Hudson River	LOCATION	and
Lake Cham	LOCATION	- plain , or with last year 's superb commemoration of the founding of
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		But it has its place in the series of recent demonstrations that have sought to realize the past for a generation which seems suddenly to have been aroused to the consciousness that the American past is by no means contemptible from the romantic point of view .

		The annals of early
America	LOCATION	have seemed dull only because their possibilities were long unrealized ; they have had to wait until our own time for the significant expression that gives color and vitality to the annals of any age .

		For the unfolding of their charms our chief debt is due to
Parkman	LOCATION	, who first brought us to understand how magnificent a drama had been enacted upon this new-world stage .

		But many others have also helped to vivify our historical inheritance , until we have at last come to view it with new insight , and to know that the old world by no means has a monopoly of thrilling situations and romantic happenings .

		The historical pageant has a highly important educational function , and we are glad that its possibilities have become so generally apparent .

		Modern education knows how important it is to quicken the understanding by bringing the eye to its aid .

		We sometimes go too far in this respect , no doubt , forgetting that vision is only an adjunct to intelligence , and by no means a substitute therefor .

		To many people the read - ing of newspapers has come to be a scanning of cuts and head-lines only , and to many children the pictures in their school-books prove so dis - tracting that the text is slighted .

		Excessive attention to the pictorial aspect of an historical theme tends to produce flabbiness of mind , en - couraging indolent receptivity at the expense of sharp intellectual reaction .

		But the picture or the spectacle , taken in its properly subordinated relation to the fact or the idea , may aid marvel - lously in bringing the latter home .

		The pageant , which is primarily a series of moving pictures , is calculated to stir the most lethargic mind to interest .

		The symbols of the printed page be - come matters of real human concern when thus informed with life .

		And when nature lends a hand , as in the case of the
Hudson River	LOCATION	and the Rock of
Quebec	LOCATION	, supplying the actual scenes where great deeds were once wrought , the spec - tacle of the pageant acquires an impressiveness of which the depth and the enduring character are not easily to be measured .

		It is well that men should from time to time be made to feel how firmly the present is linked with the past ; f orgetf ulness of this fact constitutes perhaps the chief danger of our restless modern life .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		Extraneous aids to literary production , as we find them adopted by various celebrated authors , often provoke a smile of amusement , so very like to solemn fooling do they seem .

		Dickens is said to have sought inspiration from a number of quaint little bronze figures that he kept on his writing-table .

		Ibsen maintained a similar company of puppets .


Bulwer Lytton	ORGANIZATION	had to clothe himself in fine array before the muse would visit him , whereas Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	is reported as finding the removal of footgear conducive to a free flow of ideas .

		The Hungarian novelist
Jdkai	PERSON	was reduced to sterility and despair whenever his supply of violet ink gave out , and all the world knows that the philosopher
Kant	PERSON	was so troubled when the trees grew to such a height as to hide an old tower on which he had been wont to fix his gaze in moods of metaphysical specu - lation , that he was forced to request the cutting away of the obstructive foliage .

		Malebranche ,
Hobbes	LOCATION	,
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 273 and
Corneille	PERSON	required a penumbra for the incuba - tion of their ideas , and were wont to darken their studies in the daytime .

		Zola also pulled down the blinds , but at the same time turned on the gas jets and flooded his room with artificial light , having in his struggling days been in the habit of writing far into the
night	TIME	, so that daylight had become disso - ciated with literary work .

		Richter , on the other hand , and
Ouida	PERSON	wrote best in the radiance of the early morning sun and in the open air .

		Gray in - voked the muse with a page or two of Spenser .


Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	needed to feel a pen in his hand , as a sort of conductor of ideas , before his verse or prose would flow .

		Miss
Carolyn Wells	PERSON	has indi - cated the various kinds of candy that may be appro - priately indulged in as a prelude to various kinds of literary effort .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, while writing his dictionary , derived assistance from orange peel and tea , while the purring of a cat on his table was a further aid .

		Sheridan liked to have a bottle of good wine beside him as he wrote , and in this he was not peculiar ; but he also required the stimulus of brilliant lights all about him .

		Douglas Jerrold tolerated no litter on his desk ; all was immaculate there , his ink - stand resting in a marble shell , and his little dog curled up at his feet .

		Sardou always wrote his plays first on little scraps of paper , then on foolscap .

		Milton and
Warburton	PERSON	shared the same peculiarity , a fondness for organ strains as the best means to induce the mood for high literary endeavor .

		Buffon scorned all meretricious aids , his desk and chair and writing materials being the sole furnishings of his study .

		Thus it appears that the would-be great writer can hardly go wrong in choosing his method of work .

		Whatever oddity or commonplaceness he adopts , he is pretty sure to find distinguished precedent for his choice .

		The faculty of idiom-making -- or , as some might differently express it , a genius for slang -- is quite extensively credited to Americans , and not unjustly .

		What other language tban our own '' American-English '' can show anything to com - pare with the breezy freedom and picturesque apt - ness of some of our western idioms , and with the homely and concise expressiveness of our Yankee - isms ?

		The Manchester u Guardian , '' commenting on this subject , acknowledges the English indebted - ness to
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Lately we have become very apt pupils of American phrase-makers . ''

		it says .

		`` It is almost good colloquial English to say that a thing is ' up to so-and-so , ' meaning tbat it is so-and-so 's concern .

		Even as an Americanism we believe this phrase is fairly recent .

		Almost as freely we speak of a person as being ' up against ' an obstacle or an opponent -- a very expressive phrase with no ade - quate equivalent in elegant English ... Our recent readiness to adopt Americanisms is not an unhealthy tendency if we adopt them not as mere novelties in slang , but for the sake of their liveliness and force .

		Perhaps it would be a still healthier sign to make a few new idioms for ourselves . ''

		In somewhat differ - ent vein , and betraying less accurate information , a writer in the
London	LOCATION	' • Nation '' comments on our supposed use of * I swan . '' ''

		I frequently ask my American friends , '' says this writer , `` if they can give i the derivation of ' I swan , ' and never yet have I heard even an attempt to do so .

		Fifty years ago ' I i swan ' was in regular use by poets and novelists , and to-day it is employed in current American speech , though a certain class of Americans seem to find it necessary to apologize for the use of what they think is slang . ''

		Then we are confidently assured that it is not slang , but merely a corruption of '' I warrant you , '' through '' I ` se warrant , '' '' A 's warn , '' of the Liddesdale farmer .

		Thus what has been considered a bit of Yankee slang turns out to be an idiom of the Scottish border that '' fifty years ago ... was in regular use by poets and novelists . ''

		Henceforth , our polite circles of
Boston	LOCATION	, or
Chicago	LOCATION	, or
Kalama	LOCATION	- zoo , or any other centre of refinement and culture , may feel at liberty to continue the daily use of '' I swan , '' but with no longer any need of the hitherto customary apology .

		What a relief !

		The libraby of a big-game hunter in
Africa	LOCATION	might fairly be expected to abound in the literature of the chase , and it was doubtless with such expec - tations that many readers of Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's African article in the current '' Scribner 's Magazine '' turned to the catalogue of the '' Pigskin Library '' at its close .

		But there is not a trace of any such litera - ture to be found in the fifty-three works chosen by the ex-President and his son to solace their idle hours in the tropic wilds .

		Apart from
Mark Twain	PERSON	's u
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	'' and M
Huckleberry Finn	PERSON	, '' and some of
Scott	PERSON	's ,
Poe	PERSON	's ,
Bret Harte	PERSON	's , and
Cooper	PERSON	's fiction , the selections appear to represent the father 's rather than the son 's literary likings ; and these likings are well known to be catholic and comprehensive .

		It is a little surprising , however , omnivorous though Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	is in his reading , to see him carrying all the way to
East Africa	LOCATION	the apocryphal portions of the
Bible	LOCATION	, and
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's * • Frederick the Great , '' as well as Gregorovius 's ''
Rome	LOCATION	, ''
Spenser	PERSON	's * Faerie Queene , ''
Dante	PERSON	's M Inferno , '' and `` La Chanson de Roland . ''

		But on the whole he has with him a very inviting company of the world 's best authors , and more of them than most of us will get time to look into within the period of this famous hunting excur - sion . ''

		The Pigskin Library , '' edited by
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	might not be a bad venture for some enterprising publisher , especially if he could an - nounce the volumes as bound in skins of the distin - guished editor 's own procuring .

		• • • Engineering and the classics are declared by Dr.
Charles P. Steinmetz	PERSON	, a prominent member of the
American Institute of Civil Engineers	ORGANIZATION	, which recently held its annual convention , to be not so mutually hostile as many have imagined .

		He main - tains that the general educational training necessary for handling the problems of modern life is much the same for every profession , and that the engineer 274 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, needs to lay as broad a foundation as the lawyer , the doctor , or the clergyman .

		The power of intense application and concentration acquired by wrestling with Greek and Latin he regards as especially valuable for the engineer , and as obtainable in no other way so well as by the safe and sure road long ago unwittingly built for generations of unborn schoolboys by
Nepos	ORGANIZATION	,
Caesar , Xenophon , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The engineer 's work , moreover , it is argued , tends to make him one-sided and narrow-minded , and he needs the corrective influence of the so-called cul - tural studies to enlarge his view .

		A further reason why he should be a classical scholar is found in the great and rapidly increasing number of scientific terms derived from the Greek , and , to a less extent , from the Latin .

		It is a pleasing picture we seem to get from this broad-minded man of science , of the liberally educated civil engineer , his theodolite over his shoulder and his Theocritus under his arm , pursuing his calling with outlook extending far beyond his measuring chain , and ideas too large to be expressed in the figures jotted down in his note-book .

		Of course Dr.
Steinmetz	PERSON	is not the first one , and we hope he will not be the last , to emphasize the desir - ability of being a whole man before becoming either an engineer or a statesman , an orator or a poet , a mechanic or a millionaire .

		A SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE TO '' THE ART AND Science of Advertising , '' Mr.
George French	PERSON	's instructive book recently reviewed by us , is suggested by the ingenious scheme of a
St. Louis	LOCATION	manufacturer to get his name before the public .

		Noting with regret that '' old-fashioned chivalry toward women '' is rapidly declining in his own city , and that the decline is even more precipitate in
New York	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	, this trans-Mississippi champion of the weaker sex is distributing '' true-blue buttons , '' which will indicate to any woman entering a street-car that the wearer of such button is a pattern of chivalry and is eagerly awaiting an opportunity to prove it by resigning to her his seat , if he has one .

		A speedy cure to bad manners is all but guaranteed to any man who will wear the button for a week : '' he will become fixed in old-fashioned chivalry toward women '' -- and at the same time the manufacturer 's name , displayed on the button , will become fixed in the minds of numerous observers .

		Thus are we taught a neat little lesson in the difficult art not only of advertising , but also of worshipping both manners and mammon at the same time -- of killing two birds with one button , so to speak .

		• • , •
The National Education Association	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	is a large and influential organization , with manifold activities and great powers for good .

		It has many departments for special work , among which the
Library Department	ORGANIZATION	has had considerable prominence , as affording opportunities for teachers and librarians to get together and discuss matters of practical concern to both classes of workers in the broad field of public instruction .

		Now that this
Library Department	ORGANIZATION	has grown from its small begin - nings in
1896	DATE	, until its meetings have become among the most interesting and best attended of all the departments of
the Education Association	ORGANIZATION	, it seems a pity that it should be abolished , as has been pro- posed by the
Executive Committee of the Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion , in its plans for reorganization .

		The object , of course , is to simplify the affairs and proceedings of the Association ; but it seems as if this might be done in some better way .

		Not unnaturally , the librarians of the country are opposing the action , and pleading for a stay of proceedings until they can present their side of the question .

		It is to be hoped that their arguments will receive a careful hearing .

		This branch of educational work is more distinctive , and certainly not less important , than many others that are allowed to continue the enjoy - ment of old-time privileges in the councils of the Association ... • A distinguished promoter of the art of printing ,
Robert Hoe	PERSON	, head of the firm of
R. Hoe & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and perfecter of the marvellous sextuple cylinder machine that prints , cuts , pastes , folds , counts , 1 and delivers from twenty-four thousand to seventy-two thousand newspapers an hour , according to the number of pages in each copy , died in
London	LOCATION	a few weeks ago , at the age of seventy .

		His service to the cause of letters in helping to make possible the cheap and voluminous modern newspaper , includ - ing its colored supplement , may be of questionable value ; but his ingenuity and energy can not fail to win our admiration .

		Besides being an inventor and a conspicuously successful business man , he was a writer on the history and development of printing , and also a collector of early books and other rare specimens of primitive printing .

		This collection is said to be worth as much as a
million dollars	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Hoe	PERSON	had the quietness and unobtrusiveness of the man of deeds rather than words , but a few of his words of wisdom have gained currency ; as , for example , '' Concentration is the first condition of success , '' and '' Get behind a thing and push it ; do n't put yourself in front and pull . ''


Chicago	LOCATION	's civil-service selection of a libra - rian , the exact method of which has already been explained by us , was made public on the first of the month .

		Mr.
Henry E. Legler	PERSON	, secretary of the
Wisconsin Free Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and president of the publishing board , of the executive board , and of the national council of the American Library Asso - ciation , is the successful candidate .

		He has accepted the call , as was of course to be expected from his consenting to enter the competition .

		Mr.
Legler	PERSON	is an Italian by birth , a Swiss by early education , but an American by later school-training and by subse - quent residence and professional activity in this country .

		Before taking up library work he tried his hand not unsuccessfully at journalism , including the mechanical details of printing , at politics -LRB- he was elected to the
Wisconsin	LOCATION	legislature in
1889	DATE	-RRB- , and at public school committee-work ; and he has also
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 275 produced a number of biographical and historical works , besides writing of late on library matters .

		He is in the prime of middle life , and is regarded by those who know him as exceptionally well-fitted for his high office .

		It is interesting to note that the accepted candidate lacks a library-school training , and has never even served behind a delivery desk or as the presiding genius of a reference room .

		But he proved his aptitude for library administration when , as member of the
Milwaukee	LOCATION	school board , he instituted the close cooperation between schools and the library which has since served as a model for other cities . ''

		Library extension , '' it seems , is to be the watchword of the new library administration in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		O • • • Glittering gems of caustic criticism , from the mordant pen of
George Meredith	PERSON	, long a '' reader '' to the publishing house of
Chapman	PERSON	and Hall , have been exhumed from the dark unfathomed caves of the firm 's business records , and are given a setting in the pages of '' The Fortnightly Review . ''

		A few of these brilliants we venture to display . ''

		A mere wisp of a tale '' is the sufficient condemna - tion of one unlucky manuscript ; `` vaporish stuff , '' that of another .

		`` Anstey might have made the subject amusing .

		This writer is an elephant , '' '' uns still a third merciless verdict . ''

		Might gain a prize for dulness ; '' '' Feebler stuff than this might be written , but would tax an ape ; '' '' Written in a queer old maundering style ; poor stuff , respectable in the mouth of one 's grandmother ; '' '' An infernal ro - mance ; '' '' Cockneyish dialogue , gutter English , ill - contrived incidents , done in daubs , '' -- thus are the hopes of various unnamed literary aspirants blasted , for the time being , by this hard-hearted reader .

		His own sensitiveness to adverse criticism is a signi - ficant fact in this connection , -- so often is the highest power to sting united with the keenest susceptibility of pricks from hostile shafts .

		Rural appreciation of good literature is made the subject of a recent newspaper editorial , and the query is offered whether urban sophistication does not '' quench the thirst for the Muse . ''

		The simple life of the country and the reading of good old books do seem to go well together . ''

		We know of one typical bookcase , '' proceeds the writer already quoted , '' in a hamlet far from the railroad , wherein at least half the books are volumes of poetry .

		We give the list as they stood upon the shelf :
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
John G. Saxe	PERSON	, Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Goldsmith	PERSON	, Mrs.
Hemans	PERSON	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Dryden	PERSON	,
Will Carleton	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Alice	PERSON	and
Pboebe Cary	PERSON	, and
Holmes	PERSON	.

		The range is perhaps the best thing about this list .

		And the books are not mere mural decora - tion ; they are well-thumbed . ''

		The writer also takes pleasure in recalling '' an actual farmer '' who re - marked : '' No more books for me in hayin ' time .

		I was readin ' • Last o ' th ' Mohicans ' last
summer	DATE	, an ' I could n't hardly stop to get m ' hay in . ''

		We too can recall '' an actual farmer '' who was a reader of books , but whose taste was a grade higher than that of this
Cooper	PERSON	enthusiast .

		Shakespeare and
Scott	PERSON	were our farmer 's favorites , and he sat up nights , in the winter , to read his well-worn editions of their works .

		The happy fortunes of Dr.
George Brandes	PERSON	-- not the sad fortunes that have been going the rounds of the newspapers for the benefit of credu - lous readers -- should cause his friends and admirers to rejoice .

		In a letter to the editor who lately pub - lished the amazing myth of his unsuccess and impe - cuniosity , he writes to contradict the various false statements and to declare himself on the best of terms with his publishers and the reading world .

		He says , among other things : '' I have been fortunate in finding a large public for my works both at home and abroad .

		A number of my thirty different volumes have been issued in many separate editions , and of my recently collected works six thousand sets have already been sold ... My collected works have appeared in
Russia	LOCATION	in several editions , and of my ' Life of Shakespeare ' several thousand copies have been sold in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, where it seems to have become , in a way , a standard work . ''

		On the whole , then , any movement to pass round the hat for this distinguished Danish writer 's benefit may now be suspended as premature and needless .

		Special library bindings for popular books are doubtless advisable on the score of both economy and appearance .

		Mr.
Le Roy Jeffers	PERSON	, head of the order department of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, has prepared an extensive '' Reference List of Titles Suggested for a Special Library Binding , '' which is already '' in active use in 180 of the largest libraries in the country . ''

		The issue of some of these books in more than one edition , at different prices , is care - fully noted , and every effort has apparently been made to render the list serviceable .

		Fiction natur - ally predominates , with poetry and other polite liter - ature in second place .

		Some little arbitrariness of choice can not but occur , as , for example , the inclu - sion of twenty-nine of Miss
Rosa Nouchette Carey	PERSON	's novels , and the exclusion of all of Mr.
William E. Norris	PERSON	's .

		The list fills a pamphlet of 125 pages .

		Cramming the mind with poetry is not exactly the best way , one would think , to induce a love of poetry , when there is no urgent craving to start with .

		Nevertheless a recent graduate of
Harvard	LOCATION	, deplor - ing the modern utilitarian and scientific trend of college education , thus frankly expresses his sense of a lack in his own academic training : '' If they had only crowded more poetry into my system while I was in college , there might have been some left in me now . ''

		With the inauguration of President
Lowell	PERSON	this month as head of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	the hope is finding expression that some return to the old system of prescribed '' humanities '' may be effected .

		276 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, ON TEACHING LITERATURE .

		BY ONE WHO TRIES TO TEACH IT .

		Why does not some one ask , Can science be taught ?

		It is presumably superior to literature for this purpose , because it is a body of fairly definite ascertained facts and more or less tenable theories .

		But these are things to be told ; and is telling teach - ing ?

		Where are all the fine old implications of the word , if any man who has found out something by study may become a teacher by telling what he has found ?

		Should not teaching still be the counterpart of learning rather than of study ?

		And whereas we acquire knowledge , we learn wisdom .

		On this ground may we not reasonably hold that literature , which is the depository of human wisdom , is emi - nently the teacher 's field ?

		We have heard the objections .

		There are the Knowledges , and there are the Arts , and for the rest there is moonshine ; and to talk of teaching being anything else than imparting either knowledge or skill is to talk nonsense .

		But before we consider this , let us put aside all suspicion of quibbling .

		Let us make the word '' teach '' as broad as anyone pleases ; admit that to impart knowledge is to teach it -LRB- and the pupil also -RRB- ; consider even that he who does no more than set pupils a task and use physi - cal measures to see that they perforin it , is also a teacher .

		Or , better still , let us omit the word from the statement of the problem .

		Then the question becomes simply : Can we in the schools do anything at all with literature ?

		and is it worth while ?

		Curiously enough , the greatest sceptics would appear to be among those who have the cause of letters most at heart .

		Perhaps their own acquaint - ance was made in solitude , and they can not brook the idea of a formal introduction to the wayward Muse .

		Or perhaps they have seen the introduction attempted by one who was chiefly interested in the cut of the Muse 's clothes . ''

		Now this classic knot was tied by
Boileau	PERSON	; and you shall see pretty soon where that starched ruff came from . ''

		These things are so clear when they are once seen , and so easily communicable .

		And how boundless the field that is opened !

		Think what discoveries may be made !

		We know now that the germs of '' Paradise Lost '' are in
Caedmon	LOCATION	,
Andreini	PERSON	, and
Vondel	LOCATION	; literary par - allels make it certain that
Wordsworth	PERSON	sometimes composed with his eye on a book ; we find that in earliest Roman art and letters the wheel of Fortune did not revolve ; we are almost certain that the orig - inal goose honked high , and we may hope some day to identify the goose .

		But literature must not be held responsible for all the diversions practised in its name .

		Doubtless all things are at times sadly enough mistaught .

		Litera - ture suffers especially , because of its comprehensive - ness and vague definition .

		On the one hand it is a thing of record , a body of accumulated material whose medium is language ; and language has a continu - ous life-history , falling , like other living things , into orders and families , into genera and species .

		To the philologist who conducts his investigations in this field in a sanely historical and scientific spirit , all honor is due , and literature is under deep obligations to him , -- though the philologist , I conceive , is not primarily either a student or teacher of literature .

		On the other hand , literature is in itself an art , even in considerable measure a craft ; and everybody admits that a craft can be taught .

		As a matter of fact , the craft of letters in its humbler aspect is daily taught to thousands of students of English com - position .

		But this again is not what is meant .

		The field of contention is that existing body of classical literature , imaginative and -LRB- as the phrase of simpler days has it -RRB- inspired , which no one has the temerity to attempt to teach as an art , and into which the curious incursions of the philologist seem often so pitifully inept .

		Here is the shadowy middle ground -- the misty mid-region of Weir -- where our profes - sors of literature would take their stand and pose as high priests of the holy of holies .

		Very natur - ally , those who are already endowed with the faculty to understand want no such intervention .

		When they can listen to the Prophet , shall the Professor speak ?

		Yet here the Professor finds his vocation .

		For the generously endowed appear to be few .

		Of course those , on the other hand , who are quite incapable of instruction , must , as in everything else , be passed by .

		But human faculties are not strati - fied ; they rise and sink in an infinite scale .

		Some men mount by native impulse to the highest and best in life and art ; others climb by painful degrees .

		And while some of these latter might attain in the end by their own efforts , with help they will surely attain the sooner .

		And many may catch some sight of the goal who would never have done so unaided .

		Understanding is a necessary condition of all enjoyment above the sensual rank , and the under - standing is always open to assistance .

		At the very approach to literature , if it be in any degree subtle , abstruse , or archaic , there is the bar of inadequate knowledge .

		Many who are competent to enjoy are not yet able to read ; and they must be instructed .

		Take the case of the archaic .

		Experience shows how hard it is for the uninstructed to divest any word in their vocabulary of the meaning which it has always borne to them .

		My class in the Mort Darthur reads : `` It seemeth me , said Sir
Launcelot	PERSON	, this siege -LSB- chair -RSB- ought to be fulfilled this same day , for this is the feast of Pentecost after the four hundred and four and fifty year ; and if it would please all parties , I would none of these letters were seen this day , till he be come that ought to achieve this adventure .

		Then made they to ordain a cloth of silk for to cover these letters in the siege perilous . ''

		Immediately I discover that they think the word `` fulfil '' refers to the prophecy that is about to be fulfilled , -- though
Malory	PERSON	meant merely that the chair would be filled , or find its rightful occupant .

		And the cloth of silk which was '' ordained '' under - went , they imagine , some kind of ceremony or con - secration ; whereas it was simply ordered to be made , in all probability by some needlewoman .

		It requires a discourse of considerable length -- on feudalism , on chivalry , and on Old - World social distinctions --
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 277 to remove from the minds of the unacquainted their false conception of Spenser 's '' gentle knight '' and substitute the true one .

		Few but teachers know how very far
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's language is from being modern , and how very far therefore the ordinary reader is from really understanding him .

		Suppose you who love your
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	without studying him attempt to read some passage to a Shakespearian student and see how quickly he will find you astray .

		Even Charles Lamb begins to require elucidation .

		Only those who are content to enjoy with a partial understanding will maintain that there is no office here for the skilled interpreter .

		Nor is it the office of merely philological explanation .

		The philologist , with his exact science of forms and constructions , his etymologies and syntaxes , holds a somewhat separate ground from that of the interpreter , who applies to the subtle meanings of words , and the individual colorings they acquire , tests of a very dif - ferent order .

		Yet if any philologist were disposed to be jealous of this distinction -- as I think none would be -- we may be content to resign this part of the field entirely into his hands , to be called by his own name .

		The point is that there is an abundance of work to do here in merely laying the approaches to literature ; and it might well occupy the major part of some years of elementary instruction .

		A step beyond this is the service of telling another what to look for .

		You listen to a lecture by a geol - ogist who discourses of valley formations , -- how this narrow steep-sided canyon has been formed by erosion , how those long straight parallel valleys are the result of faulting , how this other broad level - floored vale is in reality a silted-up lake , -- and the next time you go to the mountains your old haunts take on a novel interest , because you have been told what to see .

		Why should such instruction be grate - fully received from the scientist and not from the teacher of literature ?

		A pupil of mine calls atten - tion to the fact that a line in Spenser has caught his fancy -- the line in which Sans joy , having been miraculously delivered from the
Redcross Knight	PERSON	, '' Lay covered with inchaunted cloud all day . ''

		Straightway the line , which I had often passed over without notice , takes on for me too a certain lin - gering charm .

		Perhaps I in turn can communicate something of the impression always left on my imagination by the conclusion of the ballad of Sir
Patrick Spens	PERSON	, -- that picture , drawn at a stroke , of the eternal burial-place beneath the sea , where , half over to Aberdour , the faithful master and his men went down in fifty fathoms of water : '' And thair lies guid Sir
Patrick Spens	PERSON	, Wi 1 the Scots lords at his feit . ''

		Or perhaps I can give an added emphasis to the example , in the same ballad , of duty heroically per - formed , by showing that Sir
Patrick	PERSON	, -- who , after exclaiming against the rigor of the king 's order in sending him to sea in the stormy season , goes never - theless , -- is doing precisely as the three hundred did at
Balaclava	LOCATION	, whom
Tennyson	PERSON	has commemorated with more elaborate circumstance in his u Was there a man dismayed ? ''

		and '' Theirs not to make reply . ''

		I take up the play of ``
Julius Caesar	PERSON	, '' and am trans - ported in imagination to the time and scene of one of the greatest crises in history ; and as I am hurried along through the warring forces of the wavering ambition of
Caesar	LOCATION	, the fanatic patriotism of
Brutus	LOCATION	, and the fatuous fickleness of the mob , the sense of a crumbling state grows upon me until it seems as if the very world were toppling to its ruin .

		May I not try to impart something of this sense to another who , it may be , has as yet seen in the drama only some pretty stage effects and some rhetorical speeches ?

		If it still be argued that this is only to tell , -- to tell what I have seen or felt , -- and not yet to teach in any such high sense as was hinted at in the begin - ning , I would reply that the service does not end here .

		For there is stimulus in seeing what another has seen , incentive to see also for one 's self .

		So your scientist , communicating only what he has learned from another , coldly handing on certain elements of common knowledge , may pass for a teacher ; but when , after patient research , he has made his own discoveries , he is in a position to assume the priestly office ; and if , by the confidence and enthusiasm of his communication , he can impart to another the same zeal , inspiring him to go and do likewise , then , and perhaps only then , has he really read his title clear .

		For to communicate the en - thusiasm for understanding , for discovery , and for growth , is , in intellectual matters , one of the highest functions of the teacher , and it is a function as surely exercisable in the field of letters as in any field under the sun .

		Let us go yet a step further .

		Since great litera - ture is wrought of the very substance of life , it has in it the elements of ultimate truth and becomes of universal import .

		And the difference between know - ledge and wisdom , I take it , is the difference between knowing truths and seeing truth , between knowing facts and understanding life .

		To dwell , therefore , upon this aspect of literature is only less instructive than to observe life itself .

		For looking on is a part of experience ; and to look on in imagination , when the imagination is sufficiently sharpened , does not differ very materially from looking on in fact .

		In all such literature , then , as is fundamentally a criti - cism of life , the teacher finds his greatest oppor - tunity .

		Being by both experience and study more deeply versed in life than his pupils , he is in a posi - tion to assist them more rapidly to something of the same insight and sympathy .

		It may be that few pupils who have not themselves passed middle age can comprehend what insight there is in Words - worth 's simple and touching description of the aging couple in the poem of ''
Michael	PERSON	'' over whom many seasons of domestic toil have passed , leaving them '' neither gay perhaps , Nor cheerful , yet with objects and with hopes , Living a life of eager industry . ''

		Yet
Wordsworth	PERSON	had attained to this insight before thirty ; and at the very least , some sense of it may be so infixed in the pupil 's memory that when he 278 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, arrives at the stage of comprehension it will recur to him with accrued beauty and power .

		There is no need to argue the possibility of bringing home to any ordinarily susceptible sensibilities , young or old , the noble despair of Mark Antony : '' Hark !

		the land bids me tread no more upon ' t ; It is ashamed to bear me .

		Friends , come hither ; I am so lated in the world that I Have lost ray way for ever ; '' or the equally noble stoicism of Octavius giving counsel to his sister -- counsel little suited to any woman but a Roman : '' Cheer your heart : Be you not troubled with the time , which drives O'er your content these strong necessities ; But let determined things to destiny Hold unbewail 'd their way . ''

		Deeper criticism of life .

		than this it is not easy to conceive .

		And suppose it be admitted that in set - ting forth these things the teacher is performing only the office of a showman ; with such contents of his show-box he is a showman glorified .

		That it is use - less to thrust them before the eyes of those who would not see them for themselves , I personally can - not for a moment admit ; I know too well how much I am myself indebted to two or three genuine teachers of literature .

		The service can be done .

		Into any discussion of whether it is worth doing , I refuse to go .

		The above was suggested by the title of Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	's article in
The Dial	LOCATION	, * and was written before that article was read .

		Now that I read it I am glad to see that it does not contain so much dissent as I had half expected to find .

		Of course Mr.
Moore	PERSON	has his caveats , as we all have . ''

		But , '' runs one in the very first sentence , '' to teach litera - ture is a good deal like trying to teach life itself . ''

		Just so .

		Yet this is precisely what the world 's greatest teachers have tried to do ; when I spoke of the fine old implications of the word , I had in mind nothing other than this .

		Nor do I think Mr.
Moore	PERSON	means to imply the impossibility of it , but only the difficulty .

		We know it will be imperfectly done .

		Teaching is no sufficient substitute for experience .

		It may , however , be a valuable supplement , -- other - wise it were folly for the world to hoard its wisdom .

		Rasselas will not always listen to
Imlac	LOCATION	, remaining forever in the
Happy Valley	LOCATION	; but when he goes forth to explore the world , he does well to take the sage along .

		* ' Absolute realization , transcendent power , '' says Mr.
Moore	PERSON	again , '' are the main goals of literature . ''

		And sometimes , indeed , in the hands of the masters , the goals seem nearly reached , the realization all but absolute .

		To a realization of this realization I have insisted that many can be brought by the simple means of human help .

		To me this is almost axio - matic ; and on the subject of method I prefer to remain silent .

		I judge that we who teach are not always nearly so much concerned with method as others think we must be ; in this field especially *
October 1,1909	DATE	.

		am I distrustful of those who advance any very defi - nite preconceived method .

		And indeed Mr.
Moore	PERSON	, after setting forth so alluringly his own air-drawn method , dismisses it with a touch of pleasant irony that discloses a like distrust .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		TEACHING A LOVE OF LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's interesting article '' On Teaching Liter - ature , '' in your issue for
October 1	DATE	, seems to me to take the critic 's rather than the teacher 's point of view .

		It would be desirable indeed to start the boys off with a course calculated to make them '' realize that literature is a fine art '' ; and then to jump them from these studies in '' the near and the minute '' to '' the consideration of the large and the remote '' ; and finally to impress upon them the significance in literature of the individual and the universal mood .

		The spirit of Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's sugges - tions is very fine .

		But it is an article of my teaching creed that the approach to literature is as personal a matter for each student in the clsss as it would be for the untaught man out in the world .

		You can not foretell at what book or poem , or phrase even , a particular soul will kindle .

		My own experience leads me to conclude that most boys appreciate the big things in literature before they have eyes for matters of art and craft ; so that I should place Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's second course before his first , were I following his plan .

		But there undoubtedly are a minority of students who come at the craftsman - ship first ; for them the change would be unfortunate .

		The proper method , to my mind , is very simple , but few teachers follow it .

		I should put into the introduc - tory courses as many books of as many kinds as I could -- reproducing in a highly selected way the varied pan - orama of the interests of life .

		I should try to indicate the peculiar point of view of each kind of book , as I came to it , -- without passing judgment upon it , or set - ting it above or below another kind .

		If such a course presents sufficient variety , the student is likely to find what his own temper needs .

		From that moment I be - lieve he is '' introduced '' to literature ; and any later critical information he acquires , no matter how helpful , is of secondary importance .

		The more the teacher is simply a lover of books , the greater will be his success .

		The love of books , like any other passion , has a kindling power ; but critical schemes have none to speak of .

		Most of our teachers of liter - ture , in my opinion , are lovers of critical theories more or less unsound ; too few of them are hearty lovers of the great books they pretend to '' teach . ''

		If you are committed to a theory of the novel that can best be illus - trated by
Henry James	PERSON	, you are not likely to lure your classes to a love of Fielding or Scott or
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	.

		If my plan is even simpler on paper than Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's , I am ready to admit that it is far more difficult of exe - cution .

		It demands of the ideal teacher imaginative sympathy with every student and every book ; perhaps it demands of him also a poet 's eloquence .

		But it is the right ideal for a teacher to fall short of , if one must fall short .

		THE DIAl ^ 279 FROM LIT ERAR Y
LONDON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		I never accppt very readily the charge of plagiar - ism that is frequently brought against authors .

		Such charges can be made very elaborately upon very slight data .

		To anyone familiar with the currents of literary life , it is quite apparent that the same idea may occur almost simultaneously to two or three people .

		This is most in evidence in the case of a short story , where an idea that might be thought absolutely original has inspired , almost at the same time , two people far apart .

		Not less remarkable are coincidences in the titles of books .

		Again and again we have seen two publishers announcing a book well-nigh identical in character , and sometimes even in name .

		The last case that has come before me was in the recent publication of a work entitled ''
Napoleon	PERSON	's Marshals . ''

		It was a well - written , carefully-compiled volume , -- disfigured , as I think , by an anti-Napoleon bias , but packed with details concerning the eminent men who assisted
Bonaparte	PERSON	in his great career .

		Yet there was at the same moment another book being written with equal care , which it was intended should bear the same name ; for it also was a story of the Marshals of the first Empire .

		This second writer has now had to look around for a new title , and is calling his book u
Napoleon	PERSON	's Empire-Builders , '' which perhaps , after all , is just as good a title as that of the rival work ; but what a strange coincidence it is !

		Equally regrettable are the many publishers ' projects which are injured by this misfortune of co - incidence .

		I remember , on one occasion , Mr.
David Nutt	PERSON	projected an edition of
Howell	ORGANIZATION	's '' Familiar Letters , '' under the editorship of Mr.
Joseph Jacobs	PERSON	.

		There had not been an edition of this book for fifty years ; yet only a few weeks before Mr.
Nutt	PERSON	's great undertaking was to appear , another publisher sent forth a much cheaper issue of it to the world .

		Mr.
Nutt	PERSON	was persuaded at the time that someone had betrayed the secret of his projected book ; but I , who was behind the scenes , know that this was not the case .

		Such things are constantly happening .

		At this moment , for example , the
Cambridge	LOCATION	Uni - versity Press is publishing a complete edition of the plays of
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	in ten volumes , edited by
Arnold Glover	PERSON	, and the firm of
George Bell & Son	ORGANIZATION	is also issuing the same works in a splen - did library edition in twelve volumes , edited by Mr.
A. H. Bullen	PERSON	.

		Both these sets of the plays must have been projected some years ago .

		and quite inde - pendently of each other .

		It is not likely , however , that there is room for both of them .

		The demand for the plays of
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	must be very limited , and it is deplorable that there should be rival editions , each in so attractive a form .

		Another case that occurs to me is that of the - Memoirs of the Comte de
Grammont	LOCATION	. ''

		Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	was responsible for an edition of this wonder - ful book , in
1811	DATE	.

		It was issued again , in
Bonn	LOCATION	's Library , in
1846	DATE	.

		In
1889	DATE	Mr.
John Nimmo	PERSON	pro- duced the book much more handsomely .

		For nearly twenty years there was no further edition , but quite recently two separate firms published the memoirs again -- in the same week !

		Perhaps the very latest case of this kind is that of a young Scot who with great elaboration had pre - pared a book upon
Margaret Gordon	PERSON	,
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's first love .

		Before he had found a publisher , an American author came into the field with a similar book bear - ing precisely the same title ; and this book Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	has just published in
England	LOCATION	.

		Many of us will find it hard to believe that
Margaret Gordon	PERSON	was worth one volume , let alone two .

		The idea that she was the '' Blumine '' of '' Sartor Resartus '' has been quite exploded by Mr.
Alexander Carlyle	PERSON	, who makes it clear that all the lovely episodes presented in reference to Blumine were based upon circum - stances connected with
Jane Welsh	PERSON	, who became
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's wife .

		In any case , the misfortune of the young Scottish author commands our sympathy .

		There has naturally been a considerable amount of interest excited as to what manuscripts Mr.
Mere	PERSON	- dith left behind him , unpublished .

		When I paid my first visit to Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	, twenty years ago , he showed me one such manuscript , entitled `` The Journalist . ''

		Mr.
Frederick Greenwood	PERSON	was , he told me , the hero of the book ; but
Lord Morley of Blackburn	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- then Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	-RRB- and Mr.
Stead	PERSON	-LRB- who followed Mr.
Morley	PERSON	in the editorship of the `` Pall Mall Gazette '' -RRB- were both portrayed .

		A few months before his death , however , Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	gathered two of his friends around him -- one of them his doctor -- and declared his intention of burning this unfinished manuscript , and sundry others that were at his hand ; and this was actually done .

		Happily , as I am bound to consider it , Mr.
Mere	PERSON	- dith left one unfinished manuscript behind him ; it is entitled `` Celt and
Saxon	PERSON	, '' and it incorporates Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's strong feelings with regard to the peculiarities of the two races .

		He himself was proud of being a Celt . ''

		I have not a single drop of English blood in my veins , '' he once said to me .

		There are other fragments of Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's unpublished writings that will be forthcoming in the new edition of his works in twenty-six volumes that has just been projected .

		This edition is to appear in
England	LOCATION	through the firm of Constable , in which firm Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's son , Mr.
William Maxse Meredith	PERSON	, is a partner .

		Some of these frag - ments of Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's , in which I am greatly interested , are his '' Translations from Homer : Ex - periments in English Hexameters , '' that well deserve printing .

		Meanwhile , the volume of Mr.
Mere	PERSON	- dith 's Letters , which is to be the sole authoritative contribution to his biography , will not be ready for publication for a year or more .


Lord Morley of Blackburn	ORGANIZATION	, who will edit it , has already received a number of striking letters ; for
Meredith	PERSON	was a very prince of letter-writers .

		Chesterton on
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, and
Shaw on Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	.

		* It was surely an odd fancy that prompted Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	to write a book on his irrepressible contemporary , Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	.

		Whatever its impel - ling motive , it is as entertaining as anything Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's exuberant genius has yet produced .

		He writes with all his wonted sureness of himself and of his theme , -- except that he does falter for a moment to acknowledge his inability to treat the music-loving part of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's person - ality .

		`` Upon this part of him I am a reverent agnostic , '' he declares ; '' it is well to have some such dark continent in the character of a man of whom one writes .

		It preserves two very important things -- modesty in the biographer and mystery in the biography . ''

		Doubtless Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	would be the last to deny that we see in every person or object only what we bring with us to see .

		Hence we have in his book quite as much a picture of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	as a study of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	.

		The two-edged quality of criticism has never made a more striking or more amusing display of itself than in this analysis of the supposedly
Shawish	PERSON	or Shavian or Shawensian characteristics .

		For instance , the following passage from an early page might just as easily have been written about the author as by him -- with the simple change of a proper name .

		Indeed -LRB- with this change -RRB- Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	himself might have written it of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	. ''

		But here comes the paradox of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	; the greatest of all paradoxes and the one of which he is unconscious .

		These one or two plain truths which quite stupid people learn at the beginning are exactly the one or two truths which
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	may not learn even at the end .

		He is a daring pilgrim who has set out from the grave to find the cradle .

		He started from points of view which no one else was clever enough to discover , and he is at last discovering points of view which no one else was ever stupid enough to ignore .

		This absence of the red - hot truisms of boyhood ; this sense that he is not rooted in the ancient sagacities of infancy , has , I think , a great deal to do with his position ... '' The last sentence , referring to certain matters of fact , must be abruptly broken off , else the transposed application would be incorrect .

		A little later occurs a passage illustrating the thorough good-will and jovial friendliness with which the writer has approached his self-imposed task .

		In reading it , Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's confirmed veg - * George
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.

		By
Gilbert K. Chesterton	PERSON	.

		New York :
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		etarianism must be borne in mind , and also Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's ample physical proportions . ''

		I seem to remember that when he was lying sick and near to death at the end of his
Saturday	DATE	Review career he wrote a fine fantastic article , declaring that his hearse ought to be drawn by all the animals that he had not eaten .

		Whenever that evil day comes there will be no need to fall back on the ranks of the brute creation ; there will be no lack of men and women who owe him so much as to be glad to take the place of the animals ; and the present writer for one will be glad to express his gratitude as an elephant . ''

		As to the plan and scope of the book , it begins with a characteristic assertion : '' Most people either say that they agree with
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	or that they do not understand him .

		I am the only person who understands him , and I do not agree with him . ''

		Then follow , after a short preface , chapters on Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	as an Irishman , as a Puritan , and as a Progressive ; but the greater part of the book is devoted to '' The Critic , '' '' The Dramatist , '' and '' The
Philoso	PERSON	- pher . ''

		Hence it is , as was natural , more a study of the writer than of the man in his extra - literary capacity .

		The fact of his Irish birth and his protestantism is made to explain many of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's peculiarities , and the argument is delightfully plausible -- perhaps too plausible to be wholly convincing .

		In the chapter on Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	as critic , attention is chiefly directed to his well-known anti-Shakespearianism , which again is traced to '' the fact that he is a Puritan , while
Shakespeare	PERSON	was spiritually a Catholic .

		The former is always screwing himself up to see truth ; the latter is often content that truth is there .

		The Puritan is only strong enough to stiffen ; the Catholic is strong enough to relax . ''

		The chapter entitled '' The Dramatist '' takes up the earlier of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's plays , with appre - ciative and occasionally adverse comment , in which the playwright is here and there charged with not understanding human nature , and with certain other failings .

		Some of his offenses against refined dramatic art are also pointed out .

		But the reviewer 's tone is in general cordial , and there is little of captious criticism .

		In his character of philospher , Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	is thought by his critic to have inflicted three injuries on mankind and to have rendered two important services . ''

		The primary respect in which
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	has been a bad influence , '' we are asked to believe , '' is that he has encouraged fastidiousness .

		He has made men dainty about their moral meals . ''

		And '' the second of the two points on which I think
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	has done definite harm is this : that he has -LRB- not always or even as a rule intentionally -RRB- increased that
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 281 anarchy of thought which is always the destruc - tion of thought . ''

		This , coming from the pen that wrote it , almost moves to merriment ; and so perhaps may the third charge , that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	'' has to a very slight extent , but still percep - tibly , encouraged a kind of charlatanism of utterance among those who possess his Irish impudence without his Irish virtue . ''

		The ser - vices rendered by this Irish philosopher are thus stated : '' In the first place , and quite apart from all partic - ular theories , the world owes thanks to
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	for having combined being intelligent with being intel - ligible .

		He has popularized philosophy , or rather he has repopularized it , for philosophy is always popular , except in peculiarly corrupt and oligarchic ages , like our own ... The second phase of the man 's really fruitful efficacy is in a sense the converse of this .

		He has im - proved philosophic discussions by making them popular .

		But he has also improved popular amusements by making them more philosophic .

		And by more philo - sophic I do not mean duller , but funnier ; that is , more varied . ''

		Three superstitions , we are told , are enter - tained by the public concerning Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, '' first that he desires ` problem ' plays , second that he is paradoxical , and third that in his dramas as elsewhere he is specially ' a Socialist . ' ''

		But all this is false , maintains Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, even though he has shown that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's plays turn , as a rule , on a '' very plain pivot of ethical or philosophical conviction '' ; and although , as in the first passage quoted above , he refers to the man as an habitual utterer of paradoxes .

		But these and other details may be considered chiefly matters of opinion and point of view , and disa - greement with the writer need not lessen one 's interest in his book .

		How far , after all , has the writer succeeded in presenting the real Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	?

		If he under - stands him as well as he claims to , the passive subject may conceivably feel highly indignant ; for who likes to think that any man can take his measure ? ''

		The greater the truth , the greater the libel '' is a true word .

		And even an obviously distorted representation is not pleasant to the victim .

		It is hard to laugh at a caricature of oneself .

		But , as we are happily in a position to know , the victim in this case has lost no whit of his good-nature , or of his resources of wit and satire .

		Almost simultan - eous with the appearance of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's book in this country there comes an extended review of it in the
London	LOCATION	'' Nation , '' the writer being none other than Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	himself , who thus discloses the interesting situation of a biog - rapher reviewed by the subject of his biography .

		The entertainment is indeed a rare one .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	begins by saying : '' This book is what everybody expected it to be : the best work of literary art I have yet provoked .

		It is a fascinating portrait study ; and I am proud to have been the painter 's model .

		It is in the great tradition of liter - ary portraiture : it gives not only the figure , but the epoch .

		It makes the figure interesting and memorable by giving it the greatness and spaciousness of an epoch , and it makes it attractive by giving it the handsom - est and friendliest personal qualities of the painter himself . ''

		But , humorously laments the reviewer , not all readers will be able to see the many virtues ascribed to him .

		`` He perceives that I am an angel ; and he is quite right .

		But he will never convince those who can not see my wings ; and for them his portrait will never be a good likeness .

		Fortunately , lots of other people will take his word for it , and some will rub their eyes and look a little more carefully ; so his book will be of signal service to me . ''

		All the same , the genial reviewer goes on to say , the book is in some respects quite misleading .

		Thereupon he proceeds to point out an obviously baseless criticism of a certain passage in '' Major
Barbara	PERSON	, '' and to convict the critic of making '' a howling misquotation ' ' from the play .

		Then , taking up Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's animadversions upon his abstinence from alcoholic beverages , the man of unspoiled relish for
Adam	PERSON	's ale continues , in pleasantly sarcastic vein : '' Teetotalism is , to Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, a strange and unnatural asceticism forced on men by an inhuman per - version of religion .

		Beer-drinking is to him , when his imagination runs away with him on paper , nothing short of the communion .

		He sees in every public-house a temple of the true catholic faith ... and he will see nothing but ' cold extravagance ' in my sure prevision of the strict regimen of Contrexeville water and saccharine in which his Bacchic priesthood will presently end . ''

		The article extends to some length , with much excellent fooling , and much that is a degree more serious than fooling , but none the less excellent .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	is rather well char - acterized as , '' at present , a man of vehement reactions ; and , like all reactionists , he usually empties the baby out with the bath . ''

		Finally , the suggestion is offered that a subscription be taken up for the purpose of sending Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	to
Ireland	LOCATION	for a two years ' sojourn .

		There he will learn many things . ''

		He will eat salmon and Irish stew and drink whisky prosaically , because he will hunger and thirst for food and drink , instead of drinking beer poetically because he thirsts for righteousness .

		And the facte will be firm under his feet , whilst the heavens are open over his head ; and his soul will become a torment to him , like the soul of the Wandering Jew , until he has achieved his appointed work , which is not that of spec - 282 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, ulating as to what I am here for , but of discovering and doing what he himself is here for . ''

		It is a pity that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's review could not be bound up with the book -- that
Chesterton	PERSON	on
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	and
Shaw on Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	could not go together to the reader , for his infinite delight and merriment .

		But the book as it stands is well worth while .

Bicknell	PERSON	.

		The
Foundations of Heredity	ORGANIZATION	.

		* While the scientific world was ringing with the first shock of controversy over the '' Origin of Species , '' an obscure monk in an Austrian convent garden was patiently observing the laws of heredity as manifested in successive genera - tions of peas .

		It is striking evidence of the eternal value of exact experimentation that the work of
Gregor Johann Mendel	PERSON	is to-day a living force in Biology perhaps only second to that of
Charles Darwin	PERSON	.

		Mendel 's communication on plant hybridiza - tion was made to the natural history society of Briinn in
1865	DATE	, and for thirty-five years re - mained totally unnoticed .

		In
1900	DATE	,
de Vries	ORGANIZATION	,
Correns	PERSON	, and Tschermak almost simultaneously called attention to the importance of his work ; and a new field of experimental study of her - edity came into being , with the name of
Mendel	PERSON	- ism .

		Professor
Bateson	PERSON	, of
the University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	, became the most ardent exponent of the new principle in
England	LOCATION	, and when the statistical school of biologists made light of it he published in
1902	DATE	a book entitled ''
Mendel	PERSON	's Principles of Heredity : A
Defence	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The present work is not a new edition of the old one , but a substitute for it .

		In view of the progress of Mendelian experiments during the last five years , it is less a defence of a new study than an exposition of the results of a tried and fruitful one .

		The essential points in
Mendel	ORGANIZATION	's observations were three in number .

		First , he found that many properties of his peas -- tallness , for example -- were inherited , as indivisible unit - characters .

		Each of the individual offspring of a cross was tall or short ; none half-way between .

		Second , one character might be dom - inant over the other , so that in a given plant it only would appear , while the latent or recessive character could be transmitted to a future genera - *

		tion .

		Third , and most important , he showed that in the formation of the germ-cells of a plant of mixed ancestry the opposite characters , dominant and recessive , separate ; so that each individual germ-cell has one , and one alone .

		For example , breeding a pure dwarf and a pure tall pea gives offspring all tall .

		Tallness is dominant .

		But the tall second generation contain the short ele - ment , as shown by further breeding .

		The third generation produced by self-fertilized seed of the second contains tall and short individuals in the proportion of three to one .

		The short ones , as shown by further breeding , have no tall ele - ment ; of the tall three-quarters , one quarter have only the tall element ; the other half are mixed , like their parents of the second genera - tion .

		The tall and short elements segregate so that each ovule or pollen grain has one alone ; and by '' chance '' recombination we get one - quarter pure tall , one-quarter pure dwarf , and one-half mixed , the latter appearing tall because that quality is dominant when both are present .

		Professor
Bateson	PERSON	's book is the most complete and authoritative presentation of the studies which have been made of inheritance phenomena of this sort ; and such studies are numerous and striking .

		He discusses Mendelian inheritance of almost numberless characters , such as size , color , smoothness , habit , resistance to specific disease , form of flower and seed , presence of starch , in plants ; and color , hornlessness , char - acter of coat or feathers , and peculiarities like the waltzing habit in mice , among animals .

		Many of the cases are complicated by the presence of numerous inter-related variables .

		Twenty-one distinct forms may be produced by separations and recombinations of elements in the offspring of two types of primrose .

		Professor
Bateson	PERSON	discusses all the most important of such cases in great detail , and with as much clearness as the abstruse nature of the subject-matter warrants .

		He includes practically all work up to
1908	DATE	, and is fair and just in estimating the importance of various contributions within the field of Mendelism .

		The book includes three interesting portraits of
Mendel	PERSON	, and handsome colored plates showing inheritance in sweet peas , primroses , fowls , mice , and moths .

		The principles of
Mendel	ORGANIZATION	will undoubtedly find place in that firm foundation for the theory of heredity which will some day be constructed ; and his careful experimental method offers perhaps the surest instrument for its upbuilding .

		It is unfortunate , however , that Professor
Bateson	PERSON	is .

		so occupied with the brilliant successes of Mendelian study that he can see no merit in
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 283 work of any other kind .

		The asperity of old conflicts might well be softened by omitting references to '' the so-called investigations of heredity '' by
Galton	PERSON	and
Pearson	PERSON	and the Bio - metrical school , as work which u has resulted only in the concealment of that order which it was ostensibly undertaken to reveal , '' and the statement that '' it will appear inexplicable that work so unsound in construction should have been respectfully received by the scientific world . ''

		Both the experimental and the statis - tical methods are required for the full elucidation of the truth .

		Professor
Bateson	PERSON	has a wide and just vision of the importance of the subject of Heredity -- or Genetics , as he prefers to call it .

		He says : '' It may be anticipated that a general recognition of the chief results of Mendelian analysis will bring about a profound change in man 's conception of his own nature and in his outlook on the world .

		Many have in all ages held the belief that our powers and characteristics are directly dependent on physical composition ; but when it becomes known that the dependence is so close that the hereditary descent of certain attributes can be proved to follow definite predicable formulae , these ideas acquire a solidity they never possessed before , and it is likely that the science of sociology will pass into a new phase .

		... It is not in dispute that the appearance of a char - acteristic may be in part decided by environmental influences .

		Opportunity given may decide that a char - acter manifests itself which without opportunity must have lain dormant .

		The question of opportunity and of the degree to which the conditions of life are opera - tive in controlling or developing characters will some day demand attention , but in order to answer such ques - tions successfully it is the first necessity that a knowl - edge of the genetic behavior of the factors should be obtained ... The outcome of genetic research is to show that human society can , if it so please , control its composition more easily than was previously supposed possible ... The power is in their hands and they will use that power like any other with which science can endow them .

		The consequence of such action will be immediate and decisive .

		For this revolution we do well to prepare . ''

		MISINTERPRETATION 'S OF THE CARLYXES .

		* Mr.
R. S. Craig	PERSON	, the author of a book which he curiously entitles '' The Making of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, '' has become dominated by a theory , which is allowed some more or less full expression on almost every page , at least of the latter part of the work .

		That theory is that
Jane Welsh	PERSON	was simply an ambitious but overrated and spiteful woman ; that she did not love
Carlyle	PERSON	, but did love
Edward Irving	PERSON	, and married
Carlyle	PERSON	for ambition : that
Froude	PERSON	is right in arguing that * The Making of Cablyle .

		By
R. S. Craig	PERSON	.

		New York :
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		she forced
Carlyle	PERSON	to marry her in consequence of Irving 's telling Mrs.
Montagu	PERSON	that
Miss Welsh	LOCATION	was in love with him ; that
Carlyle	PERSON	's caustic manner of describing his contemporaries is largely due to the example of his wife , to whom , in writing his Reminiscences , he sought , as it were , to make reparation for his neglect .

		It is of course a great pity that Mr.
Craig	PERSON	could not have deferred the publication of his volume till after the appearance of the recent `` Love Letters of Thomas
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Jane Welsh	PERSON	, '' * which would have given him ample evidence on some of these points .

		But it was not necessary to wait for the publication of these letters ; Mr.
Craig	PERSON	has not , it seems to us , correctly inter - preted the mass of evidence made accessible in a trustworthy form in the four volumes of u New Letters and Memorials of Thomas and of
Jane Welsh Carlyle	PERSON	, '' the
Correspondence of Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	and Goethe edited by Professor
Norton	PERSON	, and Mr.
David Wilson	PERSON	's volume on
Froude	PERSON	and
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		For example , the introduction to the '' New Letters and Memorials of
Jane Welsh Carlyle	PERSON	, '' as is well known , contains an admirable estimate of Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	; Sir
James Crichton	PERSON	-
Browne	PERSON	's view , there expressed , !

		has never been successfully controverted .

		Yet Mr.
Craig	PERSON	vir - tually ignores this view ; he has nothing what - ever to say about Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	's physical condi - tion , # which is of importance even in the early period more especially treated in his book .

		Nor is his book wholly free from errors in detail .

		For example , he says that by
June , 1821	DATE	,
Miss Welsh	LOCATION	had conveyed to her mother the use of Craigenputtock for life -LRB- p. 168 -RRB- ; whereas the letter enclosing this conveyance § is dated by the editor , Mr.
Alexander Carlyle	PERSON	, evidently on good authority ,
19 July , 1825	DATE	.

		From Mr.
Craig	PERSON	's reliance on
Froude	PERSON	-LRB- pp. 373f . -RRB-

		it would seem that he has not even seen Mr.
Alexander Carlyle	PERSON	's volumes !

		His admiration for
Froude	PERSON	is excessive , and is perhaps the cause of some of his own shortcomings .

		The only fault he lays at
Froude	PERSON	's door is an occasional misunderstanding of the evidence .

		Writing of the
Carlyles	ORGANIZATION	' differ - ences , he says -LRB- p. 372 -RRB- : '' After

Oct. 16	DATE	, had no letters to print in any grave way condemnatory of either ... Surely it is a mystery ; yet , after all , a very plain one , as we hope to prove .

		Everything points to the truthfulness and discretion of
Froude	PERSON	, but not to his comprehension of the facts .

		He was unaware of their significance . ''

		Froude telling the truth and only the truth !

		And this after the careful labors of Professor
Norton	PERSON	, Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	, and others , have utterly - discredited
Froude	PERSON	's work , both in general and in particular .

		The point would not be worth dwelling on were it not for the fact that occa - sionally a misguided admirer or defender of Froude * turns up and helps to prolong the life of his mythical story of the Carlyles .

		Even if there be a slight modicum of truth in his books , the sooner his grossly distorted and ignoble `` his - tory '' of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	is consigned to oblivion , the sooner will it be possible for a fair-minded public to learn and rightly appreciate the real facts .

		And this is not , of course , to say that
Froude	PERSON	, in the beginning at least , intentionally exagger - ated
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's faults .

		The whole trouble arose from the fact that
Carlyle	PERSON	's '' heightened and telling '' phraseology , the utterance of a strongly emotional nature , fell into the hands of one who flatly misunderstood it , and whose passionate fondness for the picturesque in biography dis - posed him to credit an utterly unfounded theory interpreting the strange phenomena of the Car - lyles ' married life .

		And having adopted this theory he felt bound to defend it , thus more and more calumniating the object of his worship .

		Thomas and
Jane Welsh Carlyle	PERSON	were far from angelic natures .

		They both possessed the fatal gift of sarcasm , and they doubtless did many persons injustice .

		The difference between them and others is that they dared to say openly and to write what many others dare only think or whisper .

		The consequences were disastrous , and they paid the penalty .

		But let it be re - membered that they were both trying to tell the truth -LRB- which is often painfully embarrassing -RRB- ; and that in many instances they probably suc - ceeded .

		Whatever else they may have been , they were not shams ; and they helped purge the air of some cant .

		To return , in closing , to Mr.
Craig	PERSON	, it is pain - ful to speak of his work as we have done , and we regret the necessity of doing so .

		The book con - tains also minor faults which help to strengthen the unfortunate impression it produces .

		Its bulkiness is inexcusable ; it would have gained immensely if its five hundred pages had been compressed into half that number .

		Needless repetitions occur on every page .

		Froude , for ♦ For example , in
The Nation	ORGANIZATION	, lxxxviii .

		418 .

		example , is called '' eloquent '' at least three times .

		Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	's encomium of ''
Sartor Resartus	PERSON	'' is printed at least as many times .

		Strange grammatical and rhetorical construc - tions abound ; for example , '' Neither he nor
Froude	PERSON	mention it '' -LRB- p. 94 -RRB- ; '' He had never ' assisted , ' as a young minister or doctor has so frequently to do , placing themselves for the first time under tutelage '' -LRB- p. 228 -RRB- ; '' inferior society than that '' -LRB- p. 338 -RRB- ; `` his Welsh kindred '' -LRB- p. 422 -RRB- ; '' the two conceived a mutual admira - tion for each other '' -LRB- p. 439 -RRB- ; ''
Carlyle	PERSON	found plenty friends '' -LRB- p. 440 -RRB- ; '' Would Milton be likely to find any publisher in the whole range of
London	LOCATION	to take Paradise Lost off his hands , let alone give him < # 10 for it ? ''

		-LRB- p. 446 -RRB- .

		French words are printed without accents , and the last syllable of Teufelsdroeckh always loses the e .

		The style at times is irritating ; there is a con - stant tendency to short jerky statements or ques - tions that might pass for epigrams ; for example , '' Fame ? ''

		-LRB- p. 433 -RRB- .

		On page 59 we meet with
Carlyle	PERSON	's refreshing etymology , Lord equals '' Law - ward '' !

		The fact that
Carlyle	PERSON	was originally responsible for this error does not excuse his biographer .

		The author has added another to the list of books in which
Carlyle	PERSON	and his wife are misin - terpreted and misrepresented .

		The successful biographer of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	is yet to appear .

		When he does arrive , he will prove to be a man who will be willing to give up a theory for the sake of the truth ; and he must have a keener insight than any of the '' poor fools '' -- to borrow the Sage 's own cheerful term -- who have yet attempted this most difficult task .

		THE DIAL 285 recognized contributions to complex aspects of modern science .

		Most of those of like reputation , who have yielded to the conclusion that the perplexing phenomena which they witnessed were not ex - plicable by the recognized laws of mind and matter , have yet expressed their conviction , at times regretfully , or it may be hesitantly , and commonly with a reserve that held aloof from extravagant explanation and uncritical credu - lity .

		The evidence has been endured , possibly , but hardly yet embraced .

		The Italian savant , however , having once admitted the possibility of phenomena that transcend ordinary experience , and having had recourse for his explanation to the intervention of departed spirits , feels no further limitations of logic or plausibility , and records with apparently equal acceptance the most variously assorted medley of miracles , albeit commonplace ones , and the crassest vio - lations of common law and common sense , that in our day and generation have been collected within a single volume under a reputable signa - ture .

		The reader , as he follows the narrative , must forcibly remind himself that he is exam - ining , not the wonder-book of a pre-scientific traveller with a generous appetite for good `` copy , '' but the conclusions reached with all the show of experiment and apparatus of a twentieth century laboratory student .

		It is not the purpose of the present notice to summarize the extensive so-called evidence , but only to indicate the attitude toward it of Pro- fessor
Lombroso	PERSON	.

		He informs the reader that by training and temperament he was strongly antagonistic to all this sort of occultism ; yet his conversion seems to have been easy , and to have been effected by an hysterical girl in whom he discovered the loss of vision , but who by com - pensation '' saw with the same degree of acute - ness at the point of the nose and the left lobe of the ear , '' and in whom also '' the sense of smell became transferred to the back of the foot . ''

		The same inventive subject predicted that on a certain day '' she would be delirious , and then would have seven cataleptic fits that would be healed with gold , '' all of which , mar - vellous to relate , ensued as predicted .

		But the crowning instrument of his conversion was the Italian peasant medium ,
Eusapia Paladino	PERSON	, whose advent to our shores is now heralded .

		In the presence of this woman , physics , chemistry , and physiology retire abashed , while psychology is silenced in confusion .

		Chairs and tables and large pieces of furniture move about with motives of their own , but unmoved by human forces ; metronomes start themselves going , and all sorts of scientific apparatus is pressed into a travesty of service to prove that the medium is innocent of the phenomena that occur in her presence .

		None the less , the same
Eusapia	PERSON	has at times indulged in freeing one of her hands to move objects or give raps ; in lifting the table with her knees ; and in slyly removing a hair from her head to fasten it to one of the instru - ments so as to influence its registration ; in gathering flowers before the sittings , which later were to appear miraculously '' apported '' ; but all this without in the least disturbing the con - fidence of her observers in her genuine mani - festations .

		The difficulties of the situation must be evi - dent when Professor Lombroso apologetically records that '' It is now certain that supernu - merary spectral limbs are superimposed on her true limbs , and act as their substitutes .

		These phantom doubles used to be often taken for her normal arms . ''

		The `` spirit-forms '' that appear in the presence of mediums are thus explained : '' This fact proves that the body of spectral appear - ance is formed at the expense of the body of the psychic , and the matter is confirmed by the circumstance that in the first materializations of mediums many of the phantasms they evoke bear a certain resemblance to the face or the limbs of the mediums , or even to the whole of his or her person . ''

		Accordingly , when one of
Lombroso	PERSON	's col - leagues declines to accept a spirit-form as that of his mother , because of the conflict between what was presented and the actual truth , he is urged to bear in mind that spirits , unused to the vocal mechanism of the medium , must make mistakes , and that their behavior must be excused . ''

		He lays stress also upon the fact that the phantasm had a fuller bust than his mother , not remembering that the phantasms assume the words , gestures , and body of the medium .

		This should also have explained for him the vulgar habit of playfully biting the beloved one , which is common to all the other phantasms evoked by
Eusapia	LOCATION	from whom they borrow it . ''

		Instances like the following are recorded as facts without trace of hesitation . ''

		The child Yencker gave raps when two months old .

		... The nephew of
Seymour	PERSON	wrote automatically when nine days old ; at the age of seven months he gave typtological communications . ''

		Once more , a medium in forming her spirit companion found that '' she herself had lost her knees and feet .

		But if she touched the place where they normally should be , she felt pain .

		Hence an invisible part of them existed . ''

		The same thing happened to
Eusapia	LOCATION	, whose '' con - 286 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, trol '' explained that he had removed her lower limbs to decrease her weight for the levitation .

		Now as to explanation , let this suffice : '' There is also another singular attribute of mediums which we must admit in order to explain certain spirit - ualistic phenomena ; namely , the fact that in the psy - chological atmosphere of the medium in a trance , and by the medium 's own action , the conditions of matter are modified , just as if the space in which the phe - nomena takes place , belonged not to three but to four dimensions , in which -LRB- according to the theory of the mathematicians -RRB- the law of gravity and the law of the impenetrability of matter should suddenly fail , and the laws that rule time and space should suddenly cease , so that a body from a far-off point may all at once find itself near by , and you may find a bunch of freshest flowers in your coat-pocket , without their showing any trace of being spoiled . ''

		Similarly , as time is inverted , the medium reads the future as we should recall the past .

		Yet this power is curiously limited . ''

		As respects the lottery , -- something in which all the village population of the province of
Naples	LOCATION	are sin - ners , -- she had no success whatever in premonitions , but in compensation possessed a singular telepathic power . ''

		Or consider this explanation of the passage of objects out of a closed room , which procedure naturally involves a transit through wood or glass or bricks . ''

		Either it must pass through the panes of glass without coming apart or breaking up , -- that is to say , its atoms must pass through the inter-atomic spaces of the panes ; or else it must be decomposed into impon - derable material -LRB- an operation which we not happily call ' dematerialization ' -RRB- before passing the walls , and afterwards be recom posed ; or else , in order to appear and disappear without passing through the wails at all , it would be necessary for it to pass into the fourth dimension of space , and then , returning , emerge from that again . ''

		Surely , in this strain there is no need to con - sider anything as more remarkable or less worthy of credence than anything else , and the testimony of apparatus and the records of photographs become a mere travesty of a scientific procedure .

		If this is the type of popular scientific presenta - tion that is to shape opinion , the task to be faced by those with real concern for the hygiene of popular logic seems stupendous .

		Where , indeed , are we to find the sturdiness of view and criti - cal conservatism that form the safeguard of modern thinking ?

		One can only pause dumb - founded , and ask , '' After Lombroso -- What ? ''

		And yet the reflection remains that it is no longer exceptional for the man of scientific train - ing to use the logic of his own specialty with moderate success , and yet reserve a corner of his intellectual domain free from the invasions of logic and open to the satisfaction of a dra - matic instinct or temperamental longing .

		It is none the less natural to assume that the per - sonal factor in the exercise of the two pursuits is not wholly different .

		Of this there are occa - sional corroborations in the tendency to yield to alluring theories , and accordingly to abandon that sane perspective of importance which more than anything else forms the heart of the scien - tific temper .

		In this aspect , the psychology of reputable believers in disreputable tales becomes yet more interesting than the psychology of the tales themselves ; and such is the case of
Lombroso	LOCATION	.

		The
Doves Press Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		* It was inevitable , probably , that in his work at the
Doves Press	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Cobden-Sanderson	PERSON	would sooner or later get around to Shake - speare .

		In his five - volume edition of the
Bible	LOCATION	, brought to completion nearly five years ago , he gave a monumental setting to the first of all books ; and now a volume devoted to '' Hamlet '' marks the beginning of a similar service for the writings which , in the estimate of English - speaking peoples at least , rank second in the peerage of literature .

		It must not be under - stood , however , that we are ultimately to have a complete Shakespeare in this form ; Mr.
Cobden	PERSON	-
Sanderson	PERSON	is not a young man , and conditions of work at the
Doves Press	ORGANIZATION	preclude hasty pro- duction .

		The present plan contemplates a selec - tion of some dozen plays only , to be approached by stages .

		The first stage embraces the four supreme tragedies -- '' Hamlet , '' ''
Lear	PERSON	, '' '' Othello , '' and '' Macbeth . ''

		The publication of these will occupy at least two years ; at the end of that time another stage will be under - taken , -- or it may be decided to stop with the Tragedies above mentioned .

		The plan of presentment involves something more than a mere reprint of Shakespeare in beautiful dress , in the modern accepted form of the text .

		Believing that a capacity for appre - ciating literature in the form in which it was originally given to the world is worth cultivating , Mr.
Cobden-Sanderson	PERSON	has gone back for his text to the original editions , following almost literally the old spelling and punctuation , and avoiding the division into acts and scenes intro - duced into later editions .

		Thus , the present '' Hamlet '' reproduces the second quarto im - printed at
London	LOCATION	in
1604	DATE	, with such portions * The Tragicall Historie of Hamlet , Prince of
Denmark	LOCATION	.

		By
William Shakespeare	PERSON	.

		Limited edition .

		Printed by
T. J. Cobden-Sanderson	PERSON	at the
Doves Press	ORGANIZATION	,
Hammersmith	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	.


1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 287 of the first folio of
1623	DATE	as are not contained in the quarto .

		Such a presentment would , of course , be '' cauiary to the generall '' -LRB- as this text has it -RRB- ; but to those for whom the present edition is intended , there can not but be a decided charm in reading '' Hamlet '' as it was actually written , with all the atmosphere of the original printing successfully preserved .

		Those familar with the
Doves Press	ORGANIZATION	books know that they do not depend at all for their distinction , as the volumes printed by
William Morris	PERSON	did in large degree , upon elaborate orna - mentation .

		A '' flourished '' initial at the be - ginning is the only note of decoration in this edition of '' Hamlet . ''

		The charm of the book is wholly inherent in the type and its arrange - ment , in the presswork and the paper .

		Except for two or three fantastic characters , such as the freakish interrogation point , the type is both beautiful and legible ; the presswork is doubt - less as near perfection as may be attained ; and the paper could scarcely be bettered for the purpose .

		There is , however , a feature of the typography , the type arrangement , which , although some may think it trivial and others justifiable , seems to us so serious , and to involve so fundamental a misconception of the laws of typographic art , that we can not pass it without protest .

		We refer to the '' spacing '' of the letter-press of the book .

		Now as the printing art is at present known and practised among men , the only way in which the group of letters composing a single word may be presented to the eye as a distinct unit -- as a word-form -- is by leaving a blank -LRB- technically , a '' space ' * -RRB- between the word and its neighbors .

		The space being indispensable , the only question is simply how much space .

		In his essay on '' The Book Beautiful , '' Mr.
Cobden-Sanderson	PERSON	has laid down the precept that '' the whole duty of Typography is to com - municate to the imagination , without loss by the way , the thought or image intended to be con - veyed by the writer , '' a dictum which , in another form , has the authority of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	.

		Now we maintain that there must be distinct and decided loss of the author 's thought or image when the space between words in a printed page is so slight that the reader is continually puzzled and retarded in his reading .

		The puzzlement may be unconscious or subconscious ; the loss is nevertheless actual .

		Through long usage the eye has become accustomed to a certain minimum space between words ; an arbitrary reduction of this space to a half or a third the customary amount results in visual distress of no slight degree .

		We are familiar enough with the theory underlying this microscopic separation of words .

		It is held that the conventional spacing of type results in a printed page made ragged and unsightly by irregular spots of white over its whole extent , -- sometimes , as in the poorer sort of machine composition , where over-spacing is the rule , the effect is that of jagged perpendic - ular rows of words rather than of ordered hori - zontal lines .

		To avoid these blemishes , and to produce a page of even harmonious tone and color , very thin spacing is held to be essential .

		If a printed page were meant to be merely dec - orative , there would be something in this con - tention ; but the primary purpose of a book is to be read , and no principle is sound aesthetically which seriously interferes with this essential function .

		We have dealt rather more fully with this point than might perhaps seem warranted .

		But the defect is to us an important one , and it happens also to be a defect not confined to Mr.
Cobden-Sanderson	PERSON	's work .

		It is found in even more marked degree in the volumes produced by
William Morris	PERSON	at the
Kelmscott Press	ORGANIZATION	; it is prominent in the work of two of our most artistic printers , Mr.
Bruce Rogers	PERSON	and Mr.
Updike	PERSON	.

		Whatever may be the abstract reasons in its defence , we believe few readers will dis - agree with us that its practical application , in books intended to be read , results in confusion and irritation .

		A happy medium , in this as in so many things , is the goal to seek .

		In general effect , this latest volume from the Doves Press amply fulfils Mr.
Cobden	PERSON	-
Sanderson	PERSON	's well-expressed ideal of workman - ship , -- it is indeed a thing of '' order touched with delight . ''

		To the student of Shakespeare who is also a lover of beautiful bookmaMng , its appeal will be irresistible .

		That we may finally have the whole of Shakespeare in this form , is a consummation devoutly to be wished .


Waldo R. Browne	PERSON	.

		Has the Hudson grown less pictur - o/a ^ s ^ d ^ . '

		es < l ue since the day 3 of C ° le and
Durand	PERSON	?

		In some places , certainly , yes : brickyards and quarries and railroads will do much to deprive anything of picturesqueness .

		The Hudson is no longer the almost primeval river it was when all
New York	LOCATION	state had a population smaller than can now be found in the island of
Manhattan	LOCATION	.

		But is what is still as in older days less picturesque ?

		One would almost think so from 288 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	's book , '' The Picturesque Hudson '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Much as Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	has that is interesting about the great river that , histori - cally at least , holds first place in American art and letters , it seems to us that he has done little to present what he calls its chief quality .

		Of course people 's ideas of the picturesque will differ : it is not remarkable that Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's should be different from that of
Thomas Cole	PERSON	, but it is at least worth noting .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	is a skilful observer and writer ; his book has much that is good in its history , gossip , description , as well as in its pictures .

		But it shows that if he is right , there has passed away a glory from the
Hudson	LOCATION	.

		We do not mean that Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	chooses unpicturesque subjects ; it is proper for a true idea of the Hudson , that we should have the locks at Troy , the wharves at
Albany	LOCATION	, the
Poughkeepsie	LOCATION	bridge , the battery at
New York	LOCATION	.

		Nor need such scenes be unpicturesque ; the picture of the
Haverstraw	LOCATION	Brickyards is one of the best in the book .

		We mean that he does not give any pictur - esque character to those places that we should nat - urally think of as picturesque , and which some people can still find as romantically beautiful as they were to the
Hudson River School	ORGANIZATION	-- such places as
Anthony	PERSON	's Nose , the Northern Gateway of the
Highlands	LOCATION	, the Tappan See , the
Palisades	LOCATION	.

		Of these more purely landscape scenes in the book , the only one we really admire is the view near
Fishkill	LOCATION	.

		Here Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	has been singularly happy in composition and execution .

		But in the main his Hudson is sadly uninteresting : if it could have offered no more , it would never have inspired Irving and
Morris	PERSON	and
Willis	PERSON	.

		Yet in reality the
Hudson	LOCATION	preserves its ancient charm : from
Sunnyside	LOCATION	and
Undercliff	LOCATION	and Idlewild it is still as lovely as ever .

		And though one miss the affectionate romanticism that gave the river a wonderful glory in the older days , yet still one may find a pictorial quality and a literary charm , unless one be ultra-modern and realistic .

		But one would hardly suspect it from Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's testimony .

		The deeper '' The Human Way '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- , by meanings Mrs.
Louise Collier Willcox	PERSON	, is a col - oflife - lection of essays written with , at times , an almost startling insight into the deeper meanings of life .

		Toward the end of the book occurs this definition , perhaps a new one , of genius : '' In - deed , what we call genius , as distinguished from talent , or learning , or accomplishment , is really a power of strong appeal to the great masses of man - kind which grows out of profound self-knowledge . ''

		Something of this profound self-knowledge that amounts to genius Mrs.
Willcox	PERSON	's chapters certainly reveal .

		She demonstrates most convincingly the oneness of human experience and shows that a rich individual life is impossible apart from a rich col - lective existence .

		Something of the bracing influ - ence of that pragmatism or personal idealism that is now in the air is felt in her stimulating pages , as when she asserts : `` So it comes to seem but the short-sightedness of youth that wailed over limited scope for effort or an uncongenial atmosphere ; for whatever atmosphere we desire and think about , we make ; and whatever ideal we hold , we create ; and only those who dream fitfully fail to make their dreams come true .

		To come slowly to this realiza - tion is to accept no outlook as final . ''

		In the essay on '' The Service of Books , '' from which the fore - going is taken , there are many other good things ; but there is also a rather harsh and summary treat - ment of Tennyson against which protest rises .

		After observing , with a degree of truth , that '' it is a truism that he who writes for his own generation renounces the next , '' the author continues : ''
Tennyson	PERSON	spoke to the thought of his own day and then fell back . ''

		But it was long years before his contemporaries would listen to him , and it is not hard to find lines and even whole poems of his that will not soon be suffered to die .

		Mrs.
Willcox	PERSON	's style appeals to the well-read : she is steeped in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	and betrays her fondness for
Browning	PERSON	,
Swinburne	LOCATION	, and Mere - dith ; and the body of her thought is not inferior to its garb .

		Now that people can read for them - maslue tmaS selves , they rather prefer to read their poetry at home .

		In Shake - speare 's day , thousands heard poetry on a stage who heard it nowhere else .

		Nowadays millions have poetry in books who never dream of it on the stage .

		Yet the drama remains a delightful poetic means , and in spite of theatrical critics who condemn `` the closest drama '' there are still written plays that the poet never thought of having produced .

		Whether such be the case with Mr.
Louis J. Block	PERSON	's '' The World 's Triumph '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- we will not make sure .

		There are those who believe that anything will do on the stage if there are people who want to act it and others who want to see it . ''

		Faust , '' ''
Manfred	PERSON	, '' u Peer Gynt , '' are examples .

		We judge , however , that Mr.
Block	PERSON	prefers the dramatic form because it enables him to present imaginatively some of his hopes and thoughts on life and the present world .

		So at least we read his play .

		Science , the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, the People , even the
State	ORGANIZATION	, are at a standstill .

		The loosing of the world-riddle comes from the simplicity of devoted faith .

		We believe that in his Epilogue Mr.
Block	PERSON	has rightly criticized himself : he has woven us a strange and wondrous mystery in an age that loves the clear and simple .

		This imaginative and melodious presentation , this pageant of ideal and poetic figures , seems to belong to an earlier age than ours .

		The work is , indeed , more a Christmas masque than a modern play , and must be read largely in the spirit of the past .

		In the confusion and turmoil of low ambitions and big attempts , the poet offers us a dream of faith .

		It would be aside from a true appreciation to offer definite dramatic criticism , and we prefer merely to recommend the play to readers who will take it for what it is , who
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 289 will read and find in poetic form food for thought and perhaps for the solution of difficulty .

		If one think there is no unanswerable argument , one may at least gain insights worthy of trust .

		A series of essays illustrating social Geo ^ ianel-a .

		England in the eighteenth century , by Mr.
John Fyvie	PERSON	, is issued in a volume entitled `` Wits ,
Beaux	LOCATION	, and Beauties of the Georgian Era '' -LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		These essays , eight in number , take the form of biographical sketches with the emphasis placed on the social aspects of life .

		Some of these were well worth writing : the introductory essay on
Samuel Foote	PERSON	, the '' English Aristophanes , '' is particularly interesting not only as a vigorous defence of the actor-dramatist , but also for the light that it sheds on the world that
Foote	ORGANIZATION	satirized on the
London	LOCATION	stage .

		The author supports his conclusions by quoting liberally from
Foote	ORGANIZATION	's plays .

		Valuable , too , is the account of the
Duchess of Queensberry	ORGANIZATION	's eccentricities , though mainly for the glimpses that it affords us of Gay and Swift .

		There seems , however , to be little reason for giving pro- longed attention to the careers of ^ such persons as the Duchess of
Kingston	LOCATION	and the Countess of
Suffolk	LOCATION	, whose titles to fame rest on their moral delin - quencies only .

		Mr.
Fyvie	PERSON	's work contains little that is new or original ; it serves rather to emphasize opinions commonly held by giving concrete illus - trations .

		In his selection of instances the author is usually discreet ; and no attempt is made to enlist our sympathies for unworthy subjects .

		His work is throughout a very readable one ; the English is delightful , though at times somewhat informal ; but stately periods would scarcely seem in place in a discussion of the jokes of
George Selwyn	PERSON	and the broad humor of the '' clerical wit , '' the Rev.
John Warner	ORGANIZATION	,
D.D.	LOCATION	.

		A manual for In his little treatise on '' Writing the writers of the Short Story '' -LRB-
Hinds	PERSON	, Noble & short story .

		Eldredge -RRB- , the author , Mr.
Esenwein	PERSON	, has approached the short story as an historian , as a maker of text-books , and as a literary adviser .

		It is always difficult to ride three horses at once , and in this instance they are not all guided with equal felicity .

		To be candid , the introductory chapters which discuss the rise of the short story are too brief , too general , and too cut up by quotations from various authorities , to be useful .

		It would be well to know more about the history of the short story than may be learned from these pages , if one wished to profess a knowledge of the subject .

		Again , the later chapters , which are more thorough , more authoritative , and always interesting , are split up into a multitude of sections and sub-divisions , filled with quotations from earlier criticisms , and sown with illustrations until it is doubtful whether an immature student of the elements of short-story writing could emerge with a clear idea of the whole matter .

		As history , and as an elementary text-book , Mr.
Esenwein	PERSON	's book is not wholly satisfactory .

		But as a handbook and manual for literary aspirants who are trying to write salable stories , as a reference - book for college students who show more ability in narrative than the usual course in rhetoric requires , this work deserves a hearty recommendation .

		It is full of interesting criticisms , valuable comments , and stimulating suggestions .

		If the teacher of narrative can not use it with his elementary courses , he can assuredly poach upon it for material to make these classes more effective .

		And the writer who is try - ing to compose not a theme but a short story will find that the editor of ''
Lippincott	PERSON	's Magazine '' has made good use of the practical experience of his editorship .

		Vernon Lee 's A boU g h ° f the Duddin g W t ™ ^ OT latest book bay laurel , fastened to the dash - of essays .

		board of a street-car in
Rome	LOCATION	by a poor road-mender who had a love of the beautiful , furnished Miss Violet Paget -LRB- `` Vernon Lee '' -RRB- with a name for her latest book , '' Laurus Nobilis '' -LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which pleads in eloquent strain the cause of beauty .

		Three significant coincidences , early pointed out , indicate the line of argument followed by the author .

		These coincidences are : '' that between development of the aesthetic faculties and the development of the altruistic instincts ; that between development of a sense of aesthetic harmony and a sense of the higher harmonies of universal life ; and , before everything else , the coincidence between the preference for aesthetic pleasures and the nobler growth of the individual . ''

		Miss Paget heartily believes in the '' vital connection between beauty and every other noble object of our living , '' and she emphasizes the difference between the low , passive , or sensual pleasures , and the higher beneficent and active delights of the soul .

		The highest aesthetic satisfactions are dissociated with ownership and self - indulgence ; they are attainable to the reverent and the pure-minded ; but , by one of the ironies of what is commonly called civilization , are beyond the reach of the toiling money-getter .

		Walter
Pater	PERSON	's influ - ence is felt throughout the book , both in unconscious imitation of his parenthetic style and in occasional quotation or allusion .


Ruskin	PERSON	also has left his stamp on the writer 's mind .

		In spite of the much fine writing in the book , one feels the earnest sincerity of it all .

		A casual reference to a bank-holiday journey in a third-class compartment , with a goat and numerous other fellow-passengers , lends weight to the writer 's advocacy of the simple life and the inexpensive pleasures .

		The book is one to read slowly and take to heart .

		Professor
William Edward Simonds of Knox College	ORGANIZATION	has followed up his text-book on English literature with a similar `` Student 's History of American Litera - ture '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , although the historical setting has been less dwelt upon in the later work because of its assumed familiarity to the student .

		From the earliest colonial attempts at literature down to the very latest noteworthy novel , the author has traced with care and judgment the outlines of our literary Outlines of American literature .

		The editor is Mr.

		Besides a page of comment on each picture , he has written Introductions to the four chronological periods into which , by style and tendency , the pictures are grouped , and has compiled , for an appendix , brief biog - raphical notes of the artists represented .

		One can hardly imagine a more attractive and at the same time profitable way of studying British art in informal , amateur fashion than by the perusal of this beautiful picture book .

		The reproductions , nearly 200 in number , are well chosen and of excellent quality .

		These great poets are indeed represented , but not typically , the intention of the work being to serve as an introduction to the study of the great period which began with them .

		There are seventy-eight numbers in the entire anthology , equally divided between the two sections , each number being a book , an author , or a literary group .

Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, includes both series of the famous anthology in a single volume .

		It is the best selection of lyrics that we have , despite the fact that the editor 's judgment did not in the second series display the unerring quality that was exemplified in the first .

		`` A Dictionary of Quotations from English and American Poets , '' revised and enlarged by Miss
Anna L. Ward	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in their thin-paper series of poets .

		Other volumes of this series are a
Wordsworth	LOCATION	with
Lord Morley	ORGANIZATION	's introductory essay , and a
Lowell	PERSON	-LRB- the early poems now out of copyright -RRB- edited by Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	.

		A '' Source History of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' prepared by Professors
Howard Walter Caldwell	PERSON	and
Clark Edmund Persiuger	PERSON	, is announced by
Messrs. Ainsworth & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The plan of the book is to present a fairly consecutive and connected history of the evolution of the American nation and people , the emphasis being placed throughout upon political and social ideas and ideals .

		The '' Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society '' for its thirtieth session are published by
Messrs. Williams & Norgate	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are seven papers and two symposia , besides the customary official matter .

		Among the contributors are Messrs.
F. C. S. Schiller	PERSON	,
Bernard Bosanquet	PERSON	,
J. H. Muirhead	PERSON	, and
G. F. Stout	ORGANIZATION	.

		Discus - sions of such subjects as
Bergson	PERSON	and Pluralism show that the Society is nothing if not up to date . ''

		The Stage History of
Shakespeare 's King Richard the Third	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Miss
Alice I. Perry Wood	PERSON	, is a recent publication of the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Perhaps no other of the plays has had such varied fortunes as this , or has suffered under such an indignity as was laid upon it by
Colley Cibber	PERSON	.

		The chapter on the fortunes of tragedy in
America	LOCATION	, at the hands of
Kean	PERSON	,
Forrest	LOCATION	,
Booth	LOCATION	,
Irving	LOCATION	, and
Mansfield	PERSON	, is of peculiar interest .

		Attractive little bibliographies of
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	and
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	, based on material in the
Brooklyn Public Library	LOCATION	, are issued by that institution , in uniform shape with its former centennial biblio - graphies .

		The lists cover fourteen and sixteen duo - decimo pages respectively , and contain all that even a specialist has much need to concern himself with .

		In the
Johnson	PERSON	list the critical eye notes a misspelling of
Lichfield	PERSON	-LRB- with a superfluous t -RRB- on page nine .

		Thirteen new volumes of ''
Crowell	PERSON	's Shorter French Texts '' have just been issned .

		They include three plays of Moliere -LRB- '' L'Avare , '' '' Le
Bourgeois Gentil	PERSON	-

		de Bawr ; a ''
Choix de Poe	PERSON	`` sies Faciles , '' edited by Mr.
W. M. Daniels	PERSON	; an abridgment of '' L'Avocat Patelin '' ; a selection of `` Poemes X apoleoniens '' ; and a `` Choix de Contes Populaires de la Haute-Bretagne . ''

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a volume of '' Readings in
American Government	ORGANIZATION	and Politics , '' by Professor
Charles A. Beard	PERSON	, -- a source-book to accompany the author 's text upon this subject , now in course of
prepa	LOCATION	- ration .

		The selections are 237 in number , grouped in 32 chapters , from '' Colonial Origins of American In - stitutions '' down to recent '' Social and Economic Leg - islation . ''

		The book affords a very valuable adjunct to the work of instruction in American history and politi - cal science .

		A new volume has just been published by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	in the series of ''
Original Narratives of Early American History	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It has for its contents `` Narra - tives of
New Netherland	LOCATION	'' from
1609	DATE	to
1664	DATE	, and is edited by Professor
J. Franklin Jameson	PERSON	.

		The Hudson narratives of van Meteres and
Robert Juet	PERSON	lead off in the list of contents , which ends with
Stuyvesant	ORGANIZATION	's report of the surrender of the province to the English .

		There are an even score of documents altogether , most of them translated from the Dutch .

		An article on '' The Religion of a Sensible American , '' by President
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	, is now published as a booklet , with additions , by the
American Unitarian Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		It originally appeared in the ''
Hibbert	PERSON	Journal . ''

		In it the author has '' set forth the religious belief and work of a friend , no longer living ; one who could stand without question as a sensible man , and one whose thought and life were typical of the best which we may call American . ''

		He is not named in the text , but the book is dedicated to the memory of the bite
Wilbur Wilson Thoburn	PERSON	, of
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Welcome to English readers is a translation of
M. Bede	PERSON	's `` Rembrandt und seine Zeitgenossen . ''

		It is called '' Great Masters of Dutch and Flemish Painting '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , and the vivacity and picturesqueness of the original has been well preserved by the translator ,
Margaret L. Clark	PERSON	.

		Rembrandt is of course the prin - cipal figure ; nowhere else will one find his life and work more sympathetically described .

		But
Frans Hals	PERSON	,
Rubens	PERSON	, and
Van Dyck	PERSON	, the Dutch masters of the genre picture , of landscape and of still-life , each has separate and dignified treatment .

		The illustrations , forty in number , have been well chosen , but are less clearly reproduced than they should be .

		The '' Bulletin of the
Library Association of Port	ORGANIZATION	- bind , '' which appears monthly -LRB- excepting
July	DATE	and
August	DATE	-RRB- , calls attention to some of the good books of all time , and also to some of the good books of the present time as represented by the library 's latest accessions .

		Another designation of this library is the '' Free Public Library of
Multonomah County	LOCATION	, '' which makes it evident that
Portland	LOCATION	in
Oregon	LOCATION	, and not
Portland	LOCATION	in
Maine	LOCATION	, is the city rejoicing in the possession of so intelligently active an institution .

		The
September	DATE	number of the Bulletin opens with a short list of the best essayists , each title followed by a quoted criticism .

		In this and the other departments of the little paper economy of space and printer 's ink is carried so far as to give , with a few exceptions , only the last names of authors , as '' Smith .

		Mr.

		It is a matter of common knowledge to all who are familiar with the Armenian struggle for religious freedom , that political forces have been a strong factor in the persecution to which this people has been periodically subjected .

		All the sidelights which the condition of European politics could throw on the situation have been employed by the author , and his sympathetic treatment leaves the reader with a clear understanding of the various motives for the frequent outbreaks against the Armenians which have aroused the Christian world .

		THE CAMERALISTS : The Pioneers of German Social Polity By albion w. small To readers of English only , cameralism is virtually a lost chapter in the history of the social sciences .

America	LOCATION	could correctly define the term , and few could name more than one or two writers to whom it is properly applied .

		In this volume there is given to readers of English the first reliable and detailed account of the cameralistic school .

		The present volume is an intimate and charming account of
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	's personal side and his home life , written by his daughter-in-law .

		It tells much that no one outside the family circle could tell ; it mentions many things that Mr.

		The early Dutch merchants and patroons lived in much greater comfort and even elegance than any one nowadays but antiquarians suppose .

		And at the same time he makes it seem real and as true to all the best and the finest in human nature as , for instance , a Balzac novel is true to the worst , the vulgarest , and the most bestial ... If you like leisurely reading that twists around through all sorts of unexpected bypaths and indulges in all manner of little quips and quaint turns , and throws little pellets of philosophy at you when you least expect them , and makes cynical observations with an endearing smile and humorous ones with a serious face .

		But the people who demand a thrill on every page should be warned to pass by on the other side and buy some other book . ''

		The classics exist ; and we all know about them , or possess a hazy ac - quaintance with them , but it is necessary for some apostle of culture like Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	to stimulate our interest in them by graceful introductions and wisely chosen selections , in order that we turn our attention from magazines and news - papers to the wonderful literature which is the heritage of all who speak the English tongue .

		That public education is the function of the
State	ORGANIZATION	rather than of the municipality , is a prin - ciple that we have always maintained .

		The
State	ORGANIZATION	is bound to see to it that throughout its area the means of education are provided upon as ample a scale as the general prosperity of the commonwealth makes advisable .

		The parsimony of the particular locality must not be permitted to keep its schools below the generally accepted standard , and the locality which would find it a real hardship to provide the needed support is entitled to assistance at the expense of more favored communities .

		On the other hand , the essentials being secured by law , the business of administration is distinctly a local affair , and it is in the last degree unwise for
the State	ORGANIZATION	to prescribe matters of detail , or to interfere in questions that call for expert educational know - ledge .

		The average legislature is about as well fitted to handle such delicate questions as it would be to regulate the circulation of books by public libraries or the scientific management of hospitals .

		If we try to imagine the law of the
State	ORGANIZATION	declaring that no library shall pay more than a dollar a volume for any of its books , or that the patients in every hospital shall be given fixed doses of certain specified drugs once a week , we shall have an exact parallel to the sort of educa - tional legislation which is imposed with blithe and self-satisfied ignorance upon the hapless schools of many a town and city throughout this country .

		Through the efforts of well-meaning people , whose judgment is as faulty as their intentions are good , a considerable number of our states have long been burdened with laws imposing upon their schools a cast-iron require - ment concerning the teaching of physiology with reference to the use of alcohol and tobacco .

		The mischievous ingenuity of these laws is almost beyond belief .

		They demand that certain dog - mas be enforced upon children with the most damnable iteration year after year , -- dogmas that even a child 's experience knows to be unsound ; and they make it almost impossible for text-books of physiology written in scientific language to be used in public schools .

		Men of science are practically unanimous in condemning 320 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, these requirements , but the fanatics and doc - trinaires have their way with the legislatures , and the voice of reason avails for nothing .

		Thus science is discredited , the canker of insincerity affects the teacher 's work , and reasonable admonition against the evils of intemperance misses its opportunity altogether .

		The
Illinois	LOCATION	legislature at its last session distinguished itself by imposing two singularly foolish laws upon the public schools of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of these laws fixes a maximum price for every text-book used in the elementary schools ; that is , it forbids the authorization of any text - book that the publishers do not offer to supply at or below the price thus specified .

		The other law imposes upon all the teachers in the State the obligation to devote a certain amount of time each week to the inculcation of ideas con - cerning the humane treatment of the lower animals .

		Considering now the first of these amazing prescriptions , it is to be noted that the prices fixed are far below those at which the best books are obtainable .

		There is no reason to believe that the best books will be offered at the spe - cified prices , for the simple reason that compe - tition has already forced their prices to about as low a level as possible .

		Despite the '' book trust '' bogey that obsesses many minds , com - petition among school-book publishers has al - ready made unreasonable prices a practical impossibility , and the margin of practicable reduction is a narrow one in most cases .

		The only possible effect of the law must then be to force the substitution of distinctly inferior books for many of those hitherto in use .

		Now to save the child a
few cents	MONEY	in the price of one of his school books is as good an example of a penny - wise and pound-foolish policy as could well be imagined .

		It runs counter to the elementary truism that a text-book is a tool , an instrument of precision , and that it has to be employed in one of the most delicate of the arts .

		A teacher who does not have the use of the best book available is like a railway engineer furnished with a cheap watch , a meteorological expert with a cheap barometer , or a violinist with a cheap fiddle .

		In these cases , the use of the inferior implement would be universally recog - nized as an inconceivable folly ; but in the case of the teacher , there seems to exist in many minds a notion that the implements he uses do not greatly matter .

		The making of text-books is now comparable in refinement , in the nice fitting of means to ends , with the making of microscopes and chronometers , and the best of them would be cheap at almost any price .

		The injury done to education by debarring the best books from use is immeasurably greater than the benefit derived from the trifling economy that is thus effected .

		Our second law , the one that makes humane instruction compulsory in all the
Illinois	LOCATION	schools , is a legislative `` freak '' which it is difficult to discuss seriously .

		All competent moralists are agreed that the one way not to be employed in developing the ethical instincts is the way of direct precept at stated periods .

		Yet in the present instance one particular sort of moral training is singled out , and is to be forced down the throats of all the young people at school in weekly doses of half-hour size -LRB- although daily six-minute doses are considerately permitted as an alternative -RRB- , and this process is to be contin - ued ad nauseam from the kindergarten to the college .

		A plan better calculated to dull the moral consciousness and make the sympathies callous could hardly have been devised , and in the very name of the humanity which the mis - guided sponsors of this law seek to foster we enter our protest against it .

		Moreover , not content with securing its primary aim of uni - versal instruction in this subject , the law makes the drastic requirement that the instruction shall be given by every teacher in every school supported by public taxation in the
State	ORGANIZATION	, enforcing the requirement by the penalty of a heavy fine for non-compliance .

		This means that a weekly half-hour shall be devoted to the work in every elementary school , every high and normal school , and even -LRB- for the law makes no allowances -RRB- in the
State University	ORGANIZATION	.

		It also makes teachers of all sorts , special teachers in all the higher schools , teachers of singing and drawing and chemistry and gymnastics and geometry , amenable to the law and the penalty provided .

		Such a law , however unwise , is at least workable in an elementary school , where every teacher instructs the same group of chil - dren in a variety of subjects ; but in its appli - cation to one of the higher schools it spells nothing less than chaos .

		Its absurdity is so manifest that we can not believe that it will long remain unrepealed , or at the very least unmodi - fied in its terms .

		It is , in its existing form , a singularly vicious example of the sort of legis - lative tinkering with education that works mis - chief wherever it is attempted .

		And the worst of it is that it tends to bring into discredit one of the noblest objects of ethical endeavor .

		THE DIAL 321 SPELLING RE FORM IN EXTREMIS . ''

		It is not good to exult over the slain , '' says Homer .

		Spelling reform is moribund , and it would be unseemly to mock at its death-rattles .

		President
Roosevelt	PERSON	's order has been rescinded .

		The people refuse to take the subject seriously , being little in - clined , in
Arnold	LOCATION	's phrase , to wander forty years in the wilderness in order that posterity may enter a very problematic orthographical Canaan .

		A few radical journals try to put the new program thru ; the majority are recalcitrant .

		The great publishers will have nothing to do with it .

		The scholars who are alleged to be sound in the faith show themselves extremely lukewarm in the testimony of works .

		The consensus of literary and academic opinion is hostile .

		Spelling reform is dead , and in his lately - published volume , `` English Spelling and Spelling Reform , '' Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	writes its epicedium in the guise of an argument .

		More in anger than in sorrow , we note with amusement .

		He has been devoting his
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	leisures to the maintenance against all comers of two theses .

		The first is , that in matters of diction and idiom , whatever is is right , or at any rate '' equally as good '' if * • predicated '' upon prevailing usage .

		What the people say '' goes , '' and is not to be '' cut out '' at the dictation of '' highbrows . ''

		Why eschew short cuts ? ''

		Female college '' is con - venient , and '' simplified spelling board '' is pregnant with suggestiveness .

		The second thesis , and the one with which we are here concerned , is that in the matter of spelling whatever is is wrong .

		Conscious of public approval , he writes on the first topic with his customary good-humor .

		But the stubbornness of a wicked and perverse generation in rejecting his epanorthographical gospel induces in him a Jeremianic mood , the conflict of which with his native geniality of temperament provokes a smile .

		He is hurt by the '' intemperate invective '' of his opponents .

		But he will not retort in kind .

		The hard - est thing that he can find it in his heart to say of them is that they do not belong to the '' higher class of minds , who have been gained over '' ; that although theirs is a '' mild form of imbecility '' their '' procliv - ities are violently asinine '' ; that being `` ill-informed , '' '' semi-educated , '' or '' educated ignoramuses , '' they are also ' ■ ignoramuses , not to say idiots '' ; that they manifest a '' continuous incapacity '' to apprehend reason ; that they dwell in an '' atmosphere of serene ignorance , '' and the '' extent of their linguistic igno - rance and the depth of their orthographic depravity '' can not be fathomed ; that they should confine their '' displays of vast and varied stores of misinforma - tion '' and their '' pitiful exhibitions of ignorance '' to the circle of `` friends ignorant enough to sym - pathize with them '' ; that '' the annals of fatuity will be searched in vain for utterances more fatuous '' than theirs , and that their '' innate incapability of comprehension and the orthographic iniquity in which they are steeped '' abandon them to M dismal and unreal hallucinations '' and u ghastly specters of an argument , '' and account for the `` utter shal - lowness '' of their reasoning and the '' utter hol - lowness '' of their objections .

		We are glad that Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	holds himself in check , and treats our '' gabble '' with a `` singular lenience which it does not deserve . ''


Herbert Spencer	PERSON	thought that all criticism of his particular version of evolution betrayed the intel - lectual limitations of the old ladies of his boarding house , whose conversation embittered his morning coffee .

		Similarly , everyone who hesitates to hustle the evolution of orthography along the lines pre - dicted and prescribed by a self-constituted board , perhaps too much '' simplified '' to see all aspects of so many-sided a question , is assimilated in Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's jaundiced vision to the Englishman whose honor is rooted in a U , to the fine old crusted Tories who denounce in the '' Times '' the encroach - ments of American spelling , or the naive if not apocryphal gentlemen who declare that the spelling of Shakespeare is good enough for them .

		His publishers proclaim and his methods show that he is appealing to a popular jury .

		He could not complain , then , if the opposing advocate availed himself to the utmost of the natural human distaste for violent interference with existing associations which he so bitterly deplores as the main obstacle to the triumph of the righteous cause .

		Such an employment of ridicule as the test of -LRB- pragmatic -RRB- truth would be quite as fair as his own appeal to popular sentiment in favor of everything which labels itself '' progress '' or '' science , '' quite as fair as his representation that the issue is sharply joined between sound linguistics and sentimental literary sciolism , quite as loyal , to animadvert on a typical detail , as his implication -LRB- p. 63 -RRB- that
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	did not know the Greek derivation of '' diocese . ''

		Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	should learn from his Mill that an argument is not met at all until met in its strongest statement ; and from his
Burke	PERSON	that in large and complicated social questions the conserva - tive instinct , which he denounces as prejudice , is an indispensable brake on the workings of another instinct which impatient doctrinaires dignify by the name of `` progress '' or `` evolution , '' and which , if not so checked , would conduct mankind to most preposterous conclusions .

		Viewed in this light , con - servative feeling may deserve respect even in those who can not support it by presentable arguments .

		No philosophical conservative can be quite sure in far-reaching issues that his resistance to question - begging '' progress '' is absolutely wise .

		His general conservatism , like the radicalism of his opponents , is a great parti pris .

		But in a generation that is intoxicated with the idea of change , and habitually confounds unconscious with consciously engineered and exploited evolution , an intelligent man may well feel that the conservative literary instinct in so large a matter as language puts the burden of proof 322 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, heavily on the other side .

		I have personally no shibboleths , and no strong feeling for or against spelling one or two , or a dozen or two , words in this way or that .

		But I have a strong dislike of systematizing interference with language , and a strong distrust of all personally conducted evolutions or revolutions .

		And my feeling is not lessened by the historical example to which Professor
Louns	PERSON	- hury innocently appeals .

		He cites the French Revolution to illustrate the thoroughgoing logical consistency in reform of the French mind in con - trast to the Englishman 's besotted acquiescence in anomaly .

		The pertinency of this illustration is not apparent to me unless I am to think the French way in that instance the better .

		I do not .

		There is little space to scrutinize Professor
Louns	PERSON	- bury 's facts , logic , and linguistic principles in detail .

		His argument constantly faces two ways .

		The value of the proposed reform is magnified on the tacit assumption that it is to be thoroughgoing and con - sistent .

		Objections of large scope are minimized or made to appear pettifogging cavils by the admission that consistent spelling by the sound is beyond our reach , and the inference that it is petty prejudice to resist the rectification of a few anomalies .

		It does not require an expert dialectician to perceive that this reasoning is reversible .

		If the changes are to be considerable , the broad objections , sound or unsound , recover their prima facie claim to a respectful hearing .

		If they are to be slight , why all this agitation ?

		The divergence from English usage , for example , already regrettable , will become a grave matter if carried much farther .

		No tinkering with present conventions can be tolerated that is not acceptable to all English-speaking peoples .

		Again , the argument that the usefulness of existing printed books will be impaired can be made to look foolish only by insisting that reform will not proceed fast or far .

		Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	assures us that it will not .

		We believe him -- and for cause ; the ignora - muses whom he denounces have seen to that .

		But how far and how fast would the '' horses of Euthy - phron '' have carried us if we had given them their heads ?

		Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	dwells so invidiously on the ignorance of his opponents that we are justified in replying that the kind of expert knowledge on which he chiefly insists is neither a very high order of scholarship nor , what is more to the point , so rele - vant to the question in hand as he supposes .

		By linguistic scholarship he seems to understand ac - quaintance with the history of English lexicography and the past variations of English spelling .

		We like quite as well for the present purpose
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's definition , which is in effect that scholarship consists in the habitual and summary recognition of the pre - ferences of the language to which we are born .

		The fact that English orthography has fluctuated wildly may be a sufficient answer to controversialists who attribute a superstitious sanctity to our present spell - ing .

		It is not necessarily an argument in favor of altering the established and standardized usage of to-day .

		Nor is a note-book erudition in respect to these past irrationalities an essential prerequisite for a wise judgment as to the desirability of upsetting the literary associations of an entire generation .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's point about the
London	LOCATION	Times 's then arbitrary and whimsical spelling `` diocess '' was in no wise affected by the fact that
Johnson	PERSON	's dic - tionary spelled it so .

		An hour or two in the British Museum would have acquainted Arnold with this fact , and with all the other facts which his critic flings at his head , had they been pertinent to his purpose .

		We read , then , with interest Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's chapter on ''
Hono	PERSON	-LRB- u -RRB- r , '' his account of the variations between `` er '' and '' re , '' and the other historical details with which he pads his argument .

		But we deny in toto their relevancy to the present issue .

		And we can only smile at the airs of triumph over men quite as scholarly as himself with which he exhibits to the people the particular wares of his own specialty .

		The same may he said of his scorn of the argu - ment for the preservation of etymology .

		It is easy , but superfluous , for him to show that this argument is often urged by those who know less of etymology than he does ; that no absolute consistency is attain - able in the matter , and that any system of spelling will obscure some etymologies and reveal others .

		All this does not alter the fact that the general tendency of the innovations proposed is towards the obscuration of now transparent etymologies , and that this , though not a conclusive objection to demonstrated countervailing gains , is , so far as it goes , a consideration to be weighed with others , and can not be magisterially dismissed or laughed out of court .

		If now we turn to larger questions of linguistic principle , there is much to give us pause .

		The plea is repeatedly made that a rational spelling will con - serve pronunciation .

		It would prevent the
London	LOCATION	newsboy from crying '' pipers '' and preserve the '' Italian a '' in the mouth of the
Illinois	LOCATION	'' sucker . ''

		Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's controversial eagerness here gets the better of his scientific conscience .

		A con - ceivable tendency of this kind no one is in a position to deny .

		But history lends it little support .

		Why in the
thirteenth century	DATE	did English `` a '' change to an O sound ?

		Why did English `` i , '' unequivo - cally denoted , change ?

		How did it happen that almost the entire nicely discriminated and sufficiently designated Greek vowel and diphthong system lapsed into the monotonous e sound of modern Greek ?

		The modern Greek boy is up against a much stiff er orthographical proposition -LRB- to speak by '' prevailing usage '' -RRB- than that which confronts his English con - temporary .

		But I should like to see the reception which educated Greeks would give to the proposal to relieve him by a simplified phonetic spelling .

		The Smeute caused by a too colloquial translation of the New Testament would be child 's play in comparison .

		The Greeks know that it is this irra -
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 323 tional spelling which gives their language its inexhaustible resources , and makes it instead of a miserable patois one of the finest prose idioms of modern
Europe	LOCATION	.

		And they also know what Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's a priori psychology of least resistance overlooks , that the time `` wasted '' in learning to spell is largely spent in the close scrutiny , assimilation , and discrimination of a vocabulary extending far beyond that of conversation .

		This pedagogical question , on which Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	finally rests his case , is far too complex to be settled by a few question-begging assertions .

		I do not deal in absolutes .

		The inconsistencies of our spelling doubtless cause some waste of mental effort ; but infinitely less than Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	assumes .

		And there are many counterbalancing considerations which he ignores .

		Correct spelling is mainly a matter of instinctive accuracy of visual observation , which good minds , with some startling exceptions , are apt to possess .

		For the large pro- portion of words outside the sphere of ordinary con - versation , it probably involves , even when most irrational phonetically , little more strain of attention than is actually helpful in the acquisition and dis - crimination of what we may call the literary vocab - ulary .

		Under any system , literate persons must learn to spell alike , unless Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	con - templates the perpetuation of the anarchy which , with
Josh Billings	PERSON	,
Mark Twain	PERSON	, and Professor Child , he recommends as a solvent of existing ortho - doxy and an affirmation of individuality .

		Under any system , there would be nearly as many bad spellers as under the present , and under any system the sufferings of congenital incapacity will be about the same .

		The assertion that the anomalies of the present system actually corrupt the logical sense is a jest .

		In our day , and in the domain of psychology or linguistics , the acceptance and artistic utilization of anomaly is a more desirable mental attitude than the blind faith in systematic and mechanical regular - ization which we are tempted to take into these fields from the physical sciences .

		There is neither regular - ity nor systematizing logic in idiom or semasiology .

		The logic of idiom is that of the gentleman who said ' • Wherever I turn up I am turned down . ''

		There is no logical or ultimate etymological reason for the gradations of meaning in u esteem , '' '' respect , '' • • veneration , '' or for the differentiation of '' blame '' and '' blaspheme . ''

		If the anomalies of our spelling make English hard for foreigners , our prepositional idioms and the divergent meanings we give to words of Latin origin make it impossible .

		There is no space to elaborate the parallel .

		There is a type of mind which sees in its regularity of derivation and meaning a superiority of Esperanto over English .

		Shall we , then , organize a simplified board of semantic and synonyms , and convert English into Volapuk ?

		Such irregularities , due to accidents of history and psychology , are the chief cause of the incomparable resources of our tongue .

		They are the delight of the student , and constitute the opportunity of the skilful writer -- the scholar of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's defini - tion .

		These considerations would be far-fetched and absurd if urged in support of the wilful multiplica - tion of irregularities .

		But they are a legitimate answer to the contention that the study and accepts ance of linguistic anomaly is in itself detrimental to the youthful mind .

		And they suggest that even the anomalies of spelling may have , or be turned into , compensating advantages which a facile and a priori psychology of education overlooks .

		There are probably no conclusive and peremptory arguments on either side of this controversy .

		It is not a question of mathematical demonstration , but of the balancing of many nice and complex consid - erations , with a strong presumption in favor of conservatism in a matter at once too large and too delicate for conscious and prescriptive control .

		I have merely tried to show that the display of techni - cal erudition with which Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	would overawe the layman is not germane to the issue ; that the arguments which seem to him final admit of answer ; and that the absurdities which it pleases him to attribute to the conservatives are no essential part of the motives and reasons that determine their attitude .

		For the rest , in all charity , we commend to him the philosophy of Thersites : a He beats me and I rail at him : O worthy satisfaction !

		CASUA L COM MENT .

		FINDING ONESELF A CHARACTER IN FICTION niUSt yield a unique and diverting sensation -- perhaps not unlike the rarer experience of finding one 's work a classic while one is still in a position to profit by it .

		Something like this must be the sensation enjoyed by Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	and Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	, who , it appears , are just now so vital a part of
London	LOCATION	life that a presentment of it in fic - tion is hardly complete without one or both of them , and the novelist takes little risk in introducing them , and assuming his readers ' readiness to catch the force of the allusions .

		To cite two recent instances , Mr.
E. Temple Thurston	PERSON	, in '' The City of Beautiful Nonsense , '' allows his heroine to mis - take a bailiff named
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	, whom she meets in the rooms of the impecunious hero , for u the Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	. ''

		and to him she begins quoting passages from
G. K. C	PERSON	, supposing she is performing the neat but not novel trick of quoting an author to him - self ; while the bailiff , fired to emulation , promptly makes an epigram which in his opinion is quite as good as any of
G. K. C. 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Again , in Mr. `` Wells 's ''
Ann Veronica	PERSON	, '' the spectacled Suffragette and Intellectual ,
Miss Miniver	PERSON	, talks to
Ann	PERSON	of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	and Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, comparing them with half a dozen fictitious , or fictitiously named , re - formers ; and finally she and
Ann	PERSON	go to Essex Hall to hear addresses by
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	and the fictitious
Fabi	PERSON	- ans .

		The curious thing is that the gentlemen can be 324 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, thus introduced into an imaginary company without incongruity , -- or so we find it , -- a fact which in - dicates an enveloping literary atmosphere that sel - dom lends its romantic glamour to inhabitants of this mundane sphere .

		Possible sources of the gla - mour we refuse even to speculate upon .

		Only Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	could do justice to the subject , in a Preface -- unless Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	would make a ''
Tremen	PERSON	- dous Trifle '' of it , or add to '' The Defendant '' a
Defence of Being a Literary Allusion	ORGANIZATION	.

		• • • A CURIOUS COMMENTARY ON THE METHODS OF publishers is offered by the appearance -- sudden , unheralded , like an apparition from another world -- of the '' Last Poems '' of
George Meredith	PERSON	.

		Some fourteen hundred titles jostle one another on the Fall announcement lists of our leading publishing houses ; several hundred of them have been not merely an - nounced to the retail book-trade , but extensively advertised in advance to the public , who might reasonably have supposed that all the most tempting dainties in the season 's feast of literature had been put before them to gloat over , anticipate , by-and-by to taste .

		And now there drops from the clouds a volume containing these '' Last Poems '' of
George Meredith	PERSON	, bearing the imprint of a progressive house whose policy and practice are certainly not to sup - press its best enterprises -- not to be , as
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	aptly puts it , referring to some publishers of his day , '' secreters , '' rather than publishers , of books .

		The explanation of this anomalous situation would seem to be that such an enormous number of books are produced nowadays , and the business of publishing them is so complicated a matter -- so different from the manufacturing and marketing of more material wares -- that confusion of aim and a lack of coor - dination in efforts for publicity are the inevitable results .

		But undoubtedly we shall enjoy Meredith 's '' Last Poems '' as much as if we had long been anticipating them ; unexpected pleasures have a charm of their own .

		The North Pole in poetry cuts no great figure ; or , to change the metaphor a little , it does not cut much more ice in poetry than it does in prosaic reality .

		To be sure , we have Pope 's couplet con - cerning certain persons who '' speed the soft inter - course from soul to soul , and waft a sigh from Indus to the Pole '' ; and the lines in
Barton Booth	LOCATION	's old song , '' True as the needle to the
Pole	LOCATION	, or as the dial to the sun '' ; and one of
Isaac Watts	PERSON	's stanzas begins , '' Were I so tall to reach the Pole , or grasp the ocean with my span '' ; and
Coleridge	PERSON	has sung '' Oh sleep !

		it is a gentle thing , beloved from pole to pole '' ; and , finally ,
Addison	PERSON	once made a rhyme about the planets that '' confirm the tidings as they roll , and spread the truth from pole to pole . ''

		After all , however , the imaginary termini of the earth 's axis have not , either singly or taken together , done much toward kindling the poetic imagination ; their asso - ciations are too cold and rigid .

		Any addition , there - fore , to this slender stock of Arctic allusion in verse becomes a matter of literary moment .

		The latest contribution is found in the beautifully appropriate poem with which Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	so graciously favored the large audience gathered at the
Metropolitan Opera House	ORGANIZATION	in the course of the late Hudson-Fulton celebration in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Her concluding stanza reads thus : '' And , as one sun doth compass all That can arise or may befall , One sentence on Creation 's night Bestowed the blessed boon of light , So shall all Life one promise fill Of gentle nurture and good will , While , pledging Love 's assured control , The Flag of Freedom crowns the Pole . ''

		A PESSIMISTIC POET 'S HOPELESS TASK Was that undertaken by the late
John Davidson	PERSON	, the recent finding of whose body , together with the despairing preface to his posthumous volume of poems , con - firms the conjecture of his suicide . ''

		For half a century , '' he once wrote , in a mood of supreme discon - tent , '' I have survived in a world entirely unfitted for me ; and having known both the heaven and the hell thereof , and being without a revenue and an army and navy to compel the nations , I begin definitely in my Testaments and Tragedies to destroy this unfit world and make it over again in my own image , '' -- truly a rather colossal enterprise .

		It was in the preface to the sheaf of poems which he went out to post to his publisher on the
evening	TIME	of
March 23	DATE	, the last time he was seen alive , that he wrote : '' The time has come to make an end .

		There are several motives .

		I find my pension is not enough ; I have therefore still to turn aside and attempt things for which people will pay .

		My health also counts .

		Asthma and other annoyances I have tolerated for years ; but I can not put up with cancer . ''

		It is not so very strange , even if it is very sad , that such a life should be thus ended .

		Having created the alter - native of making the world over again or leaving it , the tragic ending was inevitable .

		He was one of those who can do great things , but are powerless under the pressure of small things ; who are able to '' Create new worlds without the least misgiving , But on this planet can not make a living . ''

		A LAUREATESHIP ALMOST DECLINED , but finally accepted with reluctance , and only after a letter of refusal had actually been written , forms the most interesting topic of a Tennyson letter , never before published in full , which was read at the Lincoln cele - bration of the poet 's centenary by Mr.
Willingham F. Rawnsley	PERSON	, a friend of
Tennyson 's	ORGANIZATION	and a grand - son of the Rev.
H. D. Rawnsley	PERSON	, to whom the letter was addressed .

		The passage referring to the proffered honor -LRB- and appearing only in part in
Lord Tennyson	PERSON	's life of his father -RRB- reads as follows : '' I thank you for your congratulations touching the lau - reateship .

		I was advised by my friends not to decline it , and I was even told that , being already in receipt of a pension , I could not gracefully refuse it ; but I wish more and more that some one else had it .

		THE DIAL 325 I have no passion for courts , but a great love of privacy ; nor do I count having the office as any par - ticular feather in my cap .

		It is , I believe , scarcely
# 100	MONEY	a year , and my friend
R. M. Milnes	PERSON	tells me that the price of the patent and court dress will swallow up all the first year 's income . ''

		This sacri - fice of the first year 's emoluments , however , was avoided , as the biography explains , by a loan -LRB- from
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of the court dress worn by the preceding laureate .

		It is difficult for us now to conceive of
Tennyson	LOCATION	as uncrowned with the laurel wreath , but he came very near declining it -- much nearer than most of his readers have ever suspected .

		• • • The
Laurexce Sterxe	PERSON	of
France	LOCATION	is what some of his countrymen have called
M. Anatole France	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- to designate him by his familiar pen-name -RRB- .

		A few sentences from
Madame Ducleaux	ORGANIZATION	's new book -LRB- '' The French Procession '' -RRB- present the famous author in life-like fashion .

		She writes , with some incongruity of metaphor : '' In
1888	DATE	, when I came to live in
Paris	LOCATION	, I first met M.
France	LOCATION	.

		He was then a slender , youngish scholar of five-and-forty .

		appreciated rather than famous , whose literary gift still appeared elegant rather than great .

		His fine face , which since has assumed a glance of extraor - dinary power and penetration , wore an expression often gentle , sometimes mordant , more frequently veiled and ambiguous , and this uncertain air made the men and women of the world -LRB- for whose society he showed the predilection of a satirist -RRB- somtimes com - plain that he had Vair perfide .

		What disconcerted them was the dim perception of a force in reserve ; but it is possible to be both frank and mysterious ;
M. France	LOCATION	concealed nothing and disguised nothing ; he merely exceeded their comprehension -- and perhaps at that time his own . ''

		The distinguished author 's American readers , daily increasing in numbers with the appearance of his works in English , will look with interest for
Madame Ducleaux	ORGANIZATION	's fuller account of him .

		• • • The best-sellixg book of philosopht that the publishing world has seen for many a day is undoubtedly Dr.
William James	PERSON	's ■ Pragmatism . ''

		Published two years ago , this piquant treatment of things abstruse has already gone through eight edi - tions , and the demand is not yet satisfied .

		More - over , the book has been translated into Japanese and is said to be enjoying a brisk sale in the island kingdom , where its author is held in honor as a prophet Eight editions in two years would be a good record for a novel -- for one of the philosopher 's brother 's novels , let us say .

		The old saying in regard to the James brothers , -- that one of them wrote philosophy that was as fascinating as fiction , while the other wrote fiction that was as abstruse as phi - losophy , -- seems to be having additional verifica - tion .

		* Pragmatism '' and '' The Will to Believe '' are certainly books to render one oblivious of the passing of time ; and now a sequel to the later work has made its appearance under the title , '' The Meaning of Truth . ''

		Whether or not it answers satisfactorily
Pilate	ORGANIZATION	's question of two thousand years ago will probably still remain largely a matter of individual opinion .

		... The dyixg request of ax eccextric book - collector was once thus expressed in his will : '' My wish is that my drawings , my prints , my curiosities , my books -- in a word , those things of art which have been the joy of my life -- shall not be consigned to the cold tomb of a museum and subjected to the stupid gaze of the careless passer-by ; but I direct that they all be dispersed again under the hammer of the auctioneer , so that the pleasure which the acquiring of each one of them has given me shall be given again , in each case , to some inheritor of my own tastes . ''

		This action of the testator -LRB-
Edmond de Goncourt	PERSON	, who was of course much more than a collector of curios -RRB- is called to mind by the wish of the late
Robert Hoe	PERSON	, uttered before bis death , that his incomparable collection of books and manuscripts -LRB- partly catalogued , under 20,962 titles , in a fifteen volume privately-printed catalogue , and valued at a
million dollars	MONEY	at least -RRB- should be sold at auction .

		This sale he even intended to effect in his lifetime -- so it is reported .

		Whenever and wherever -LRB- prob - ably in
London	LOCATION	-RRB- it ultimately takes place , the sale will be a bibliopolic event of the first importance .

		... The abidixg love of good literature , of what may be called , in its less restricted sense , classic literature , is something to make one hopeful of the ultimate salvation of the race .

		Dime novels and penny dreadfuls do have their readers , it must be admitted ; but so do the excellent and inexpensive reprints of our best authors , of which a familiar example is '' Everyman 's Library . ''

		This wisely selected series now numbers four hundred volumes , and is thus in sight of the half-way mark in its steady progress toward the thousand - volume goal set for it .

		It is announced that five million volumes have already been sold , and that an additional hundred volumes will be published next year .

		Mr.
Dent	PERSON	, the
London	LOCATION	publisher of the series , will soon visit this country , it is reported , to consult with some of our university professors and other educators as to future additions to this popular series of reprints . ''

		• • A SUBJECT-IXDEX OF A GREAT PUBLIC LIBRARY will before long , it is hoped , see the light of day in book form .

		For nearly five years that great store - house of literature , the
London Library	LOCATION	, has been in the hands of expert cataloguers , who doubtless will succeed in making its treasures much more available than at present Already the cost of preparing this voluminous index , not counting the printer 's bill which is yet to come , amounts to more than two thousand pounds .

		The subject-headings will number between eight and nine thousand ; and those who have seen the proof-sheets are said to declare that no index equal to it for excellence has ever been printed in
England	LOCATION	.

		326 THE DIA1 -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, FROM LITERARY
LONDON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of The Dial . -RRB-

		There are various rumors afloat in
London	LOCATION	as to novels that would seem to be involving their authors and publishers in some measure of legal trouble .

		Mr.
John Long	PERSON	, a comparatively recent addition to our publishing fraternity , seems to be frequently '' in the wars . ''

		Just now the trouble is over a book entitled '' A Native Wife , '' by Mr.
Henry Bruce	PERSON	; and as a result it has been withdrawn from circu - lation .

		The work presents a picture of a commercial representative of a great firm in
India	LOCATION	who marries a native and is ostracized by the whole white com - munity in consequence .

		The story , although charac - terized by much illiteracy , really shows remarkable knowledge of the by-ways of Indian life .

		The picture of the missionaries , presenting much sordid - ness mingled with undoubted ideals , strikes one as about the most accurate that has yet been given to the public .

		After an indictment which certainly presents the missionary in a peculiarly offensive light , Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	acknowledges that the Christian - ized natives are one of the greatest factors in the preservation of the English connection .

		These com - munities , he says , scattered throughout
India	LOCATION	, are so many little islands , or oases , of political loyalty and of potential civilization .

		He lays great emphasis on the fact that this loyalty is produced in a very great degree by the work of American missionaries , who , he says , '' show some of the best results . ''

		However , it would seem that Mr.
Long	PERSON	has been taken to task by some native Indian lawyer who thinks he is presented in the pages of `` A Native Wife . ''

		I can not imagine , however , that this action for libel is of serious moment , or will ever come into court .

		I am sorry to note the extraordinary vogue in this country of what may be called abnormal fiction .

		Many so-called novels that are having large sales should never have been published at all .

		And novels are not the only offenders against taste .

		The innum - erable volumes of pretended historical reminiscences , court gossip , and vulgar tittle-tattle , compete for the doubtful honor of sensational preeminence .

		A fla - grant example may be found in the reminiscences of the
Countess of Cardigan	ORGANIZATION	, which is having an extra - ordinary sale in
England	LOCATION	.

		It has gone through three editions here , and one bookseller has told me that he could have sold 500 more copies if he could have obtained them from the binders .

		Yet this is not due to any real newness in the book , for many of the best stories have been known in the smoking-rooms of English houses for years .

		The meretricious attrac - tion is , of course , in the fact that the stories are told by a woman , and a woman in society , who bears a name that counts for something in modern English history .

		Lord Cardigan was the hero of the
Bala	LOCATION	- clava Charge .

		It is said that while he led his troop into fire in that brilliant episode , which
Tennyson	PERSON	has made forever memorable in his '' Charge of the Light Brigade , '' he scuttled out again with too great quickness ; in fact ,
Lord Cardigan	LOCATION	at one time threatened an action for libel against
Kinglake	PERSON	for his version of the affair in his `` History of the Crimean War , '' but the action never came into court .

		Of course it is of immense interest that Lord Cardigan 's widow should print all these scandalous stories , and they are just now the talk of every table in
London	LOCATION	.

		The point at which interest undoubtedly centres , however , is Lady Cardigan 's statement as to her having received a proposal of marriage from
Lord Beaconsfield	ORGANIZATION	.


Lord Beaconsfield	PERSON	, who for so many years was idolized by his own party and hated by the opposite party in this country to an extent that has scarcely a parallel save in the case of
Gladstone	LOCATION	, has now become a cult in which both parties unite ; and this although the primrose-day enthusiasm that was identified with his name for a few years appears to be dying out .

		Everyone is asking whether
Lord Beaconsfield	PERSON	did really propose marriage to
Lady Cardigan	LOCATION	, the year after he lost the wife to whom he seemed to be so much devoted , -- although he did once say of Lady Beaconsfield that she never knew which came first , the Greeks or the Romans .

		I believe I am right in saying that evidence of this will be forth - coming , and that Lady Cardigan 's '' Recollections '' are to be followed by yet a second volume in which a facsimile of the letter wherein Disraeli proposed to her will be included .

		Of much more significance , if people had a real sense of relative importance with regard to books , is the new work on Byron that Mr.
Richard Edg	PERSON	- cumbe has just issued in
London	LOCATION	through the firm of
John Murray	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Edgcumbe	PERSON	is quite the best living authority upon
Byron	PERSON	.

		He is Sergeant-at - Arms to the
King	PERSON	, and he is connected with the family of the poet
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	in a collateral way , his mother having been a daughter of Sir
John Shelley	PERSON	, the sixth Baronet .

		The poet Shelley , had he sur - vived his father , would have been the third Baronet .

		Mr.
Edgcumbe	PERSON	was secretary to the
National Byron Memorial Committee	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has written sundry small volumes , but nothing of anything like the importance of this new work , which he entitles `` Byron : The Last Phase . ''

		In this book Mr.
Edgcumbe	PERSON	has told over again the story of
Byron	PERSON	's later life , -- the greater and nobler
Byron	PERSON	who died for
Greece	LOCATION	and freedom .

		There will , however , be more interest in the second and third part of Mr.
Edgcumbe	PERSON	's vol - ume , treating of the debatable points in
Byron	LOCATION	's life which have been made the subject of so much con - troversy ever since Mrs.
Beecher Stowe	PERSON	wrote about them in the '' Atlantic Monthly '' and ''
Macmillan	PERSON	's Magazine , '' a half - century ago .

		It will be remembered that a year or two before his death ,
Lord Lovelace	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	's grandson , pub - lished a volume on
Byron	PERSON	's story entitled `` Astarte . ''

		The book was much prized by
Byron	PERSON	specialists , although it has never been sold indiscriminately .

		For my copy , which cost me three guineas , I have
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 327 been offered ten ; but I fancy the book can now be obtained at its original price .

		Lord
Lovelace	PERSON	took the precaution to copyright the book in
America	LOCATION	, having it set in type there and duly deposited in the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		I was talking , only the other day , to the agent for American publications in
London	LOCATION	who arranged the matter .

		The book made me very angry ; and had it not been copy - righted , I should have liked to republish it with what I believe would have been a conclusive answer to
Lord Lovelace	PERSON	's every point .

		The drawback to much of Mr.
Edgcumbe	PERSON	's answer is that the people who read it will not have the book before them .

		The unhappy side of Mr.
Edgcumbe	PERSON	's defence is that he also has to incriminate someone , the prin - cipal point of the story being that
Byron	PERSON	did not fight when Lady
Byron	PERSON	threatened divorce proceed - ings , because both he and his sister wished to shield
Mary Chaworth	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	's first love .

		It has never been known before , as clearly as Mr.
Edgcumbe	PERSON	now shows it , that
Byron	PERSON	renewed his intimacy with this lady after she became Mrs.
Musters	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Edgcumbe	PERSON	, I think , conclusively proves that Mrs.
Musters	PERSON	was the mother of
Byron	PERSON	's child
Medora	PERSON	, and that his sister adopted the child .

		However , I must leave this book to your own reviewer .

		THE HISTORICAL PAGEANT IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		My attention has been called to an article in The Dial for
October 16	DATE	, on the subject of Historical Pageants .

		By some omission , which I take to be merely accidental , the article contains no reference to the pageant arranged in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	a year ago in connec - tion with the celebration of the 225th anniversary of the founding of that city .

		So far as I know , this continues to be as yet the only pageant of any size or importance ever given in this country .

		While it was not planned on the present very popular English pattern , as a play on the green , like the beautiful pageant at
Quebec	LOCATION	in
July 1908	DATE	, but rather followed the models of the Con - tinental European pageants , which take the form of pro- cessions , it was accounted by the 600,000 or 800,000 people who were able to view it to be quite as faithful and artistic a presentation of the history of a great com - munity .

		It had the direction of excellent historians and artists who placed more than 5000 people in costume in a line which moved over a distance of five miles on Broad Street .

		The episodes chosen for representation began with the earliest settlements , carried the city through the Revolutionary War and the picturesque period following the war , through those twenty-five years when it was the capital of the
United States	LOCATION	, and ended with the
Centennial Exhibition of 1876	ORGANIZATION	.

		The omission of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	from your list of his - torical pageants in this country is the more noticeable as you mention
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	.

		There was no historical pageant at the
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	cele - bration , barring some Indian scenes which were largely fanciful .

		The city of
Burlington	LOCATION	,
Vt.	LOCATION	, contemplated one , but was deterred by the expense .

		New York last month had the most abominable travesty upon the name of Historical Pageant that human ingenuity could invent .

		The
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' declared it to be tawdry , cheap , and entirely unworthy of the city ; while no one who witnessed the exhibition has been able to ' speak of it with patience or toleration .

		I am sure that a journal like The Dial would not knowingly give its endorsement to pageantry which is arranged without regard to the principles of history or art .

		We have made a beginning in the right direction ; and if our standards are not again lowered to the level of the car - nival and the secret-society parade , this entertainment may become an educational influence of the greatest popular value .

SOPHIE JEWETT	PERSON	-- A TRIBUTE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The death , on the
11th of October	DATE	, of Associate Professor
Sophie Jewett	PERSON	of the
Department	ORGANIZATION	of English Literature at
Wellesley College	ORGANIZATION	brings poignant sense of loss to those whose number is itself a significant tribute .

		Gifted , lovely , with a spirit so '' finely touched to all fine issues '' that it seemed often a source of newer beauty , she was at once rarely beloved by friends and strangely memorable to those of even slight acquaintance .

		In twenty years of teaching she gave to several hundred students the inspiration of a scholarship as unsparing in its own endeavor as it was gracious and generous .

		Owing to its habit of abundant giving , it leaves but few tangible results .

		Nevertheless , an edition of
Tennyson	PERSON	's '' Holy Grail , '' singularly penetrative and thorough , and a mass of yet unpublished work on the ballads of
Southern Europe	LOCATION	, constitute a precious legacy .

		For about twenty years , also ,
Miss Jewett	PERSON	has been known as a poet whose lyrics , appearing at long inter - vals , mainly in '' Scribner 's '' and ''
Harper	PERSON	's '' maga - zines , were of exquisite craft and most delicate and inimitable music .

		In
1896	DATE	a number were brought together in `` The Pilgrim '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ; in
1905	DATE	a second collection was made in '' Persephone , '' a privately printed department publication ; in
1908	DATE	appeared such a translation of the beautiful Middle-English poem '' The Pearl '' as only a poet 's poet could have made .

		-LRB- A full review of this charming work appeared in The Dial of
December 16 , 1908	DATE	. -RRB-

		Other poems of such late pub - lication as the
April	DATE	and
August	DATE	'' Scribner 's , ''
1909	DATE	, or '' The Outlook '' for
October 16	DATE	, still wait their garland - ing .

		One is tempted to think of them in her own words for
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	's verses : '' Frail scattered petals , crimson , gold , Drift to the feet of you and me Unf aded , -- even such vain , brief things -LRB- Roses of Paestnm ,
Helen	PERSON	's tears -RRB- As lover loves , and poet sings , And wise earth hoards through myriad years , Careless when some star disappears . ''

		As
Meleager	PERSON	said of
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	, these later '' full-hearted '' poems are '' few , but roses all . ''

		The Making of an African Explorer .

		* A brief entry in the late
Henry M. Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's diary pictures , in a characteristic incident , the harsh training to which Fortune subjected him from infancy , to harden him into the most reso - lute , resourceful , and successful African ex - plorer of his day .

		The incident , a trifle in itself , took place in
1863	DATE	, in
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, where young
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	was boarding with Judge X .

		`` Judge drunk , '' runs the record ; `` tried to kill his wife ; attempted three times .

		-- I held him down all night .

		Next morning , exhausted ; lighted cigar in parlor ; wife came down -- insulted and raved at me for smoking in her house ! ''

		The autobiography of
Sir Henry Morton Stanley	ORGANIZATION	, competently edited by Lady
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	, is , in its first half , the detailed and pathetic account of the writer 's homeless , loveless , harsh and cheerless boyhood and youth .

		Of course there were occasional gleams of sunshine , and some little taste of the milk of human kindness ; but it was , on the whole , such a barbarously inhuman discipline as not one in a thousand could have survived in any sort of physical or moral health .

		A father dead before the child was a month old ; a mother with no vestige of maternal love for her infant , whom she cast off at the earliest moment ; a workhouse up - bringing , under the rod of an atrociously cruel schoolmaster , who finally went raving mad ; wanderings and hardships in two hemispheres , with rough experience of army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	service in time of war ; and , finally , the ups and downs of a roving journalist , -- all these contributed to the toughening of fibre and the capacity for endurance that were to stand the future explorer of tropical
Africa	LOCATION	in such good stead .

		The date of
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's birth seems not to have been known to him ; at least he does not give it , and only in his seventh chapter do we find an approximate indication of the year .

		He speaks of himself as , in
1861	DATE	, `` getting close on to eighteen , '' which would make his birth-year
1843	DATE	.

		Most of the reference books give
1841	DATE	, and even
1840	DATE	is the date assigned by one authority .

		That he was of Welsh extraction , and first saw the light of day near
Denbigh	LOCATION	, in
Wales	LOCATION	, appears to be certain .

		ment to the care of a grandfather , who soon afterward died , and his subsequent haphazard course of life , up to his discharge from the
U. S. Artillery	ORGANIZATION	service in the
summer of 1862	DATE	, a temporary physical wreck and without a penny in his pockets , are fully related in the unfinished autobiography .

		The rest of his life - history is pieced together , with the necessary editorial stitches , from
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's journals , notes , letters , and other writings .

		But as the world is already fairly familiar with these later and more historically important events and achieve - ments , the earlier and in many respects more humanly interesting and appealing incidents will here be chiefly dwelt upon .

		The most striking characteristics of the little workhouse boy whose many sorrows and very few joys are so touchingly told , are his moral earnestness , his blind faith in a loving God , his aching hunger for human affection , his intel - lectual quickness and vigor , his sturdy power of endurance , and the innate and unspoilable germ of goodness in his character .

		The inhuman schoolmaster whom he finally rebelled against and , with another boy 's aid , soundly thrashed , before absconding never to return , is sufficiently depicted in the following paragraph : '' Day after day little wretches would be flung down on the stone floor in writhing heaps , or stood , with blink - ing eyes and humped backs , to receive the shock of the ebony ruler , or were sent pirouetting across the school from a ruffianly kick , while the rest suffered from a sympathetic terror during such exhibitions , for none knew what moment he might be called to endure the like .

		Every hour of our lives we lived and breathed in mortal fear of the cruel hand and blighting glare of one so easily frenzied . ''

		Disposed to view the accidents of his life - course as providentially ordered for the ulti - mate bringing about of things not altogether unmemorable , the autobiographer thus refers to his treatment at the hands of a hard-featured and close-fisted aunt upon whose tender mercies he had thrown himself after running away from the workhouse and its brutal teacher of youth : '' To her own children ,
Aunt Mary	ORGANIZATION	was the best of mothers .

		Had I received but a tithe of her affection , I fear that , like an ass partial to his crib , I should have become too home-loving to leave .

		As Jacob served Laban , I would have served aunt for years , for a mere smile , but she had not interest enough in me to study my disposition , or to suspect that the silent boy with a somewhat dogged look could be so touched by emotion .

		What I might have become with gracious treatment her youngest son
David	PERSON	became .

		He clung to his mother 's hearth , and eventually married the daughter of Jones , of Hurblas , by whom he had a large family .

		All his life he remained profoundly ignorant that beyond his natal nook the universe pulsed deep and strong , but , as
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 329 the saying is , ' Home-keeping youth hath ever homely wits , ' and gain and honour are not for those who cling to their firesides . ''

		After a dreary experience as an overworked and underfed shop-boy in
Liverpool	LOCATION	, the lad found a berth for himself , in a menial capacity , on a sailing vessel bound for
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		Every order he received , as soon as seasickness abated enough to let him stagger on deck , was accompanied with an oath and likely also to be attended or preceded by a blow .

		The sub - joined bit of narrative and reflection is signifi - cant . ''

		From this date began , I think , the noting of a strange coincidence , which has since been so common with me that I accept it as a rule .

		When I pray for a man , it happens that at that moment he is cursing me ; when I praise I am slandered ; if I command -LSB- commend ? -RSB-

		, I am reviled ; if I feel affectionate or sympathetic towards one , it is my fate to be detested or scorned by him .

		I first noticed this curious coincidence on board the '
Windermere	LOCATION	. '

		I bore no grudge , and thought no evil of any person , but prayed for all , morning and evening , extolled the courage , strength , and energy of my ship - mates , likened them to sea-lions , and felt it an honour to be in the company of such brave men ; but , invariably , they damned my eyes , my face , my heart , my soul , my person , my nationality ; I was damned aft , and damned forward .

		I was wholly obnoxious to everyone aboard , and the only service they asked of God towards me was that He should damn me to all eternity . ''

		Nevertheless the object of all this vituperation continued to bless them that cursed him and to pray for them which despitefully used him and persecuted him .

		He wasted no time cherishing either real or fancied grievances , but pushed on to better things with a pluck and courage that were bound to conquer an adverse fate in the end .

		The fact that Sir
Henry Morton Stanley	PERSON	was born plain
John Rowlands	PERSON	, son and grandson of men of the same name , will be new to some readers .

		It was from a well-to-do and benevo - lent tradesman of
New Orleans	LOCATION	, who recognized the boy 's worth and adopted him , that he got his name ,
Henry Stanley	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nothing is said to account for the
Morton	LOCATION	; possibly it too formed a part of the benefactor s name .

		The short season of paternal kindness that brought the waif 's better nature to a rapid development was ended by the sudden death of Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	, intestate , and the casting once more adrift of the young wanderer .

		His subsequent varied experi - ences , his abhorrence of the inhumane treatment of slaves , but nevertheless his impulsive adop - tion of the cause unfavorable to their emanci - pation , and his terrific initiation into the art of war at
Shiloh	LOCATION	, with his subsequent capture and confinement at
Camp Douglas	ORGANIZATION	, on the outskirts of
Chicago	LOCATION	, are graphically and stirringly related .

		It was the raw recruit 's too eager advance to meet the enemy that led to his capture and his later unspeakable experience of prison horrors .

		Of the latter he writes : '' The statistics of Andersonville are beheved to show that the South was even more callous towards their prisoners than the authorities of
Camp Douglas	ORGANIZATION	were .

		I admit that we were better fed than the Union pris - oners were , and against
Colonel Milligan	PERSON	and Mr.
Shipman	PERSON	I have not a single accusation to make .

		It was the age that was brutally senseless , and heedlessly cruel .

		It was lavish and wasteful of life , and had not the least idea of what civilized warfare ought to be , except in strategy .

		It was at the end of the flint-lock age , a stupid and heartless age , which believed that the application of every variety of torture was better for discipline than kindness , and was guilty , during the war , of enormities that would tax the most saintly to forgive . ''

		The practical certainty of death in this disease - infected prison , together with a friendly and convincing presentation of the
Federal	ORGANIZATION	side of the pending controversy from one of the officers in charge , finally induced
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	to obtain his freedom by swearing allegiance to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	and enlisting in the artillery service .

		But the seeds of disease were already in his system , and his only experience of warfare in the newly - adopted cause came some months later in the
navy	ORGANIZATION	, where he was more concerned with watch - ing and reporting for publication the progress of events , than with taking an enthusiastic part in shaping them .

		After all , it was no quarrel of his , and after fighting and suffering for the South he may well have found it hard to kindle the same degree of ardor for the North .

		Thence - forth , at any rate , it is as a roving press reporter , and an adventurous explorer of strange lands , that he finds outlet for his indomitable energy ; and his course from this point has been some - what closely followed by the reading public .

		Nevertheless , the old story , or a small part of the old story , of his meeting with
Livingstone	PERSON	may here bear re-telling .

		• • My mission to find
Livingstone	PERSON	was very simple , and was a clear and definite aim .

		All I had to do was to free my mind from all else , and relieve it of every earthly desire but the finding of the man whom I was sent to seek .

		To think of self , friends , banking-account , life - insurance , or any worldly interest but the one sole pur - pose of reaching the spot where
Livingstone	PERSON	might happen to rest , could only tend to weaken resolution .

		Intense application to my task assisted me to forget all I had left behind , and all that might lie ahead in future ... '' Our meeting took place on the
10th November , 1871	DATE	.

		It found him reduced to the lowest ebb in for - tune by his endless quest of the solution to the problem of that mighty river
Lualaba	LOCATION	, which , at a distance of three hundred miles from
Lake Tanganyika	LOCATION	, flowed parallel with the lake , northward .

		In body , he was , as he himself expressed it , ' a mere ruckle of bones . '

		330 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, '' The effect of the meeting was a rapid restoration to health ; he was also placed above want , for he had now stores in abundance sufficient to have kept him in
Ujiji	LOCATION	for years , or to equip an expedition capable of solving within a few months even that tough problem of the
Lualaba	LOCATION	.

		There was only one thing wanting to com - plete the old man 's happiness -- that was an obedient and tractable escort .

		Could I have furnished this to him there and then , no doubt
Livingstone	PERSON	would have been alive to-day -LSB- this was written in
1885	DATE	-RSB- , because , after a few days ' rest at
Ujiji	LOCATION	, we should have parted -- he to return to the
Lualaba	LOCATION	, and trace the river , per - haps , down to the sea , or until he found sufficient proofs that it was the
Congo	LOCATION	, which would be about seven hun - dred miles north-west of
Nyangwe	LOCATION	; I journeying to the
East Coast	LOCATION	. ''

		The occupations and interests of the explorer after retiring to the enjoyment of domestic life at Furze Hill , together with his parliamentary experience and other matters , sustain the in - terest of the volume to its closing page and the death of Stanley in
1904	DATE	.

		The whole is told , with a few intercalations and additions , by his own pen ; for he was a copious diarist .

		`` Thoughts from Note-books '' form a supplementary chap - ter , followed by an index and a map illustrating his three African journeys .

		The numerous por - traits , including nine of
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	and one of Lady Stanley , and other illustrations , are good .

		Despite the rather bitter philosophical reflec - tions that sprinkle its pages -- reflections that tend to show the writer as rather too constantly '' on the edge of resentment '' -LRB- to quote a phrase of his own -RRB- , and that indicate some unwhole - some brooding over past wrongs -- as where he says of reviewers that '' the Reviewer is either fulsome , or he is a bitter savage , striking stupidly because of blind hate '' -- the book is nothing short of absorbing in its interest .

		Stanley 's lit - erary style , as is already known , has the charm of clearness , vigor , and grace , with occasional unexpected felicities in apt quotation or well - chosen epithet .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		The Poet as Dramatist .

		* It seemed a notable event , a year or so ago , when it appeared that Mr.
William Vaughan Moody	PERSON	had written a successful play .

		That Mr.
Moody	PERSON	should write beautiful poetry , was some - thing to be thankful for .

		I remember still the freshness of the impression with which I discov - ered , on opening '' The Masque of Judgment , '' that instead of being a normal and respectable * The Great Divide .

		A Play in Three Acts .

		A Play in Four Acts .

William Vaughan Moody	PERSON	.

		New York :
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		drama in verse , it was really a dramatic poem with strange powers of stirring , thrilling , en - lightening .

		That impression I still believe to have been right ; for on looking at the book again , I feel much the same way about it .

		But a dramatic poem was one thing , and a play for the stage was another , -- as has often been urged , and indeed proved , by the authority of the box-office as well as of the critic .

		So it had not appeared improbable that Mr.
Moody	PERSON	might find himself unable to do what even
Browning	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	, for instance , had not succeeded in doing .

		But unquestionably '' The Great Di - vide '' has been very successful on the stage , and , although brought out two years ago , it is still presented .

		Mr.
Moody	PERSON	then wrote '' The Faith Healer , '' which has had a less favorable presentation on the stage .

		Both plays , how - ever , have been published , and invite the con - sideration of those who read as well as of those who go to the theatre .

		Once must say at once that they are both extremely interesting .

		I prefer '' The Masque of Judgment '' myself , when it comes to read - ing : doubtless I should prefer '' The Great Divide '' on the stage .

		These new plays are written in prose , whereby Mr.
Moody	PERSON	seems to give up his most wonderful power .

		But these changes are rather a necessity , and one should not quarrel with them .

		If a man is going to write for our stage to-day , it seems useless for him to try to write the kind of play that was successful three hundred years ago .

		I can not feel that Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	's poems are successful on the stage .

		If one speak of '' Cyrano de Ber - gerac '' or '' The Sunken Bell , '' I must admit that I have little to say , except that they were produced under other influences and other tra - ditions than those of our stage .

		In spite of these , it still seems a bit of tour-de-force for one to create a great success in poetry on the stage , at least on the American stage .

		As a rule , our dramatists can not even do the thing in prose .

		However that may be , Mr.
Moody	PERSON	has written his plays in prose , and in prose we must read him or pass him by for the present ^ A prose play , then , is what we have , -- or , \ rather , two such plays , one of an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	girl gone west , the other of a religious enthusiast .

		Perhaps poetry would not do for such subjects : Mr.
Moody	PERSON	wanted to deal with the life which had impressed him , with the life of to-day that we know , with the life of our own people and country .

		Probably it seemed to him that verse was out of the question .

		These things , he may have felt , demand the simplicity and the realism
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 331 of prose .

		Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	might have used verse had he chosen , when he wrote '' The Scarecrow , '' for that was a legendary tale of old New Eng - land .

		Mr.
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	might have thought fit to write ''
Nathan Hale	PERSON	'' in verse , for his story there came out of our own hero-period .

		Neither did so ; and perhaps one would hardly expect a man who is writing of to-day even to think of it .

		Mr.
Moody	PERSON	, then , is severely realistic in his form .

		Nor does he seize every advantage that he might ; there was perhaps elaborate scenery of mountain and canyon in the second act of '' The Great Divide , '' but '' The Faith Healer '' is set entirely in the main room of a '' farm - house near a small town in the
Middle West	LOCATION	. ''

		Still , the plays are the work of a poet ; and that , I believe , will constitute their great interest to the reader to-day .

		Mr.
Moody	PERSON	puts away from him all the help of stimulating figure and picture , -- all that belongs elsewhere , he may think , -- and finds or makes his poetry in the simple power of his conception .

		That is a great victory .

		I am not well versed in stage technique , and should hesitate to offer an opinion as to how much of it there may be in Mr.
Moody	PERSON	's plays .

		Of what is called dramatic construction , there seems to me only just enough .

		In '' The Great Divide , '' an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	girl in the West , in romantic sympathy with its unfinished bigness , is carried off by a man who happens in upon her when she is alone , much as a Dacotah in
Parkman	LOCATION	's day might have carried off a squaw .

		The man mar - ries her , and is successful in a gold-mine he has ; but they fail to find entire happiness , and she leaves him and goes to her old home .

		Our sympathies are with them ; we wish them to make a success of life .

		There is the crucial point : things are at their worst ; how are they to get right , if indeed they ever do ?

		Her hus - band comes East after her ; she appreciates him at his true worth , and they go back out West again -- beyond the
Great Divide	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is here , I suppose , enough dramatic construction for the stage .

		At the end of the first act the question is proposed ; at the end of the second -LRB- where
Ruth	PERSON	leaves her husband -RRB- it is at its farthest from solution .

		At the end of the play the question is solved .

		At the theatre one does not always demand explanations , if the action and dialogue are good .

		ut in reading , we ask , Why should she have left him ?

		and then , Why does she come back to him , or , rather , let him come to her ?

		Mr.
Moody	PERSON	, of course , provides answers to these ques - tions ; his characters are by no means without dialog -- bS motives .

		But I feel sure that many , even of those who saw the play , had little conception of just what those motives were ; indeed , I can - not be absolutely certain that after reading the play I know just how the final event is brought about .

		In '' The Faith Healer '' I believe this criticism is yet more applicable .

		In that play we have a religious enthusiast of wonderful spiritual power : he has raised the dead .

		In the family where he is staying for a time , he meets a woman , and they love each other .

		At that , his spiritual power seems to wane ; and fearing that it is she who is at fault , she resolves to leave him .

		In the last act , as in `` The Great Divide , '' the two understand each other , and his spiritual power returns .

		Here too the theatrical points , as we may call them , are definite ; we watch with pain - ful interest the ebb and flow of spiritual power .

		But why the ebb and why the flow ?

		I would not suggest that Mr.
Moody	PERSON	is not definite in his own mind in each play .

		The reason for the reader 's vagueness -LRB- if I may judge others by myself -RRB- comes from the nature of the means that he chooses .

		In '' The Great Divide '' the means lie in the particular spiritual nature of Ruth ; in '' The Faith Healer , '' in the particular spiritual nature of
Michaelis	PERSON	.

		Indefi - nite matters these , such as the poet understands sufficiently for his purpose , but which the aver - age reader may not always comprehend .

		In one of the plays , a matter-of-fact person says : '' Mystery !

		... You women would live on it if we 'd let you ! ''

		And
Rhoda	PERSON	answers , '' Whether you let us or not , we do live on it , and so does the whole world . ''

		I believe that accounts for Ruth too .

		I doubt if her husband ever understood just the reasons that led her from loathing to love ; probably he was quite content not to understand , so long as he knew .

		Perhaps we may be content to do something of the same sort .

		Mr.
Moody	PERSON	discerns currents of influence and of power that guide the world , and in his plays he presents them .

		There are many who will instinctively apprehend and respond to such things .

		We are not to imagine that
Ruth	PERSON	is merely fickle , with one whim one day and another the next ; that
Michaelis	PERSON	is merely an emotionalist , with his seasons of exaltation and depression .

		These people are inerrantly led by powers that they recognize even if they do not understand .

		Nor are such motives really inferior dramatic means .

		They may be , on the other hand , the very best means , -- easily better than all the clever contrivances that would be obvious enough 332 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, on the stage or in a book .

		Provided always that they be true to life ; and here one must have con - fidence in one 's poet .

		Doubtless we should not have confidence in everyone .

		Mr.
Moody	PERSON	says to us , People act and feel so and so .

		That is the way with the artist ; he almost of necessity takes the classic position of
Turner	ORGANIZATION	, with the person who did not see nature as he did : '' Do n't you wish you could ? ''

		Personally , I often wish I did , though it is more convenient from day to day if one can understand the more obvious things of the daily round .

		But it is refreshing now and then to get a glimpse of the other thing .

		There is much else in the plays worth men - tioning -- perhaps even with praise or blame , though Mr.
Moody	PERSON	presumably intends to go on his way without much regard to either .

		So I will speak of nothing else ; all the rest is , as
Verlaine	PERSON	said long since , merely literature .


Edward E. Hale	PERSON	, Jr. .

		The Literary History of
Rome	LOCATION	.

		* Mr.
Wight Duff	PERSON	's '' Literary History of
Rome	LOCATION	'' does not present formal catalogues of facts , arranged especially for reference work , like a Teuffel-Schwabe ; nor give convenient bird 's - eye views of men and movements , like the lesser American manuals of Lawton and
Fowler	PERSON	; nor contain extended studies of par - ticular phases , after the manner of a Sellar , a Nettleship , ora
Boissier	PERSON	; nor arouse the reader 's enthusiasm like the glowing appreciations of a Mackail ; but it is a book which is better than any single one of these , because it combines and unifies to no inconsiderable degree the virtues of all of them .

		The reader may well regret that it carries him only to the end of the Augustan Age .

		All things considered , if it were continued to the close of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, it would be the one work on the subject in any language which neither specialist nor layman could afford to omit from his library .

		Ending even as it does in mediis rebus , it is none the less valuable for the period it covers .

		It is a summing up of scholarship to date on the history and appreciation of a great historic literature through its most interesting and significant phases .

		Professor
Duff	PERSON	's work is written by a scholar who possesses wonderful patience and rare * A Literary History of
Rome	LOCATION	.

		From the Origins to the Close of the Golden Age .

		By
J. Wight Duff	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, Professor of Classics ,
Armstrong College	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- in the
University Durham	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ,
Newcastle-upon-Tyne	LOCATION	.

		New York : Charles • Scribner 's Sons .

		mastery over material , has not spared himself in his efforts , and has allowed himself the space requisite for the unmutilated and uncompressed presentation of his subject , without , however , presuming upon the privilege ; for he is a model of terseness and concentration .

		He will appeal most to the specialist audience -- to teachers and advanced students .

		His foot-notes are filled with special information : extensive lists of editions , in themselves comprising brief sketches of text - ual history ; citations of authorities covering the results of scholarship in all the phases allied to literature ; abundance of quotation from Latin writers , enabling the scholar to test for himself the author 's conclusions .

		Nor is the body of the page less replete with scholarly matter ; if Professor
Duff	PERSON	has sinned at all , it is in having presented too much , rather than too little .

		Perhaps an approved history of Roman literature ought to carry along with it the vast bulk of uninteresting detail about authors who were in their own time obscure representatives of minor movements , and who are known now only by name , or at most by fragments preserved in unliterary connections by later grammarians and other unliterary special - ists .

		If this is true , it must be on the theory that , in the treatment of a far-away period like Roman antiquity , absolutely nothing is negligible .

		The reader is tempted to think , as he labors through some parts of the work -- notably the careful pages dealing with the lesser dramatists , the annalists ,
Alexandrinism	PERSON	, and other examples of the unknown and unadored -- that the author has shed his ink on the pertinent and imperti - nent alike ; and feels like turning on him with his own sensible statement a propos of Livy 's omissions : ''
Livy	PERSON	produced a much more real impression by avoiding the boredom of pedantic tmnuticB . ''

		We may let that pass , however : perhaps it is as well for an author to be on the safe side -- especially as his reviewer himself may have made his reputation by sagacious treatment of the unessential .

		Professor
Duff	PERSON	's book fortunately contains also a wealth of the essential , such as may be found in no other work on the subject ; and this fits it for the wider circle -LRB- who may omit the less significant portions if they choose -RRB- , as well as for the specialist .

		He pursues a con - sistent and effective method : sketching first the character of the times and the author 's environ - ment ; then narrating , in a finely sympathetic spirit , his life experience ; discussing next his works , in chronological order , and in a manner which , in a work of this size , may be termed
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 333 exhaustive ; and concluding with a critical estimate which is the best feature of the book .

		Those who wish to test the truth of this will do well to turn to the author 's treatment of Plautus ,
Catullus	LOCATION	,
Cicero	LOCATION	,
Virgil	PERSON	, or , best of all ,
Horace	PERSON	.

		Even the less known in letters , as Ennius and
Cato	ORGANIZATION	, are made to stand forth with remarkable distinctness , both as literary char - acters and men .

		For all the multitude of detail , the author succeeds in unifying the impression , and makes of the subjects of his sketches living Personalities .

		His summaries of literary appre - ciation are packed with detail , and noteworthy for richness .

		It is not often that the much in little is so well exemplified as in the explana - tion of the universality of
Horace	PERSON	's appeal in pp. 534-545 .

		This prompts a further summary of Professor
Duff	PERSON	's good qualities .

		His scholarship is broad and deep : he not only gives a full account of literature itself , but harmonizes and unifies his work as a whole by painting in the linguistic , political , and religious background .

		His famil - iarity with modern literature also serves him and his readers well ; it is with rare pleasure that one happens on the terse and facile allusions in his pages : pedantic
Varro	PERSON	's seventy hebdomads are `` the forgivable sum of seventy times seven '' ; the bargeman in
Horace	PERSON	sings of the girl he left behind him -- absentem nt cantat amicam ;
Ovid	LOCATION	, '' the idle singer of an empty day , ; ' died in exile , '' heart-sick of hope deferred .

		* ' To his knowledge add brotherly kindness : he is sympathetic .

		He likes his subject , and is on friendly terms with the men he introduces .

		And to his brotherly kindness add temperance .

		He sees their shortcomings , and does not curtly condemn and dismiss ; he sees their virtues , and does not let enthusiasm blind him .

		This means simply that he is sane and well balanced ; he follows the golden mean by nat - ural inclination rather than mere calculation .

		He knows the artificiality of Virgil 's Eclogues , and the Homeric reflex in the iEneid ; but real - izes that this is only on the surface , and that the
Mantuan	PERSON	's love of nature in the garden of the world , and the Roman quality of the story of ^ Eneas , are none the less genuine .

		He recog - nizes that Plautus drew from Greek Comedy , but makes us see the essentially Italian nature of the product .

		He can charge
Cicero	PERSON	with vanity and redundancy , without causing the reader to despise the great Roman for it ; he admits that the orator was not a poet of the first * class , but has the sense to commend his verse for the good qualities it does display , and the courage to suggest the `` true view that
Cicero	PERSON	ia a vivacious and tasteful intermediary who trans - mitted to
Lucretius	PERSON	and Catullus the ancient Latin versification enhanced in dignity , and , still more decidedly , in technique . ''

		He appre - ciates the practical and the scientific aspect of the poem of Lucretius , but knows that the poetic and spiritual are what determine its real char - acter .

		He can see that
Caesar	PERSON	had a great mind and a great heart , without attributing to him either sublime patriotism or divine foresight in his teens .

		His sanity and balance find especially clear expression in his comparisons :
Horace	PERSON	and Catullus ,
Cicero	PERSON	and
Livy	PERSON	, etc. .

		Most of all are these qualities seen in the author 's insistence on the national character of Latin literature .

		He will not hear to the facile dismissal of Latin letters , and Roman art in general , as mere Hellenistic products , -- a view in which Latin scholarship has been wont to acquiesce .

		He will give all due credit to Hellenic influence , but not without maintaining that the Greek and Roman literatures are separately animated expressions ; with
Franz Wickhoff	PERSON	and Mrs. Strong , he contributes at the same time to justice and good sense by asserting the Italian nature of Roman art .

		This , and the historical importance of the Latin language and literature , are the two large lessons of the book .

		The English versions with which Professor
Duff	PERSON	enlivens his work afford no small pleasure to the reader , who is courteously given the oppor - tunity to judge of their excellence by compari - son with the Latin original at the bottom of the page .

		His versions of both poetry and prose are noteworthy for accuracy and good taste .

		The lines from
Pacuvius	LOCATION	and Catullus ,
Vivamus	LOCATION	, mea
Lesbia	LOCATION	, and the neat sonnet translation of
Lugete	LOCATION	, O Veneres , are examples of his clever - ness .

		In Horace he is not so felicitous , -- but that might be expected in the case of an author who is universally recognized as `` the type of the untranslatable . ''

		But nihil est ab omni parte beatum .

		After the noting of all these excellences of the book , it will cause surprise and regret to be told that a sense of monotony in style insists on rising into the reader 's consciousness as often as momentary flagging of interest in the subject-matter gives it opportunity , and is indeed never very far from the surface .

		The author 's nervous quick - ness , clarity , and straightforwardness are admir - ably adapted to occasional detailed characteriza - tion , or to the rapid fire of learned minutice ; but for narrative and criticism the style does 334 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	not flow enough ; the sentences are simple and clear , but do not fuse ; the reader is not carried in a current , but advances on foot , and is too often conscious of the sound of his steps .

		There is great dearth not only of colons , semi-colons , and commas , -- which , of course , do not of themselves give forth virtue , -- but also of the streaming quality of which they should be the sign ; and in the use of connectives , which more than anything else gives Ciceronianism its mag - nificent onward sweep , Professor Duff either disbelieves or is unpractised .

		It is not without significance that he selects for translation from the second Philippic a passage containing few connectives , and omits to render part of those .

		He is consistent and natural , but consistency is not a jewel which fits every setting .

		Two
Great Masters of English Poetry	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The two most important periods of our poetic literature , it will hardly be denied , are the age of Shakespeare and the age of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	; and the two most significant poets in these periods are those who give them their names .

		It is not surprising , therefore , that out of eleven lectures the Professor of Poetry at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	should devote four each to these periods , the remaining three being of a general character .

		Shakespeare admittedly is inexhaustible ; and readers and critics are finding
Wordsworth	PERSON	more and more worthy of profound study .

		Professor
Bradley	PERSON	's keen and illuminating work on '' Shakespearean Tragedy '' showed how much there was to be said on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's best-known plays , after all these years of criticism ; and now two of his lectures , '' The Rejection of Falstaff '' and ''
Antony	PERSON	and Cleopatra , '' treat familiar themes *

		in a fresh and interesting fashion .

		The other two lectures , '' Shakespeare the Man '' and ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	's Theatre and Audience , '' are rather an entertaining re-statement of facts than a new contribution to scholarship .

		The same penetration that gave us one of the most admir - able and sympathetic studies of '' Hamlet '' has given us here equally successful appreciations of Falstaff and Cleopatra , perhaps the three most remarkable characters in the whole Shake - spearean gallery .

		The various theories to ac - count for the rejection of Falstaff are fairly discussed , and , after a full consideration of the characters of the Prince and the Knight , are overthrown .

		Even the very clever suggestion of the German Roetscher , that Sir
John	PERSON	's remark , '' Master Shallow , I owe you a thousand pound , '' is a final stroke of wit , showing his superiority to the
King	ORGANIZATION	's rebuff -- this too has to go by the board .

		Much as we should like to be virtuous with
Henry	ORGANIZATION	and happy with Falstaff , we are forced to see in the latter 's commitment to the Fleet and his subsequent death something that is far from being a joke .

		Shakespeare , as Pro- fessor Bradley contends , has here overreached himself ; he has made the character so excellent in its humor that he could by no devices remove the spell he has woven round the admirers of the fat old knight .

		He can not make us believe him to be the rascally reprobate our colder reason assures us he is .

		`` Our hearts go out to
Falstaff	LOCATION	, to the Fleet , or , if necessary , to
Arthur	PERSON	's bosom , or wheresomever he is . ''

		The case of Falstaff is something like that of Cleopatra .

		With all her grievous faults , those which belong to her as a sort of '' sublimated Doll Tearsheet , '' which we must condemn with - out being puritanical , she never for a moment loses her eternal fascination for us .

		The end of Falstaff does not fulfil
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's intention , for we ought not to feel sorrow at Sir
John	PERSON	's fate ; whereas we do , so completely has he won our affections .

		There are certain traits of character which Professor Bradley points out as common to both Falstaff and
Cleopatra	LOCATION	, strange as it may at first sight appear .

		She is vain , and so is he ; and in the second interview with the Messenger she is comic .

		She carries all before her , as Sir
John	PERSON	does ; and yet her empire , like his , is built on sand . ''

		Finally , as his love for the Prince gives dignity and pathos to Falstaff in his overthrow , so what raises Cleopatra at last into pure tragedy is , in part , that which some critics have denied her , her love for Antony . ''

		It is the combination of splendid qualities with vulgar
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 335 ones that makes her the wonderful creation she is , and that puts this play in a different class from any one of the great tragedies .

		We can - not regret that she and her lover did not gain the world , as we do in the case of Hamlet , or Othello , or even Romeo .

		And this is not due so much to the illicit nature of their love as to the fact that they '' come before us in a glory already tarnished , half ruined by their past . ''

		Their love has not the certitude of permanence ; neither trusts the other fully .

		Never was such love so gloriously presented ; but when the glory dies away , it does not leave us mourning .

		The criticism is well taken , that the fact that we mourn so little saddens us .

		The triumph of the lovers is complete , and we feel that life can not offer them what it might offer the great tragic heroes and heroines .

		That
Wordsworth	PERSON	is the most sublime of our poets since
Milton	PERSON	, is the contention Professor Bradley maintains in the greater part of his lecture on
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		He insists that the mystic , visionary , sublime aspect of Words - worth 's poetry must not be slighted .

		And the sublime
Professor Bradley	ORGANIZATION	defines in a lecture on that subject included in this volume as the image of the boundlessness of the Infinite , '' its rejection of any pretension to independence or absoluteness on the part of its finite forms . ''

		It is just such a conception of the sublime that
Wordsworth	PERSON	illustrates in the lines descriptive of his descent of the Alps : the torrents , crags , and winds '' Were all like workings of one mind , the features Of the same face , blossoms upon one tree : Characters of the great Apocalypse , The types and symbols of Eternity , Of first , and last , and midst , and without end . ''

		And this sublimity is associated in Words - worth 's case with the mountains and with soli - tude , Professor Bradley remarks .

		Yes , it is largely true ; but '' Tintern Abbey '' is evidence that other scenes than the mountains or other conditions than absolute solitude may call forth '' an aspect more sublime '' ; '' that blessed mood , In which the burthen of the mystery , In which the heavy and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world , Is lightened . ''

		But he was preeminently the poet of the moun - tains ; here '' he felt his faith , '' just as
Byron	PERSON	was the poet of the sea .

		So he is likewise and inevitably the poet of solitude . ''

		Lucy Gray '' has the mystic touch that marks it off from certain trivial verses included in the '' Lyrical Ballads . ''

		On the other hand , to give a sub - lime significance to ''
Alice Fell	PERSON	, '' as Professor Bradley tries to do , seems very hard .

		Her grief is not unbounded , as sublime grief must be , since a few shillings dry all her tears .

		Other lectures are upon '' Poetry for
Poe	PERSON	- try 's Sake , '' '' The Sublime , '' ''
Hegel	PERSON	's Theory of Tragedy , '' `` Shelley 's View of Poetry , '' '' The Long Poem in the Age of
Wordsworth	PERSON	, '' and the '' Letters of Keats . ''

		As a whole , the book is worthy of its author and of his profes - sorship .

France	LOCATION	.

		* For nearly a generation , Professor
Henry M. Baird	PERSON	s '' Rise of the Huguenots '' has remained the most detailed and reliable treatment in English of the earlier fortunes of the French Protestants .

		Meanwhile the literature of the subject has been enriched in
France	LOCATION	by the pub - lication of many important monographs , of memoirs and biographies , of collections of state and family papers , and especially of the studies of hundreds of particular questions in the suc - cessive `` Bulletins de la Societe du Protestant - isme franqais ^ To make the results of this vast inquiry available for the comprehension of the period between
1559	DATE	and
1576	DATE	, and at the same time to present the conclusions of his own independent investigations , is the aim of Professor
Thompson	PERSON	's volume on '' The Wars of Religion in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		He brings the narrative to an end with an account of the
Peace of Mon	ORGANIZATION	- sieur in
1576	DATE	, because he believes the war then ceased to be distinctively '' religious `` and be - came political .

		Over this field still hangs an atmosphere heavy with bitter confessional controversy .

		It was a time when , under cover of religion , men sought political or personal ends ; when churches were sacked , and beautiful windows broken , and richly sculptured shrines destroyed ; when a
Duke of Guise	ORGANIZATION	was murdered by a Protestant fanatic , and a Parisian Catholic mob murdered
Coligny	ORGANIZATION	and hundreds of Huguenots .

		In deal - ing with such a field , it is difficult to avoid some of the pitfalls of partisan feeling ; but Professor
Thompson	PERSON	has been able to approach all its problems in a spirit of calm and scientific impar - tiality .

		His principal concern has obviously been that his statements accord exactly with the *

		336 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, evidence .

		It is probably true , however , that some will miss that warm sympathy for the Huguenot cause that pervaded Dr.
Baird	PERSON	's volumes .

		The serious student of the period will be impressed , not merely by the author 's fairness , but even more by his large command of the literature of the subject , both printed books and manuscript material .

		Indeed , there is such wealth of references to authorities and to docu - ments , such extended notes also on related facts , that ordinary readers may not escape the feeling of being burdened with erudition .

		The com - plexity of the subject tempts to such incidental discussion , which scholars will welcome ; for thereby they are put in confidential relations with the author , admitted as it were to his study , where they may follow his thought into all the intricacies of the evidence .

		To give a lucid in - terpretation of the struggle , Professor
Thompson	PERSON	has been obliged to hold firmly many distinct threads in the web of affairs .

		It is not enough to consider the churchmen and the heretics , for ancient political forces were still at work , their effect in turn modified by individual and family interests , and the whole further confused by the manoeuvres of foreign princes like
Philip II.	PERSON	, the self-appointed agent of
Providence	LOCATION	in restor - ing the shaken ecclesiastical edifice to its ancient foundations , and
Elizabeth	PERSON	, who found in the troubles of her neighbors an interval of quiet for her realm .

		Closely involved also in the struggle was the fate of the Netherlanders .

		One will wish that in spite of his anxiety to keep strictly to the evidence Professor
Thompson	PERSON	had given more fully his estimates of men like Coligny , who are constantly on the stage .

		He mentions him many times , but not in such a way that the reader can obtain readily the author 's estimate of his character and significance .

		Of
Catherine	PERSON	and of Charles IX .

		there are clearer portraits .

		On three phases of the situation during the period of the
Religious Wars	ORGANIZATION	, this work is unusually illuminating : the character of the German troops called in by both sides , the ori - gin of the provincial leagues , and the influence of economic conditions on the course of the struggle .

		The presence of the German Reiters , who were moved to take part on one side or the other by something more weighty than their own religious convictions , accounts in a measure for the atrocious character of the campaigning .

		The populations seem to have suffered much as they did during the last period of the Hundred Years ' War .

		A more important matter is the provincial leagues , which gain their interest from the fact that they were the first hesitant steps toward the great league which in the period after
1576	DATE	was stronger than the Crown .

		Pro- fessor
Thompson	PERSON	shows how some grew out of the local guilds , which had class as well as religious motives for opposing the Huguenot movement .

		This suggests the interplay of eco - nomic forces and religious tendencies , to which he thinks the attention given hitherto has been insufficient .

		The economic situation , he explains , was affected not merely by the ordinary vicissitudes of agricultural fortune , hard winters , crop fail - ures and famine , but also by the industrial revolution which had been going forward for a century .

		He believes that this revolution , which had been transforming the trade guilds into oligarchies of masters , was so influential in `` its social and economic effects upon the
Reforma	LOCATION	- tion that in a very true sense the religious movement may be said to have been the subor - dinate one . ''

		Again , he says that `` hosts of dissatisfied workmen throughout
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	began to identify themselves with Pro- testantism , not for religious reasons , but because the Reformation constituted exactly that for which they were seeking , a protest . ''

		He esti - mates that before
1560	DATE	the bulk of the Hugue not party was made up of artisans .

		For this his evidence is mainly the records of the heresy trials during the reign of Henry II .

		But upon this matter it is worth noting , as
M. Lemonnier	PERSON	does in a work to which Professor
Thompson	PERSON	refers , that although most of the persons brought to trial belonged to the lesser bourgeoisie , or were simple artisans , it would be unsafe to accept this as proof that the Protestant party contained few of the nobility or upper middle class , because in the sixteenth century the nobles still retained privileges which protected them in a measure against arrest .

		Further , even if the bulk of the party was made up of artisans , this would not serve as conclusive proof that the religious movement was with them mainly the means of offering a protest against social and industrial injustice .

		It has always been true that '' to the poor the gospel is preached . ''

		They were predisposed by expe - rience to listen to a gospel which discovered that the traditional classification of men into barons and peasants , masters and journeymen , was of slight import compared with the simple Calvinistic division into those whom God had chosen and those whom he had not chosen .

		This was a new standard of values , based after

		THE DIAL 337 all upon individual moral worth ; and it was a potent revolutionary force .

		Unlike most historians of the period , Professor
Thompson	PERSON	does not give a detailed account of the
Massacre of Saint Bartholomew	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is inclined to hold
Elizabeth	LOCATION	partly responsible for its occurrence , because by her rejection of the treaty negotiated in the
spring of 1572	DATE	, she left the French to confront Philip alone ; and this Charles IX .

		was afraid to do , so that he drew back from his engagements with
Louis of Nassau	ORGANIZATION	.

		Had Charles persisted ,
Catherine	PERSON	would have had no motive to procure the assassi - nation of Coligny .

		It hardly needs saying that Professor
Thompson	PERSON	does not consider the mas - sacre the result of a plot put together at
Bayonne	LOCATION	years before .

		He remarks that not what
Catherine	PERSON	did there , but what the Huguenots feared she had done , had much to do with the later troubles .

		The volume is enriched with many instructive maps and equally interesting prints .

		There are also appendices containing illustrative documents drawn from the

		The surviving contemporaries and familiars of the famous

		It is fitting that his life should be written by one of these , and , in order to ensure balanced judgment , by one who '' was and still is a Republican in politics , identified with the party that was directly in antagonism to Senator

		Mr.
Jonathan Thayer Lincoln	PERSON	, a Fall River manufacturer who has written a book called • ` The City of the Dinner Pail '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which he presents a pleasing picture of the cotton - mill workers who constitute a quarter of the popu - lation of his city , and discusses , with seventeen years of factory experience to draw upon , the actual and the desirable relations of the employed to their employers .

		He finds , in his own city at least , `` the law of progress operating in a class of working - people seeking its end through culture . ''

		In all that makes for the higher life , he asserts , this cotton - manufacturing city of many races and many lan - guages has made greater advance than in material things .

		Only nine years after
Boston	LOCATION	established the first free public library , the City of the Dinner Pail founded a similar institution ; and other indi - cations of enlightenment are not wanting .

		The solution of the labor problem , the author believes , is to be found , not in legislation , but '' in a fuller understanding of the lives of those we meet and talk with and pass by each day . ''

		Increased knowledge and sympathy and mutual good-will would , as all must admit , greatly hasten the coming of the millennium .

		Trade-unions the author regards as capable of benefit to both laborer and capitalist ; but he recognizes the abuses of unionism as it now exists .

		In noting with regret the narrowing influ - ence of specialism , whether in the manual arts or in the learned professions , he makes passing reference to '' doctors of medicine whose knowledge of anat - omy is confined to a single organ , lawyers who are unable to address a jury , and clergymen who can not preach sermons .

Mttnster	PERSON	- An inquiry into .

		* r the values of our berg 's interests and the versatility of philosophic life , j ^ g contributions is eminently demon - strated in his ability to publish within a year a vol - ume applying psychological results to legal evidence , a book of appeal to teachers from the psychological pulpit , and a comprehensive inquiry into the eternal values of our philosophical life .

		Originally written in German , the latter book appeared in its English form some months ago -LRB- u The Eternal Values '' -- Houghton -RRB- , and will interest the same set of readers who in this country are accustomed to follow the author 's more philosophical contributions .

		For their benefit it may be said that the book implies a will - ingness on their part to consider minutely and thoroughly the ground-work of the logic of experience as it is interpreted and made significant by the impos - ing system of human values .

		It is a discussion of fundamental points of view , a discussion that deter - mines how we shall think of science , of philosophy , of duty , of destiny .

		Its central distinction is that of the causal logically-elaborated universe , and of the ethical duty-directed world in which our human civilized interests prevail .

		It is thus a volume neither lightly to be taken up nor inconsiderately to be laid down .

		Its reading involves both leisure and the contemplative habit , and on the other hand a faith that Professor
Mttnsterberg	PERSON	's guidance through many long pages and devious paths is acceptable .

		For the work can not be said to be original in any other sense than that it gives a personally-conducted tour through the mazes of philosophical attitudes , in which pursuit the person - ality of the conductor forms a notable factor in the pleasure and profit of the enterprise .

		Utilizing the association which mod - ` th F eTeicn7r V '' and ern education recognizes between psychology and the teacher , Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	arranges in systematic form his ideas of what teachers should know and feel .

		It is largely advice , partly sermonizing , together with some sound exposition of wholesome texts ; and the whole , if well shaken and frequently taken , should prove an efficient corrective for much weak sentiment and weaker thinking that passes for wisdom at educa - tional meetings .

		The earlier pronouncements of the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	psychologist on the relation of psychology to education -- the relation being set forth as a nonentity or a menace -- were over-seasoned ; and the present prefatorial attempt to explain them is as unsuccessful as it is unnecessary .

		Professor Mttn - sterberg 's text speaks for itself .

		That no superficial manipulation of psychological data can supply ethical motives , or set a goal to our endeavors , is as true and as pertinent to this day and generation as to their predecessors , The swamping of all educational ideals by utilitarian and commercial concerns remains the '' yellow peril '' ; and nothing but a widely dis - seminated and enthusiastic sense of the categorical imperative among morally vertebrate personalities will keep it down .

		When we are told , or read , as teachers are told , that he who throws his influence in behalf of thoroughness rather than the immedi - ately attractive , who makes children willing as well as able to realize ideals , who presents ideals not as the refuge of flabby souls but as the dominant source of wholesome action , who makes the school a place where beauty , harmony , and character may be treated as realities and established as motives , before their pursuit is hopelessly swamped in the street and the market-place , is filling his place as a teacher , it all sounds trite , and we know we have heard it before .

		But there is really little else to say .

		The situation is one that calls for doing , not talking ; and it is only because there is such confusion of tongues that some plain speaking is - still to be welcomed .

		Professor
Mtinsterberg	PERSON	says more than this : he pre - sents some pertinent illustrations of how psycho - logical insight lets in light upon actual problems ; and he clears away some venerable cobwebs , as well as the entangling constructions of more modern spiders , in the musty educational cellar .

		He is really trying to put the foundations in order ; though the conception of his task leads him to a personally - conducted and critical tour from cellar to attic , or from kindergarten to the university .

		The Teutonic thoroughness of the survey militates somewhat against the actual attractiveness of the expedition .

		Our teachers are not quite used to being thus addressed ; and there is a danger , as is common with sermons , that those most in need of the uplift are not to be found in the congregation .

		After outlining the economic , social , and political conditions which preceded the inauguration of the federal system ten years ago , the author treats of the framework of the

		The reader will share the author 's regret that the book is but an outline sketch .

		We should welcome , for example , a more extended discussion of the success of the experiment of combining the parliamentary system of
Great Britain	LOCATION	with the Federal system of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It was predicted at the outset that there could not be a responsible government which was responsible to two houses of parliament .

		Mr.
Wise	PERSON	shows that the anticipated conflict has not yet come to a direct issue , because thus far the senate has been divided on the same party lines as the house .

		But he sees in this the failure of the senate to per - form its original function as a States house , and concludes that the tendency is therefore toward the supremacy of the lower house and the consequent strengthening of the system of responsible govern - ment at the expense of the idea of federation .

		But the facts on which his inference is based are not set forth in sufficient detail to enable one to test the accuracy of his judgment .

		There is still room for a more compendious and detailed treatment of the constitutional questions of the new commonwealth .

		The pictures of the Huguenot , the Catholic and the modern boy , are in themselves fine ; but they are treated as types of the forces which are at work building the new age , and the incidents in the lad 's career are occasions for display of a wealth of learning and personal reflection in the field of modern pedagogy .

W. D. Howells	PERSON	, prepared by Mr.
Percival Chubb	PERSON	for use as a supplementary reader , and published by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The diverting and informing introductions contrib - uted by Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	to the '' Everyman 's Library '' edition of
Dickens	PERSON	are to be gathered into a separate volume and published before long by
Messrs. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Mary Sinclair	PERSON	's new novel is to be published serially , the first instalment appearing this month in `` The Century Magazine . ''

		This latest work by the author of '' The Divine Fire '' is a story of artists and writers in
London	LOCATION	, and is called '' The Creators : A Comedy . ''

		The library of the late
Simon Newcomb	PERSON	, the astron - omer , has been presented to the College of the
City of New York	ORGANIZATION	by
John Claflin	PERSON	, who purchased it from the
Newcomb	PERSON	estate .

		It consists of
6000	DATE	volumes and
3000	DATE	pamphlets on scientific subjects , some of them very rare .

		Miss
Laura Stedman	PERSON	, of
New York City	LOCATION	, has con - cluded a contract for the publication of the official '' Life and Letters of
E. C. Stedman	PERSON	, '' which she now has in active preparation .

		Miss
Stedman	PERSON	is the poet 's granddaughter .

		Messrs.
Moffat	PERSON	,
Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will be the publishers .

		A timely book on big game shooting is announced for publication this month by the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will be called '' Hunting in
British East Africa	LOCATION	, '' and is the record of a highly successful hunt made by
Percy C. Madeira	PERSON	over much the same ground that Mr.
Roose	PERSON	- velt is now covering .

		It is reported that Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	, authors of the very successful life of
Whistler	LOCATION	published last year , are coming to the
United States	LOCATION	in
January	DATE	next and will make a joint lecture tour .

		It is under - stood that they will talk of '' Whistler the Artist and the Man , '' '' The History of Illustration , '' and '' Engraving . ''

		Under the title of '' The History of Science , '' a series of books , each one devoted to the history of one of the leading branches of science , is announced by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		The first two volumes of the series will be a
History of Astronomy	ORGANIZATION	and a
History of Chemistry	ORGANIZATION	, written respectively by
George Forbes	PERSON	and by Sir
Edward Thorpe	PERSON	. ''

		In Starland with a Three-Inch Telescope , '' by Mr.
William Tyler Olcott	PERSON	, is a little book that will prove very convenient to the amateur astronomer , even if equipped with nothing better than a good opera-glass .

		There are many diagrams , including a series of the moon at various ages .

		The book is pubhshed by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		The publication of that much-needed work , a
Scots Dialect Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, is announced from
London	LOCATION	.

		It has been prepared by the Rev.
Alexander Warrack	PERSON	, for - merly of Leswalt .

		The work is to be dedicated to Dr.
Craigie	PERSON	, of the English Dictionary , and has an intro - duction by Mr.
Grant	PERSON	, Lecturer on Phonetics in the
Aberdeen Training College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Chalmers Hadley	PERSON	, formerly Secretary and State Organizer of the
Public Library Commission of Indiana	ORGANIZATION	, has been chosen to take charge of the new
Chicago	LOCATION	headquarters of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, on the fifth floor of the
Public Library Building	ORGANIZATION	, where all visiting library workers will find much to interest them .

		It is announced that the new offices are open daily from nine to five , and members visiting
Chicago	LOCATION	may have mail sent there and are cordially invited to use the rooms .

		The Putnams will shortly publish ''
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	-- the People 's Leader in the Struggle for
National Existence	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Put	PERSON	- nam has utilized an address given on the Centennial Commemoration Day ,
February 12 , 1909	DATE	, as the germ for this monograph , which presents the main events in the career of the people 's leader .

		That
Ben Jonson	PERSON	was the author of an English grammar is a fact that may come as a surprise even to students of English literature .

		That the work is '' an interesting milestone in the history of the English language '' is a fact that has so impressed itself upon Miss
Alice Vinton Waite	PERSON	that she has edited it for the use of teachers .

		The work , based upon the text of
1640	DATE	, is published by the
Sturgis & Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first Grammar of the language spoken by the
Bontoc Igorot	PERSON	-LRB- a mountain tribe of
North Luzon	LOCATION	,
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	-RRB- , by Dr.
Carl Wilhelm Seidenadel	PERSON	, is announced by the
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This Grammar , the first of the hitherto unexplored idiom of the
Bontoc Igorot	PERSON	, contains the results of a scholar 's independent and uninfluenced research ; it is based entirely upon material collected directly from the natives ' lips .

		An extensive Vocabulary of more than four thousand Igorot words , and Texts on Mythology , Folk Lore , Historical Episodes and Songs , are included in this book , which furnishes an abundance of trust - worthy material and new theories about the structure of Philippine languages in general .

		An announcement of unusual interest to American bibliophiles is that the next publication of The Doves Press , to appear this month , will be a reprint of the paper on
William Caxton	ORGANIZATION	read by
George Parker	PERSON	Win - ship , Librarian of the
John Carter Brown Library of Providence	ORGANIZATION	, before the Club of Odd Volumes , in Feb - ruary of last year .

		The edition will be Umited to 300 paper copies , and 15 copies on vellum .

		Mr.
Cobden	PERSON	-
Sanderson	PERSON	has also in press , for issue this month , a tercentenary edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Sonnets , printed verbatim et literatim from the original edition `` im - printed at
London	LOCATION	by
G. Eld	ORGANIZATION	for T. T.
1609	DATE	, '' on the same plan as the reprint of '' Hamlet '' reviewed in the last issue of The Dial .

		A new volume -LRB- the second -RRB- in the Doves Press edition of Goethe 's '' Faust '' will appear in the Spring of next year ; the first part , it will be recalled , was published in
1906	DATE	. ''

		Representative Biographies of English men of Letters , '' edited by Messrs.
Charles T. Copeland	PERSON	and
Frank W. C. Hersey	PERSON	, is published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Carlyle 's essay on '' Biography '' serves as an intro - duction , and is followed by three classes of examples .

		In the first class , we have extracts from such famous autobiographies as those of
Lord Herbert of Cherbury	ORGANIZATION	and
Gibbon	PERSON	, and autobiographical passages from the writings of
Pepys	LOCATION	, Swift ,
Cibber	ORGANIZATION	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Dickens	PERSON	,
Ruskin	PERSON	, and
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		In the second group we have examples of the work of famous biographers , complete lives in some cases , extracts in others .

		The authors here illustrated are
Walton	PERSON	,
Johnson	PERSON	,
Boswell	PERSON	,
Southey	LOCATION	,
Lockhart	LOCATION	,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		The third group offers reprints of a dozen lives from the `` Dictionary of National Biography , '' illustrating the
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 341 methods of such writers as Messrs.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	,
Austin Dobson	PERSON	,
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	,
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	,
Richard Gar	PERSON	- nett , and
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	.

		This makes a useful collection of material for the student of biographical technique , but the selection is too haphazard to be of much use to the student of the history of English literature .

		Col.
Theodore A. Dodge	PERSON	, the well-known military historian , critic , and writer , died in
Versailles	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, on the
26th of October	DATE	, at the age of sixty-seven .

		Colonel Dodge was one of the brilliant young
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts officers who achieved distinction in the Civil War , enlisting as a private in
1861	DATE	and being in com - mand of a regiment before he was twenty-one .

		At
Gettysburg	LOCATION	he lost a leg , and on other fields sustained severe wounds .

		After the war ,
Colonel Dodge	ORGANIZATION	's edu - cation and experience led him to take up the study of military subjects , in which he attained high rank as a student and author .

		His '' Birds-eye View of the Civil War '' and '' The Chmpaign of
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	'' are perhaps the best known of his works , which range from lighter essays and magazine articles to a '' History of the Art of War '' in twelve volumes .

		Colonel Dodge 's memory is especially cherished by The Dial , to which he was a frequent and always welcome contributor during its earlier years .

		The publication by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons of the Memorial Edition of the
Works of * George Meredith	ORGANIZATION	will begin in this country during this Fall , probably in
November	DATE	, and simultaneously with the publication in
England	LOCATION	.

		The set will include from twenty-five to twenty-seven volumes ; it will be printed from new type on fine paper , and will be handsomely bound .

		The illustrations will comprise reproductions of many of the original illustrations which accompanied the author 's novels and poems when published in mag - azine form , a number of portraits taken at different periods of Meredith 's life , pictures especially taken for this edition from scenes associated by the author with many of his novels and poems , reproductions of MSS. , etc. .

		The edition will include the hitherto unpublished novel , '' Celt and
Saxon	PERSON	, '' and an unfinished comedy , `` The Sentimentalists '' ; while in the volumes of short stories and essays will be included some incomplete
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		and several critical reviews and articles .

		The poems will include all the poetry published by the au - thor over his name , or with regard to the publication of which he left instructions .

		There will also be a volume containing the various changes , etc. , made by
Meredith	PERSON	in his work , together with a complete bibliography .

		`` A very big thought in a very unusual and sometimes classic book . ''

		--
Ella Wheeler Wilcox	PERSON	, in the New York Journal .

		`` Quite unlike other books , and not amenable to classifica - tion , '
Tamam	PERSON	' presents a series of studies of the inner life and of psychological experience intertwined with pictures of the outer side of life , varied with pleasing descriptions of natural scenes , and all bound together with a thread of intense emotion afforded by the love of a strong , deep-natured man and a woman of equal strength of ` feeling .

		The author does not even give these two people names , and they pass in and out of the scenes almost as weirdly as if they were ghosts deeply colored with human passions .

		The book has a certain quiet strength combined with refinement of feeling , and is very well written .

		The title is a Persian word , meaning oblivion . ''

The Nation	ORGANIZATION	has to say about HAPPY HAWKINS By
ROBERT ALEXANDER WASON	PERSON	'' One opens ' Happy
Hawkins	PERSON	' expecting the usual ranch and cowboy novel .

		Abundant , in truth , are ranch and cowboy , guns , gambling dens -- but they all stand for something better and larger than `` effects . '

		Happy
Hawkins	PERSON	tells his own story in undiluted Western language .

		His story is so good and he tells it with such a fine capacity for knowing how to do it that every page does , indeed , hold the interest in a grip that is at first surprise , then admiration , and at last positive affection .

		The most dialect-weary reader must own that here the dialect in an indispensable charm ; and those who stop the ears when American humor is mentioned need have no fear -- for here is the thing in its best estate .

		Melodrama there is , but far more of daily human nature .

		In an occasional flaming color there is revealed less of the theatrical than of the eternal boyish .

		The question is : has any nove l of the West as good as this been written since ` The Virginian ' ? ''

		This story of the big-hearted , lovable , whimsical Westerner has made its author 's reputation .

		It is a great book which every Ameri - can should read .

		BIBLICAL IDEAS OF ATONEMENT : Their History and Significance By
ERNEST DEWITT BURTON	PERSON	,
JOHN MERLIN POW1S SMITH	PERSON	, and
GERALD BIRNEY	PERSON	SMITH This book sets forth the content of the biblical teachings upon the subject of Atonement , and suggests the point of view from which these conceptions may profitably be studied at the present day .

		The attitude assumed toward the records throughout is that of historical interpretation rather than of theological systematization .

		Consequently , the effort is to discover precisely what ideas of atonement are reflected by the biblical laws , institutions , and utterances .

		The authors employ the historical method throughout .

		To trace the history of an idea is to discover the forces that have co-operated to produce it and to transform it from age to age .

		The history of the idea is thus its best explanation .

		Yet as many readers will desire , not only a historical statement of what was believed and taught by the prophets and teachers of old , but also some indication of the value of those teachings for the present day , the closing section of the book -LRB- Chap , xii , xiii -RRB- is devoted to this aspect of the matter .

		BRIEFER MENTION 390 NOTES 391 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 392 THE CASE OF P OE AN D HIS CRITICS .

		I. I am late in bringing my anniversary wreath to the memory of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	.

		Perhaps while the awkward squad had reopened fire over his grave it was just as well to be silent .

		What I had to say could well wait till the spattering was over .

		Fortunate , as far as fame is concerned , is the man whose personality creates a legend .

		If there is something problematical in his character , or if various interpretations are read into his acts by others , his memory is pretty sure to be preserved .

		It does not matter that the legend is wholly or in part a lie ; or that the problem is capable of the simplest solution .

		The instinct of the baser part of mankind to besmirch greatness , the more legitimate interest of the most of us in strong contrasts of character and fate , and the generous impulses of the few who spring forward to defend those whom death has left defenseless , all conspire to create a perennial curiosity about the subject of such a legend .

		In this respect it is possible that Gris - wold 's defamation has served
Poe	PERSON	well .

		The slanderer has wrought the good where he only willed the evil .

		You can not kill a legend .

		You may riddle it with logic or explode it with facts ; but the next day it is well and strong again , doing business at the old stand and imposing on the credulity of mankind by its air of venerable authority .

		There are just two indictments brought against
Poe	PERSON	and measurably proved .

		One is that he occasionally drank too much .

		Now if we are going to rule out of the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Fame all the men who have drunk too much , the ranks of the Immortals will be sadly thinned .

		Shakespeare and
Burns	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	, and probably
Tennyson	PERSON	, will have to go .

		Considering that
Poe	PERSON	, by the quantity and quality of his work , paid the world quite all the debt he owed it , the matter does not seem to concern the world at all .

		It did con - cern the two persons whom
Poe	PERSON	loved and protected , but they do not appear to have minded his slight irregularities , and gave him a love and worship such as few men have won .

		It was no drunkard who evoked such affection .

		It was no drunkard who did
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		It was no drunkard whose mind grew keener and clearer and loftier to the last .

		For myself , I believe that
Poe	PERSON	's lapses into intemperance were probably a benefit to him .

		They relaxed his constant tension of nerve and brain .

		Certainly up to the last tragic and mysterious day of his life his nature always seemed capable of rebound to hope and purposeful activity .

		The other charge against
Poe	PERSON	is , that in the failure 368 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, of his desperate industry to provide for his family , he borrowed a few small sums which remained un - paid at his death .

		He may possibly have owed three or four hundred dollars .


Goldsmith	PERSON	owed two or three thousand pounds ; yet he is the best beloved of English writers .

		Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	died owing thirty or forty thousand pounds ; yet no one has ever impeached his honor .

		Both of these men incurred their debts for the purposes of vain ostentation and display .

		Why , then , should Poe be hounded for his pitiful borrowings , all of which would probably have been made good had he lived ?

		No one is perfect .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	says that conduct is nine-tenths of life ; but he does not define what he means by conduct .

		The keeping of one or two commandments is certainly not all there is to it .

		You may be as pure as snow , as temperate as a horse - trough , and yet have no conduct at all worth speaking of .

		Arnold himself placed
Byron	PERSON	in the forefront of modern poetry .

		He knew very well that the English poet had plenty of sins on his head , but he valued above these the courage and strength and haughty truthfulness which Byron displayed .

		Sim - ilarly
Poe	PERSON	's petty failings , which have unquestion - ably been magnified a hundred fold , are absolutely trivial as set against his chivalrous love for his wife , his courtesy , his independence which would not cringe or flatter , the high standard to which he held his work , and the generosity with which he wel - comed his rivals .

		He stood aside as no man of his rank ever did before , and ushered his great contem - poraries ,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Dickens	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, Home ,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, and others , into their proper places .

		Possibly his only serious error in contem - porary criticism was his slighting tone towards
Emerson	PERSON	.

		The two men were antipathetic , and we can no more blame them for not liking each other than we can blame Gray and Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	for their mutual misprision .

		Voltaire said that the French had not epic heads .

		Well , the Americans have not poetic heads .

		It can not be helped , and they are hardly to be blamed for it .

		They have a score of other good qualities , of which they are justly proud .

		But there is no use of their strutting about like Audrey , thanking God they are not poetical .

		The consensus of mankind has decided that to be really and truly poetical is a vastly fine thing -- that it is in fact the crown and consummation of human fate .

		Our American judg - ments are not going to alter this verdict of the ages .

		It was
Poe	PERSON	's misfortune that he , the most sensitive and visionary of the children of genius , had to be dropped into the place of practicality -- the domain of the Dollar .

		Many of my readers may have seen that experiment in physics , where a cat is placed in the glass receiver of an air-pump and then the air gradually exhausted from it .

		They have seen poor pussie run about , utter plaintive cries , try to stop the outlet of the chamber with its paw , and finally turn over to die .

		Something like that was
Poe	PERSON	's struggle in
America	LOCATION	.

		II .

		I have written so much about the various phases of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's genius , that I am rather at a loss for a novel view-point .

		Probably I had best try to answer some of the objections that have been repeatedly urged against his work , or have recently been re-stated .

		The most important of these concerns his supposed lack of matter , substance , import , profundity .

		Now it seems to me that there are two ways of being pro- found in literature .

		One is the way of gnomic utter - ance , of maxims , of words tagged with a direct moral purpose ; the other is the way of dramatic or pictorial projection of life , nature , and abstract imaginings .

		Let me go to the cognate art of paint - ing for an illustration .


Hogarth	PERSON	is a great moralist ; he paints the plain results of vice and virtue , of industry and indolence .

		His pictures are embodi - ments of the ordinary maxims of prudence and worldly wisdom .

		No doubt they are impressive ; no doubt they are useful .

		But turn to an artist like Rembrandt .

		He tells no story , -- it is impossible to make out what some of his pictures signify .

		He enforces no moral , -- for he paints indifferently base subjects and noble ones .

		Yet has any student or critic ever doubted which of these two artists had the profounder nature , -- which of the two art products is best calculated to impress , ennoble , and thrill man - kind ?

		Poe has little of the capability for gnomic wisdom which men like
Dante	PERSON	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and Goethe possessed , but he shares with them the power to dilate and move our minds by totality of effect .

		Everything he wrote , down to the merest journalistic scrap , bears the stamp of a singular and powerful nature .

		Like Rembrandt , he can not escape his shadow , can not avoid flashing forth his unearthly lights .

		Of course , as there are various grades of moral utterances , from the maxims of Tupper to the sayings of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, so there are many kinds of moving or thrilling effects , suited to different orders of minds .

		Hawk 's Eye the Detective will thrill an errand-boy more than
Poe	PERSON	's `` Murders in the Rue Morgue . ''

		But
Poe	PERSON	has been tested by time .

		Intellects of the highest order have testified to his power over them .

		And this power is profundity .

		It only remains to ask whether this profundity works for good .

		Alas , that is the question which besets all great art .

		Is it really well for us to have the sorrows , passions , vices , crimes , diseases , madnesses , and mel - ancholy broodings of mankind realized and visualized in words ?

		The best opinion of all ages has decided that it is -- that such literature is more tonic and for - tifying than visions of fools ' paradises done in rose - water .

		The poet 's intention is everything , in the use of such material .

		And in
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's case there is cer - tainly no pandering to evil -- no suggestions which would make for impurity or wrong .

		He is one of the purest-minded writers in literature .

		A second objection to
Poe	PERSON	is that he fails of the genuine sublime .

		He moves , his critics say , in a region vaulted by fogs or smoke , amid charnal - houses and among grotesque monsters , and never
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 369 has a glimpse of the supreme things of life and nature .

		Again I would distinguish two kinds of sublimity .

		One I might call the moral sublime , and as examples of it I would quote the '' God said , let there be light , and there was light '' of the Script - ures .

		I would quote that passage in the
Iliad	LOCATION	where old Priam kneels before Achilles and kisses the hand red with his son 's blood , and the mighty victor takes `` pity on his gray hair and his gray beard . ''

		I would quote the scene where Dante parts with the immortal lovers in Hell , and says : '' I wailed not , so I grew of stone within . ''

		I would quote
King Lear	PERSON	's adjuration to the storm -- `` I tax you not , ye elements , with unkindness ; I never gave you kingdom , call 'd you children . ''

		Or that other passage , where , his heart bursting in agony , he sighs out his last word , '' Pray you undo this button . ''

		Of this kind of sublime , I am free to confess there is no touch or trace in
Poe	LOCATION	.

		But it is most rare anywhere .

		Milton hardly reaches it ; nor , I think , does Goethe .

		When I say this I do not for - get the high and haughty air which
Milton	PERSON	exhibits .

		There is plenty of that in
Poe	LOCATION	, -- in fact , his whole work is suffused with it .

		Nor do I forget the wild pathos which is in
Goethe	LOCATION	.

		There is a whole world of sorrow and regret in
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's poetry .

		But the pas - sages I have quoted combine the utmost significance with the utmost simplicity .

		Words disappear in the blaze of meaning .

		The other kind of sublime , the physical sublime , is common enough .

		It is the stuff out of which most of the masterpieces of literature are fashioned .

		At the risk of being tedious , I will again give in - stances .

		There is the picture in Homer of Apollo descending from the Olympian towers , the arrows rattling in the quiver on his back as he strides along , until , seating himself against the ships , he sends his shafts down , and pestilence and death and the blaze of funeral pyres follow their flight .

		There are the red towers of Dis flickering up through the gloom , the flaked rain of fire , the rosy figures of the messenger angels which make a little dawn in Hell , -- these and a hundred other pictures are in
Dante	LOCATION	.

		There is the Spirit of the
Cape	LOCATION	which ap - pears to
Vasco de Gama	ORGANIZATION	in
Camoen	LOCATION	's poem .

		There is
Milton	LOCATION	's Lucifer rising from his fate , '' Like
Tene	PERSON	- riffe or Atlas unremoved . ''

		There is his meeting at the gates of Hell with the awful figures of Sin and Death .

		And there is picture after picture of strange invention in
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's `` Ancient Mariner . ''

		Of this kind of sublime , I say that
Poe	PERSON	is crowded f ulj .

		Turn to the '' Manuscript Found in a Bottle '' or the last pages of the '' Narrative of
Arthur Gordon Pym	PERSON	. ''

		Consider '' The Masque of the Red Death '' or `` The Fall of the
House of Usher	ORGANIZATION	, '' or that group of strange colloquies which preceeded and preluded the phantasmal imaginings of '' Eureka . ''

		In all of these ,
Poe	PERSON	works with a power of inven - tion , a vividness of realization , not unequal to the great writers I have quoted .

		I judge that it was the thinness , the poverty of their ordinary themes , which at the last drove two of our best men ,
Bryant	PERSON	and
Longfellow	LOCATION	, to translating Homer and
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		Poe tried , and not unsuccessfully , to rival the mas - ters out of his own resources .

		IH .

		Poe was in the main a tragic poet ; and his necessary preoccupation with tbings of fear and horror gives offence .

		There are many who consider him merely a superior writer of shilling shockers .

		Well , in my judgment the shilling shocker has more in common with the masterpieces of literature than the novels of nothingness which infest the world to-day .

		The Agamemnon , ^ Edipus ,
Macbeth	LOCATION	,
Lear	PERSON	,
Duchess of Malfi	ORGANIZATION	, Bride of Lammermoor ,
Wuthering Heights	LOCATION	, and
Faust	PERSON	, are all shilling shockers , done by first-rate literary hands .

		Nothing in
Poe	LOCATION	exceeds -- I doubt if anything equals -- the sheer horror out of which those works are made .

		The judgment against
Poe	PERSON	, however , is partly his own fault ; for he adopted from the German writers on aesthetics the theory that Beauty is the sole aim and end of art .

		Such a theory is destructive of the value of the most of his own work .

		Not Beauty alone , but Beauty and Power together , are the rulers of art .

		They are the wife and husband from whose union
spring	DATE	the flower and flame -- like children of the imagination .

		And they can exist separately ; they do not have to lean on each other .

		Power can combine with
Beauty	ORGANIZATION	and produce the noble and the heroic ; but it can ignore and nullify Beauty and bring forth the terrible , the grotesque , the comic , and the ugly .

		Poe 's gifts , in spite of his theory , tended in the direction of Power .

		Yet in his verse Beauty has the supremacy , though shadowed by her great and gloomy mate .

		And in a few of his prose pieces -- `` The Valley of the Many Colored Grass , '' '' The Domain of
Arnheim	PERSON	, '' '' Landor 's Cottage '' -- he embodies Beauty by itself .

		These pieces deal with landscape ; they are imaginings of
Edens	PERSON	with not enough of human presence in them to cause the serpent to enter .

		Poe 's lack of emotion troubles some people .

		He had no heart , they say .

		He had a hard fight with the world , and did not wear his heart upon his sleeve , perhaps ; and in the mass of his work , nar - rative or dramatic , a display of personal emotion would have been out of place .

		Dramatic emotion they have in plenty ; perhaps some of them are too much aquiver with nerves and sensibilities .

		But his poetry was mainly personal , -- it rose out of and was colored by the happenings of his life .

		Certainly there is no lack of personal feeling , of admiration , love , sorrow , regret , in `` To
Helen	PERSON	, '' '' The Sleeper , '' ''
Annabel Lee	PERSON	, '' '' For Annie , '' and '' The Raven . ''

		But critics presume to say that these pieces are too poetical to be real expressions of emotion , that such is not the way they would phrase love or sorrow .

		Probably not .

		But then , beauty is the necessary result of the poet 's gift .

		It was just as easy and natural for Poe to make those things rich and rare in imagery and music as it would be for an ordinary 370 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, man to put his love and sorrow into commonplace words .

		The sonnet to his wife 's mother is plain enough , yet in tenderness and sweetness it is a worthy rival of
Cowper	PERSON	's sonnet to
Mary Unwin	PERSON	, which Palgrave thought the most exquisite and pathetic in the language .

		Poe 's last letters bear out the contention that he was a being peculiarly swayed by affection and emotion .

		I confess I do not like them ; they seem to me too unrestrained , unreserved .

		Reading them is like holding a bird in one 's hand and feeling its heart throb .

		Either a man should be more of a stoic , or it is a desecration to print such things .

		But altogether the heartless
Poe	PERSON	is the most foolish bogey of his defamers .

		Poe is one of the few masters in English litera - ture who have succeeded in making prose perform the work of poetry .

		The English translators of the
Bible	LOCATION	, and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, did this before him ; but hardly anybody else .

		The professed writers of the so-called prose-poetry do not do it at all .

		The best they achieve merely makes one say , '' That is very pretty . ''

		Poe uses none of the artifices of these writers , their rhythms , alliterations , accumulations of images .

		His prose is generally as simple , lucid , straightforward , as that of Swift or
Defoe	PERSON	.

		Yet when we put down a tale of his , one note of music is ringing in our ears , one harmony of hue is gleam - ing in our eyes .

		How does he reach this result ?

		Mainly , by perfect fitness of detail , by harmony , by tone , all directed to a final effect .

		With
Dante	PERSON	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, he is one of the great tone-masters of literature .

		Leaving out `` The Raven , ''
Poe	PERSON	got his largest and most potent effects in prose ; but it is of course in verse that he reaches his highest levels of expres - sion .

		In magic and melody he is overmatched among modern English poets by
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	,
Keats	PERSON	, and
Tennyson	PERSON	alone , and by them only in quantity , not in quality .

		Such lines as '' To the glory that was
Greece	LOCATION	And the grandeur that was
Rome	LOCATION	, '' '' No more , no more , no more Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree , Or the stricken eagle soar , '' '' In what ethereal dances , By what eternal streams , '' these have the seal of ultimate perfection on them .

		And whole poems have this stamp .

		Longfellow 's '' Beleaguered City '' is a fine poem , admirable in conception and adequate in execution .

		But when we turn to
Poe	PERSON	's '' Haunted Palace '' we are in a different region of art altogether .

		Every phrase , every cadence glows or sings with some unique or wonderful light or sound .

		`` Israfel '' has less sparkle and color , but it too is divinely cadenced . ''

		Ulalume '' is not only the most Poesque of the poems , but it is the germ of a vast amount of recent poetry . ''

		Come up through the lair of the Lion , With love in her luminous eyes . ''

		or .

		or .

		Is not that the pattern which Swinburne largely followed ? ''

		The Raven '' is
Poe	PERSON	's most deliberate attempt to do a large thing .

		It has story , charac - ters , and scene , as well as emotion and atmosphere , and deserves its place in popular esteem .

		Unfor - tunately , there is not very much of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's poetry , -- but then there is not much of Catullus ,
Collins	PERSON	, Gray ,
Coleridge	PERSON	at his best .

		Left to his verse alone , I should rank
Poe	PERSON	somewhere amid this group -- a fascinating master of words , melody , and emotional utterance , but hardly a world-power .

		In prose , how - ever , he is the supreme artist of the short story ; and the man who rules absolutely one of the forms of lit - erature has his place with the kings .

		One argument more .

		It is patent , though attempts are made to deny it , that
Poe	PERSON	's fame is more wide - spread that than of any writer of English since
Byron	PERSON	.

		I think we may take it for granted that
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	of European Opinion knows some - thing .


Europe	LOCATION	has plenty of great poets and prose writers of its own ; and if it adopts and imitates
Poe	PERSON	, as it does not adopt or imitate any other recent English or American writer , it must be because he has an intense and universal appeal which these others lack .

		Why , I would ask , if
Poe	ORGANIZATION	is wanting in profundity , if his sole merit is form , why is he operative at such great distances and in other lan - guages ?

		Form is practically untranslatable .

		As is the case with the Italian poet
Leopardi	PERSON	, it is his superior weight of meaning , the significance of his whole character and thought , which enables him to overrun the boundaries of his own country and speech .

		Tennyson , like that other Italian poet
Carducci	PERSON	, is shut up at home .

		The wheel has come full-circle .

		The strange mis - shapen stone rejected by the builders has become the top of the temple .

		For myself , I have never doubted
Poe	PERSON	's supremacy in American literature .

		When I was a boy of seventeen or eighteen I wrote an elegy on him , in which , while accepting somewhat of the current estimate of his character , I placed his work where I do now .

		To-day I have come to believe that his nature was essentially as fine as his art .

		I think him a fit companion for the solemn , sweet , and wrath - ful
Dante	PERSON	, whom his own city would have burned if it could have laid hands on him .

		I think him a worthy comrade for
Spain	LOCATION	's bravest , truest son ,
Miguel Cervantes	PERSON	, who was mocked , starved , im - prisoned by his countrymen during his lifetime , and more or less hated by them for a century after his death .

		Wherever I turn my gaze upon
Poe	PERSON	, whether in his early and utter destitution in
Baltimore	LOCATION	, in hi6 period of comparative peace and prosperity in
Phil	LOCATION	- adelphia , or in those days of desolation when he paced the fir-shadowed slopes of the
Bronx	LOCATION	or the starlit footpath of the
Harlem	LOCATION	bridge , I can see nothing but an honest , serious , noble gentleman , a poet haunted by higher and more vivid visions than any of his compeers , and capable of expressing them in terms of a more splendid art .

		THE DIAL 371 CASUAL COMMENT . ''

		Shaw as a Social Symptom '' is the alluring caption under which Dr.
Stanton Coit	PERSON	, lecturer for the
West London Ethical Culture Society	ORGANIZATION	, has been telling
America	LOCATION	about his witty , talented , and ver - satile English friend .

		Mr.
Coit	PERSON	admits a doubt about
America	LOCATION	's attitude toward
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	; and he displays some confusion of thought in his own attitude toward
America	LOCATION	.

		This comes out when , for exam - ple , he characterizes Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	as not only symptomatic of to-day , like
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, but also symbolic of all
America	LOCATION	.

		But when Dr.
Coit	PERSON	comes to the point of explaining what he thinks about
Shaw	PERSON	and wants
America	LOCATION	to understand about him , he is admirably clear , definite , and entertaining .

		He considers
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's wit the legitimate successor to
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's ; his prose style comparable only to Shake - speare 's ,
Bacon	PERSON	's ,
Milton	PERSON	's , and
Jeremy Taylor	PERSON	's ; and his ideas '' symptomatic of his own time -- and very little more . ''

		That is ,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	is interesting in being perfectly typical of his age ; but his horizon is very limited .

		He is over-occupied with the
Phil	PERSON	- istinism of the English '' middle class '' ; he has known too much of the seamy side of life ; is too prone to regard his own experience as universal , and the world , accordingly , as stupid , silly , small - souled , mean-spirited , blind to ideas , indifferent to decency .

		Dr.
Coit	PERSON	finds the whole excuse for this limited point of view in
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's lack of educational advantages , and in his long and desperate struggle , not for recognition only , but for a bare livelihood .

		We should suspect that it is also a temperamental limitation , often associated with a keen wit .

		Dr.
Coit	PERSON	naturally refuses to consider
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	as either a poseur or a self-advertiser .

		Very much in earnest himself , he is assured that his friend and co-worker is equally in earnest : and his argument carries con - viction .

		In fairness to Dr.
Coit	PERSON	, it should be said that he has delivered a number of lectures on vari - ous phases of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's genius , besides the one which , in inclusive fashion , sums up his contribution to the thought of the day .

		And , as Dr.
Coit	PERSON	remarked ,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	is soon coming to
America	LOCATION	himself , and there ■ will then be an excellent opportunity to compare him with Dr.
Coit	PERSON	's impression , Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's biography , and the famous '' Prefaces . ''

		A MONUMENT OF INDUSTRY AND SCHOLARSHIP is a term that may be applied in no grudging way to the brand-new ''
Webster	PERSON	's International Dictionary '' with which
Messrs. G. & C Merriam	ORGANIZATION	have crowned the long historic line of
Webster	PERSON	's Dictionaries issued by that no less historic house .

		In no previ - ous issue , however , has there been such an advance , such a remaking and remodelling and reconstruc - tion of the work , as is shown in the present colossal volume .

		It is , first of alL ' ; new from cover to cover '' ; it is essentially '' a new dictionary of the English language . ''

		Its immediate predecessor , the '' International '' of twenty years ago , was a big dictionary , but compared with this one it seems but a juvenile to an adult .

		The statement that the number of words included is more than doubled sounds incredible , but it is true ; the earlier work had 175,000 title-words , this one has over 400,000 .

		All the earlier entries have been rigidly revised , to harmonize with the advance of scholarship and the development of the science of lexicography .

		The encyclopaedic character of the work has been ex - tended to correspond with the marvellous extension of the boundaries of knowledge , so that the work is more than ever a '' storehouse of information . ''

		New words are freely introduced , as are also many terms which , originating in slang , have passed into common use .

		The principle laid down is that a dictionary is not a literary dictator , but a chronicler of existing usage : obviously a sound position , one of the results of which is that fantastic spellings such as are proposed by '' Simplified Spelling '' boards have no place in this vocabulary .

		Still more significant of conservative tendencies in ortho - graphy is the restoration of such forms as honour , labour , endeavour , and even favour , -- a rather extreme reaction , we should say , from the almost fanatical anti-English proclivities of
Noah Webster	PERSON	, which have been the source of so much of the con - fusion that has prevailed in our American spelling .

		As a piece of book-making , the work is one of the greatest achievements of American typography .

		The type is open-faced and legible , the print sharp and clear ; the illustrations -- six thousand in number -- are well executed and authentic .

		A novel feature of the book is the division of each page into two distinct portions -- the lower part , about a fifth of the page , being used for the less important words , in smaller type , thus effecting a material saving of space ; while the upper four-fifths , containing the more im - portant terms , is in the larger and more easily con - sulted print .

		These are but a few of the many excellent features of a work to which the old-time adjuration `` Get the Best '' must potently apply .

		• • • The diversions of the mathematical mind might very excusably be of a frivolous sort , to counterbalance the severe application required of him who essays to enlarge the world 's knowledge of the properties of numbers .

		And in noteworthy instances this frivolity is found to prevail .

		The late
Augustus de Morgan	PERSON	, whose mathematical works are still authoritative , and whose '' Budget of Para - doxes '' will long appeal to the curious reader , is said to have had an insatiable appetite for novels , so that he would sit up half the night over a genuine '' thriller . ''

		It is his son , Mr.
William de Morgan	PERSON	, who has , since passing his sixty-sixth birthday , been entertaining the English-speaking world with an annual essay in fiction -- not being , it is true , a math - ematician before that , but presumably having some slight tincture of mathematics in his blood , since , besides his father , his maternal grandfather ,
William Frend	PERSON	, and his great-great-grandfather ,
James Dod	ORGANIZATION	- son -LRB- mathematical master at
Christ 's Hospital	ORGANIZATION	and 372 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, author of `` The Anti-Logarithmic Canon '' -RRB- , were strong in this branch of learning .

		Our well-known American novelist ,
Arthur Sherburne Hardy	PERSON	, author of '' Passe Rose ' '' and other good stories , was a col - lege teacher of mathematics ; and the ever-delightful romancer for children ,
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	, was likewise a mathematical professor and the author of severely abstruse mathematical works .

		But the man of science need not take shame to himself for reading or writing good and wholesome tales .

		Benjamin
Jowett	PERSON	, the famous master of
Balliol	LOCATION	, once wrote in a letter to the daughter of
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	: '' There are few ways in which people can be better employed than in reading a good novel . ''

		The vocabulary of aerial navigation is rapidly growing , but the demand for new terms is outstripping the supply .

		Awkward compounds and hideous hybrids are tentatively suggested and meet with a degree of favor ; but obviously apt and con - veniently short new words for all these new things are conspicuously wanting .

		The poetry and charm of this new mode of motion will be better preserved by the adoption of simple untechnical terms for common use , than by going further afield and im - porting into the language a strictly scientific nomen - clature of Greek derivation .

		Why should not '' airship '' prove as acceptable and useful as `` steam - ship '' ?

		The sky-craft of the future will , with little doubt , be aeroplanes , or heavier-than-air machines , and for the less-used gas-bags of our grandfathers the word '' balloon '' will continue to be the proper designation , leaving `` airship '' to denote the later models of cloud-chasers .

		Airships may be more particularly described as of the monoplane , biplane , or triplane type , just as we speak of single-screw , twin-screw , and triple-screw steamships .

		`` Aero - drome '' may be preferred to '' airship racecourse , '' and '' aerodock '' to '' airship shed '' ; but in general the more readily intelligible and less technical terms are to be preferred .

		Already our vocabulary is growing fast enough without undue multiplication of polysyllabic formations put together in the labo - ratory or the library .

		• • • An octogenarian college freshman affords a striking example of the perennially fresh appeal of literature and learning .

		Mrs.
A. D. Winship	PERSON	, aged seventy-nine , after attending the
summer	DATE	school of the
Ohio State University	ORGANIZATION	, is reported to have en - tered upon the regular college curriculum , and to have planned a course of study that should keep her pleasantly occupied until she is ninety .

		Pre - sumably she has not entered the engineering depart - ment , or the school of agriculture , or chosen exclus - ively sciences and laboratory work ; it must then have been the undying delights of book-learning that attracted her . ''

		Learning is ever in the freshness of its youth , even for the old , '' says JEschylus in the `` Agamemnon . ''

		A maxim of Publius Syrus affirms that `` It is better to learn late than never '' ; perhaps it is , in some respects , better to learn late than early -- more enjoyable to the mature learner than to the foolish and impatient youngster .

		Many a gray - haired possessor of a college diploma might profitably and with pleasure go back to his Latin , Greek , and Mathematics , with judicious selection from modern additions to this bill of fare , and spend another quadrennium in academic seclusion , taking a fresh parchment -LRB- if he could pass the examina - tions -RRB- at the end .

		Happy , thrice and four times happy Mrs.
Winship	PERSON	, who like
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Portia is '' happy in this , she is not yet so old but she may learn . ''

		... The literary likings of book-thieves are not necessarily indicated by the titles of the books they steal .

		A purloiner of Audubon 's '' Birds of Amer - ica '' -- supposing that massive and costly work could be unostentatiously abstracted from some pub - lic or private library -- need not be an enthusiastic ornithologist ; nor would the misappropriator of a
Mazarine Bible	PERSON	be likely to be a truly religious per - son .

		The
St. Joseph	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Mo.	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library reports some rather curious stealings among its last year 's book-thefts .

		Four were religious books , -- Proud - foot 's `` Child 's Christ Tales , ''
Peabody	ORGANIZATION	's '' Mornings in the
College Chapel	ORGANIZATION	, ''
Keedy	PERSON	's `` Teacher 's Book of Old Testament Heroes , '' and
Drummond	PERSON	's '' Ad - dresses . ''

		Useful arts were unceremoniously drawn upon to the extent of twenty-two volumes ; but the lighter sort of fiction proved to be the favorite department with these light-fingered patrons of lit - erature , fifty-eight novels being removed without troubling the perhaps already overworked young person at the delivery desk .

		May it not be that our American love of short-cuts and hatred of red-tape are accountable for many of these unrecorded bor - rowings , and that many , or perhaps most , of the missing volumes will return as silently as they stole away ?


Oliver Otis Howard	PERSON	, soldier , author , and educator , whose memorable Autobiography ap - peared two years ago -LRB- reviewed at length in The Dial of
Oct. 16 , 1907	DATE	-RRB- , died suddenly at his home in
Burlington	LOCATION	,
Vermont	LOCATION	, on the 26th of
October	DATE	. ''

		The American Havelock '' and '' the Christian soldier '' were the well-deserved titles of honor be - stowed upon him by his comrades in the army .

		His most gallant and most effective service to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	cause was rendered at the battle of
Gettys	LOCATION	- burg , where his resolute holding of an important position in the face of tremendous odds probably saved the day -- if , indeed , any one act of bravery and of tactical wisdom can be said to have decided the issue on that occasion .

		As founder and presi - dent of
Lincoln Memorial University	ORGANIZATION	, as a zealous promoter of negro education , as author of one of the best of our military autobiographies , as occasional contributor to the magazines , and as advocate of various charitable causes -LRB- educational , missionary , and in behalf of temperance -RRB- ,
General Howard	ORGANIZATION	has made his influence felt in his day and generation , and he will not soon be forgotten .


1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 373 The evolution of a new word , or of a new meaning of an old word , or the gradual passage of a slang term from bad company into polite society , or of an irreproachable word from refined circles into base fellowship , is always interesting to those who believe that the elements of language are as much alive as the elements of the landscape .

		The attention of language-lovers and language-students has of late been called to a curious usage of the word '' near , '' a term that already has proved adaptable to divers requirements .

		A `` near-winner , '' in the vocabulary of the day , of course needs no explanation ; nor does u near-silk goods '' nor a '' near-gold ring . ''

		A journal with some pretensions to correctness in its English recently reported the breaking up of a meeting in a '' near-riot . ''

		An aspiring versifier might be called -LRB- by a cruel critic -RRB- a `` near-poet , '' and a ward politi - cian a '' near-statesman . ''

		A miss is as good as a mile , and no one would feel unduly puffed up by this ascription of near-greatness .

		Taken all in all , the little word `` near , '' in its varied uses and mean - ings as adjective , adverb , verb , and near-preposition , is an interesting and fruitful study .

		A popular misconception relating to the mone - tary rewards of literary endeavor is well illustrated by an anecdote now passing current about Dr.
Cook	PERSON	, the Arctic explorer .

		Report has it that having been cabled to by a prominent publisher to name his price for book and serial rights in the story of his Polar journey , Dr.
Cook	PERSON	cabled back that he wanted 8500,000 .

		If the story is true , it shows that the explorer shared the popular superstition ; if not , it attests the subtle psychological understanding of the person who invented it .

		The average reader would accept the story without question and without considering the doctor 's demand at all exorbitant .

		How easy to write a book , and what a lot of money you can get for it !

		Thus pleasantly vague is the average man 's snap-shot judgment of authorship .

		By the same course of reasoning another fallacy is arrived at : because many successful authors have tried and failed at law , medicine , or business , the man who has not made a success of his profession may embark hopefully on a literary career .

		Liter - ature is sometimes lucrative ; but as a get-rich-quick scheme , or last resource in misfortune , it is scarcely to be recommended .

		FROM LITERARY
LONDON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of The Dial . -RRB-

		Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	has issued a pamphlet , originally a lecture , entitled '' Why I Wrote ` The White Pro- phet , ' '' -- an attempt on his part , of course , to give an additional vogue to his novel of that name , which , as I have already explained , has fallen exceedingly flat in this country .

		The booksellers have been dis - posed to attribute its comparative failure to the fact that Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	issued it in two volumes , the public having become accustomed of late years to novels in one volume only .

		I think , however , there are other reasons for this failure , one of them being that the novel had had a very wide circulation in the pages of our most successful monthly , '' The Strand Magazine '' ; and perhaps another reason is that a large part of the novel-reading public has got some - what tired of Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	's infinite propensity for booming himself .

		He is not likely to gain much by his pamphlet explaining why he wrote '' The White Prophet . ''

		K people will not read the book they are not likely to be interested in knowing why its author wrote it ; and Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's proposition that booksellers should place this pamphlet in their shops , and push it as much as possible , is not likely to mend matters .

		Meanwhile Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	has secured the alliance of the man in all
England	LOCATION	the most remote from his peculiar talent -- Mr.
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	has written a preface to '' The White Prophet , '' terse , eloquent , and to the point .

		While one of Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's weaknesses is his redun - dancy of words , his singular faculty for what may be termed '' gush , '' Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's writings are char - acterized by a fine directness of style which one might have thought would have led him to find '' The White Prophet '' an absolute offence .

		Why , then , is he so enthusiastic ?

		The reason is clear .

		Although Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	is himself an artist , he has no love of art for art 's sake .

		Shelley appeals to him , not by his divine poetic gift , but by his passion for reform .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	is not worried in the least by Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	's lack of artistry , his empty rhetoric , his ver - bosity ; all he sees is a man who wants to reform the present system of ruling
Egypt	LOCATION	, and is indignant at certain actions of the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	in connection with that rule .

		This attitude of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, however , is not an uncommon one with smaller minds than his .

		For example , a somewhat colorless review of Mt.
Caine	PERSON	's novel appeared in '' The Nation , '' a
London	LOCATION	journal of advanced democratic sympathies .

		The writer of the review took occasion to throw in a word or two of condemnation of Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's novel as a novel , whereupon a correspondent wrote to denounce the editor for receiving too coldly so strong a manifesto on behalf of Egyptian nationalism .

		I contend that this writer , in common with Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, is thoroughly wrong-headed ; that a reviewer has to ask himself solely whether a novel is a good piece of literature , not whether it is a good tract .

		The only thing that can justify a tract being circulated as literature is success .

		If a million copies of Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	's tract on behalf of Egyptian nationalism had been sold , few would have dared to deny that it was literature .

		Mr.
Caine	PERSON	, by the way , declares that he '' has touched thousands of hearts . ''

		I am reminded of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, to whom someone said , '' Your business , poet , is to touch the feeling heart . ''

		`` Ah , those feeling hearts ! ''

		Goethe replied ; '' any blockhead can touch them ! ''

		Considerable interest has been excited in the sale to Mr.
Pierpont Morgan	PERSON	, for four thousand dollars , of three of Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	's manuscripts -- 374 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1G	DATE	, ''
Diana	PERSON	of the Crossways , '' ''
Lord Ormont	PERSON	and his Aminta , '' and '' The Amazing Marriage . ''

		This certainly represents the high-water mark of material value set upon manuscripts of recent English writers .

		Hitherto
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	and Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	have been first favorites , at least in this country and among recent prose writers .

		Yet how disproportionate seems the price paid by Mr.
Mor	PERSON	- gan , when one considers the emoluments of authors of the best quality .

		Many of Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's books must have been sold outright , in his earlier years , for much less money .

		Charlotte Bronte '' sold ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	'' outright for twenty-five hundred dollars in even less happy days for the successful writer ; and her publishers have been offered more than that amount for the original manuscript .

		Mr.
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	is one of the clever young men of to-day in
London	LOCATION	.

		He is also a great friend of Mr.
Gilbert Chesterton	PERSON	.

		The two may frequently be seen together , sometimes in a hansom cab , where the portly figure of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	almost crushes out of sight the more modest form of his companion .

		It is generally believed that Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	was the primary influence in carrying
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	over to the
Roman Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	comes of a French family , although his mother was English .

		His sister , Mrs.
Belloc Lownes	PERSON	, has written novels and miscellaneous works .

		She bears a startling resemblance to the grandmother , a
Madame Belloc	ORGANIZATION	, whose portrait may be seen in the Galleries of the
Louvre	LOCATION	.


Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	himself is a writer of marked talent , especially where French history is concerned .

		His books on
Robespierre	LOCATION	and Dauton have just been followed by one on
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	.

		The story of that pathetic Queen has been told many times and by many pens , but never more brilliantly than in this volume .

		I write , however , of Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	to-day , only to disagree with him .

		He has been giving an address on literature , and in it he suggested that the novel was doomed .

		It had had its hundred and fifty years run , and the time was fast coming when we should hear no more of it .

		I do not think novel-lovers need be alarmed at the prospect .

		I can not foresee the time when people will not read novels .

		There will be all kinds of developments in the novel , but in one form or another it will doubtless remain with us .

		Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	is fond of history , and perhaps he does not care for works of imagination ; but while people are born with imagination it will find expression through the medium of poetry or through the medium of fiction .

		At present it seems that the public will not read poetry ; I doubt very much if we shall ever again renew the experience which gave colossal sales in succession to
Walter Scott	PERSON	, to
Lord Byron	PERSON	, and to
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		A love of poetry may come again , but we are certain also to have a love of prose fiction .

		This last branch of art , in - deed , shows no decay , although Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	appar - ently thinks it does .

		Every year produces a few really good novels which I imagine will be read for many years to come .


Clement K. Shorter	PERSON	.

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		POE , STEVENSON , AND
BERANGER	PERSON	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		In his essay '' On the Enjoyment of Unpleasant Places , ''
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	tells us that while sojourning at some time in his youth on a certain bare and rock-bound coast in the
North	LOCATION	country , he was for some inexplicable reason continually haunted by two lines from Be ` ranger : '' Mon cceur est un luth suspendu ; Sitot qu'on le touche , il r ^ sonne . ''

		Professor
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	, in commenting on these lines in his excellent little volume of
Stevenson	ORGANIZATION	's Essays , makes the suggestion that
Stevenson	PERSON	probably found the lines '' not in the original , but in reading the tales of
Poe	PERSON	. ''

		For , as he points out , the same lines are used at the beginning of '' The Fall of the
House of Usher	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Professor Phelps , however , goes on to say that in the first of these lines as quoted by Poe '' the third and not the first person is used , '' -- that is , the line reads , '' Son cceur est un luth suspendu . ''

		In this he is correct ; but he is in error when he implies that
Stev	PERSON	- enson tampered with his text .

		For by referring to the poem of Be ` ranger 's in which the lines occur -- his '' Le Ref us , '' of which Professor Phelps makes no mention -- it will be seen that the two lines occur there just as
Stevenson	ORGANIZATION	quoted them , which pretty well establishes that
Stevenson	PERSON	got them , not from
Poe	PERSON	, who , as is well known , was often inaccurate in his quotations , but from Be ` ranger himself .

		But the lines are interesting in another connection .

		The keynote of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's magic lyric of the angel Israfel is struck in the second line of that poem , '' Whose heartstrings are a lute , '' words that were ultimately incorporated also in the motto of the poem and with the rest erroneously accredited to the
Koran	LOCATION	.

		Now , comparison of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's line with the first of the lines from Be ` ranger brings out a striking resemblance between the two .

		Indeed ,
Poe	PERSON	's line '' Whose heartstrings are a lute , '' is not a bad translation of Be ` ranger 's line as
Poe	PERSON	subsequently `` misquoted it , `` Son cceur est uu luth sus - pendu . ''

		The resemblance has been noticed by at least two of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's editors , Professor
James A. Harrison	PERSON	in his life of Poe -LRB- p. 156 -RRB- , and Professor
A. G. Newcomer	PERSON	in his book entitled '' Poe : Poems and Tales '' -LRB- p. 300 -RRB- .

		But neither of these gentlemen has ventured to assert that there is any actual connection between the two .

		Nevertheless I make bold to suggest that
Poe	PERSON	's line -- and with it the ground-idea of '' Israfel '' -- was ulti - mately derived from Be ` ranger 's line .

		The fact that
Poe	PERSON	used Be ` ranger 's lines as the motto of his '' House of Usher , '' first published nearly ten years after '' Isra - fel '' appeared , can hardly be held to militate against this view .

		The only difficulty in the way -- and it is possibly an insuperable one -- is that of dates .

		Poe first published '' Israfel '' in
1831	DATE	, in the volume of poems brought out soon after his dismissal from West Point .

		Be ` ranger 's lines were also published in
1831	DATE	, if those of his editors who mention any date are to be relied on ; besides , the poem in which they ap - peared has to do with an incident that occurred late in
1830	DATE	or early in
1831	DATE	: Be ` ranger 's refusal of a pension offered to him by his friend , General Se ` bastiani ,
Min	LOCATION	- ister of Foreign Affairs .

		Poe 's
1831	DATE	volume of poems appeared , as 1 have said , soon after his dismissal from
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 375 West Point -- therefore after
March 6 , 1831	DATE	: perhaps very soon after , perhaps -LRB- as
Ingram	ORGANIZATION	holds -RRB- several months after .

		My theory is that '' Le Refus '' was first published in
January , 1831	DATE	, in some
Paris	LOCATION	newspaper -- perhaps Le Figaro -- in which during the month of
January	DATE	, according to the bibliographer of Be ` ranger ,
M. Jules Brivois	PERSON	, the Hues `` A mes amis devenus ministres '' -LRB- which deal with a closely related subject -RCB- were first published ; and that
Poe	PERSON	became acquainted with it toward the end of that month , or in the follow - ing month , in the bbrary of the
Military Academy	ORGANIZATION	or through some fellow cadet who subscribed for the
Paris	LOCATION	newspapers , and that he wrote his '' Israfel '' under the inspiration it afforded .

		That the West Point cadets were interested in current happenings in
France	LOCATION	in
1830	DATE	and
1831	DATE	is established by a letter from them to Gen - eral
Lafayette	LOCATION	congratulating him on the victory of
July , 1830	DATE	, which was published in Le Monileur Uni - versel for
January 8 , 1831	DATE	; and that
Poe	PERSON	shared in this interest in happenings on the continent is shown by a letter of his , of
March 10	DATE	, 183 V to General
Thayer	PERSON	, Superintendent of the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	, in which he expresses an eagerness to proceed to Pans in the hope of securing through
Lafayette	LOCATION	, who had been a friend of his pater - nal grandfather 's , an appointment in the Polish army .

		Further examination of the
Paris	LOCATION	papers of the time , only a few of which have been accessible to me , would perhaps suffice to clear up the question of dates here .

		The question of conscious indebtedness is , in the nature of the case , one that we can hardly hope to settle with any absoluteness .

Horace Greeley	PERSON	would have called '' mighty interesting read - ing , '' -- even if one can not apply to it another phrase of that plainspoken journalist and delare that it is '' signifi - cant of much . ''

		Yet it has a significance of its own , which I beg your permission to point out .

		Most of the strenuous assailants of simplified spelling have seen fit wisely to shroud themselves in anonymity ; and only three men , whose studies entitle them to be heard on a linguistic question , have ventured to warrant their opinions with their signatures .

		They are , Presi - dent Benjamin
Ide Wheeler	PERSON	of the
University of Cali	ORGANIZATION	- fornia , Professor
Harry Thurston Peck	PERSON	of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, and Professor
Paul Shorey	PERSON	of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		And what is significant is that they are all three of them specialists in the dead languages .

		No scholar in any one of the living languages has seen fit to join himself to these opponents of orthographic ameli - oration .

		Indeed , the
Modern Language Association of America	ORGANIZATION	has formally approved of the recommendations of the
Simplified Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		And a large majority of the professors of English in our universities are heartily in sympathy with the movement to give our noble language a simpler spelling .

		Although Professor
Shorey	PERSON	seems to be willing to sneer at Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's scholarship , I feel sure that he would be unwilling to misrepresent Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's statements .

		Yet it is a misrepresentation for Professor
Shorey	PERSON	to suggest that Professor
Louns	PERSON	- bury has confest defeat .

		Apparently Professor
Shorey	PERSON	overlookt those pages in which Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	exprest his unexpected satisfaction with the progress made by the simplified spelling movement .


Brander Matthews	PERSON	.


Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	,
November 3 , 1909	DATE	.

		-LSB- We are glad to print Professor
Matthews	PERSON	's letter , if for nothing else than its interesting disclosure that open and authentic opposition to simplified spelling in this country is limited to three dauntless scholastics -- one of them on the
Atlantic Seaboard	LOCATION	, one in the
Middle West	LOCATION	, and one on the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	: cer - tainly large fields for them to cover .

		Professor
Matthews	PERSON	is , however , possibly mistaken in infer - ring , as he seemingly does , that there are no more of them ; mistaken also , we can not help thinking , in believing that '' a large majority of the professors of English in our universities are heartily in sympathy with the movement to give our noble language a simpler spelling '' -- if by this ample phrase he means that they are heartily in sympathy with the work and purposes of the
Simplified Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		Or it may be that he is not so much mistaken as be - wildered .

		The number of educated persons who do not accept Simplified Spelling is hardly to be judged by the number of those who actively and publicly oppose it .

		People may dissent from any special cult -- Spiritism , Faith Healing , Single Tax -- without forming anti societies and making opposition to these cults one of the serious affairs of life .

		There are as yet no signs of the formation of societies endowed and equipped for advocating Complex Spelling , the absence of which seems to fill our enthusiastic Sim - plifiers with confidence that they possess the field .

		It is conceivable that a man may be in hearty sym - pathy with `` orthographic amelioration , '' to use Professor
Matthews	PERSON	's ingratiating phrase , and yet shudder at the prospect of the rude linguistic sur - gery by which the short-cut reformers would bring it about .

		When
Lowell	PERSON	said that all good people were bound to be socialists in his meaning of the term , he meant that they were bound to desire social amelioration , not that they must embrace a specific radical programme and propaganda .

		That the mass of educated people do not actively oppose Spelling Reform by no means proves that they favor it , -- perhaps they have not taken the matter seriously ; in
Pater	LOCATION	's phrase , it has not greatly impressed them .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Diai * -RRB- Will you permit me to express my cordial agreement with Professor
Shorey	PERSON	's views on the question of English spelling , as set forth in your issue of
November 1	DATE	.

		Any attempt to bring about changes more rapidly than they come by the unconscious process of linguistic evolution can only be a source of anarchy .

		I think our leading publishing houses have done a great service in standing out against the movement at a time when temporary excitement might easily have persuaded them that the tide was going that w-iy .

Nov. 16	DATE	, t Ifcto gooks .

		Reminiscences of a Vice-President .

		* Most readers of Vice-President
Stevenson	PERSON	's volume will wish , we imagine , that he had held himself more strictly to his main title and given more fully delineated pictures of the characters of local or national interest with whom his long legal and political career has brought him into contact .

		In his constant deviations from this path he covers much territory already traversed by various other writers fairly well known to the general reader ; and the result is an inevi - table slackening of interest .

		The story of the Mormons in
Illinois	LOCATION	, the Burr-Hamilton and other early American duels , the foundation of the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Institution , the preaching of
Peter Cartwright	PERSON	, the Lincoln-Douglas debate , and a few other items which might be men - tioned , are somewhat tiresome subjects unless the writer has wholly new material to produce , through personal relation to the events in question or through the discovery of hitherto unknown sources .

		During the author 's early years of profes - sional life , the practice of the law in the less popidous districts of
Illinois	LOCATION	still retained some of the peculiar backwoods flavor which has added so much interest to the story of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's career .

		The range over which a lawyer might be asked to extend his activities is well illus - trated by a request which Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	, then twenty-two years of age , received from a client in a divorce case .

		The opposite side had secured a continuance to the next term of court , and Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's client , the plaintiff , seemed deeply disturbed .

		He asked for a confidential interview , during which he stated that he had suddenly married the defendant during a fit of anger toward an excellent young lady whom he had really loved , and for whom his old love had returned in full force when it was too late .

		He was duly cautioned against the impropriety of allowing anything of this to become known , but was assured that he would regain his freedom at the next term of court and could then take up the broken thread again if he so desired .

		But here came the further dismal revelation that another had entered the field , and unless he could be held in check all might be lost before the divorce was granted .

Stevenson	PERSON	* Something of Men I Have Known .

General Nature	ORGANIZATION	-- Political , Historical , and Retro - spective .

		assured him that all this was beyond his prov - ince ; when the client suddenly hitched his chair up close and said : '' You are a good-looking young fellow , and rather a glib talker , and I '11 give you this hundred dollars if you 'll cut that fellow out until I get my divorce . ''

		An indignant refusal brought the rejoinder , '' Why , I thought a lawyer would do anything for money . ''

		Among miscellaneous anecdotes of legal prac - tice , Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	relates the retort of
Curran	PERSON	to a judge who is said to have uttered the insult - ing taunt , '' I could put you in my pocket , sir . '' ''

		If you did , '' was
Curran	PERSON	's reply , '' you would have more law in your pocket than you ever had in your head ! ''

		The author need not have gone abroad , for the same kind of retort in still more striking form is related of
Alexander H. Stephens	PERSON	in his contest for a seat in the
House of Repre	ORGANIZATION	- sentatives , in
1843	DATE	. ''

		I could swallow him whole and never know the difference ! '' '

		con - temptuously said Judge
Walter T. Colquitt	PERSON	, who had been called to the stump to check the little Georgian 's too effective campaign . ''

		Yes , and if you did , '' was the instantaneous retort , '' there would be more brains in your belly than ever will be in your head . ''

		We leave it to the literary source-monger to determine whether
Stephens	PERSON	got his idea out of the simple facts of the situation , or from
Curran	PERSON	, -- or , as has been suggested , from '' Flibbertigibbet '' in
Kenil	LOCATION	- worth : '' Why , thou little Hop-the-gutter , thou art as sharp as vinegar this afternoon !

		But tell me , how didst thou come off with yonder jolter - headed giant whom I left thee with ?

		I was afraid he would have stripped thy clothes and so swallowed thee , as men peel and eat a roasted chestnut . '' ''

		Had he done so , '' was the retort , '' he would have had more brains in his guts than ever he had in his noddle . ''

		As a judge of men , Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	is over - charitable .

		There is scarcely a word of serious personal criticism of any contemporary , and we find very kindly mention of some whose stand - ing at the bar of public opinion has been seri - ously shaken .

		He puts himself down unreserv - edly in favor of
William J. Bryan	PERSON	as the great - est living orator and the most gifted man he has ever known .

		If it be a prerequisite of really great oratory to carry conviction , one might readily challenge this estimate .

		It is almost ex - clusively by his oratory that
Bryan	PERSON	is known to his fellow countrymen , and in three great tests they have overwhelmingly rejected his advice .

		One can but recall the emphatic assertion of Quintilian , '' No one pleads worse than the orator
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 377 who himself pleases while his case displeases .

		For the source of the pleasure is necessarily aside from the case . ''

		If '' the greatest living orator '' is one who so signally lacks the power to con - vince , then Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	has indeed done well to head his chapter '' The Lost Art of Oratory . ''

		His tribute to
Cleveland	LOCATION	, with whom he was associated first as Assistant Postmaster-General and later as Vice President , is strong and sin - cere . ' '

		No incumbent of the Presidency was ever less of a time-server than
Cleveland	LOCATION	.

		Expediency was a word scarcely known to his vocabulary .

		Recognizing alike the dignity and responsibility of the great office , he was in the highest degree self-reliant .

		None the less he at all times availed himself of the wise counsel of his official advisers .

		In matters falling within their especial province , their determination was , except in rare instances , conclusive .

		In no sense was his mind closed against the timely counsel of his friends .

		Far from being opinionated , in the offensive sense of the word , the ultimate determination , however , was after having taken counsel of himself . ''

		As a guest at his home for some days during the campaign of
1892	DATE	, the author mentions espe - cially his quality as a tender and considerate husband , a kind and affectionate father . ''

		It has never been my good fortune to cross the threshold of a more delightful home . ''

		And yet men with good memories can recall the fact that twenty-one years ago political malice stooped low enough to try to turn a presidential election by circulating all over the country , through underground channels , the assertion that Presi - dent
Cleveland	LOCATION	was making his home wretched by drunkenness and personal cruelty !

		It would be easy to fill several pages of The Dial with the humorous incidents which the author has collected for his readers ; but we shall close with a story concerning
Thaddeus Stevens	PERSON	, told by Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	on the authority of
James G. Blaine	PERSON	, who related it to him one day when passing a certain house on Pennsyl - vania Avenue , known as a high-toned gambling establishment .

		Blaine was passing the house during his first term in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, when
Stevens	PERSON	emerged from its doors and greeted him .

		Just then a negro preacher stepped up and asked Mr.
Stevens	PERSON	for a contribution toward a new church .

		Taking a roll of money from his vest pocket , he handed a fifty-dollar bill to the preacher , and turning to Mr.
Blaine	PERSON	solemnly observed , '' God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform ! ''


W. H. Johnson	PERSON	.

		The Religioxs and Morals of the World .

		* Dr.
Hastings	PERSON	has won well merited fame as a dictionary maker .

		He plans wisely , marshals his forces well , holds himself modestly in the background , preserves a juste milieu , and pleases his public .

		His '' Dictionary of the Bible '' -LRB- 1898-1904 -RRB- appealed very strongly to a large class of modern theologians .

		It was learned , lucid , cautiously critical , and moder - ately conservative .

		While its contributors occu - pied very much the same position on Old Testament subjects as the scholars who wrote for Professor
Cheyne	PERSON	's `` Encyclopaedia Biblica , '' they did not carry the same methods of critical investigation quite as unhesitatingly and regard - less of results into the New Testament .

		This corresponded in temper and attitude with the prevailing mood in large sections of the church .

		The '' Dictionary of Christ and the Gospels , '' a notable work which followed in
1906-1907	DATE	, strengthened the favorable impression .

		It showed the same skill in handling the material , and the same ample erudition , while it pre - sented the founder of Christianity neither quite as a mere man and a prophet of his people , subject to the common conditions of human life , nor altogether as the incarnate god of ecclesi - astical dogma .

		The one-volume '' Dictionary of the Bible '' -LRB-
1908	DATE	-RRB- gave further evidence of the great ability in this field possessed by the editor of '' The Expository Times . ''

		The most original and ambitious enterprise , however , that Dr.
Hastings	PERSON	has yet undertaken is the '' Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics , '' of which the first volume now lies before us .

		It will comprise from ten to twelve huge vol - umes of about ten thousand pages .

		According to editorial announcement , it will contain arti - cles '' on every religious belief or custom , on every philosophical idea , and every moral prac - tice , '' and also on '' such persons and places as are famous in the history of religion and mor - als . ''

		It will '' embrace the whole range of the - ology and philosophy , together with the relevant portions of anthropology , mythology , folk-lore , biology , psychology , economics , and sociology . ''

		Acknowledgments are made to half a hundred scholars for their assistance as counsellors .

		Over two hundred appear as authors of articles in this volume .

Britain	LOCATION	, how - ever , furnishes the most of them , and they are mainly specialists of distinction .

		Hundreds of others will , of course , contribute to the suc - ceeding volumes .

		Surely , everything has been done to make this a great encyclopaedia .

		In reading through the three hundred and more articles included in this volume , the re - viewer has indeed been unable to suppress a query whether , in spite of the abundance of well-digested information and mature reflection offered here , it was really expedient to give so large a scope to the work .

		We were greatly in need of an encyclopaedia of religion .

		The vast material brought together , in recent years , by the comparative study of religious phenomena , was nowhere available to the general public .

		Even good text - books failed to include
Chris	PERSON	- tianity among the religions of the world , and therefore necessarily gave a one-sided and wrong idea of the religious development .

		Pos - sibly it would have been a service of more immediate value , and more general usefulness , if Dr.
Hastings	PERSON	had confined himself to a pre - sentation , within narrower limits but in a com - petent manner and in a proper spirit , of the varied expressions of man 's religious life .

		He would have found it , even so , sufficiently diffi - cult to give an article on '' every religious belief or custom . ''

		There can be no question , however , that by including ethics and philosophy , geography and history , biology and economics , Dr.
Hastings	PERSON	has been able to place religion in its natural setting , as it were , and to make it more intelli - gible as an expression of man 's life .

		This extension of the scope also justified him in call - ing to his assistance experts in various sciences and independent thinkers whose statements have not passed through the alembic of the theological mind .

		In religion , ideas , customs , and institutions are important , but the personal element counts for most .

		On the one hand , divine personalities -- gods , heroes , angels -- challenge the religious interest ; on the other , human personalities , prophets , priests , and saints .

		Such an ency - clopaedia as this should be rich in religious biography .

		Every important god should appear under his own name .

		That is not done here .

		One often has to hunt him up in articles deal - ing with all sorts of things besides theology .

		If he is discussed at length somewhere , his name should appear in its proper place , with an exact cross-reference .

		There seem to be nineteen biographical articles .

		There are three Jews ,

		Amyraut , Arius , and Arminius should have had separate biographies , and many others discussed inciden - tally ought to have been given special articles .

		In the well-written article on
Apollonius of Tyana	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Canney	PERSON	might have made more of the knowledge of

Damis	PERSON	unmistak - ably displays .

		When a man is known as
Alex	PERSON	- ander of Abonoteichos , readers naturally like to know where that place was .

		They should have been told to look up Inebole on the Black Sea .

		The article on
Abyssinia	LOCATION	, by
Littman	PERSON	, derives special freshness and value from the author 's recent expedition to this country .

		In reference to the Falashas , a view differing from his is taken by
MacCulloch	PERSON	-LRB- article Agaos -RRB- , who denies that they are Jews by descent , and re - gards them as proselytes before the introduction of Christianity .

Eduard Meyer	PERSON	has shown that they were probably only the pre-Hellenic inhabitants of

		Mr.
Glothlin	PERSON	does not seem to be acquainted with the remarkable development of the Anabaptist churches in
Italy	LOCATION	, as shown in the published archives of the Inquisition ; nor does he do justice to Denck .

		It is sincerely to be hoped that Dr.
Hastings	PERSON	may see fit to devote a special article to this man of genius whose opinions were as far in advance of his age as his character shone by contrast with some of his better-known contemporaries .

		McGiffert gives a careful summary of the tendencies of life in the Apostolic Age .

		This age he closes with the
end of the first century	DATE	.

		To the present writer he seems to crowd the reign of Domitian with literary productions that clearly belong to the second century .

		The article on Apologetics is itself a curious example of this jeu < T esprit , and another interesting specimen of the same kind is the article on Apostolic Succession .

		It is a characteristic of this encyclopaedia that certain topics are treated from different points of view by different writers , or that the various phases are assigned to different men .

		Many hands have been at work on such articles as those on Adoption , Adultery , Ages of the World .

		Ancestor - Worship , Anointing ,

Xathamel Schmidt	PERSON	.


Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	.

		A Musical , wizard of the North .

		* We hear a great deal about nationalism in music .

		The Italian melody has played a signifi - cant part in the development of the art ; the German contrapuntal harmony has shown itself to be an investiture for a deeper and larger view of life : and now the Russian and the Hungarian have made dazzling additions to our musical resources .

		Nor have we by any means reached the end .

		From the rugged North comes a contribution well calculated to arouse our curiosity and lead us on to admiration .

		Yet it seems easy to make altogether too much of nationality .

		After all , it is hardly the most important fact in
Wagner	PERSON	's life that he was born a
Teuton	LOCATION	, or in
Tchaikovsky	ORGANIZATION	's that he was born a Slav .

		So also we consider too curiously about genealogies .

		A great man is truly his own ancestor ; he creates his own environment ; he finds his followers ; he is the founder of his race and fortune .

		It would seem that too much stress has been placed upon local color , so called , and the peculiarities indigenous to native music everywhere .

		The composers have made use of folk songs and folk dances , but thev have not allowed themselves to be fettered by the limita - tions inevitably belonging to these .

		No art has been more universal than music .

		The most characteristically national writers have used sub - jects that had arisen in lands other than theirs .

		When
Schumann	PERSON	and Tchaikovsky each gave
Byron	PERSON	's ''
Manfred	PERSON	M a musical setting , perhaps a nobler artistic product than the original , local color receded into the distance : and
Wagner	PERSON	, certainly as national as any composer , used
Norse	ORGANIZATION	material in his epoch-making work rather than the home-bred version of the great story .

		The national song is really music in the im - mature and immediate stage .

		It springs from the life of the people in its youth .

		It is the first natural expression of emotion , and there - fore has all the characteristic elements of race and locality - .

		It has the charm and suggestive - ness that belong to a limited experience which has its realizations before it .

Nov. 16	DATE	, fears and expectations , and which gives an im - aginative hue to the sober facts of the daily round .

		It reflects the skies and the landscape that gave it birth ; it has the narrowness and the intensity and the superstition of the youth - ful and developing consciousness .

		A reflection upon its own processes follows , and this reflec - tion means both a loss and a gain .

		The naive melodiousness , the spontaneous reproduction of story or feeling , vanishes as if it would never return .

		The processes of the art grow multi - form and complex ; they are curious and inge - nious structures ; but the fresh charm is there no longer .

		The age of elaborate contrapuntal combinations has set in , and the musical edifices reared are such that it seems impossible ever to surpass them .

		The whole movement , however , leads up to a return of the melodiousness that characterized the first stage ; the difference now is that the command of the resources of the art accompanies the creation of the song .

		The local color and the nationalism are made subservient to a larger and a deeper purpose ; absolute music becomes a genuine expression of life 's universal experiences , and takes its place with the other arts that have told the great world - story to mankind in ways that allure and enchant .

		Not all nations have been so gifted as to be able to present the faith and aspiration of the race in music .

		The Anglo-Saxon , for some reason not here to be inquired into , has appar - ently been debarred from this accomplishment .

		The Scandinavian has stepped upon the stage later than the others , but he seems to be mak - ing good his claim to a place .


Gade	PERSON	,
Svendsen	PERSON	,
Sinding	PERSON	,
Nordraak	LOCATION	,
Kjerulf	PERSON	, and above all Ed - vard
Hagerup Grieg	PERSON	, have entered the charmed circle , and are altogether likely to stay there , established citizens of the realm .


Edvard Hagerup Grieg	PERSON	was born at
Bergen	LOCATION	in
Norway	LOCATION	, on the
15th of June , 1843	DATE	.

		His family was of importance ; his maternal grand - father had been mayor of the city .

		His father was the English consul in
Bergen	LOCATION	, and on the paternal side the family were of Scottish ante - cedents , a certain
Alexander Greig	PERSON	of Aberdeen having left his country for
Norway	LOCATION	during the troublous times of the Stuart Pretender .

		The mother was an accomplished musician , who had studied in
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The son remembered particularly her fine perform - ance of a Beethoven fantasy with orchestra , at a concert in his native city .

		This mother de - termined that her son should be musical , and she succeeded beyond her most ardent expecta - tions .

		The young student showed remarkable attainment , and when he was twelve years of age he brought to school a manuscript with the superscription , '' Variations on a German Mel - ody for the Piano , by
Edvard Grieg	ORGANIZATION	, Opus 1 . ''

		The teacher , however , with pedagogical astute - ness perhaps too common , seemed to take a sin - gular offense at such use of the boy 's energies .

		At this time the ideas of the youth were not definitely turned in the direction of music , but he intended to become a minister of the gospel , a herald of the truth as he considered it .

		The decisive moment , however , was at hand .

		One day , when
Edvard	ORGANIZATION	was about fifteen years old , the famous violinist , Ole Bull , made a visit to the Griegs .

		He heard the boy play , looked over his writings , and on his persuasion it was decided to send
Edvard	ORGANIZATION	to the Conservatory at Leipsic .

		He had the thorough and systematic instruction of Richter , of
Hauptman	PERSON	, of
Reinicke	PERSON	; but his thoughts and imaginings went out toward the romanticism of Chopin and
Schumann	PERSON	, who remained throughout his life strong inspirations in his work .

		He also had help from
Moscheles	LOCATION	, who gave him great encouragement .

		Sir
Arthur Sullivan	PERSON	was a fellow-student , and the young Norwegian found it necessary to toil long and diligently to keep the pace set by his confreres .

		He continued under the influence of
Ole Bull	ORGANIZATION	, and formed a friendship with
Richard Nordraak	PERSON	, a Norwegian composer , with decided national - istic tendencies , who died at the early age of twenty-four .

		He had also made the acquaint - ance of Kjerulf , whose songs have the Norse accent and flavor .

		Together these men were agreed in giving to their music the form and substance which belonged to the picturesque peninsula giving them birth .

		In
1867	DATE	Grieg married his cousin ,
Nina Hagerup	PERSON	, and gave con - certs with his wife in
Christiania	LOCATION	, his residence for about eight years .

		The so-called national movement in music , however , soon lost the interest attending its beginning , and
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	found himself in a war with jealousies and medi - ocrities .

		He gained the adhesion of his coun - try 's great men ;
Bjornson	PERSON	and
Ibsen	PERSON	recognized in him a kindred spirit .

		He early attracted the attention of Liszt .

		In
December , 1868	DATE	, the famous player wrote him : '' It gives me great pleasure to tell you of the sincere enjoyment I derived from a perusal of your sonata -LRB- Opus 8 -RRB- .

		It bears witness to a strong talent for com - position , a talent that is reflective , inventive , provided with excellent material , and which needs only to follow its national inclinations to rise to a high rank .

		I com - fort myself with the belief that you will find in your country the success and encouragement you deserve ;

		THE DIAL , 381 nor will you miss them elsewhere ; and if you visit
Germany	LOCATION	this
winter	DATE	I invite you cordially to spend some time at
Weimar	LOCATION	that we may become acquainted . ''

		The praise from
Liszt	PERSON	was entirely spontaneous , the statement that
Grieg	PERSON	had sent to the virtuoso some of his compositions being incorrect .

		After - wards , while
Grieg	PERSON	was in
Rome	LOCATION	, the composers met ; and in a letter home the Norwegian dreamer has this to say : `` I had fortunately just received the manuscript of my pianoforte concerto from
Leipsic	LOCATION	, and took it with me .

		Besides myself , there were present Winding ,
Sgambati	PERSON	, and a German Lisztite , whose name I do not know , but who goes so far in the aping of his idol that he even wears the gown of an abbe ; add to these a
Chevalier de Concilium	ORGANIZATION	, and some young ladies of the kind that would like to eat Liszt , skin , hair , and all ; their admiration is simply comical ... Winding and I were very anxious to see if he would really play my concerto at sight .

		I , for my part , considered it impos - sible ; not so Liszt . '

		Will you play ? '

		he asked , and I made haste to reply , ' No , I can not . '

		-LRB- You know I have never practiced it . -RRB-

		Then Liszt took the manuscript , went to the piano , and said to the assembled guests , with his characterietic smile , ' Very well , then , I will show you also that I can not . '

		With that he began .

		I admit that he took the first part of the concerto too fast , and the beginning consequently sounded helter-skelter ; but later on , when I had a chance to indicate the tempo , he played as only he can play .

		... In conclusion , he handed me the manuscript , and said , in a peculiarly cordial tone , ' Keep steadily on ; you have the capability , and -- do not let them intimidate you . ' ''

		This last admonition
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	took greatly to heart .

		It encouraged him to pursue the unusual tenor of his way ; it led him to make more of the peculiar spirit of his country 's music ; it gave him confidence in the artistic creed which he had now clearly formulated , and which became his guide during the remainder of his life .

		He used the abundant material of folk-music furnished by
Norway	LOCATION	, as other great composers had done before him with folk-music of their lands .

		He took the many peasant songs and dances and glorified them .

		He used them for the delinea - tion of national life and traits .

		As
Coleridge	PERSON	made a new thing out of the ballads of
England	LOCATION	in his '' Ancient Mariner , '' so Grieg made bal - lads and orchestral pieces of remarkable merit and novelty out of the peasant melodies of Nor - way .

		His work , of course , was not confined to such efforts .

		He was a free musician of the modern type , and his best music belongs to no time or country .

		He lived in the great era of
Norway	LOCATION	's literary activity ; he numbered the first men of his time among his friends .

		He has set to music the weird and extraordinary story put forth in Ibsen 's '' Peer Gynt , '' and he began the setting of ''
Olaf Trygvason	PERSON	'' by
Bjornson	PERSON	, perhaps the noblest subject which
Norway	LOCATION	's history affords .

		Olaf Trygvason Car - ry le declares to be ' • still a shining figure for us , the wildly beautifullest man in body and soul that one has ever heard of in the North . ''

		Grieg has left compositions of every kind , but like his masters ,
Chopin	PERSON	and
Schmann	PERSON	, his power is essentially lyric , and his piano pieces , his chamber music , and his songs embody the hopes , the moods , the aspirations of his time and people in exquisite and permanent forms .


Norway	LOCATION	's scenery , her history , her home life , her intense absorption in the questions and dreams of the modern epoch , are reflected in his music .

		He had the audacities characteristic of his nation and period ; but his was a sane and steadfast mind , and his work in consequence is uplifting and wholesome .

		He spent the greater part of his life in his native town or its neighborhood .

		He won the appreciation of his contemporaries ; the German Emperor with his usual cordiality did him honor ; he conducted his music in other countries be - sides his own .

		He was , unfortunately , an inva - lid , and his accomplishment is therefore less than it might have been ; although it may , through these apparent misfortunes , have gained in refinement and sympathy .

		When the good fight was ended , he received generously the recognition that belongs to one who has done valiant service and added to the joy and eleva - tion of his fellow men .

		The present edition of Mr.
Henry T. Finck	PERSON	's book on ''
Grieg	PERSON	and his Music '' is almost a new work .

		It presents much additional mate - rial .

		It contains a number of letters from the composer to the author .

		It is an enthusiastic discussion of
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	's place among musicians ; it is written in the writer 's entertaining man - ner ; it is thorough and conscientious .

		We may not agree with Mr.
Finck	PERSON	in all the claims he makes for his hero , but his arguments are cal - culated to convince .

		He makes one statement which we can not help quoting : `` If I am to be called uncritical because of my abounding enthusiasm for the best products of
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	's genius , uncritical let me be called .

		The older I get the more I become convinced that the alleged • critical ' faculty of our times is a mental disease , a species of phylloxera threatening the best works of genius .

		Let us enjoy the fresh grapes from which the harmless wine of musical intoxication is made , leaving the raisins to the analysis and the critical commentators .

		Grieg 's music is as fresh and inspiriting as on the day when it was composed ; most of it is music of the future . ''

		Mr.
Finck	PERSON	evidently believes in the apprecia - tion as distinguished from the criticism ; and in this we think he is right .

		He has given the 382 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, earnest and devoted life of Grieg with true regard and understanding ; lie furnishes a re - view of the works which is authoritative ; and has made an illuminating and enjoyable book .

		The publishers have done their part well , both in letter-press and illustrations .

		Mesmerism and
Christian Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The connection of the two systems incorpor - ated in the title of Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	's book , '' Mes - merism and Christian Science , '' is justified in the sub-title , '' A Short History of Mental Heal - ing '' ' ; and it is as an admirable historical con - tribution that the work will find its place .

		In deed , the account of the life of
Mesmer	PERSON	and of the further vicissitudes of his system maintains so admirable a perspective that it may well be regarded as the most reliable accessible history of the subject .

		It is a curious aspect of Mes - mer 's own view of the phenomena which he so inadvertently aroused , that the very details which he ignored , and which in turn were set aside by several of the examining commissions -LRB- for whom '' imagination '' was an adequate explanation for the whole range of their obser - vations , -RRB- are the very ones which proved histori - cally influential and scientifically significant .

		In the first place , the discovery that the subjects upon whom
Mesmer	PERSON	exercised his '' magnetic '' influence were really in an abnormal mental state , fell to one of his successors ; and then , when a rational interpretation seemed inevitable , the development of affairs was distorted by the discovery that the '' somnambules '' -LRB- as they were then termed -RRB- had supersensitive powers , could read their own and others ' physiologies , and by this method practise a new variety of mental healing .

		Here too lies the bond of connection between the '' mesmerists '' and the '' spiritualists ' ; for the '' sensitives '' of the former became the '' mediums '' of the latter , while the doctrine of a magnetic fluid or radiation was once more revived in the theories of
Reichenbach	PERSON	.

		The spiritualistic interest soon absorbed the thera - peutic ; and the demonstration of occult and transcendent powers seemed alone adequate to prove either the reality of the hypnotic state or the truth of the theories to which the observa - tions gave rise .

		With the reinstatement of the hypnotic phenomena on a rational basis , hypnotic * A

		suggestions were again utilized for curative pur - poses ; and in this practice the demonstration of the dominant importance of suggestion became the central and the most valuable result .

		With this recognition , '' mental healing * ' as a psycho - logical procedure was justified alike in theory and practice ; and with the growth of experience , the large role of suggestive measures as applied to normal individuals in the normal state was overwhelmingly established .

		The last stage in the development was to formulate these principles , and , as it happened , to give them a pronounced religious setting .

		With this movement once inaugurated , the trend of its development proved to be largely deter - mined by the personality and the methods of its leader , Mrs.
Eddy	PERSON	.

		The peculiarities of her be - lief and the astounding scope of her influence do not loom as large in the critical historian 's per - spective as they did in the actual unfoldment of the spectacular drama which we of this genera - tion have had the privilege of witnessing .

		It is curious that among these notions is a violent antipathy to '' animal magnetism , '' which Mrs.
Eddy	PERSON	regards as the incarnation of as much of evil as her system permits her to recognize .

		Yet throughout this story , with its many ramifica - tions , the demonstration of the actual cures effected remains the positive support of each theory in turn ; so that Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	is justified in holding together the diverse strands of his his - tory by the common interest in mental healing .

		Mr.
Podmore	PERSON	is already favorably known as the historian of modern spiritualism and as the author of several works bearing upon psychical research .

		Though he is inclined to admit the possibility -LRB- if not the actual demonstration -RRB- of supersensuous forms of psychical manifestation , he is both cautious and critical in his admis - sions , and with a few exceptions -- which , how - ever , are to be regretted -- he does not allow his personal view to detract from the objective presentation of his material .

		THE DTAL 383 how , though he had been nurtured on '' The Nation , '' and had no fear of independent voting , and determined as he was not to vote for
Blaine	PERSON	, he could yet not bring himself to vote for the ob - scure man against whom scandalous charges had been brought , and who seemed to have little to recommend him to the confidence of the country for the supreme gift of the people .

		Good men trembled when the returns came in , showing that
Cleveland	LOCATION	had been elected , fearing that the un - skilled pilot would rim the ship on the rocks , that the results of the Civil War would be lost .

		These fears seem childish , now that we have come to know that masterful pilot , his sturdy patriotism , his lofty ideals , his steadiness in action , his great ability ; but they were very real then .

		One of the greatest of
Grover Cleveland	PERSON	's many services to the country was his clearing away forever of the conviction , held by number - less conscientious Republicans , that the Demo - crats would not be loyal to the settlement of the great struggle between the North and the South , that they could not be trusted with the control of the government .

		When his administration had manifested its fine temper , that bogey was destroyed , and the two parties could meet on equal terms as contestants for power .

		Mr.
Parker	PERSON	's book is not intended as a formal biography , but it answers every purpose of a biography from the political side , and it presents the real
Grover Cleveland	PERSON	with great skill .

		The author was thrown into close relations with President
Cleveland	LOCATION	during his first administra - tion , and was depended on by him until his death as adviser , as the medium for communicating with the public , as energetic and skilful in doing what Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	himself could not do in gain - ing newspaper cooperation and support for the government .

		He thus held Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	's con - fidence for the rest of his life , and from the intimacy thus maintained he is able to show us the real man as perhaps no other living person could .

		The early history of Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	is given briefly but sufficiently .

		His struggles were those of many a poor clergyman 's son , the one disappointment having been his inability to secure a college education on account of the burden resting upon him of supporting his mother and sisters .

		The same cause kept him from enlisting in the army ; his two brothers went as soldiers , and he burdened himself with debt for many years to furnish a substitute for himself .

		His rise to publie confidence and pro- fessional success in
Buffalo	LOCATION	, and his phenomenal victory in
New York	LOCATION	as candidate for the gov - ernorship , though almost unknown to the people of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, are described with sufficient fulness .

		President
Cleveland	LOCATION	never , when in active political life , quite gained popularity with the people .

		He was very reserved , very much op - posed to any line of conduct that might look as if he were trying to gain popular favor , too sturdily independent to bend to popular demands , too sensitive in political and personal honor to use office or influence to advance his own inter - ests or those of his friends .

		Many instances of this are given , from which we select a charac - teristic one . ''

		One day during the
last winter	DATE	of his life , when in one of his reminiscent moods , he surprised me by saying , '
Parker	PERSON	, it has always been said that it was something of a drawback to a man , if he wanted anything , to have been one of my friends ; and I guess that in some respects this judgment was about right . '

		Continuing , he ex - plained : ' I simply could not bring myself to the point of using the public service , or of being open to the charge of using it , for personal ends .

		It would , however , be unjust to accuse me of discriminating against my friends , as my record shows ; but I would rather , a thousand times , go to my grave with the reputation I have gained in this respect than to have had anybody say with truth that I had used official patronage for the payment of private debts . ''

		Differing in feeling and practice from some men of high position , he insisted that his parlor and his table were his own , and declined to use them for furthering political plans or interests .

		That Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	possessed personal qual - ities which endeared him to all who were brought into friendly contact with him , comes as some - thing of a surprise to those who knew only of his rugged honesty and his violent controversies with
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and with many of the leaders of his party .

		Probably no other president has ever bound so closely to himself the men whom he chose as members of his cabinet .

		Every man of them remained his intimate personal friend until death .

		There seems to have been a charm in his simple manhood and his sym - pathetic nature that won all who came within the circle of personal relations with him .

		And as different as was the man
Cleveland	LOCATION	from the austere self-contained President , so different was the ponderous literary style of his public documents from his playful and self-revealing letters to his friends .

		Among the portions of the book most valu - able to the student of history is that which gives the inside story of the activities of
Cleve	PERSON	- land 's friends to make him the candidate of his party in
1892	DATE	.

		Rarely are the details of any important campaign given as frankly as these are given by Mr.
Parker	PERSON	; and rarely is there 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, a campaign in which there is so little for the most high-minded to be ashamed of .

		The whole management was highly creditable to Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	and to his friends , and is very inter - esting as a revelation of character as well as of the methods of political campaigning .

		Equally interesting is the story of Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	's selection of his cabinet officers and leading offi - cials ; of the famous
Venezuela	LOCATION	message which came so dangerously near involving us in a war with
England	LOCATION	, and is regarded by many of
Cleveland	LOCATION	's admirers as his greatest official mistake ; of his attitude towards those in his own party who were pursuing the false gods of free silver and populism .

		All is told in a straightforward way that carries conviction .

		Much as
Grover Cleveland	PERSON	has come to be ad - mired as one of our best presidents , this book will increase admiration for him both as presi - dent and as man .

		* Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	's new novel -LRB- his fourth -RRB- is en - titled '' It Never Can Happen Again , '' which gives an easy cue to the reviewer .

		He has only to say '' Let us hope that it can , '' or '' See that it does n't , '' according as his opinion is favorable or unfavorable , and there is a whole judgment in a nutshell .

		For our own part , we should unhesitatingly employ the former phrase , as a feeble expression of gratitude for these seven hundred pages of ingenious inven - tion , stamped with the truly creative mark as far as character is concerned , replete with the humor that lights up the depths of life , and rich with the fruits of a ripened intelligence brought to bear upon a wide range of human concerns .

		pensity to quips of thought and paradox , as it is called , misleads you and spoils your talk . ''

		This might be made the text of an adverse criticism , for few books are so largely made up of `` quips of thought '' as are those of this writer , but at the worst they are no more than the exhibition of a mannerism which can not obscure the deep human sympathies underneath , and which , although it demands from the reader perpetual agility , never fails to justify itself as essential to the texture of the narrative .

		As in two of its predecessors , the opening gambit of the new novel is a series of moves taken by a child in the
London	LOCATION	slums and the child 's more or less disreputable relatives and associates .

		In this case the child is a girl named
Lizerann	PERSON	, not `` for short , '' like
Alice	PERSON	, but by way of phonetic transcription .

		She is a brave little thing of seven , speaking a dialect which is accurately reproduced , and lavishing a wealth of affection upon her '' daddy , '' who once sailed the seas , and is now a blind beggar .

		Even this calamity does not spare him from the buffets of fate , for presently he is run over by a carter 's wagon and taken to the hospital with crushed limbs .

		Indi - rectly , this disaster is the means of bringing kindly protection to both father and child , and of surround - ing their remaining days with a tenderness that softens the intolerable pathos of their close .

		For in the end a motor-car gets what is left of this father 's life , and the child dies a victim of tuberculosis .

		We soon realize that she is not to grow up and provide the story with a heroine , as
Alice	PERSON	did , but that the leading interest is to be created about a group of quite different people .

		These people , whom we first meet at a country house , include among their number the stately daugter of the family ,
Judith Murgatroyd	PERSON	, and
Alfred Challis	PERSON	, a successful novelist and playwright .

		There are several other figures of interest , besides chits and bores , but these two , together with the author 's wife -LRB- who is not of the party , and reputed to be impossible -RRB- are the chief characters of the novel .


Judith	PERSON	, who is a vain and selfish creature , exerts her arts upon
Alfred	PERSON	and fascinates a part of his nature , while the other and better part of it remains loyal to his own bourgeois establishment .

		On the other hand , the wife nurses a few sparks of pique at her husband 's fancied neglect into a flame of resentment , fanned to fury by her own misconstruction of trivial happenings , and by the over-candid sympathies of a prurient gossip of whom she makes a confidant .

		Things get worse and worse between husband and wife , until the latter takes refuge with her mother , and the former is fairly driven into a passion for Judith the temptress .

		When the crisis approaches ,
Alfred	PERSON	and
Judith	PERSON	are just about to carry out a plan of elope - ment and marriage , and the very motor-car which is carrying them away runs over the blind beggar and knocks
Alfred	PERSON	into an unconsciousness which lasts for several days .

		But how , the perplexed reader will ask at this point , how could
Alfred	PERSON	plan marriage with another woman when he already had a wife ?

		Thereby hangs the whole of Mr. De
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 385
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's tale , which is a complicated and whimsi - cal illustration of the English law prohibiting mar - riage with a deceased wife 's sister .

		Alfred 's wife i > this sort of a wife ; and when she deserts him she takes the position that their marriage has never been legal , and upon this theory she defies him to claim possession of their children .

		Now these happenings are so timed that the climax is reached just when the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	is on the point of relaxing in its stubborn opposition , and of legalizing such marriages retrospectively as well as for the future .

		When
Alfred	PERSON	is speeding away in the motor-car with
Judith	PERSON	, their haste is due to the fact that unless they are married at once the action of the Lords , now assured , will confirm the legal character of
Alfred	ORGANIZATION	's previous marriage and make his wife and children legitimate .

		So the chauffeur whose reckless driving checks the escapade proves to be a dens ex machind in the literal sense .

		There are still other complications , wheels within wheels , involving the intricacy of the marriage laws , at which the author pokes all sorts of satirical fun ; but we should despair of describing them with any degree of brevity .

		Suffice it to say that the wife relents when she hears of her husband 's accident , and the domestic bond , so nearly snapped , is restored in full strength .

		The title of the novel is now explained , for such a case as is here described is no longer possible under English law .

		The author appends to his tale an interesting note from which we make the following quotation : ' • When , to my great surprise , I published four years since a novel called '
Joseph Vance	PERSON	, '' a statement was repeated more than once in some journals that were kind enough to notice it .

		that its author was seventy years of age .

		Why this made me feel like a centenarian I do not know , espe - cially as it was ahead of the facts .

		But that was its moral effect .

		Its practical one was to make me endeavor to set it right .

		... Li the course of my attempts to procure the reduction to which I was entitled , I expressed a hope that the said author would live to be seventy , and .

		further , that he would write four or five volumes as long as his first in the interim . ''

		The hope has now been fulfilled , for the author has just passed his seventieth birthday .

		Our own hope is that he may become a centenarian in fact as well as in moral feeling , attaching to it only the condition that no year of the coming thirty may be without its book . ''

		The Men of the Mountain , '' Mr.
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	's latest tale , is unexpectedly compact and vivid in quality , besides being concerned with a theme quite different from those previously chosen by this fertile writer .

		It is a tale of the Franco-Prussian War , not handled , however , in the conventionally theat - rical manner , but having a real basis of life , and presenting an aspect of the struggle almost unknown to the average reader .

		No battles are described and no political crises are exploited , but we are instead given an intimate account of what the disorders of the Terrible Year meant to the simple folk of the
Jura	LOCATION	and the adjacent Swiss border .

		The smuggling , the raiding , the sharpshooting , and the general lawlessness of this region are brought home to us in a series of vivid episodes , all centring about a Genevan minister -LRB- with an
Edinburgh	LOCATION	schooling in divinity -RRB- , who is a true pastor of his scattered flock , and whose simple God-fearing life commands the tribute of our respect By way of contrast , we have a German military chaplain , whose rough humor and masterful bearing offer unfailing entertainment .

		A pair of heroines are provided ; one of them is the minister 's sister , the other is a country school mis - tress who turns out to be an heiress .

		There is also a villain , who promises well at first , but is after - wards spoiled by an attack of repentance .

		This seems to us rather a mean trick .

		But the author has , on the whole , done better in this book than in most of his others , and we must not be too severe upon his indulgence in the sentimental .

		The stories of the
Canadian Northwest	ORGANIZATION	which Mr.
Harold Bindloss	PERSON	writes with such frequency and ease are so palpably similar that we sometimes wonder how they can continue so to hold our inter - est. .

		For interesting they are , even to the newest of them , `` The Greater Power , '' which is the veriest replica of its predecessors .

		Here again is the hero who wrests victory from defeat in the struggle with nature , and wins a woman 's love by sheer deter - mination and an exhibition of the qualities of simple manhood .

		The scene is
British Columbia	LOCATION	, the task accomplished is the reclamation of a mountain val - ley by a daring work of engineering , and the enemy overcome is a knot of unscrupulous speculators in land .

		It makes a varied and virile tale no less de - serving of praise than the half dozen of its sort that have come before .

		There is good romantic stuff in '' The Castle by the Sea , '' which is the latest invention of Mr.
H. B. Marriott Watson	PERSON	.

		A Londoner , seeking a quiet place for literary work , rents a castle on the
Devon	LOCATION	coast for the
summer	DATE	.

		The owner is supposed to be in foreign parts , but in reality is hiding in and about the castle , a subject of anxious pursuit on the part of sundry creditors .

		His tenant finds anything but the peace he had looked for in his new quarters , for mysterious hangers-about and weird nocturnal dis - turbances engage his attention from the start , and the pursuit of letters languishes .

		Ghostly walkings or burglarious visitations seem to be the alternative theories upon which to account for the disturbances which vex his nights and perplex his waking hours .

		Presently he identifies his landlord , sympathizes with his difficulties , and harbors him in secret .

		For some reason , the creditors seem to have an inordinate de - sire to gain possession of the property , and their motive is at last revealed when the fact transpires that the estate has valuable deposits of copper .

		The mystery is skilfully worked up until the close , when the conspirators are thwarted , and Sir
Gilbert	PERSON	comes into his own .

		There are several interesting ladies ,
summer	DATE	visitors in the neighborhood , and one of them is charming enough to be quite adequate as a horoine , and to supply the sentimental interest which the reader naturally expects .

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's style is as good as his invention , and the sum total of the effect is decidedly pleasing .

		386 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, Mr.
Thomas Nelson Page	PERSON	has become a victim of the Zeitgeist , and has deserted his chosen field of Southern romance to plunge into the welter of industrial and political life as it exists in the American city of to-day .

		We can not say that his move has been ill-advised , for he has produced a thoroughly readable novel , albeit one that exhibits several loose ends , and is rather disjointed in con - struction .

		But he has become sufficiently familiar of late years with the problems of city life to discuss them intelligently , and he brings wholesome moral sympathies together with a fine indignation to bear upon their treatment .

		His city is not named , but his descriptions point with some closeness to
Chicago	LOCATION	, and the conditions he describes are chiefly related to the labor question in connection with the traction companies , and to the corrupt alliance of politics with vice .

		His types are fairly familiar , including the good magnate and the bad one , the walking delegate , the corporation lawyer , the political boss , the sycophantic churchman , the worldly woman of society whose luxury comes from grinding the faces of the poor , the settlement worker , and the idealist -LRB- a Jew -RRB- , who becomes the martyr of the people 's cause .

		We have also , of course , the magnate 's daughter for a heroine and the earnest young reformer for a hero , both of which figures are more humanly natural than is usually the case .

		Mr.
Page	PERSON	steers clear of melodrama , and does not force the note of conflict between duty and affection .

		Nor does he outrage all the probabilities by resorting to bathos at the close and making the wicked suffer a change of heart .

		His hero is a rather commonplace person whom we like all the better for not indulging in heroics ; while
John Marvel	PERSON	, the Christian preacher , is hardly made prominent enough to jus - tify the use of his name for a title .

		When we first make the acquaintance of
Martin Eden	PERSON	, who is the latest embodiment of Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	's conception of manly character and the latest projection of his notions about society in par - ticular and the universe in general , his command of speech is somewhat circumscribed .

		M Excuse me , Miss , fer buttin ' in that way .

		I guess the real facts is that I do n't know nothing much about such things .

		It ai n't in my class . ''

		This is not surprising , because
Martin	PERSON	, who is twenty-one , has hitherto associated chiefly with sailors and hoodlums .

		But it is a trifle surprising to find , a few weeks later , that his speech has taken on such a fashion as this : '' Beauty has significance , but I never knew its significance before .

		I just accepted beauty as something meaningless , or something that was just beautiful without rhyme or reason .

		I did not know anything about beauty .

		This grass is more beautiful to me now that I know why it is grass , and all the hidden chemistry of sun and rain that makes it become grass . ''

		The cause of this quick metamorphosis is a girl , combined with a series of attacks upon the public library , and readings that range from
Madame Blavatsky	ORGANIZATION	to
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	.

		Having realized that there is a higher life than that of the hoodlum , he aims to attain it by way of authorship .

		He scribbles assidu - ously , refuses the opportunities for honest toil that his well-wishers provide , starves himself to pay the postage on his manuscripts , and finds , with an amazement that deepens into bitterness , that they come back to him in a monotonous procession .

		Whereupon he delivers himself of sundry diatribes against the sickly culture that editors and publishers seem leagued to promote .

		Finally , the tide turns , his wares find a market , and he rolls in wealth .

		But the girl who had been the vitalizing influence in his life is by this time scorned as a product of the stupefying educational mill and an embodiment of the bourgeoisie .

		He has read
Nietzsche	PERSON	, and found in himself the traits of the superman .

		He is also by way of being a contradictory blend of socialist and anarchist .

		Spurning the maiden whose eyes are at last opened to his true greatness , scorning the clamor - ous publisher who now waylays him at every turn , despising the trade which has brought him worldly fortune , he writes no more , but cannily unloads all his juvenile effusions upon the market , distributes largess to the humble companions of his time of ad - versity , and then takes passage for the islands of the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		But even the dream of a Tabitian paradise palls upon him after a few days of the voyage , and he ends the whole miserable business of life by drop - ping out of the port-hole one dark night .

		It is just as well .

		Such turbulent egotism as his could never find any real satisfaction in existence , and such de - fiance of the collective wisdom of mankind could not contribute to society anything of value .

		It is unfor - tunate that Mr.
London	PERSON	could not invest his hero with the attributes that awaken sympathy , so that we might at least mourn the abrupt termination of his career .

		As it is , the author merely satisfies our curiosity , and leaves us wondering at the perverted idealism which makes havoc of
Martin	ORGANIZATION	's ambitions .

		And there is not a little satisfaction in knowing that he is not to live to make miserable the heroine , who is , despite
Martin	PERSON	's -LRB- and the author 's -RRB- scorn of her , a sensible and attractive young woman , far more worth while than the man who has outgrown her in his own conceit .

		In one respect , u The Hungry Heart , '' by Mr.
David Graham Phillips	PERSON	, is a resetting of the old '' triangular '' situation that has been done to death by hordes of modern novelists .

		More seriously , it is a protest , after the fashion of '' A Doll Home , '' against the convention that considers a woman a mere plaything for some man , to be indulged in her whims , but never to be admitted into intelligent companionship .

		Unfortunately , Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	, who can write verbosely and expound a thesis with a good deal of vehemence , can not shape consistent charac - ters , and can not avoid the pitfalls of vulgai'ity and sensationalism .

		He keeps our sympathies constantly shifting .

		At first they are with the neglected wife , and the husband deserves only indignatiou .

		Then the lover appears , and for a time shines in so white a light that we are almost made to condone the wife 's
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 387 faithlessness .

		But presently we have to revise our judgments all round , for the lover is transformed into a despicable creature , the husband into a patient heroic soul worthy of anybody 's love , and the wife into a rather shrewish person of unstable purpose and violent passions .

		When the forbidden fruit upon which her '' hungry heart '' is fed turns to dust and ashes in her mouth , she looks longingly at the substantial fare she has scorned , and is glad to return to it at the request of her wronged but com - placent husband .

		The element of vulgarity is not missing from the story , but it is less grossly repellant than in some of the novels that Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	has pre - viouslv published .

		But he still nurses his old griev - ance against the refinements of civilized society , and the weapon of his warfare is a weaver 's beam .

		When `` The Autobiography of Nicholas Worth '' was appearing serially in '' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' we took it at its face value as a truthful record of personal experience .

		Now .

		to our considerable sur - prise , it is called '' The Southerner , '' and published as a novel .

		This change of style , however , does not seem to call for any radical readjustment of our atti - tude toward the book , for .

		whether its tale be actu - ally true or not , the spirit of truth is in the narrative from beginning to end , and the fine idealism which inspires it is just what it was before .

		It is the life - history of a man of the South , to whom the Civil War is no more than a memory of childhood , and whose manhood energy has been devoted to the building up of a new civilization upon the ruins of the old .

		He looks hopefully to the future , not re - gretfully toward the past , and he realizes that the tradition of the old days , demanding that deference be paid to the sentiments and prejudices of a van - ishing generation , is the chief obstacle in the path of progress .

		He encounters this obstacle , embodied in the politicians and • • colonels '' of the old regime , at every stage of his career : and it causes him many a disheartening set-back .

		But his faith i ?

		strong , and his patience adequate , and he sees the new or - der gradually unfolding in politics , industry , and education .

		The story of this man 's struggle for the betterment of his fellows , whether it be pieced to - gether by fancy , or be literally the record of expe - rience , makes one of the most genuine of books ; it combines sincerity with insight , and deserves to be taken to heart by serious readers both

		Jason sought the golden fleece , and succumbed to the charms of Medea : the modern • * Jason '' of Mr.
Justus Miles Forman	PERSON	's romance undertook the chivalrous quest of tracking a boy who had been kidnapped in
Paris	LOCATION	, and found his fate in the young woman who was responsible for the boy 's detention .

		This was not altogether nice of
Jason	PERSON	, whose real name was Sainte-Marie .

		because the adventure was embarked upon for the sake of the beaux yeux of the boy 's sister , and what he should have done was to return successful and claim his reward .

		On the other hand , the boy was not exactly kidnapped , because he had been deceived by his uncle -LRB- a wily villain -RRB- into believing that his family were angry with him , and was the willing guest of
Medea	LOCATION	, the object of his calf-love .

		The enchantress was herself a nicer girl than one might imagine , and her chief misfortune was her father , who was a shady adven - turer .

		This is the complication set forth in Mr.
Forman	PERSON	's story , which is ingeniously contrived and vivaciously related .

		It is an intensely Parisian story , written by one who knows intimately and loves deeply the cheerful City of Light .

		Historical novels about
Cromwell	PERSON	are apt to be interesting , and , although their name is legion , we have taken up '' Big
John Baldwin	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Wilson Vance	PERSON	, with pleasurable anticipations that have not been disappointed .

		The story is in the journal form , as written from time to time by its hero , who is a sort of
John Ridd	PERSON	of the Fen country .

		He is huge of build , masterful of disposition , and always lovable .

		He is pig-headed enough to refuse the king 's favors , and to defy
Cromwell	PERSON	.

		Especially in the matter of the Irish massacres , he is plain spoken in his speech with the
Lord General	ORGANIZATION	, and thwarts him in an attempt to capture Prince Rupert by treachery .

		The heroine twists him about her fingers , and teases him to the top of her bent ; but this particular agony is not unduly prolonged , and her maiden heart is irrevokably yielded up to him midway in the narrative .

		After the
Protectorate	ORGANIZATION	is firmly established , the hero , wearying of wars , seeks a home in

		In the fulness of time , some thirty years later , he dies leaving the long - winded but not unreadable journal for the instruc - tion of his descendants .

Fabre	PERSON	,
Huysman	PERSON	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Maeterlinck	PERSON	are so brief that full treat - ment seems out of the question .

		Yet he clearly sets before us the reason why these thinkers , aside from the superficial likeness in being French , have beneath all their disparity the essential agreement of a skeptical attitude toward life .

		Their negations were of different kinds .

		Fabre was a priest who saw through the shams of his profession ; Fontenelle , cynical in everything else , foil in love with the 388 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, scientific truth which later was to obsess modern thinking ;
Huysman	PERSON	's rebound into the Catholic faith came after he had run the gamut of the world 's pleasures and found them dust and ashes .

		Me ` rime'e was the man of the world utterly weary of the shows thereof ; while
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, like
Huysman	PERSON	, found relief in his maturity from the haunting fatal - ism of his earlier plays in a kind of Emersonian idealism .

		And Anatole

		Unlike as the six are , they are of the fellowship of Doubt , each in his respective day and generation .

		They are thus symptomatic , and so properly grouped .

		The final summary of the modern philosophic pose is keen and wise , and the book as a whole has a literary quality unusual in works of its kind , which makes it agreeable reading ; its theme assures stimulation , for there is something fascinating about men who , even when they interpret humanity in terms of pessimism , unite persuasive eloquence of expression with intellectual power .

		True beacons they may not be ; but they shed light in their own fashion , if only to warn us away from the rocks of casuistry and the treacherous waters of hypercriticism .

		quarian work on '' The Literary His - tory of the Adelphi and its Neighborhood '' -LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Austin Brereton	PERSON	adds a few interesting particu - lars and writes a new Introduction .

		The name '' Adelphi '' seems to have been applied since
1772	DATE	to a block of buildings erected by the brothers Robert and
James Adam	PERSON	, famous architects of their time , who signed their architectural drawings with this Greek word meaning '' brothers . ''

		The rambling edi - fice in question stands on the bank of the Thames , between the Strand and the river , not far from Char - ing Cross .

		Mr.
Brereton	PERSON	has delved into the ancient history of this spot , and even has the hardihood to ask the reader to accompany him back to the thir - teenth century , when
Durham House	ORGANIZATION	, town residence of the Bishop of
Durham	LOCATION	, stood on the ground now covered by the
Adelphi	ORGANIZATION	.

		With incredible industry he has brought together a multitude of historic and literary references to the locality , succeeding even in knitting connection between it and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, to say nothing of
Dickens	LOCATION	,
Hood	LOCATION	,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Hazlitt	PERSON	, De Quincey ,
Garrick	PERSON	,
Goldsmith	PERSON	,
Johnson	PERSON	,
Pepys	PERSON	, and a host of others -- a very pretty exercise in lit - erary research , and furnishing opportunity -LRB- if de - sired -RRB- for any number of enlarged and emended editions of one 's book .

		Incidentally , Mr.
Brereton	PERSON	compliments us Americans on our acquaintance with the lore of old
London	LOCATION	streets , while he refers to the Londoners as knowing nothing about their own city .

		One wishes that he had made it a little clearer ex - actly what is at present designated by the name
Adelphi	LOCATION	; for its application appears loose and elas - tic .

		The fact that the author himself lives at '' 3 Men and manners of old
Florence	LOCATION	.

		Adam Street ,
Adelphi	LOCATION	, W. C , '' may help to explain his eager interest in this particular neighborhood .

		The book has many illustrations from old prints and other sources .

		Whether Dr.
Guido Biagi	PERSON	writes in his native Italian or in English , he is master of a fine literary style , and is sure to be engaging .

		Moreover , as librarian of two of the oldest collections of books in
Florence	LOCATION	, he has access to a large amount of rare material .

		He un - derstands how to ransack among old books and parchments , among dusty archives and forgotten records , and to extract from them all sorts of choice bits in a way to make them appeal to the imagina - tion .

		Therefore his latest book , '' Men and Manners of Old Florence '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , is not only a highly inform - ing work but a highly entertaining one .

		Although not a connected narrative , its five essays deal with sub - jects that give us more than passing glimpses into Florentine life at its most interesting period -- the six centuries between the thirteenth and the nine - teenth .

		From one chapter , we learn something of the life of the early Italian merchants , before they had won fortunes , and while they were still laboring in their shops and warehouses , striving for the achieve - ment of riches and nobility for their families .

		Even in those primitive days , we find abundant evidence of that natural courtesy and love of refinement and beauty which led those early merchants to spend the first money they could spare upon the beautifying of their houses and gardens , the collecting and order - ing for pure love of art , of pictures and illuminations and manuscripts , thus forming the nucleus of many a famous library or gallery of art .

		In another chap - ter we have an alluring picture of that easy mirthful life , that dazzling splendor of art and poetry , that thoughtless gaiety which is summed up in the word Renaissance .

		In another essay , the longest of all , we are given the life-story of a woman who was a famous beauty and a poet of some merit in her day , a woman who figured under her own or fictitious names as the heroine of countless songs , tales , and sonnets -- Tullia of
Aragon	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Biagi	PERSON	explains the position of
Tullia	LOCATION	, and of others of her class , by the somewhat surprising statement that '' Intelligent sympathy was rarely looked for in the family , for the housewife of this time was either a fear-inspiring virago with a masculine mind , capable of protecting her virtue by sheer force of arms , or else she was a creature wholly absorbed in domestic matters , with no understanding for anything beyond her prayers and her pantry .

		Thus men of letters , who sought for charm of mind , for a beauty less austere , who wanted a Muse for their verses and a companion for their merry feastings , turned to the trained and ac - complished courtesans , regarding them somewhat as one regards a fair flower whose scent and beauty one enjoys without inquiring how and where it was grown . ''

		The forty-nine illustrations of the book are of unusual excellence , many of them having never been published before .

		These two abstracts , one of
1842	DATE	and the other of
1844	DATE	, are now printed together as u The Foundation of the Origin of Species '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The essays are edited and an introduction is furnished by
Francis Darwin	PERSON	.

		The
1842	DATE	essay is in
Darwin	LOCATION	's most elliptical style ; in many places it is absolutely unintelligible , and must always have been so to anyone but the writer .

		It clearly is simply a worker 's outline notes , preliminary to a careful setting forth of the subject .

		The very careful and thorough editing which it receives can make it no more than this .

		It is interesting chiefly for two reasons : one , because the outline is Dar - win 's -- we see how the master worked ; the other , because it , in connection with the
1844	DATE	essay , shows how his ideas changed and developed in the twenty years from
1839	DATE	when he read
Malthus	PERSON	to
1859	DATE	when the '' Origin '' appeared .

		The
1844	DATE	essay is much easier and more satisfactory reading than the earlier outline .

		It is a far more carefully prepared statement of the subject , which was originally written as a sort of '' insurance policy '' on
Darwin	PERSON	's ideas as to the origin of species .

		In event of his sudden death it was intended that this essay should serve as the basis of a presentation of his ideas to the public , to be expanded by a competent editor .

		Happily , the occasion never came to make this use of the essay .

		It served in
Darwin	LOCATION	's own hands as the nucleus in the preparation of the 4 * Origin . ''

		It is neither vulgar gossip nor ambitious theorizing , but an honest effort to place before the reader the lead - ing experiences and the personal peculiarities of each of twenty-six remarkable men , in such a manner that each will leave a distinct and separate impression in the memory ; a difficult goal to reach , it is true , and one which has led to some perilously unqualified statements .

		But the slips are unimportant , and the book is in the main an admirable one .

		A succinct and comprehensive Introduction sketches the history of
France	LOCATION	during the Napoleonic period ; a table termed a '' Synopsis of the Marshals '' notes for each the date of his birth , the date of his reception of the Marshal 's baton , his titles , and the date and manner of his death .


Berthier	PERSON	,
Massena	LOCATION	,
Davout	LOCATION	,
Lannes	LOCATION	, Soult .

		Ney , and
Bernadotte	PERSON	, are listed as the really great names , the others as owing their eminence to accident as well as merit .

		It would be interesting to discuss the author 's clear-cut characterization of each separate hero , but it is perhaps more worth while to note some general statements : that every Marshal but four was a trained soldier ; that though most of them rose rapidly from humble positions , the French army of those days was so peculiarly managed that the non-commissioned officers were better commanders than the holders of commissions in many other armies : that these men had enjoyed advantages in the school of war almost unprece - dented in history ; that they were picked and trained -LRB- to quote our present author 's phrasing of a popular qualification -RRB- by '' him whom nature had adorned with the greatest intellect that the world has yet seen . ''

		The new book is a real acquisition to the literature of its class .

College	ORGANIZATION	, with the rather unsatisfactory title `` Fifty Years in

Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Washburn	PERSON	writes with the unconscious power of a man absorbed by his theme ; so that a book which is absolutely without literary ambition , and is to a large extent statistical information , becomes a story of absorbing interest .

		The College was opened in
1863	DATE	, with four students , three English and one American : and through the years since then -- years of heroic struggle made harder by Turkish folly , Bulgarian recklessness , Russian cupidity , English statecraft , French and German jealousy , earthquake , plague , and fire -- it has grown to an attendance of over four hundred students of every race and nation , and to an influence second to that of no educational institution in the world .

		In the briefest of his papers is a sense of leisure which is one of their chief charms .

		But if an essayist to-day were too obviously a laudator temporis acti , he could hardly be popular .

		And if Mr.

		Only one name of even secondary signifi - cance -- that of Gounod -- is included in the list .

		This does not mean , of course , that the composers repre - sented are not estimable writers , or that their perform - ance is not creditable , but we can not help thinking of '' Die Allonackt , '' for example , and noticing the dif - ference .

		Notes .

		`` My Pets , '' newly translated from the French of
Alexandre Dumas	PERSON	by Mr.
Alfred Allinson	PERSON	, and embel - lished with a series of pictures , is a recent publication of the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Swinburne 's Dramas '' is the title of a volume edited by Dr.
Arthur Beatty	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Only three of the dramas are given -- the two Greek tragedies and ''
Mary Stuart	PERSON	. ''

		There is an introduction , a bibliography , and a slender outfit of notes .

		Two more volumes in the edition of the writings of
M. Anatole France	ORGANIZATION	, published by the
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	, give us '' The Merry Tales of Jacques Tournebroche '' and '' Child Life in Town and Country , '' translated by Mr.
Alfred Allinson	PERSON	; and ''
Penguin Island	LOCATION	, '' translated by Mr.
A. W. Evans	PERSON	.

		An attractive single-volume edition of '' The Poems of Oscar Wilde '' is published by
Messrs. John W. Luce & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is an authorized edition , and , as far as our observation has gone , a complete one .

		At the same time we have from Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons a new edition of Wilde 's '' De Profundis , '' edited by Mr.
Robert Ross	PERSON	. ''

		Eloquent Sons of the South '' is a two-volume col - lection of examples of Southern oratory , from
Patrick Henry to Henry W. Grady	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volumes are small , but they seem to have required the services of three editors -- Messrs.
John Temple Graves	PERSON	,
Clark Howell	PERSON	, and
Walter Williams	PERSON	, -- and they are sent us by the
Chappie Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	. ''

		Art in
Great Britain	LOCATION	and Heland , '' by Sir
Walter Armstrong	PERSON	, is a volume in the series entitled ''
Ars	ORGANIZATION	Una : Species Mille , '' published by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		A complete general history of art is projected in this series , and a dozen or more volumes are already announced .

		The illustrations are small , but very numerous , and the comprehensiveness of this feature is the most marked characteristic of the volume .

		The
St. Louis Society of Psychology	ORGANIZATION	has undertaken the publication , by subscription , of a translation of ''
Hegel	PERSON	's
Larger Logic	ORGANIZATION	, '' as made by the late
Henry C. Bookmeyer	ORGANIZATION	.

		This will be the first complete publica - tion of the work in English , and will fill either two or three volumes , at
eight dollars	MONEY	a set .

		The manuscript has been carefully revised by Mr.
Louis J. Block	PERSON	, and a special introduction has been written by Dr.
William T. Harris	PERSON	.

		The work will contain engraved portraits of the author , the translator , and the editor .

		An interesting and valuable publication is announced by the
Dodge Publishing Company	ORGANIZATION	in a series of repro - ductions of typical examples of the leading schools of painting from the collection in the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	.

		The unique feature of this series is that the paintings selected are faithfully reproduced not only in line and composition , but in color and tone , so that the student or art-lover has before him what is practically a reduced facsimile of the original .

		The collection begins with the earliest Italian masters , coming down through the periods of
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	,
Perugino	ORGANIZATION	,
Correggio	LOCATION	, and
Titian	ORGANIZATION	, and the Flemish and German schools , to the more modern English and French painters .

		The explanatory and critical text is by such well-known authorities as
Kenedy	LOCATION	,
Brockwell	PERSON	, and
Lippmann	PERSON	.

		The series will be complete in seventeen parts , each contain - ing about thirty pages of text , with six colored plates .

		William De
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's Great Novels It Never Can Happen Again NOW READY
MR. DE MORGAN	PERSON	'S new novel is a masterpiece of construction and intimate knowledge , and in some respects a greater novel than any of his earlier ones ; its aspect is as sound , and the book is more subtle .

		The plot itself completely holds the attention ; the stage is full and the actors are many .

		The classes represented include every scale of English society brought together with extraordinary dexterity .

		There are two main themes .

		One is the love of Blind
Jim	PERSON	for his little daughter Lizarann , and here Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	is at his best -- no other living author can depict as he can the lower orders of cockney society .

		The second main theme is the account of the doings of Sir
Titus Scropp	PERSON	, novelist ,
Marianne	PERSON	his wife , and
Judith Arkroyd	PERSON	, with stage ambitions , daughter of a wealthy baronet , perhaps the most fascinating woman Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	has yet drawn .

		The book is entirely convincing -- it is Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	at his best , and will be read years hence when most of the productions of the day have been long forgotten .

		-LRB-
$ 1.75	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Joseph
Vance	PERSON	Somehow Good In this , his first novel , Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	tells a touching story , yet full of humor , of life-long love and heroic sacrifice .

		While the scene is mostly in and near the
London	LOCATION	of the fifties , there are some telling glimpses of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		-LRB-

		The book of the last decade ; the best thing in fiction since Mr.

		If the reader likes both '

		Alice = for = Short The scheme of Alice-for-short , which might paradoxically be called a genial ghost-and-murder story , is utterly different , yet humor and humanity again dominate .

		It is the story of a
London	LOCATION	waif , a friendly artist , his friends and family .

		The reap - pearance in
Nineteenth Century London	LOCATION	of the long - buried past , and a remarkable case of suspended memory , give the dramatic background .

		-LRB-

		Really worth reading and praising .

		If any writer of the present era is read a half century hence , a quarter century , or even a decade , that writer is William De Morgan . ''

		`` Why all this Popularity ? ''

		asks
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	, writing of these novels in the Outlook , and he answers , De Morgan is '' almost the perfect example of the humorist , certainly the completist since Lamb ... there is hardly a single page that is free from a smile ... Humor , how - ever , is not all .

		There must also be enough dramatic interest to hold the reader , enough fidelity to the fact in the character-drawing to persuade .

		... In the
De Morgan	ORGANIZATION	world it is hard to find an unat - tractive figure even among the less admirable ... the charm of the young women ... All brave and humorous and gay , and all trailing clouds of glory from the fairyland from which they have just come . ''

Ella Wheeler Wilcox	PERSON	, in the iVew York Journal . ''

		Quite unlike other books , and not amenable to classifica - tion , '
Taraam	PERSON	' presents a series of studies of the inner life and of psychological experience intertwined with pictures of the outer side of life , varied with pleasing descriptions of natural scenes , and all bound together with a thread of intense emotion afforded by the love of a strong , deep-natured man and a woman of equal strength of feeling .

		The author does not even give these two people names , and they pass in and out of the scenes almost as weirdly as if they were ghosts deeply colored with human passions .

		The book has a certain quiet strength combined with refinement of feeling , and is very well written .

JAMES EDWARD LeROSSIGNOL	PERSON	Six stories of a high literary quality , humorous and pathetic , drawn from the lives of the habitants of old
Quebec Province	LOCATION	-- those strong and simple people made famous by
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	and the poet

		THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPER By james edward
Rogers	PERSON	This book is an intimate study of the American newspaper , and a reply to certain severe criticisms that have recently been made .

		The author has tried as far as possible to see both sides of the question , the subject of discussion being treated as one of concrete fact , and he has therefore examined some fifteen thousand newspapers from all sections of the country as a means of getting acquainted with the necessary basis for an accurate judgment .

		The book discusses in succession the following topics : The Historical Evolution of the Modern Newspaper ;
The City	LOCATION	and the Newspaper ; The Nature of the American Newspaper ; The Influence of the
American Newspaper	ORGANIZATION	, and the Causes of that Influence .

		BIBLICAL IDEAS OF ATONEMENT : Their History and Significance By
ERNEST DeWITT BURTON	PERSON	,
JOHN MERLIN POW1S SMITH	PERSON	, and
GERALD BIRNEY	PERSON	SMITH This book sets forth the content of the biblical teachings upon the subject of Atonement , and suggests the point of view from which these conceptions may profitably be studied at the present day .

		The attitude assumed toward the records throughout is that of historical interpretation rather than of theological systematization .

		Consequently , the effort is to discover precisely what ideas of atonement are reflected by the biblical laws , institutions , and utterances .

		The authors employ the historical method throughout .

		To trace the history of an idea is to discover the forces that have co-operated to produce it and to transform it from age to age .

		The history of the idea is thus its best explanation .

		Yet as many readers will desire , not only a historical statement of what was believed and taught by the prophets and teachers of old , but also some indication of the value of those teachings for the present day , the closing section of the book -LRB- Chap , xii , xiii -RRB- is devoted to this aspect of the matter .

		Here the average in - telligent man can learn something on questions about which he inevi - tably thinks and speculates , most often mistakenly , for these ques - tions are discussed clearly and without technicalities , not by some enthusiastic and misinformed mid - dleman , but by a scientist who stands high in his profession , and whose word is not only of great interest , but great weight .

		HUMAN EQUIPMENT : ITS USE AND ABUSE -LRB- In The Art of Life Series -RRB- By
EDWARD HOWARD GRIQQS	PERSON	This new book deals with the problem , so acutely important in our money-mad society , of the right use of things -- the relation of man , both individually and collectively taken , to the tools and equipment of civilization .

		Its central thesis forms a trenchant criticism of the persistent superstition that lavish expenditure in careless luxury benefits society .

		The author shows , both by economic argument and historic example , that all use of the power money represents for what is either useless or harmful , forces some one to work harder somewhere in the social structure , and unchecked is paid for at a terrible price in the end .

		Incidentally , there is an illuminating discussion of the causes of panics -- those '' clearing-houses in which we pay our bad debts . ''

		The style is peculiarly forceful and convincing , and the book is full of wise suggestions for the conduct of life .

		It has been an interesting speculation , and , when coupled with the attempt to make a suitable selection of names deserving of academic dis - tinction , has proved almost as fascinating as the attempt to make a list of the hundred -LRB- or some other number -RRB- best books .

		Either subject is one upon which almost everybody feels quali - fied to express a judgment , and readily lends itself to popular discussion .

		Ten years ago , what we called '' the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	game '' was started first in this country , under the direction of a now long defunct literary journal , and an
American Academy	ORGANIZATION	was constituted by grace of popular vote .

		The results of this plebiscite method were about as irrational as might have been expected .

		Mr.
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	and Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	were elected to membership -LRB- much to their own astonish - ment , we may presume -RRB- , while Colonel Hig - ginson and
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	were left in the outer darkness . ''

		Mark Twain '' received more votes than Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, and
Frank Stock	ORGANIZATION	- ton more than
Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	.

		Moreover , as we pointed out at the time , the American list was entirely made up of men of letters in the narrower sense , whereas its French prototype included only nine representatives of belles-lettres in the total of forty names .

		This newspaper Academy was , of course , only a matter for jest ; but it so happened that 440 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, steps were being taken at the same time toward the organization of an academic body that should be really representative of American leadership , and not alone in the narrow field of literary achievement .

		The first step was taken in
1898	DATE	, when the
American Social Science Association	ORGANIZATION	nominated a small group of leaders to form the nucleus of a
National Institute of Arts and Letters	ORGANIZATION	.

		The men thus nominated proceeded cautiously to enlarge their membership , eventu - ally raising it to the number of two hundred and fifty , set as a limit .

		The next step was taken when the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	, thus brought into existence , set about the organization of an Academy .

		The academicians were to be mem - bers of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	, and were to be fifty in number .

		The method of selection was carefully considered , and was as follows : Seven mem - bers were chosen by vote of the Institute ; these seven elected eight others ; the resulting fifteen elected five more , and the twenty thus brought together added ten others to their number .

		By similar procedure , the membership was still further raised until the limit was closely ap - proached .

		There the matter rests ; and thus the
American Academy	ORGANIZATION	has come into existence , '' not with observation , '' but none the less the embodiment of highly significant fact .

		The best justification for the method em - ployed , and the all-sufficient excuse for the being of the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	, is found in the roll of its membership .

		The following list gives all the names up to the present date , including those of deceased members .

J. S. Sargent W. M. Sloane F. Hopkinson Smith A. H. Thayer Henry Van Dyke Elihu Vedder J. Q. A. Ward A. D. White Woodrow Wilson G. E. Woodberry	PERSON	Here are sixty-two names altogether , forty-five of them the names of living men , and the col - lective distinction of the list is deeply impressive .

		One may miss a well-known name here and there , and one may have doubts concerning the academic quality of a few of the names included ; but the membership of the Academy as a whole is clearly representative of what is best in our intellectual and artistic life .

		A third of the names , more or less , belong to belles-lettres proper ; the re - maining two-thirds represent approximately the other fields of distinction recognized by the French Academy , and the fine arts other than literature , which the
French Academy	ORGANIZATION	hardly recognizes at all .

		This account of the organization is timely be - cause , although the Academy has had an unob - trusive existence for some five years , it is to be more definitely and officially launched within the next few days .

		Following the precedent of the
American Academy of Sciences	ORGANIZATION	, incorporated in
1863	DATE	, it is about to obtain a charter by
Act of Congress	ORGANIZATION	which will emphasize its national character .

		The annual meeting required by its constitution will be held
December 13-14	DATE	, at
Washington	LOCATION	; a reception by President Taf t will be a feature of the occasion , and the papers read will be published as the first annual volume of proceedings .

		It would be futile to attempt to indicate the probable course of the activities likely to be undertaken by the new Academy .

		One natur - ally inclines to quote from
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's classical essay on '' The Literary Influence of Academies , '' and we have no doubt of the desir - ability of our possessing '' an institution owing its existence to a national bent toward the things of the mind , towards culture , towards clearness , correctness , and propriety in thinking and speak - ing , and ... which creates ... a force of educated opinion , '' an institution which will tend to maintain a '' high , correct standard in intel - lectual matters , '' which will discourage every '' orthographical antic , '' every form of '' ignor - ance and charlatanism , '' every manifestation of '' the provincial spirit . ''

		Whether our own Academy will make for these ends , and for the promotion of that '' urbanity '' which we as a people so sadly need , remains to be disclosed .

		It is at least a cause for satisfaction that such a start has been made , seemingly in the right direction .


1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 441
RICHARD WATSON GILDER	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	died on the eighteenth of
November	DATE	, at the age of sixty-five ; and American literature is the poorer by one of its most conspicuous represen - tatives .

		Born at
Bordentown	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	,
February 8 , 1844	DATE	, he was the son of a clergyman who afterwards conducted a private school on
Long Island	LOCATION	, and in this institution the boy acquired the rudiments of his education .

		Aside from this elementary instruc - tion , his education was self-acquired .

		He learned to set type when a child , and at the tender age of twelve was editor and publisher of a newspaper .

		In
1860	DATE	he joined with two other youths in the publication of a campaign newspaper in the interests of Bell and
Everett	PERSON	- In
1863	DATE	he enlisted as a pri - vate in a
Philadelphia	LOCATION	company .

		After the war , he studied law , but soon abandoned it for journalism , becoming editor of two
Newark	LOCATION	newspapers .

		In
1870	DATE	he edited u Hours at Home '' for a few months , and later in that year joined with
J. G. Holland	PERSON	in the editorship of u Scribner 's Monthly , '' then just established .

		In
1881	DATE	, when Mr.
Holland	PERSON	died , the magazine was reorganized , re-named '' The Century , '' and Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	became editor-in-chief .

		It is by this title that he has been known to the country at large for nearly thirty years .

		As a man of letters he is classified among the poets , although his prose work is by no means inconsiderable .

		His verse fills many small volumes , and is of sufficient importance to insure him a high rank among the men who fall just short of being reckoned the major poets of
America	LOCATION	.

		It is verse that lacks somewhat in sub - stance and virility , that rarely strikes the inevitable lyric note , but that appeals strongly to the cultivated intelligence by virtue of its qualities of intellectual distinction , artistic feeling , and exalted idealism .

		But Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	has been much more than a man of letters , and he is cherished as an example of the good citizen by thousands who very likely have never read a page of his poetry .

		Wherever his home might be .

		in
New York	LOCATION	or in the
Berkshires	LOCATION	or near
Buzzard	ORGANIZATION	's Bay , he always felt himself a member of a community toward which he had social obligations .

		Perhaps the most important civic work done by him was as chairman of the
New York Tenement House Commission	ORGANIZATION	; but mention must also be made of his activities in connection with civil service reform , with kindergarten and settle - ment work , and as president of the
City Club	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		He also did stout service for literature and art in his work for the
Copyright League	ORGANIZATION	, the Authors ' Club , and various art associations , local and national .

		He was one of the first members chosen for the
American Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Let - ters , of which we speak elsewhere in this issue .

		Personally , he was one of the most companionable and lovable of men , and few are privileged to enjoy such friendships as were his .

		We do not particu - larly mean by this his intimacy with public charac - ters -- of which
Grover Cleveland	PERSON	and
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	are perhaps the most conspicuous exam - ples -- but the relations which he established with countless lesser persons , who knew him well enough to know how genuine was his nature , how unfailing were his sympathies , and how absolute was his devotion to goodness and truth and beauty .

		Those who now mourn his untimely death will grieve for him more as a personal friend than as a lost public leader ; and to say this is to offer the best tribute to his memory .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's most lasting monument , with all his varied activities and achievements , will un - doubtedly be the half-hundred and more volumes of the magazine he so successfully edited from its establishment in
1881	DATE	to the day of his death .

		If there are such persons as `` born editors , '' he was one .

		He had taste , industry , literary instincts , and many practical qualities not easy to define but indis - pensable to the successful purveyor of literary wares .

		He had a keen sense of values , and was ever on the alert to secure the worthiest and best -LRB- mean - ing the best for his purposes -RRB- in the literary market A reported utterance of his concerning the chances of a young and unknown writer with the editors of leading periodicals is of interest .

		u The new writer , '' he asserted , '' has every chance .

		The competition for good matter is too great to allow an editor to pass over any manuscript without consideration .

		The hope of every editor is that he may be able to secure some new light in the literary sky .

		He is so anxious to do this that he often exaggerates the discovery of some slight talent He is always discovering that he has made mistakes in the past , and I have said that an editor 's hell is paved with the manuscripts which he has rejected , but which he wishes he bad accepted .

		He has turned them down only to find that some other editor has discovered genius in them .

		The result is that he is afraid he may miss finding the spark of genius in the new manuscripts before him , and he often gives the new writers too much chance . ''

		There is , undoubtedly , truth in this ; yet we fancy Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	, if pressed , would have testified that his editorial remorse was less frequently called out by the things he had turned down and wished he had accepted than by the things he had accepted and wished he had turned down .

		It was
George William Curtis	PERSON	, we believe , who said that an editor was nearly always right in declining a manuscript The late Dr.
William T. Harris	PERSON	, who died last month at the age of seventy-four , fell just short of being a philosopher or a poet beeause he chose to be an educator -- or was turned into the pedagogic path by the fate that seems so inexorably to decide for us what we shall do and be .

		Born in
Connecticut	LOCATION	and educated at
Phillips Academy	ORGANIZATION	,
Andover	LOCATION	, and at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, he won his laurels as educator at
St. Louis	LOCATION	, 442 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, whose public school system he planned and directed with distinguished success .

		His twenty years ' ser - vice as
U. S. Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	increased his fame , and meantime his writings and lectures on philosophy and literature , as well as on education , brought him recognition as a thorough scholar and a profound thinker .

		Not the least of his titles to re - nown was his mastery of the Hegelian philosophy , of which he became noted as the leading exponent in this country .

		He founded the Philosophic Society of
St. Louis	LOCATION	, was prominent in the
Concord School of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	, and started the `` Journal of Specula - tive Philosophy . ''

		Noteworthy among his published works is `` The Spiritual Sense of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's Divine Comedy . ''

		Since
1900	DATE	he had been the editor-in - chief of
Webster	PERSON	's Dictionary , whose recent re-issue in much enlarged and improved form as '' The New International , '' shows unmistakably the touches of his master-hand -- most conspicuously , perhaps , in the novel two-story page with its object-lesson in dif - ferentiation and judicious subordination .

		The end crowns the work , and , in this instance , the work crowns the end of Dr.
Harris	PERSON	's useful life .

		The Augustan age of juvenile literature will always be the age of our childhood .

		No subse - quent period has equalled it ; no future era will be comparable with it .

		A correspondent of a
New York	LOCATION	newspaper , referring to the late sixties of the nineteenth century , makes the assertion -LRB- amazing to those of us who chanced to be born in that golden age -RRB- that '' there were few children 's books then , and most of them were of little account . ''

		What a mistake !

		There were the absurdly delightful '' Rollo Books '' -- absurdly delightful , because written in that didactic , condescending tone that ought to have repelled -- and the ever-enchanting fairy tales of the
Grimm	PERSON	brothers , and the splendid `` Arabian Nights '' -LRB- in wisely abridged form -RRB- , and ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, '' and '' The Swiss Family
Robinson	PERSON	, '' and Miss Edge - worth 's stories for children -- some of them not half - bad reading , forty years ago -- and a goodly num - ber of other books that , either by design or accident , made a strong appeal to wide-eyed youth .

		Later generations of children have sung the praises of Henty and
Fenn	PERSON	and the long-winded writer of the ''
Elsie Books	PERSON	, '' and more besides ; but they are de - cidedly not the gods of our childhood .

		The poly - chromatic series of fairy books of Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's manufacture may get themselves read , perhaps even with rapturous delight , by children who had not the good fortune to be born forty years ago ; but not all the colors of the rainbow will give his volumes the charm -LRB- for us -RRB- of the immortal Grimm stories .

		Books that must re read in childhood , or the chance of enjoying them to the full will be for - ever lost , are unfortunately withheld from thousands of our hungry-souled , wide-eyed little ones , by rea - son of poverty or parental unwisdom or some cul - pable neglect from some quarter .

		Who that has read and re-read in infancy the delightful fairy stories of the
Grimm	PERSON	brothers can doubt that his whole after-life was made richer and more significant than if these delightfully real and at the same time marvellous tales had been kept from him until he had reached years of so-called discretion ?

		The Lincoln -LRB-
Nebraska	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library is doing good work in guarding , so far as may be , the children of that city from the calamity here indicated .

		`` We all realize , '' writes the librarian in her latest Report , '' that children are losing much pleasure and missing things that will be a source of regret to them all their lives if certain books are not read . ''

		-LRB- The meaning here is better than the syntax . -RRB- ''

		The city superintendent of schools appointed a committee composed of three high-school teachers of English , three grade principals and the librarian to select a list of books that would be required reading for the seventh and eighth grades .

		These books were not to be books for information and instruction , but they were to instill a love of good literature and be valu - able from the cultural side . ''

		An excellent move ; but how much better it would be if the home and the parents could in every instance do what the library and the librarian and school-teachers are seeking to effect !

		o • • • Writing down to the reader 's level is pretty sure to be resented by the reader , and by children not less than by their elders .

		In one of the books of the present season -- Dr.
George Hodges	PERSON	's '' Garden of Eden '' -- the unfortunate attempt has again been made to re-tell some of the grand old Bible stories in language supposed to suit young readers .

		Charm and mystery and poetic truth are thus ruthlessly made to give place to flat incredibility and tiresome absurdity .

		The fact that the
King James	ORGANIZATION	version of the
Bible	LOCATION	is in English such as was never spoken in everyday life is nothing against it as a work of literature .

		Homer 's wonderful epics , with all their naturalness and directness of appeal , are written in Greek such as was never used by any branch of the
Hellenic	ORGANIZATION	race -- as Professor
Mahaffy	PERSON	reminded us a year ago in his
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	lectures .

		Dr.
Hodges	PERSON	must be able to recall , as so many of us can , the nameless charm and the unap - proachable majesty of the Old Testament language as it falls on young and but half-understanding ears .

		Nor does the child wish to understand wholly ; some margin must be left for the imagination .

		The poetry of the
Bible	LOCATION	, and in fact all poetry , appeals to chil - dren largely through the mere sound of the words -- their rhythm and stateliness and their unusualness .

		Common language and words of one syllable the child can have in abundance without seeking them in poetry and romance .

		The public library and the grateful farmer is the theme of an editorial note in a recent issue of '' New York Libraries , '' a monthly journal just entering on its second year of intelligent service .

		A wealthy farmer living in the neighbor -
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 443 hood of a small city library had been disposed to look upon this purveyor of literature as a superfluity and a passing fad .

		But in a moment of sore per - plexity and pressing need , when one of his valuable cows was sick and likely to die , the scornful farmer humbled his pride and sought counsel of the libra - rian , if perchance the latter might know of some book in his collection treating of bovine ailments and prescribing a remedy for such cases as the one in question .

		Surely enough , the desired work on vet - erinary science was soon forthcoming ; its advice was followed , and the cow 's life was saved .

		The farmer was properly grateful , and when , soon after - ward , he fell sick , and , despite his nearness to the library , failed to find a cure for his disease , it was discovered , at the opening of his last will and testa - ment , that he had left
seventy-five thousand dollars	MONEY	to the institution that had saved his cow 's life .

		As a fitting sequel to this true story , the editor makes room for a list of about seventy of the best books on agriculture now available for public libraries , a list selected by Professor Tuck of the
State Agricultural College	ORGANIZATION	at
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	, and undoubtedly trustworthy and valuable .

		... Political oratory as literature does not appeal to most readers with irrisistible attraction .

		Patrons of public libraries , especially where the open-shelf system prevails , must have noticed how seldom the volumes of even
Burke	PERSON	's and
Webster	PERSON	's speeches are missing from their places .

		And when we come to contemporary statesmen , the call for their public utterances , printed and bound , is even less clamorous .

		Some of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's addresses , nota - bly his
Gettysburg	LOCATION	oration -LRB- which is not an example of political oratory at all -RRB- , make excellent reading , and are read to some extent ; but the ordinary effec - tive harangue , however witty and telling it may have sounded to its hearers , proves to be woefully un - stimulating when read in cold print .

		The eye is not caught by the same tricks that captivate the ear .

		Nevertheless , the publishers of Mr.
Winston Spencer Churchill	PERSON	,
M. P.	PERSON	, are planning an issue of some of that brilliant parliamentarian 's speeches , and the volume is likely to contain many clever thoughts cleverly expressed ; for this gifted son of a talented American mother -LRB- and of a distinguished English father -RRB- has the art of expressing himself both pun - gently and picturesquely .

		But the ordinary reader gets all the printed politics he wishes from his daily newspaper .

		... Library activity in the
Blue-Grass State	ORGANIZATION	is displaying new energy , and the hope is cherished there that before long a library commission will be established and that there will be a rapid increase to the now scanty number of free public libraries .

		It is almost twenty years since the first library com - mission was appointed , in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		The country at large soon B caught on '' to the idea , and since
1890	DATE	thirty-two other states have followed the good example .

		Of these , no fewer than eight are in the South , and within the present year as many as five of our commonwealths -- namely ,
North Carolina	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	,
Texas	LOCATION	,
Utah	LOCATION	, and
Illinois	LOCATION	-- have fallen into line with the enlightened and pro- gressive majority .

		At a late meeting of the
Ken	PERSON	- tucky
Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	Mr.
William F. Yust	PERSON	, librarian of the
Louisville Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and president of the
Kentucky Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, gave an address on ' ; What a
Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	will do for
Kentucky	LOCATION	. ''

		This address , now printed -LRB- and , we infer , obtainable of Mr.
Yust	PERSON	-RRB- narrates the progress of the library commission movement , and tells what those interested are doing and hope to do for
Kentucky	LOCATION	.

		The market value of Meredith manu - scripts is indicated by the recent sale of three of them to Mr.
J. P. Morgan	PERSON	.

		The autograph manu - scripts of ''
Diana	PERSON	of the Crossways , '' ''
Lord Ormont	PERSON	and his Aminta , '' and '' An Amazing Mar - riage '' were secured by Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	for eight hundred pounds -- not a remarkably high price compared with that commanded by the manuscripts of several of his predecessors in English fiction .

		A
Dickens	PERSON	or
Thackeray	PERSON	or Scott autograph novel would easily bring much more than one of Mere - dith 's .

		It was a curious whim of this author to leave these literary treasures to an old servant , who can hardly have known their value in the market , nor have cherished them for their literary excel - lence .

		But he lost little time in converting the bequest into cash , and one can only hope that the middle - man did not get the lion 's share of the shekels .

		What a blessing for this ancient retainer that his master did not use a typewriter !

		Sad will be the lot of autograph-hunters when this machine shall have entirely driven out the pen .

		The humbug of de luxe editions has seldom been carried to such monstrous absurdity as in a recent instance that has caused some stir in the book-world of
New York	LOCATION	.

		A certain resident of that city , more opulent than wise , was persuaded to subscribe to a luxurious issue of the works of a certain book-writing ex-president of the
United States	LOCATION	, and was to pay
sixty-six hundred dollars	MONEY	for the magnificently-bound set of volumes .

		But whether the gilt and the tooling were not lavish enough , or whether the reading matter proved dis - appointing , the fat-pursed and fat-witted subscriber demurred at the size of the bill and sought relief in the courts .

		The only comfort , however , that he derived from that source took the form of a rather caustic observation from the judge to the effect that anyone who would pay such a price for the books of even the author in question must be an incom - petent ... •
Washington	LOCATION	Irving 's escape from law to literature forms the subject of a very interesting note by Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, printed in the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post . ''

		After
Irving	PERSON	's service as Minister to
Spain	LOCATION	, he returned to
New York	LOCATION	, and , discouraged about his prospects of literary success , 444 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, arranged to have a desk in the law-office of his brother ,
John Treat Irving	ORGANIZATION	.

		One morning he '' came into his brother 's office actually dancing with glee . '

		Brother John / he said , ' here is a fool of a publisher willing to pay me a thousand dollars a year for doing nothing .

		I shall not bother myself further with the troubles of the law ; ' and ... in his satisfaction he actually kicked over his desk . ''

		The '' fool of a publisher '' was Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's father ; and the bargain he made with Irving proved highly advantageous to both parties .

		The house of
Putnam	LOCATION	has rendered distinguished service to the cause of letters , but seldom a greater one than in recalling Irving from the uncongenial pursuit of the law , and saving him to literature .

		FROM LIT ERAR Y
LONDON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of The Dial . -RRB-

		We are now in the very height of the
London	LOCATION	publishing season , and I am sorry to say that so far not a single vital book has been added to our liter - ature .

		The book of the moment is Sir
Ernest Shackleton	PERSON	's work , `` The Heart of the Antarctic , '' which is being distributed simultaneously in every country in the world .

		One great
London	LOCATION	store , -- and that an American one , for it is owned by Mr.
Selfridge	PERSON	, -- has devoted a window to a display of this work , and has draped piles of the volumes with flags in a manner that can not fail to attract notice .

		The two huge volumes will doubtless have a good vogue among those who are interested in
Polar Exploration	ORGANIZATION	.

		Meanwhile extensive negotiations have been going on over Commander
Peary	PERSON	's book .

		Rival publishers have not shown any great eagerness to pay the large sum demanded , the fact being that the unfortunate controversy between Commander
Peary	PERSON	and Dr.
Cook	PERSON	has , it is felt , minimized the selling quality of Commander
Peary	PERSON	's book , which would otherwise have received an enormous ovation here .

		The books that are most conspicuous in the ordi - nary bookshops in
London	LOCATION	at this moment are what are known as color-books .

		The invention of the three-colored process of printing , and its develop - ment by Mr.
Carl Hentschel	PERSON	, have been responsible for the existence of a wonderful array of these pro- ductions .

		They have usually been books descriptive of countries or of cities , such as
Venice	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		I have received four such books on
Venice	LOCATION	and five on
Rome	LOCATION	, for example ; and a fifth , entitled '' The Color of
Rome	LOCATION	, '' has just reached me .

		But the business of producing illustrated guide-books in color seems to be rather overdone , in spite of the fact that the demand has been great and the sales very remunerative .

		The color-books of the season are now mainly in the realm of imagination .

		Mr.
Arthur Rackham	PERSON	, the most popular of our illustra - tors in color , this year has five books , of which the most beautiful in my eyes is his edition of ''
Grimm	PERSON	's Fairy Tales , '' published here by the Constables ; although much is to be said for a translation , by that accomplished journalist Mr.
W. L. Courtney	PERSON	, of Motte-Fouque '' s '' Undine . ''

		There are many other books illustrated in color ; for example , there are no less than four color books of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Plays , issued on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	by the firm of
Hodder & Stoughton	ORGANIZATION	, which has now started an American business , as your advertisement col - umns testify .

		Booksellers tell me that this firm 's edition of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's Rubaiyat of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	, with illustrations by
Edmund Dulac	PERSON	, is selling here the best of all their books .

		Apart from such works , a walk through half a dozen
London	LOCATION	bookshops during this month of
November	DATE	conveys no definite impression of literary activity .

		The
Omar Khayyam Club	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	has just had its fiftieth dinner .

		The Club was started seventeen years ago , by a few friends .

		It limited its members to fifty-nine , in consideration of the fact that
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	published his great poem in the year
1859	DATE	.

		Now its membership is completed , and it has kept up its meetings with amazing vitality .

		Its guests , from year to year , have included nearly all the most eminent men of the day .

		The present Prime Minister of
England	LOCATION	, and the late Mr.
John Hay	PERSON	, your Ambassador to St. James , have been among the guests .

		A new list of its members has just been circulated , and this indicates that all our leading writers have retained their membership .

		At our
November	DATE	meeting , Mr.
Gilbert K. Chesterton	PERSON	was one of the wittiest of the speakers .

		In speak - ing of the interest which the
Club	ORGANIZATION	appropriately took in wine , he told us that one of his nonconformist friends had assured him that when Christ turned water into wine at a marriage feast it was into a non-alcoholic beverage . ''

		I can not imagine , '' said Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, '' any such wilful waste of divine power . ''

		We often hear complaints on this side against the American copyright law .

		It has not given English authors all that they hoped for , yet I had a concrete example furnished to me the other day of what it had done in a branch of literature not usually very remunerative -- biography .

		Few more interesting series of books have been published in my time than
Macmillan	PERSON	's '' English Men of Letters . ''

		The first series , it will be remembered , was edited by Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	, now
Lord Morley of Blackburn	ORGANIZATION	.

		It included biographies of great writers of the past by some of the great writers of the Victorian era .

		After along interval of years , the firm of
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	issued a '' New Series '' of the '' English Men of Letters , '' but without
Lord Morley	ORGANIZATION	's name as editor .

		It is no disparagement of the talent of these younger writers to say that they lack the scholarship and in many cases the fine qualities of style of their prede - cessors .

		Yet , curiously enough , they received , I am told , exactly double the amount for their work ; and of this , fifty per cent was due to American copyright , the advantages of which came to us in the interval between the two series .


1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 445 How much the English public really loves a lord , in spite of the attack upon the
House of Peers	ORGANIZATION	that is now absorbing our attention , may be instanced by the treatment of our English newspapers of Lord
Rosebery	PERSON	.

		Considered impartially ,
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	is a man of but very moderate talent .

		His brief occupancy of the position of Prime Minister of
England	LOCATION	was a great fiasco .

		As a writer of books , he has not the slightest importance .

		His '' Napoleon : The Last Phase '' was by no means a brilliant sum - mary of the events it recorded .

		The other day he gave a lecture at
Lichfield	LOCATION	upon Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, in which he said the wrong thing at every turn .

		He declared , for example , that
Johnson	PERSON	was a typical John Bull ; and he spoke contemptuously of '' Ras - selas . ''

		Now we all know that
Johnson	PERSON	was not a typical
John Bull	PERSON	, and that '' Rasselas '' is an English classic .

		Yet such is the curious sycophancy of English journalism that our newspapers take Lord
Rosebery	PERSON	seriously at every turn ; they praise his dull books , and quote his utterances as if they were semi-inspired .

		The other day they were full of the fact that he had been down Fleet Street visiting the haunts of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	.

		Now there would be no harm whatever in his lordship paying a visit to Fleet Street , quite privately , but it was a pity that he should have taken two or three newspaper acquaint - ances with him .

		The result was , it was told all over the world the next morning that Lord
Rosebery	PERSON	had dined at the ``
Cheshire	LOCATION	Cheese , '' in `` Wine Office Court , Fleet Street ; and thus one more lift is given to a fiction already too popular , especially with American visitors to
London	LOCATION	.

		There is not the slightest evidence that Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	was ever in the ''
Cheshire Cheese	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		They will there show you his portrait , and a seat with a brass plate telling you that here he sat ; but the ''
Cheshire	LOCATION	Cheese '' is not once mentioned in
Boswell 's Life of Johnson	ORGANIZATION	, and there is no good reason why
Johnson	PERSON	should have visited it any more than fifty other taverns that were in these regions in his day .

		Johnson , like most men , had his favorite taverns ; and although I should be happy to believe that the ''
Cheshire	LOCATION	Cheese '' was one of them , I decline to do so upon the one existing scrap of evidence .

		This piece of evidence is that of old
Silas Redding	PERSON	, who fifty years ago declared , when a garrulous old man , that he had been informed that
Johnson	PERSON	was in the habit of fre - quenting this tavern .


Johnson	PERSON	's one extant house , in
Gough Square	LOCATION	, Fleet Street , is now used as a type - foundry .

		Its frontage is very much what it was in
Johnson	PERSON	's day .

		It would be a fine thing if some rich man would buy this house and present it to the British nation .

		It would be excellent to have a
Johnson Museum	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	, in this centre .

		But as far as I am concerned , I am more interested in the project of a Johnson statue for
London	LOCATION	.

		I want it to be of colossal and imposing proportions , and I want it to stand looking up Fleet Street , although this would involve having its back to the church in which
Johnson	PERSON	worshipped for many years .

		In that church of St.
Clement Danes	PERSON	, they still show you the pew in a gallery which the great man was wont to occupy .

		Some day , if ever I have the leisure , I propose to get together a strong committee , of names that will command respect , and set to work to collect no less than
# 3,000	MONEY	, in order to be able to commission this statue .

		Some of my friends in
America	LOCATION	may begin at once to save up their dollars for this meritorious ^

		SPELLING REFORM AND SCHOLARSHIP .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		I should be much troubled if Professor
Matthews	PERSON	really thought , as intimated in his communication in your last issue , that I misrepresented Professor
Louns	PERSON	- bury .

		The spelling reform has always been a sort of '' merry war . ''

		My mild jests at the '' death rattle '' and the '' epicedium '' of the movement may pair off with the '' acanthology '' of jibes at the ignorance of his opponents which I collected from Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's pages , and which he doubtless would not wish us to take too seriously .

		It is true , however , that whatever satis - faction Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	may profess at the progress already accomplished , the general tone of his book is that of a prophet denouncing a perverse generation which will not receive the gospel .

		This was obviously all that my banter meant .

		I am confident that Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	believes that I had not the slightest intention of sneering at his scholarship , which is not questioned , and is not confined to the history of English spelling .

		But his argument seemed to claim for that special form of scholarship the same kind of peremptory authority in this matter that we concede to a chemist or a geologist in their special - ties .

		And my rejoinder was , and is , that the cases are not parallel .

		Spelling reform is not and can not be made a matter of pure science , still less of historical English philology , especially when its advocates admit that they do not hope for a thoroughgoing and scientific reform .

		It involves many nice questions of taste , literary feeling , psychology of education , and practical consequences , in the decision of which the judgments of all thoughtful men , whatever their specialties , are entitled to consider - ation -- even the opinions of those pariahs , the teachers of dead languages .

		An acquaintance with the past vagaries of English orthography is a formidable contro - versial weapon against opponents who are naive enough to suppose that it has never varied .

		Professor
Louns	PERSON	- bury uses it with great skill .

		But it does not justify him in assuming the tone of an expert in mathematics or physics addressing himself to laymen .

		The advisa - bility of now confusing the virtually established practice of a generation , not to say a century , is not proved by descriptions of the confusion that reigned in the past .

		Many things were done in the past that would not be considered good precedents now .

		The necessity for knowing the detail of the past history of a question de - pends on the logical connection of past and present in the given case .

		In this case it is very slight .

		RECOLLECTIONS OF A NONAGENARIAN .

		* Anyone who can look back over three-quarters of a century has the satisfaction of knowing that he has witnessed in that time more signal achieve - ments in the arts and sciences , and in human progress generally , than have been effected in all the centuries of history before his birth .

		Mr.
John Bigelow	PERSON	, who has just completed his ninety - second year , may well consider his reminiscences sufficiently memorable to deserve publication .

		In three ample volumes , of nearly
2000	DATE	pages , he gives to the world his . ''

		Retrospections of an Active Life , '' from infancy to his retirement , in
1867	DATE	, from the diplomatic service , with a half-promise to continue the narrative down to the present time if life and strength are spared him .

		We owe it to one of Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's daughters that the '' Retrospections '' were made to include the writer 's memories of his boyhood , memories which she had written down from dictation for the benefit of her own child , but which seemed to their author unworthy of a wider reading .

		But he acknowledges that his recollection of those very early incidents is fuller and clearer than of many subsequent and far more import - ant events ; and certain it is that he has revived those distant days with so much of realism , and even of romance , that the earlier chapters of his book far excell , in interest for the general reader , the subsequent pages with their faithful record of public and political affairs that have long since ceased to be of the nature of burning issues , and can strongly appeal to those only whose mem - ories or whose chosen studies invest the facts with a living significance .


Bristol	LOCATION	, now Maiden , or Malden-on-Hudson , in
Ulster County	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, was Mr.
Bigelows	PERSON	birthplace , and there he received what he felt to be the best part of his education .

		Twice he went away to school , and afterward studied at
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- then
Washington	LOCATION	College -RRB- ,
Hartford	LOCATION	, and at
Union College	ORGANIZATION	,
Schenectady	LOCATION	, where he took his bachelor 's degree ; but the little coun - try school at home was , he says , the only edu - cational institution where he was '' conscious of receiving any thorough or conscientious in - struction '' from his teachers .

		knows , not high .

		Of the home influences at
Bristol	LOCATION	we learn considerable .

		A capable , sen - sible mother , and a father who successfully con - ducted ship-building and farming at the same time , and was known as '' a good provider , '' reared their children in accordance with early
New England	LOCATION	principles .

		In the following pas - sage the author touches on the religious side of this upbringing : `` I have said that my parents were Presbyterians .

		They were more than that : they were
New England Presbyterians	ORGANIZATION	.

		They were more than that : they were Connecticut Presbyterians , and they meant to be just as good as a
Connecticut	LOCATION	Presbyterian can be .

		They were very strict about keeping the Sabbath .

		They ordinarily commenced their Sabbath
Saturday	DATE
afternoon	TIME	, and not infrequently tried to make us remember that the Sabbath had commenced before our half-holiday had expired .

		They were not ascetical at all ; on the con - trary , they were always cheerful and sensible .

		They had , however , been brought up to distrust the influence of worldly pleasures and to estimate the moral efficacy of self-denial at a much higher figure than their own -- or anybody else 's -- children ever did . ''

		The book makes it clear that
Connecticut	LOCATION	Presbyterianism did not long meet the spiritual demands or answer the insistent queries of this child .

		Of his secular education it has already been said that formal instruction constituted no great part of it .

		The libraries , poor enough though they were , of the two colleges he attended , furnished him far more of intellectual food and stimulus than did the class-room exercises , and he seems always to have been a voracious and retentive reader .

		After graduation from
Union College	ORGANIZATION	at eighteen , he chose the law for his pro- fession , and obtained his legal training chiefly in a
New York	LOCATION	office , there being no law schools in those days .

		But the lure of literature -- more immediately , of journalism -- turned him aside from a promising practice in
1849	DATE	, and he became part owner and joint editor , with the poet
Bryant	PERSON	, of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post . ''

		Bryant 's influence on the young journalist may be judged from the following : '' In looking back upon my past life , I have been fre - quently impressed with a sense of my obligations to the superior standards by which I had from time to time the privilege of gauging my conduct .

		For full twenty years after my daily intercourse with Mr.
Bryant	PERSON	ter - minated by my retirement from the
Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	and absence from the country , I would find myself fre - quently testing things I had done or proposed to do by asking myself , How would Mr.
Bryant	PERSON	act under similar circumstances ?

		I rarely applied this test without re - ceiving a clear and satisfactory answer .

		The influence which Mr.
Bryant	PERSON	exerted over me by his example -- he never gave advice -- satisfies me that everyone undervalues the importance of his own example .

		In ordering our own ' lives , we are unconsciously ordering
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 447 the lives of everybody else ; for a wave of influence once projected by us never sleeps even when it has washed every shore . ''

		Memories of our great statesmen of the early and middle nineteenth century are scattered through Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's volumes .

		Webster he heard speak in
1837	DATE	on the condition of the country : and he recalls the orator 's presence of mind in calming an incipient panic in the crowded hall by raising his hand to invoke quiet and assuring the audience that nothing had broken but their own patience and the thread of his argument .

		John
Quincy Adams	PERSON	was invited by the
New York Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	to deliver an address in celebration of the jubilee of
Washington	LOCATION	's first inauguration , and his dis - course , occupying two hours , is regarded by Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	as `` the most impressive speech '' he ever heard .

		It was the matter , not the manner , of this scholarly effort that won the hearer 's favor ; for
Adams	PERSON	lacked the eloquence of
Webster	PERSON	,
Everett	LOCATION	, and other noted speakers of his time .

		Xaturally enough , there is a good deal of political history and reflection mingled with these reminiscences of famous statesmen and the times in which they lived .

		Always independent in his politics , Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	was a Democrat in early life , of the M Barnburner , '' not the '' Hunker , '' variety ; he took an active part in the election of
Silas Wright	PERSON	to the gov - ernorship of
New York	LOCATION	, and was appointed by him an inspector of Sing Sing Prison , where he helped to effect some much-needed reforms .

		He joined the Free-Soil movement , worked for
Fremont	LOCATION	's election to the presidency , and even wrote a campaign life of that unsuccessful can - didate .

		In the autumn of 1858 Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	went with his family to
Europe	LOCATION	for a nineteen-months sojourn , and he devotes a long and most inter - esting chapter to what he did and saw and heard in
France	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	.

		His deliberately-formed opinion of
Gladstone	LOCATION	, as recorded in his diary , is noteworthy . ''

		I think it will be found that Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's power , like the late
Daniel Webster	PERSON	's , consists more in his skill in using material than in his ability to provide it ; that he is a manufacturer rather than a producer , and his wonderful faculty of clothing and adorning an idea or doctrine that has been put into his hands has tempted him to the publication of a great deal of learned non - sense , which would never have seen the light if he had anything like the same capacity for discovering truths that he has for propagating them when discovered ... But as a member of the Government he has been brought into contact with and partially into a state of dependence upon the Liberal party , who are counselled by two or three of the most ingenious and philosophic politicians in
England	LOCATION	.

		They supply him with ideas , and he is fascinated by the scope afforded his resources for their development and propagation . ''

		Soon after returning from
Europe	LOCATION	, Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	severed his connection with the '' Even - ing Post '' in order to devote himself to literary pursuits more attractive to him than journalism .

		The immediate project on which he had fixed his mind was a biography of
Fenelon	LOCATION	; but more urgent claims appear to have engrossed his attention , and the book on the Archbishop of Cambray remained unwritten .

		The appoint - ment as Consul-General at
Paris	LOCATION	, followed in three years by promotion to a higher office in the same capital -- that of Minister to
France	LOCATION	-- together with the distractions of the Civil War , may well have upset any prearranged plans .

		Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's eminent service to his country in defeating the Confederate scheme for having a navy built in
France	LOCATION	, with the French Em - peror 's sanction or connivance , has long been a matter of history , and the full account of the affair may be read in his book , ''
France	LOCATION	and the
Confederate Navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		* ' That our country had at
Paris	LOCATION	, in that critical time , so loyal , so alert , and so thoroughly capable a man to guard its interests , was indeed fortunate .

		The '' Retrospections , '' as they proceed , give place more and more to the author 's wide and highly interesting correspondence with public men of distinction -- that is , to their letters , only a few of Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's being printed .

		Especially full and frequent are the letters from
Charles Sumner	PERSON	, an intimate and valued friend .

		One trait of Sumner 's , a very human weakness , the author takes occasion to note . ''

		Sumner can not bear to have anyone talk as though anything could be found in books about literature and literary men that he did not know .

		I have seen him snap up poor
Bemis	ORGANIZATION	, one of his satellites , and Mr.
Lyman	PERSON	also , in a most ferocious way , for attempting to quote a book to him , as if he did not know it already .

		Indeed , such are the only occasions in my long acquaint - ance with him when he has ever appeared unamiable .

		But he was then an invalid of a kind that excuses everything . ''

		Of Lincoln , whom the author warmly ad - mired and energetically supported , he thus records his impressions : '' He seemed to me , nor was it in the least strange that he did , like a man utterly unconscious of the space which the President of the L'nited States occupied that day in the history of the human race , and of the vast power for the exercise of which he had become personally responsible .

		This impression was strengthened by Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's modest habit of disclaiming knowledge of affairs and familiarity with duties , and frequent avowals of ignorance , which , even where it exists , it is well for 448 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, a captain as far as possible to conceal from the public .

		... Lincoln 's greatness must be sought for in the con - stituents of his moral nature .

		He was so modest by nature that he was perfectly content to walk behind any man who wished to walk before him .

		I do not know that history has made a record of the attainment of any corresponding eminence by any other man who so habit - ually , so constitutionally , did to others as he would have them do to him .

		...
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	hardly endured more indignities and buffetings without complaint . ''

		Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's almost life-long intimacy with
Tilden	PERSON	, whose literary and financial executor he finally became , his activity in establishing the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	on its broad-based
Astor	PERSON	,
Lenox	LOCATION	, and
Tilden	PERSON	foundations , his mani - fold public services rendered and numerous offices held , his literary work , and many other matters , must be left to the book itself , and to its hoped-for sequel , to disclose .

		If a fault is prominent in his work , it lies in his too modest suppression of himself in favor of his many illustrious correspondents .

		More of his own way of looking at things , and less of his friends ' epistolary account of them , would have been welcome .

		He even carries this complaisance so far in one place as to devote forty pages of fine print to a translation of Montalembert 's essay on '' The Triumph of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, '' and the three volumes together contain far less of his own writing than of his friends ' .

		The result , in the bulk and cost of the work , is not eminently sat - isfactory .

		Of the author 's easy and unstudied literary style , little need here be said .

		Its easi - ness is perhaps sometimes carried a bit too far in that familiar form of expression known to rhe - toricians as '' construction according to sense . ''

		In so voluminous a work misprints and slips of the pen are to be expected , and are found .

		One curious error , if it be an error , puzzles the reader .

		Describing a ball at
Buckingham Palace	ORGANIZATION	, the author writes , or the printer prints : '' I had the satisfaction of seeing
Lord Lytton	LOCATION	and Disraeli among the onlookers -- the only well of literary eminence present that I recognized . ''

		Is this a veiled and far-fetched allusion to
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's `` well of English undefyled , '' or is it only a misprint of well for men f In another place , where the famous marbles collected by the
Marquis of Campana	ORGANIZATION	are under discussion , the Italian word marchese is repeatedly used as equivalent to marchioness , and vice versa .

		The many por - traits and other illustrations in the book pleas - antly arrest the reader 's attention , and in general -LRB- barring the almost unavoidable minimum of minor blemishes -RRB- the work is a credit to all con - cerned in its production .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		Farthest South .

		* When the future historian writes his account of Arctic and Antarctic explorations , he will put down the year
1909	DATE	as the annus mirabilis .

		He will record the discovery of the
North Pole	LOCATION	and of the
South Magnetic Pole	LOCATION	; he will recount how the finding of the
South Pole	LOCATION	dwindled to a paltry tantalizing century of miles ; and if the Charcot Expedition , which has been in the South Polar regions for two years , and from which some news is daily expected , is successful , he will end his chapter by telling how the two great white spots on the globe , which for over a century have lured explorers to victory or to death , have been placed , like
Keats	PERSON	's scientific rainbow , in the dull catalogue of common things .

		And , not least in his history of this wonderful year of Polar research and discovery , he will place the account of the British Antarctic Expedition led by Lieutenant
Ernest H. Shackleton	PERSON	.

		Though Lieutenant
Shackleton	PERSON	did not reach the coveted spot , he came within a hundred miles of it , and his party has the honor of having located the
South Magnetic Pole	LOCATION	.

		To that list of worthies who since
1773	DATE	have been sailing farther and farther south in search of the ultimate degree , Captain
James Cook	PERSON	, von Bellingshausen , Wed - dell ,
Balleny	LOCATION	,
Wilkes	PERSON	,
Ross	PERSON	, and Borchgrevink , -- must be added the name of the persistent young Englishman who has furthered our knowl - edge about the vast waste places beyond the
Southern Cross	ORGANIZATION	, and has pushed human endur - ance to the uttermost that his end might be attained .

		Lieutenant
Shackleton	PERSON	's two massive volumes entitled `` The Heart of the Antarctic '' are conveniently divided .

		The first volume relates the story of the expedition ; the second records the various scientific data gathered by the ex - plorers .

		These data , narrating what was done in the domains of geology , biology , magnetism , meteorology , and physics , will have but little interest for the reader who is more concerned with the manner of getting the material than he is with the matter itself .

		Of the manner -- the heroic efforts and the almost Promethean suf - fering of the men who made the remarkable journey -- the first volume is sufficient for the most greedy lover of a tale of daring-do .

1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 449 author is one of those venturesome spirits who , called by a keen thirst for scientific knowledge , by a love of adventure , and by the '' lure of little voices , '' is fitted by nature to seek '' the mysterious fascination of the unknown . ''

		More - over , Lieutenant
Shackleton	PERSON	has known these alluring regions since
1901	DATE	, when he accom - panied Lieutenant Scott on the notable '' Dis - covery '' expedition .

		Unfortunately , however , the author was invalided before the mission was ended ; but his experience awakened in him a keen desire to outdo the efforts of his comman - der and to lead his own party into the land beyond the limits of the Great Ice Barrier plain .

		His story of his effort is peculiarly his own .

		Though the account of the final dash for the
South Pole	LOCATION	makes up but a bare fourth part of the book , it is impressive in its very roughness , for the author wrote it daily under almost inconceivable conditions , and publishes it without rubbing off a particle of the '' rust that rather adorns and preserves '' the original story .

		Much of the first volume recounts the prepar - ations made for the undertaking .

		These seem - ingly minor details make for a general interest in reading the book , for the reader soon sees that even the slightest oversight may mar the work of months or undermine the outcome of the general result .

		When the reader is finally launched on the '' Nimrod , '' however , and is in winter quarters at
McMurdo Sound	LOCATION	, he finds himself in the heart of the book .

		Here , in
1908	DATE	, one division of the party ascended the volcanic
Mount Erebus	LOCATION	and surveyed its various craters . ''

		In the
spring	DATE	and
summer of 1908-9	DATE	three sledging - parties left winter quarters ; one went south and attained the most southerly latitude ever reached by man , another reached the
South Magnetic Pole	LOCATION	for the first time , and a third surveyed the mountain ranges west of
McMurdo	LOCATION	Sound . ''

		The main result of the southern sledge-journey was that the party ascertained that ■ A great chain of mountains extends from the 82nd parallel , south of
McMurdo Sound	ORGANIZATION	, to the 86th parallel , trending in a south-easterly direction ; that other great mountain ranges continue to the south and south-west , and that between them flows one of the largest glaciers in the world , leading to an inland plateau , the height of which , at latitude 88 ° South , is over 11,000 feet above sea level .

		This plateau presumably continues beyond the geographical
South Pole	LOCATION	, and extends from
Cape Andre	LOCATION	to the Pole . ''

		The Great Ice Barrier is still a mystery , but Lieutenant
Shackleton	PERSON	concluded from his ob - servations that it is composed mainly of snow .

		The '' Northern Party '' of the expedition , in addition to discovering the
Magnetic Pole	LOCATION	, cor - rected the existing map of Victoria Land .

		The results obtained by the '' Western Party '' seem to be of minor importance .

		The view of Mount Erebus from the
Nimrod	ORGANIZATION	's winter quarters is unequalled by any Arctic sight .

		These vivid glows from the vol - cano , with `` the huge steam column that rises from the crater into the cold air shot up at times to a height of 3000 or 4000 feet before spread - ing out and receiving its line direction from the air-currents , '' and with the moon rising in the eastern sky so that the column '' projected on the disc of the moon , with the great cloud travelling upward , not quietly , but impelled by force from below , '' must be a view that would encourage only the artists of the Titanic .

		This part of the expedition , aside from its scientific aspects , apparently impressed the party as the most stupendously grand and picturesque sight in the Antarctic land .

		The '' Southern Party , '' with Lieutenant Shackleton in command , began its southward march on
October 29	DATE	, and returned to quarters
March 4	DATE	, with the terse report '' We have done our best . ''

		For this part of the task the most careful preparations had been made .

		The much advertised automobile was found impracticable , the wheels sinking to the body of the car and making progress impossible .

		Instead of the usual outfit of dogs , the author had procured eight Siberian ponies , trusting that their hardi - ness would withstand the rigors of the far South , and in case of shortage of food they would not be unacceptable as meat .

		Four of the animals soon succumbed , and the other four were par - tially disabled .

		Hence the final stage of the journey was made by man-power .

		On
Novem	DATE	- ber 26 the party passed the '' farthest South '' previously reached by man .

		Here Lieutenant
Shackleton	PERSON	makes this impressive entry : '' It falls to the lot of few men to view land not pre - viously seen by human eyes , and it was with feelings of keen curiosity , not unmingled with awe , that we watched the new mountains rise from the great unknown that lay ahead of us .

		Mighty peaks they were , the eternal snows at their bases , and their rough-hewn forms rising high towards the sky .

		As the days wore on , and mountain after mountain came into view , grimly majestic , the con - sciousness of our insignificance seemed to grow upon us .

		We were but tiny black specks crawling slowly and painfully across the white plain , and bending our puny strength to the task of wresting from nature secrets preserved inviolate through all the ages . ''

		On
January 9	DATE	the party spent its last day outwards . ''

		We have shot our bolt , and the tale is latitude 88 ° 23 / South .

		... At 4
A. M.	PERSON	we started south , with the
Queen 's Union Jack	ORGANIZATION	, a brass cylinder containing stamps 450 THE DIA1 , -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, and documents to place at the furthest south point , camera , glasses , and compass .

		At 9
A. M.	PERSON	we were half running and half walking over a surface much hardened by the recent blizzard .

		We hoisted her Majesty 's flag and the other Union
Jack	PERSON	afterwards , and took possession of the plateau in the name of his Majesty ... There was no break in the plateau as it extended toward the Pole , and we feel sure that the goal we have failed to reach lies on this plain .

		We stayed only a few minutes , and then , taking the Queen 's flag and eating our scanty meal as we went , we hurried back ... Homeward bound at last .

		Whatever re - grets may be , we have done our best . ''

		Lieutenant
Shackleton	PERSON	's account of the gnaw - ing hunger endured by the men when on their southern trip makes one of the most intense bits of reading in the book . ''

		During the last weeks of the journey outward , '' he writes , '' and the long march back , when our allowance of food had been reduced to 20 ounces per man a day , we really thought of little but food . ''

		Could the explorers have satisfied their hunger with their eyes , by viewing the crude though wondrously beautiful color-schemes of the Antarctic , they would have been fully satisfied .


Marston	PERSON	, the artist of the expedition , places the colors before us in startling combinations . ''

		Bright blues and greens are seen in violent contrast with brilliant reds ; and an accurate record of the colors displayed in a sunset , as seen over broken ice , would suggest to many people an impressionistic poster of the kind seen in the
London	LOCATION	streets .

		Words fail one in an attempt to describe the wildly bizarre effects observed on days when the sky was fiery red and pale green , merging into a deep blue overhead , and the snow-fields and rocks showed violet , green and white under the light of the moon . ''

		These almost unearthly landscapes are repro - duced with remarkable effect in the color-plates of the book .

		To speak of them in detail , or of the many wonderful photogravures , and the inter - esting maps and charts , is not necessary here .

		The mechanical features of the volumes are dig - nified and pleasing , as befits the impressive and thrilling character of the narrative .

		No one reading it will question its author 's title to a place in the ranks of the
Great Explorers	ORGANIZATION	.

Pennell	PERSON	renders something of the grandeur of the Perugian prospect , and very much of the massive beauty of an Etruscan gateway to that wonderful little city .

		The pictures much more than justify themselves as glosses of the text by Mr.
James	PERSON	.

		And if the illustrations most handsomely com - plement the text , nothing could be more appro - priate than the stateliness of the book as a whole -- the dignified page , the fair paper , the wide margins .

		Of these mechanical details it is impossible not to take note ; yet one prefers not to insist upon them .

		They are not calculated to distract one 's attention from the printed word : only to dignify that word .

		That is as it should be , in good book-making . ''

		Italian Hours '' consists of a collection of some score of travel-papers composed in the years 1872-1909 .

		Most of the essays seem to belong to the seventies and eighties . ''

		The chapters of which this volume is composed have with few exceptions already been collected , and were then associated with others commemorative of other impressions of -LRB- no very extensive -RRB- ex - cursions and wanderings , '' writes Mr.
James	PERSON	in his preface .

		Thus the reader will recognize the opening chapter on
Venice	LOCATION	, and a later one en - titled ''
Italy	LOCATION	Revisited , '' as hailing from that familiar volume published twenty-five years ago in
Boston	LOCATION	, '' Portraits of Places . ''

		The novelty of the present volume consists in the fact that '' the notes on various visits to
Italy	LOCATION	are here for the first time exclusively placed together , '' to quote , once more , the preface . ''

		I have not hesitated to amend my text , expressively , '' the traveller adds .

		There has , however , been little attempt to bring the chapters '' down to date , '' unless it be in the addition of papers recording later impressions .

		THE DIAL 451 Baedeker : '' The fond appeal of the observer concerned is all to aspects and appearances -- above all to the intimate face of things as it mainly used to be . ''

		So many of these Italian hours are given to
Venice	LOCATION	, there can be no great harm in the re - viewer 's almost neglecting the rest , which the reader will not fail to enjoy for himself .

		We wish to quote a few sentences from the first chapter of all , dated
1882	DATE	.

		This is not the first chapter in point of time , however . ''

		An Early Impression '' is of ten years ' older vintage .

		Mr.
James	PERSON	writes thus of
Venice	LOCATION	in
1882	DATE	: '' Everyone has been there : it is not forbidden how - ever to speak of familiar things .

		There is nothing new to be said about her certainly , but the old is better than any novelty .

		It would be a sad day indeed when there should be something new to say .

		... 1 do not pretend to enlighten the reader ; I pretend only to give a fillip to his memory . ''

		Mr.
James	PERSON	is too modest in this self-judgment .

		With more space available , it would be a grate - ful excercise to copy here some of his '' certain little mental pictures . ''

		As it is , one need only observe that nothing can be much more interest - ins : to the amateur of Jacobean literature than to read one impression after another , to note the enthusiasm of that dated 1872 -LRB- with its state - ment about '' the mere use of one 's eyes '' being happiness enough -RRB- , and the circumstance that the later James is one for whom
Gautier	PERSON	's '' visible world '' is far from being adequate , in any literary sense . ''

		Dear old
Venice	LOCATION	, '' he writes in
1899	DATE	, '' has lost her complexion , her figure , her reputation , her self-respect , and yet , with it all , has so puzzlingly not lost a shred of her attraction . '' '

		The `` certain little mental pictures '' become increasingly technical , increas - ingly complex : that much is certain .

		One of the anecdotes of Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	which went the rounds at the time of his death , not so many months ago that the anecdote itself can be forgotten , is his remark upon the younger author 's book , '' The American Scene . '' ''

		I enjoyed it immensely , '' said Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	, or words to that effect . ''

		But it is not really an ' American scene ' at all : only a most delightful tour of
Henry James	ORGANIZATION	's insides . ''

		One does not quite wish to apply the criticism to the present volume , and yet -- when the time comes to evaluate these travel-sketches of a subtler sort , one is prompted to quote , without consciousness of malice , one of Mr.
James	PERSON	's own sentences , occurring in '' Roman Neighbourhoods . '' ''

		The great thing in art is charm , and the great thing in charm is spontaneity . ''

		The dictum which the man of letters applies as a test of Domeni - chino 's painting might indubitably be applied , with meet reverence , to his own prose . ''

		Spon - taneity '' : the word is a good one ; the thing itself is excellent .

		Perhaps it is more than one has a right to ask from so masterly an analyst of men and of places .

		The Ships and Sailors of Old Salem .

		* There is still magic in the name of the old city of Salem , once the commercial emporium of
New England	LOCATION	, now the outpost of
summer	DATE	villas of merchant princes , following the windings of the coast from
Marblehead	LOCATION	to
Bar Harbor	LOCATION	.

		The lover of romance associates it with `` The
House	ORGANIZATION	of the Seven Gables , '' the birthplace of its author , and the
Custom House	ORGANIZATION	where in the interims of signing invoices and bills of lading he conceived the scheme of '' The Scarlet Letter . ''

		The student of popular frenzies of superstition finds rich material in that wave of witchcraft which swept over
Salem Village	LOCATION	, and wonders why
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	and Judge
Sewall	PERSON	did not recommend a vigorous application of the strap as a corrective of juvenile animosity towards estimable old ladies , instead of swallowing their absurd stories of pin-pricking , broom-riding , and evil-eye fixing .

		The lover of sane architecture still delights in studying the impressive colonial mansions , with their stately doorways and old - fashioned gardens which are among the most attractive features of the sedate old city .

		The musician recalls that Billings wrote the first American composition in his Salem tannery and chalked the notes of '' Majesty * ' on the hides , and that General
Oliver	PERSON	scored his '' Coronation '' there , little dreaming that the Christian world long after his death would rejoice in its exultant strains .

		Scientist and sailor have preserved the memory of the
Salem Bowditch	PERSON	who first reduced navigation to an exact science and whose work is still the vade mecum of mariners the world over .

		The name of Salem recalls to the histo - rian its Puritan settlement only eight years after the Pilgrim settlement of
Plymouth	LOCATION	colony , its glorious place in Revolutionary annals , and the romantic stories of lords and ladies who thronged the baronial mansion on Folly Hill , of dignified colonial governors , of Crowinshield mysteries and Derby exploits , of dames ' school teachers , `` marms '' who sold molasses candy and the * The Ships and Sailors of Old Salem .

Hawthorne	PERSON	was so fond , and which are still to be obtained of her descendants in
Salem	LOCATION	streets .

		To the collectors of '' antiques '' the name sug - gests blue willow-ware and Chippendales , shell sugar-bowls and lustre pitchers , venerable high-boys , four-posters , and davenports , the private treasures in old garrets and public treas - ures in the
East India Museum	LOCATION	and in
Essex Institute	ORGANIZATION	.

		Salem thus presents diversified interests , according to the mood of the visitor ; but it has been reserved for Mr.
Ralph D. Paine	PERSON	, mousing among the dusty archives , to present Salem from its most fascinating point of view and one not generally considered and mostly forgotten .

		He has recalled in his book , '' The Ships and Sailors of Old Salem , '' the crowning glory of the North Shore outpost , -- for Salem ships and sailors , traversing uncharted seas in quest of gain and opening up new marts of trade , bringing honor to the flag in open naval engagement , or swoop - ing down upon the enemy and devastating him in privateer attack , sum up its greatest achieve - ments in commerce and romance , enterprise and heroism .

		It was Salem that first sent the American ensign into distant unexplored waters -- to
Japan	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	,
the Philippines	LOCATION	,
Guam	LOCATION	,
Sumatra	LOCATION	,
Arabia	LOCATION	, the African coast , the
Cape of Good Hope	LOCATION	, the islands of the South Seas if not of all Kipling 's seven seas .

		It is fortu - nate that Salem institutions have preserved the records of these achievements , but it is more fortunate still that Mr.
Paine	PERSON	conceived the idea of ransacking dusty shelves and dingy chests , and securing these fascinating stories and making them public before they were de - faced by time or their hiding-places were for - gotten .

		His skilful hands have done the work well .

		He does not intrude himself unnecessa - rily upon the reader , but introduces the old pioneers of maritime adventure and lets the skippers and their crews tell their own stories in their own unvarnished way .

		And what marvellous yarns they spin !

		Again truth is stranger than fiction .

		It is not necessary to go to
Marryat	LOCATION	,
Dana	PERSON	,
Connolly	PERSON	, or
Jacobs	PERSON	, for '' thrillers '' of the sea .

		Their sea-pictures of the fancy are outdone by these broad glowing canvases upon which the old captains , priva - teers , and pirates too , have told their stories .

		As the author says , '' The materials for the plot of a modern novel of adventure may be found condensed into a three-line entry of many an ancient log-book . ''

		The maritime story of Salem is an epic , and one of the most interesting in American history ; for Mr.
Paine	PERSON	's volume is not alone a study in Salem records , it is a valuable contribution to the national history .

		These journals , logs , and documents of the sturdy old captains not merely show what an important part they played in the commercial development of the whole country and in defence of the flag at their mast-heads , they are tales of high adven - ture , romances of the sea , short stories which may be solidly enjoyed by all who love the ocean -- and who have not at some time longed for a '' life on the ocean wave '' and a '' home on the rolling deep '' ?

		It is a bulky epic of thirty-one cantos and over six hundred pages , richly illustrated with cuts and facsimiles ; but no one need be deterred from reading by its length .

		It is a human document of entrancing interest .

		In these chapters Mr.
Paine	PERSON	and his old sea-dogs tell the stories of those match - less clippers whose sails flecked every sea , and with whose disappearance the ocean has lost something of its picturesqueness ; of battles fought with the pirates of the Spanish Main ; of the privateers of
1776	DATE	and
1812	DATE	, who so materially reduced the naval strength of
Great Britain	LOCATION	; of the pioneers of distant seas ; of the old frigate Essex , which Salem shipbuilders gave to the government , and which fought so gallantly for '' free-trade and sailors ' rights '' ; of the first voyages to
Japan	LOCATION	; of the first arrival of an American ship at
Guam	LOCATION	, our accidental and serio-comic possession ; of
Nathaniel Bowditch	PERSON	and his '' Practical Navigator '' ; of
South Sea	LOCATION	voy - ages ; and of the romantic career of
Frederick Townsend Ward	PERSON	, the young Salem soldier who became a Chinese mandarin .

		And to these Mr.
Paine	PERSON	has added the logs and diaries of such famous ship-masters as
Bertram	LOCATION	,
Russell	PERSON	,
Derby	ORGANIZATION	,
Crowninshield	PERSON	, Little ,
Silsbee	LOCATION	,
Cleveland	LOCATION	, and others , interesting sidelights on
Endicott	PERSON	and
Hawthorne	PERSON	, and appendixed historical docu - ments of great value .

		They were a hardy , robust , heroic lot , these old skippers , with something of the Puritan spirit manifesting itself in their remorseless dis - cipline and sometimes harsh treatment of those who fell into their hands or were not prompt in obedience .

		But they played an important part in upbuilding Salem when
New York	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	were hardly known on the seas , and in main - taining the honor of the flag .

		There are still remnants of the old ships in Salem harbor , and

Paine	PERSON	in permanent form and told in masterly fashion .

		There are few more engaging books for a winter evening around the fire than this record of '' the brave days of old . ''


George P. Upton	PERSON	.

		The Old
New York	LOCATION	axd the New .

		* It is natural that the year of the
Hudson	LOCATION	- Fulton celebration should yield a full crop of books about
New York	LOCATION	.

		The great city stopped to take breath and consider its historic past ; the rest of the country went down to help the
New Yorkers	ORGANIZATION	make holiday .

		And the canny publisher noted the chance to be timely , to con - vert the quickened interest in
New York	LOCATION	, Dutch and American , into a market for his wares .

		Three at least of these recent books about
New York	LOCATION	are of a character to appeal strongly to the holiday book-buyer , searching for something worth while in substance and attractive in ap - pearance to bestow upon his friends .

		The first of them is a faithful study of the manners and customs of the Dutch founders of
New York	LOCATION	, so entertainingly misrepresented by
Washington	LOCATION	Irving and rather neglected since his day .

		Miss
Esther Singleton	PERSON	brings to her latest research a valuable background of related information ; for she has already written a book about Dutch and Flemish furniture , and an interesting account of '' Social
New York	LOCATION	under the Georges . ''

		Her '' Dutch New York '' fairly bristles with facts , documentary evidence , curi - ous details culled from inventories , letters , and legal records ; but they are all characteristic and interesting , logically arranged and suc - cinctly related , so that they hold attention .

		Miss
Singleton	PERSON	has very little to say of the geography of old
New York	LOCATION	, and not much of its commercial relations ; it is the e very-day life of the transplanted Dutch burghers that she * Dutch

		tries to reconstruct .

		They were just that , she explains ; bringing with them to their new homes all their native customs and cherished possessions , -- their massive ''
Kasten	PERSON	, '' with
Delft	LOCATION	and porcelain and silver to fill them , their voluminous and numerous petticoats and baggy breeches , their big ruffs and jewelled head-dresses , Great and
Little Masters	ORGANIZATION	to hang on their walls , even tulips and hyacinths to plant in their gardens .

		The very earliest settlers , of course , enjoyed no such luxuries .

		Miss
Singleton	PERSON	devotes a preliminary chapter to their experiences , mostly taken verbatim from letters and diaries .

		A chapter on '' New Amsterdam Housekeeping '' details the daily life of the women , thoroughly old-world in its laborious devotion to cleanli - ness .

		There is also a chapter on servants , who certainly had a rough time of it in
New Am	LOCATION	- sterdam , in spite of all the law could do in their defence ; and one on education , flattering neither to schools , masters , nor pupils .

		Religion re - ceives due attention , as do the curious and elabo - rate marriage customs which contrast oddly with traditions of Dutch thrift .

		One of the longest chapters in the text , and the majority of the illustrations , are devoted to the Dutch fur - niture .

		There are also several reproductions of old prints and of the paintings of the period .

		A handsome photogravure of Mayor
Cornelius Steenwyck	PERSON	forms an appropriate frontispiece .

		There are plenty of books about modern
New York	LOCATION	, but '' The
New New York	LOCATION	'' stands out among them , distinguished by the personality of both author and illustrator .

		Dr.
John C. Van Dyke	PERSON	is an able and eminent art-critic , while his wonderful study of '' The Desert '' suggests more definitely what he will do here .

		Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	's position as etcher and illustrator needs no comment , and some of his best work has had
New York	LOCATION	for its subject .

		For '' The
New New York	LOCATION	'' he has made a hundred sketches in black-and-white , and two dozen or so in pastel .

		These last are far less effective than the uncolored drawings ; the method seems ill-adapted to most of the sub - jects chosen .

		But at least they add variety , -- and surely variety is one of the chief qualities in any true picture of the new
New York	LOCATION	.

		In his preface , Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	thus states the point of view agreed upon between author and illustrator as most significant : the representing of `` the life and energy of its people projected upon the background of its commerce . '

		In other words , they find
New York	LOCATION	interesting because it '' just grew , '' and is still growing ; 454 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, because it is essentially busy , hurried , crowded -- a tremendous commercial force , with sky - scrapers , bridges , tunnels , all on a vast and magnificent scale commensurate with its power and vitality .

		This thesis is brilliantly elabo - rated in an introductory chapter .

		There follows one entitled '' Seasonal Impressions , '' full of subtle understanding of color , material and spiritual .

		Some of the other chapters are not as good .

		The impression made by a city is far more complex than that of a desert .

		Some - times Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	loses his way in
New York	LOCATION	.

		We are reminded of a statement in Mr.
G. W. Steevens	PERSON	's `` The Land of the Dollar '' : `` The truth is that
New York	LOCATION	yields no impression .

		... It dazzles and it astonishes , but it does not make a picture . ''

		Certainly it does not always make a picture for Dr. Van Dyke .

		Sometimes it generalizes itself into any city ; for example , much of the chapter on '' Shops and Shopping '' would apply equally well to
London	LOCATION	or
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Often , too , a little picture is heavily framed in vague generalization . ''

		It is usually a more well-to-do class of people seated in the carriages and cabs than walks upon the side-walk , and perhaps it represents fashion or society better , since neither of them cares much for going about on foot in
New Fork	LOCATION	. ''

		One loses interest in a paragraph beginning with so obvious a statement , but Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	has a bad habit of beginning paragraphs in that way .

		We wish that he had been more consistently the artist , and less the omnivorous observer , con - scientiously attempting to absorb everything that
New York	LOCATION	has to show him .

		But if occasionally '' The
New New York	LOCATION	'' strikes the level of mere information , as a whole it moves on a much higher plane , forming a significant , if over - weighted , impression of our New World metro - polis , with its unique conception of municipal beauty , realized and to be realized in years to come -- for the new
New York	LOCATION	is still very much in the making .

		Last in our present group , we have '' The Wayfarer in
New York	LOCATION	, '' a small but very com - prehensive anthology , with a sprightly essay from Mr.
Edward S. Martin	PERSON	, deftly contrived to put the reader in the mood for enjoying the extracts -- whether or not compiled by Mr.
Martin	PERSON	is not indicated .

		These are grouped geographi - cally , under headings named fr6m the different quarters of the city ; and , roughly speaking , chronologically , for they run from the Battery progressively to the
Bronx	LOCATION	, -- that is , from the old
New York	LOCATION	to the new .

		The compiler , who - ever he be , has appreciated the fact that de - scription , however picturesque , palls , and has made human interest the basis of his selection .

		The result is a vivid panorama of city life as our novelists , poets , newspaper reporters , histo - rians , and other '' wayfarers '' have interpreted it , with many intentions and in varying mood .

Kellogg Dunton	PERSON	.

		The Charm of
China	LOCATION	.

		* In writing a book on
China	LOCATION	, Mr.
William Edgar Geil	PERSON	was wise in concentrating upon what has always been the great mystery of
China	LOCATION	-- its Great Wall .

		This mystery Mr.
Geil	PERSON	explored in the spirit of one profoundly impressed with his subject .

		There are times when he is almost lyrical in what he writes of this more than tenth wonder of the world , -- for in his interpretation it is really more wonderful than all the '' nine wonders '' together .

		He has not attempted a sober scientific treatment of his subject , -- although his pages reveal no lack of scholarly equipment , abundant accumulation of material , and a first-hand acquaintance with Chinese lit - erature .

		He has chosen , rather , to blend his material into a narrative imbued with the charm of a fervid and enthusiastic style .

		The result is a dramatic and highly entertaining book .

		The author made the entire journey over the Great Wall , and his readers share in his admiration of its extent , its circuitousness , and the numberless interesting details of its origin and history .

		Thus '' The Great Wall '' becomes almost per - sonified as the hero of a wonderful tale , and its builder ,
China	LOCATION	, is individualized as some one of vast importance and achievement .

		He exalts them , indeed , into a sort of epic dignity . ''

		The Martial Barrier of all under Heaven , '' in his rhapsodic phrase , '' extends from the Yellow Sea past the Yellow Kiver to the Yellow Sand , and thence on to the

		THE DIAL 455 when looking westward .

		And many considera - tions pass through the mind .

		Will the Yellows go to the Whites and submerge them ?

		Will it be from Yellow to White ; or will it be that the White will become Yellow and that these people will ultimately predominate ?

		Most of our thoughts , as we rode toward beautiful
Kiayiikan	PERSON	, were about the movements of nations .

		We thought in empires . ''

		Mr.
Geil	PERSON	's thoughts are indeed spacious , and though he does not make the Great Wall particularly a vantage-ground from which to speculate upon the future of the Chinese , he does hint that its vastness , even in decay , speaks of a people whose power has never slept .

		4 * Once the Great Barrier had three mil - lions of soldiery behind it .

		Suppose these came once again to man the towers , with Maxims on the turrets and seige guns behind the Wall !

		Who would dare attack ?

		But suppose they march forward , who can defend ? ''

		Mention must be made of the pictures , which are so num - erous and so truly illustrative that they are in themselves a vivid presentation of this more than vivid book .

		The charm of
China	LOCATION	is as potent now as ever to inspire books on the wonders , the mysteries , the anomalies , and the surprises of that far - eastern land .

		In Miss -LRB- or Mrs. -RRB-
E. G. Kemp	PERSON	's handsome work entitled M The Face of
China	LOCATION	'' we have the impressions and observations of a wide-awake and rather courageous woman who has twice journeyed through the central prov - inces , and has thrown herself on the courtesy and chivalry of the natives without finding her confidence misplaced .

		The soul of the far East she leaves it to others to study , and .

		if they `` / an , to reproduce : while she is content , as she says , to set down faithfully the things she has seen , and thus perhaps induce some of her readers to visit the country for themselves .

		Also , as her title-page tells us , she gives rt some account of the new schools , universities , mis - sions , and the old religious sacred places of Confucianism , Buddhism , and
Taoism	LOCATION	. ''

		Most interesting and praiseworthy is
China	LOCATION	's immense respect for education , even for its own pedantic system , and still more so its now growing esteem for Western learning .

		The marvellous com - petitive examinations for scholarly rank and title -- physical endurance tests they ought rather to be called -- are described by the au - thor , who has herself inspected the cells where the aspirants for honors suffer and even die in the three-days and nine-days intellectual combats .

		Cheerfully bright pictures of many colors , varied with sepia drawings , all of decided artistic merit , are supplied with lavish hand , and render still more attractive a very invit - ing book .

		A glaringly misquoted line from
Browning	PERSON	is the only slip of the pen we have discovered .

		Mr.
Mortimer Menpes	PERSON	has provided drawings -- sixteen elaborately colored , and sixty-four in black and white -- for one of his handsome '' Crown Series '' of large-page books , this time on M
China	LOCATION	, '' with text by Sir
Henry Arthur Blake	PERSON	.

		The text of the book , with its modicum of geographical and historical matter , and its descriptions of Chinese manners and customs , some of them already well known to the western world , is little more than an excuse for the illus - trations ; but these are life-like and worthy of careful study .

		The subjects are well adapted to color-printing -- to its defects as well as to its excellences .

		The clearness and apparent faith - fulness of drawing , in the colored and uncolored pictures alike , reveal great care and skill .

		Occasion is taken to insert Lady
Blake	PERSON	's ad - dress as president of a women 's conference at
Shanghai	LOCATION	, in
1900	DATE	, for the discussion of the home life of the women of
China	LOCATION	.

		Also extracts are given from the Eeport of the
Singapore Commission	ORGANIZATION	appointed to consider the opium question .

		Both the author and the commissioners whom he quotes are evidently inclined to regard the protest against opium-importation as simply one more '' unconsidered outburst of European sentiment . ''

		The book is an art work of merit , and -LRB- no negligible item to many buyers -RRB- of modest price . ''

		Court Life in
China	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
Isaac Taylor Headland	PERSON	of the
Peking University	ORGANIZATION	, gives itself largely to the praises -LRB- not undeserved -RRB- of the late Empress Dowager .

		Her obscure origin was naturally kept as secret as possible in her lifetime , but the author has discovered , he says , that she was one of the several children born to poor parents , and that in her childhood she car - ried the babies on her back , a la chinoise , and amused them with the simple toys sold at a cash or two apiece .

		Her lamented selection to grace the imperial court , where it was supposed she would ever afterward be dead to all the outside world , and her subsequent memorable experi - ences and achievements , are chronicled at length .

		In a chapter devoted to the reforms instituted by her , the author presents the opium question under a quite different light from that thrown on it in the book we have just noticed , and he regrets that the reformer 's life was not spared until her beneficent plan had been completely carried out .

		The book also eulogizes the late 456 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, Emperor ; but as the author was in a position to obtain full knowledge of what he wrote , there is little reason to dispute him .

		Chinese education is naturally a subject that interests him , and one in which he succeeds in interesting the reader .

		From Mrs.
Headland	PERSON	's notebook he has drawn for information on Chinese women , and between them both they have made an excellent and an instructive book .

		It is well illustrated .

		Mrs.
Archibald Little	PERSON	has lived among the Chinese and has written several books about them .

		Her latest study of social conditions and peculiar customs in the
Celestial Kingdom	LOCATION	is entitled '' In the Land of the Blue Gown . ''

		She well says that '' each nation gets accustomed to its own short-comings , and has wide-open eyes for its neighbours ' , '' and she views the back - wardness and the ignorance of
China	LOCATION	with a tol - erance born of adequate consciousness of western defects and abuses .

		A welcome departure from most books on
China	LOCATION	is found in her long chapter devoted to '' Life on a Farmstead , '' occupying more than a quarter of the entire volume .

		There is much that is primitive and delightful in Chinese rural life .

		A chapter on '' Little Known Border Tribes , '' and one de - scribing an anti-footbinding crusade , which seems to have met with some success , are also among the book 's novelties .

		We are told that in
1906	DATE	the movement for unbound feet had progressed so far , thanks to official favor and imperial edict , that some ladies of fashion went to the extreme of stuffing their shoes to make their feet appear larger than they really were ; and that at a crowded meeting in
Shanghai	LOCATION	a committee of Chinese men of influence took over the management of the reform from the foreign ladies who had hitherto directed it .

		Though foot-binding may still linger among the ignorant poor in remote districts , this abuse is thought by the author to have received its death-blow .

		Pictures from photographs are generously pro- vided .

		Under the simple title , '' The Chinese , '' Mr.
John Stuart Thomson	PERSON	has written a book of readable quality , pleasantly enlivened with inci - dents and anecdotes , and provided with numer - ous illustrations and a map .

		The opening chapter on '' Daily Life of Foreigners in
China	LOCATION	'' and the next following on '' The Portuguese and Camoens in
China	LOCATION	'' are a little apart from the author 's main subject ; but when he proceeds to describe '' Incidents of Daily Life among the Chinese , '' and to give examples of '' Chinese Humor , '' he hits on some matters that are dis - tinctive and worth while .

		One must , however , question his assertion that `` half of the false hair used in
America	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	is gathered in
China	LOCATION	. ''

		Considerations of color and quality make this doubtful -- although it really matters not at all , one way or the other .

		As an example of Chinese humor it is related that one Huan '' had refused to join the local
Triad Society	ORGANIZATION	in organizing opposition to an unpopular but pow - erful magistrate .

		He thereupon was asked for his reasons , and replied that he had ten . '

		And what are they ? ' '

		Two wives and eight chil - dren . ' ''

		There is a very western , not to say American , flavor to that ; but the essence of humor is much the same all the world over .

		Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	's opinion of the late Empress Dowager differs widely from Mr.
Headland	PERSON	's .

		He speaks of her '' banyan-like shade '' and her '' obstruc - tionist '' policy , and ascribes to her character - istics that are far from admirable .

		A chapter on '' Chinese Art and Literature '' -- too big a subject for even an entire volume -- contains some striking proverbial and epigrammatic native utterances .

		Speaking of the late ineffec - tive Opium Conference at
Shanghai	LOCATION	, the author says : '' We shall have other conferences , and
America	LOCATION	will call them until
Britain	LOCATION	keeps her word . ''

		A third edition of Mr.
E. H. Parker	PERSON	's ''
John Chinaman	PERSON	, and a Few Others '' has made its appearance , nearly eight years after the book 's first issue .

		It is of an anecdotal and amusing character , and -LRB- if one may credit the assertion of the writer himself -RRB- has met with cordial welcome as a banisher of dull care .

		In his preface to this edition the author writes : `` I am proud to say that several scientific and pro- fessional men personally unknown to me have written to thank me for having contributed a mite to the gaiety of nations in publishing '
John Chinaman	PERSON	' ; and I have reason to believe that at least one of them uses it as
Darwin	LOCATION	is stated to have used
Mark Twain	PERSON	's ' Innocents Abroad , ' -- as a means of securing sleep in a jolly frame of mind when he feels overwrought . ''

		At any rate , Mr.
Parker	PERSON	has lived in
China	LOCATION	, has min - gled with the natives , and has studied their humors .

		He divides his matter into sixteen chapters , and each of these into numerous sub - sections , with plenty of dialogue and anecdote , so that his pages have that open , inviting look that all readers for pleasure know how to value .

		Pictures , too , abound , and a glossary is added for the benefit of those who like to have foreign terms convey a definite meaning .

		THE DIAL 457 A Pageant or Fair Women .

		* '' Still with their fires Love tipt his keenest darts ; As once they drew into two burning rings All beams of Love , melting the mighty hearts Of captains and of kings . ''

		The type of woman to which
Tennyson	PERSON	here has reference is the type that inspires not only the poet but the biographer .

		The famous woman is oftenest interesting because of the world 's perennial interest in the theme of romantic love .

		The charming ladies whose sprightly memoirs are here under discussion possessed many and diverse talents , but they were all bountifully endowed with one -- the talent for V amour .

		They loved , perhaps not wisely , but with enthu - siasm .

		They craved , also , position and power ; and not infrequently they won them , shaping the affairs of men and the events of history .

		From them to the modern woman militant , striving to overcome mere man by physical force , horsewhip - ping prime ministers and scuffling with the po - lice , is a far cry indeed .

		We point the contrast , without favoring the methods and manners of either class .

		In the portly volume with the expressive title '' Enchanters of Men , '' Miss
Ethel Col	PERSON	- burn
Mayne	ORGANIZATION	has gathered together twenty-three typical examples of fascinating femininity grouped under five headings -- '' The Royal Mistress , '' `` The Courtesan , '' `` The Royal Lady , '' '' The Star , '' and '' The ■ Egeria . ' ''

		In point of time , these charmers range from
Diane de Poitiers	ORGANIZATION	and
Bianca Capello	PERSON	, of the sixteenth century , to
Jenny Lind	PERSON	and
Evelina Hanska	PERSON	of the nineteenth .

		Strange company most of these enterprising ladies are for our virtuous
Scandi	LOCATION	- navian songstress .

		The writer herself seems to be conscious of the incongruity ; to her mind there is a lack of spice in
Jenny Lind	PERSON	's exem - plary history , as compared , for example , with * Enchanters of Men .

		that of
Ninon de Lenclos	PERSON	, of
Lola Montez	PERSON	, and of
Adrienne Lecouvreur	PERSON	.

		The book contains a generous amount of reading matter , and por - traits of all but one of the '' enchanters , '' with Lord
Byron	PERSON	and
Henry of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	thrown in as congenial company .

		One of the most seductive , and in some re - spects most amiable , of the '' enchanters '' por - trayed in Miss
Mayne	ORGANIZATION	's work has been chosen by Mr.
H. Noel Williams	PERSON	as the subject of a much more elaborate study in his '' Madame du Barry . ''

		This author of nearly a dozen books on famous French women has made himself so well known to readers of such memoirs that it will here suf - fice to say that the du
Barry	PERSON	is treated with all his wonted diligence of research and entertain - ing style of narration .

		This last of the left-hand queens of
France	LOCATION	appeals to us by virtue of a cer - tain goodness of heart and magnanimity of sen - timent .

		Three times she interceded to save con - demned persons from death ; she was a generous giver , even when her means were small ; she was always moved to indignant protest by the sight of cruelty or the neglect of suffering ; and she was free from malice , and '' had the virtue , rare , especially amongst her own sex , of never speak - ing ill of anyone . ''

		There is no lack of material from which to put together an account of this successful aspirant to the '' glorious dishonor '' of being a king 's mistress , and her latest biog - rapher appears to have made good use of his predecessors ' labors .

		He closes his preface by thanking the Art Reproduction Company for assistance in selecting the portraits that appear in his volume , although the most diligent search fails to discover any but the frontispiece like - ness , the same , by the way , that is found in Miss
Mayne	ORGANIZATION	's book -- the simpering miniature executed by
Richard Cosway	PERSON	.

		The portraits that may have been intended for the preceding volume appear in large numbers in another book by the same author , entitled '' The Rose of Savoy . ''

		On the 7th
December 1697	DATE	,
Marie Adelaide	PERSON	of
Savoy	ORGANIZATION	, being then twelve years and a day old , was united in mar - riage to
Louis	LOCATION	of
France	LOCATION	,
Duke of Burgundy	ORGANIZATION	, grandson of Louis the Fourteenth ; and by him she became , in
1710	DATE	, the mother of '' the prettiest child in the world '' -LRB- as she described him in a letter -RRB- , the future
Louis	PERSON	the Fifteenth of
France	LOCATION	.

		In his ample volume the prolific Mr.
H. Noel Williams	PERSON	has told the story of this royal marriage , with its preliminaries and se - quels , and has embellished the whole by the insertion of many portraits of contemporary celebrities .

		As there have come down to us 458 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, accounts of various flirtations and coquetries indulged in by this Rose of Savoy -- even in - cluding an affair with the
Abbe de Polignac	ORGANIZATION	-- it is safe to conclude that her serious-minded spouse endured some unpleasant quarters of an hour before the two were cut off by an untimely death in
1712	DATE	. ''

		It would be difficult , '' says the author , '' to find two persons more dissimilar in character than the young people who thus be - gan their married life when their united ages scarcely exceeded thirty years . ''

		The young wife , who was an excellent mimic , went so far as to bring ridicule on her unhappy husband by her mimetic performances , which contributed to the gayety of the court , but not to the serenity of him who had espoused the
Rose of Savoy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Treating of the same period and the same court as the last-named book , the posthumous and not quite completed work of the late Mme.
Charles Vincens	PERSON	-LRB- `` Arv & de Barine '' -RRB- , `` Madame , Mother of the Regent , '' gives a cleverly - written account of a German princess married against her will to a French prince suspected of poison - ing his first wife and more than suspected of not leading a highly virtuous life .

		She survived her husband by twenty-one years , and lived to see herself a decidedly important personage as mother of the
Duke of Orleans	ORGANIZATION	,
Regent	ORGANIZATION	upon the death of the Grand Monarch and before
Louis	PERSON	the Fifteenth had attained to manhood .

		Although the writer has been complimented for her rare gift of making her various historic characters live and breathe before the reader 's eyes , it is to us of the twentieth century a some - what artificial , not easily imaginable , set of roy - alties and courtiers and king 's mistresses and sycophantic hangers-on that make their exits and their entrances in this thoroughly French drama of the late seventeenth and early eight - eenth century .

		The translation , from the pen of
Madame Charles Bigot	ORGANIZATION	, is commendably fluent and readable ; and she has , one infers , supplied the brief closing chapter left unwritten by the author .

		Twenty-four illustrations , mostly portraits , are scattered through the book .

		By a coincidence not unusual in the book - world , another elaborate treatment of the same theme as that of the preceding volume appears at the same time .

		This is Mr.
Ernest F. Henderson	PERSON	's lavishly illustrated and engagingly written volume , '' A Lady of the Old Regime . ''

		In his pages the corpulent
Elisabeth Charlotte	PERSON	-LRB- Liselotte they called her at home , in
Heidel	PERSON	- berg -RRB- appears as a very human , far from fault - less , but extremely companionable sort of person ; and she is made to paint her own good-natured looking portrait from frequent passages out of her familiar correspondence . ''

		There are many places in the Bible , '' she once wrote , '' that say one must mortify the body ; the Old and the New Testaments are full of it .

		But I think it is enough to bear patiently the evil that comes to us from the hand of God without torturing ourselves .

		I never could endure La Trappe . ''

		A contemporary diarist , quoted by Mr.
Hender	PERSON	- son , records the satirical epitaph composed on Madame : '' Here lies idleness , the mother of all vice . ''

		But if she lacked energy and indus - try , partly for physical reasons -LRB- she complained in later life that it made her puff like a buffalo to walk across the floor -RRB- , she succeeded , in her passive Germanly phlegmatic way , in being a good deal of a personage .

		Evidently her strength was to sit still .

		From the practised pen of Mr.
Francis Gribble	PERSON	there comes a readable and far from superfluous volume entitled '' Chateaubriand and his Court of Women . ''

		An adequate life of this interesting man has hitherto been lacking in English , if not also in French itself .

		Doubt - less the Memoires d 1 Outre-tombe have gener - ally been felt to cover the ground sufficiently well ; but the recent discovery of many letters and other documents bearing on
Chateaubri	PERSON	- and 's life has , as Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	is justified in thinking , made it possible and desirable to pro- duce a biography .

		The title he has chosen is explained in the author 's preface , where he says : '' It seems to follow that the time has come when a synoptic view of that career may at last be taken with some hope that the resulting picture will at once approximate to exactitude , and bring into due relief those romantic epi - sodes in it to which Chateaubriand himself appears to have attached the most importance .

		What those episodes were may be inferred from the fact that , alike as a pilgrim to the Holy Land and as
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs	ORGANIZATION	, he wrote that his sole ambition was to ' win glory ' in order that he might ' lay it at a woman 's feet . ' ''

		His `` court of women '' in - cludes Madame Recamier ,
Pauline	PERSON	de Beau - mont , the
Duchesse de Berry	ORGANIZATION	, and many others .

		The chapter devoted to his American travels is of especial interest to American readers .

		Por - traits of Chateaubriand and five of his '' court '' are included in the volume .

		In Mr.
Edgcumbe Staley	PERSON	's '' Famous Women of
Florence	LOCATION	'' there reappears one of the '' en - chanters of men '' included in the first book in the present group ,
Bianca Capello	PERSON	-- or
Bianca de ' Capelli	PERSON	, as Mr.
Staley	PERSON	writes the name ,
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 459 though he prefers to call her
Bianca de ' Medici	PERSON	in his chapter narrating her history and her connection with
Francesco de ' Medici	PERSON	.

		The other characters selected as types of Florentine womanhood are Beatrice de '
Portinari	PERSON	, '' the type of the New AVoman in the dawn of the Renaissance '' ; Lucrezia de '
Tornabuoni	PERSON	, '' the most exalted exponent of the over-riding power of woman for good '' ;
Simonetta de ' Cattanei	PERSON	, '' the perfect model of woman 's physical charms '' ;
Giovanna degli Albizzi	PERSON	, '' the exam - ple of a duteous daughter , the sympathetic wife of a man of fashion , and , with him , the highest standard of the civilization and refinement of the Renaissance '' ; Alessandra de '
Machingi	PERSON	, the pathetic example of a shadowed life and a noble patience ; and
Lisa de ' Gherardini	PERSON	, a per - son of happy nature and smiling face .

		These women , selected out of many that have appealed to the author in the course of his Florentine studies , have each a separate chapter , and are in most cases represented by a portrait .

		Index and bibliography give evidence of care in the book 's making , although a list of fifty-five errata is also proof of carelessness in some quarter .

		Holiday Publications ,
i. Books of Travel	ORGANIZATION	and Description .

		Everyone who loves a beautiful book will delight in the volume on '' French Cathedrals , '' by Mrs.
Elizabeth Robins Pennell	PERSON	.

		illustrated by Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	, which appears in uniform binding with their '' English Cathedrals '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Natur - ally , the illustrations receive first praise .

		One hundred and eighty-three of them , the title-page says there are ; but more important than their number is the fact that the
French Government	ORGANIZATION	has acquired the original drawings for the
Luxembourg	LOCATION	.

		Pen-drawings , wash-drawings , and etchings are re - produced in black and white , or black and tint .

		Various in scope , from details of screen or doorway to vistas of nave or transept and distant views of u tower and town , '' they present a series of views of each cathedral which gives a full impression from without and from within .

		One learns from them not only the features with which each great structure faces the world , as it were consciously , in the tra - ditional view , but their unconscious and intrinsic character , surprised from unexpected points and revealed in the moods of different atmospheres .

		It is for further revelation of this essential character that the text is most admirable .

		Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	never wrote more charmingly , with reminiscence personal enough , never intrusively so .

		But more than fluent style and ample knowledge -- which , though she disclaims the technician 's skill , is adequate to the reader 's need -- is the fact that she feels her churches . ''

		There are churches , '' she says , '' as there are men , who seem to impose on one the necessity , or at least the desire , to record the effect made by their personality , or individuality , in the course of long and close intimacy . ''

		These impres - sions are `` deep and vivid '' with her , and she records them sincerely and therefore convincingly .

		She sees in the French cathedral a democratic institu - tion , not shut off , like the English in its close , but `` the centre of the town and town life . ''

		`` The people are as out of place in an English cathedral as in
Buckingham	LOCATION	palace ; in a French cathedral or church they are as much at home as in their own cottage or garret . ''

		Her characterization of each famous edifice is penetrating , a challenge for agree - ment or disagreement .

		Amiens `` has a serenity which is more in keeping with the spirit of Greek than of a Gothic beauty . ''

		Notre - Dame-de-Paris , for all its Gothic perfection , is `` a church without a soul . ''

		Rheims '' the magnificent '' is '' made for princes and princely rites , '' but she '' can not imagine anyone praying well at
Rheims	LOCATION	. ''

		She recurs most often to
Chartres	LOCATION	, the '' House of Prayer , '' where '' long lines of prophets and saints , in garments of flame , seem to set the cathedral all aglow with the fiery fervor of their love and praise . ''

		A necessary sequel of her love for the churches is her hatred of the '' restorer . '' ''

		A church , '' she says , '' like a man or woman , ought to look the part it has played . ''

		Consequently the restorer , who removes the wrinkles of experience , is a falsifier .

		One can not say a better word for text and illustrations than that they are worthy of each other , -- competent , sincere , beauti - ful .

		The binding , in French blue cloth , half gilt , with the tracer -RCB- ' of a rose window on the cover , is appropriate , if somewhat severely plain .

		To travel with Mr.
Howells	PERSON	would indeed be the perfection of journeying , and it is hard to suppress a pang of envy for any friend whom he happens to refer to as his companion .

		But , fortunately , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has that grace with his pen which includes himself among the realities he presents , and makes the illusion of listening to him , instead of reading , quite easy .

		In `` Seven English Cities '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- , he is as gossippy and entertaining as ever .

		Liverpool ,
Manchester	LOCATION	, and
Sheffield	PERSON	receive his first attention ; and he insists that in spite of the cavalier treatment these places usually receive from travellers , they are '' worthy to be seen and known . ''

		A doubt with re - gard to
Liverpool	ORGANIZATION	may still linger in the mind of the reader , for Mr.
Howells	PERSON	scarcely justifies anything in it except
St. George	LOCATION	's Hall ; but that may be only because , as he says , most of his memories of the place have been acquired since his visit .

		Or it may be because he is too much occupied in holding up the mirror to the '' fond behavior of arriving Ameri - cans . ''

		But
Manchester	LOCATION	, with its parks , old-fashioned mansions , and dignified public buildings , and
Sheffield	LOCATION	, with its '' dead forest '' of chimneys , its Dukeries , and its Manor pathetic with memories of 460 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	,
Mary Queen	PERSON	of Scots , evidently deserve his plea .

		York , however , holds him longest .

		Here he is haunted less hy the '' clutter of incidents '' of Eng - lish history than hy Roman associations , and '' never can get enough '' of the windows of the Minster .


Marston Moor	ORGANIZATION	eluded him , hut he was compensated by '' the civility from everyone which had so ineffec - tively abetted his search . ''

		After a glimpse of Dur - ham , '' where the mediaeval atmosphere is in perfect repair , '' he reaches
Boston	LOCATION	, a city in some respects unworthy of its
New England	LOCATION	descendant , especially in its ignorance of the places hallowed by the Pilgrims .

		Aberystwyth and
Llandudno	LOCATION	,
Welsh	ORGANIZATION	watering-places with beautiful curving beaches and a perpetual supply of negro minstrels , complete the sacred number of his visitations .

		The Welsh he finds , not , according to their reputation , the '' prize liars of the universe , '' but truthful -- although volu - able , -- amiable , and admirably co-educated .

		The closing chapter on English character will cause some discussion .

		Are the English , as Mr.
Howells	PERSON	thinks , really more courteous than Americans , and also more loyal , more united , and more charitable ?

		The volume is furnished with an abundance of half-tones , which not only really illustrate it , but are accomodat - ingly placed just where they are wanted .

		Mr.
George Wharton Edwards	PERSON	has found in '' Holland of To-day '' a most congenial and remu - nerative field for his artistic endeavor .

		He knows the country and its people thoroughly , and is evi - dently an enthusiast on the subject of things Dutch .

		He has made for his book -- for he is its author as well as illustrator -- a series of beautiful studies of Dutch types in color , other less elaborate but no less artistic black-and-white sketches of figures , and many interesting drawings of Dutch cities , villages , canals , and farm-houses .

		The plates are not mere illustrations , -- they are pictures , each a thing of beauty , and altogether setting forth a view of
Holland	LOCATION	which is striking , individual , inviting , and impressive .

		Considered as a picture book , this deserves to be one of the most successful of the season 's output .

		It is unfortunate that Mr.
Edwards	PERSON	chose to write the text to accompany his pictures ; and more unfortunate , since he has so chosen , that his work should not have been skilfully edited .

		The impression left by the pictures is vivid , clear-cut , salient ; the text is a confused and confusing mass of detail , the interesting parts jostling the common - place , the arrangement illogical , a point of view fatally lacking , the effect incoherent . ''

		Art , Ancient and Modern , '' for example , is the heading of one chapter , -- a comprehensive enough topic , one would think , to fill the eighteen pages allotted to it .

		But the fishing industry , horse-racing , yacht clubs , cycling , skating , and marriage customs in
Holland	LOCATION	, are among the other subjects treated in that chapter .

		The book is full of information , undoubtedly reliable ; but it overwhelms the hapless reader , who will turn with relief to the pictures , cheerfully forgiving Mr.
Edwards	PERSON	his literary shortcomings for their sake .

		-LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Robert Haven Schauffler	PERSON	's magazine sketches of various German cities have been gathered into a volume entitled '' Romantic Germany '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , for which half-a-dozen German artists furnish illustrations in color and black-and-white . ''

		In the surfeit of books on
Germany	LOCATION	, '' says Mr.
Schauffler	PERSON	in his preface , '' one subject has been strangely neglected , and that is -- the land itself . ''

		And so he writes of the picturesque old towns , with their Gothic houses , mediaeval courtyards , and turreted ring - walls , -- towns that make one think of
Germany	LOCATION	as the land of the Nibelungenlied and
Grimm	PERSON	's Fairy Tales , of gnomes and giants , of romance and poetry and magic .

		Dantzig ,
Rothenburg	PERSON	,
Hilde	ORGANIZATION	- sheim , Meissen -- all have distinct personalities for Mr.
Schauffler	PERSON	, and he delineates their characters and interrelations most delightfully , as only a tried and discerning friend could do .

		Most of the older German cities , he explains , '' are coy , and cover their charms with a cheap new veil . ''

		But for Mr.
Schauffler	PERSON	the veil hides no secret charms ; he understands them all , and makes them concrete for his readers , until they feel with him as if they were '' walking bodily through the pages of Grimm . ''

		The pictures are in many styles , but all have been chosen with reference to the romantic note .

		Tested by novelty of view-point and charm of style , Mr.
Schauffler	PERSON	's book has few rivals among recent vol - umes of travel-sketches .

		A new and enlarged edition of Mr.
John Muir	PERSON	's '' Our National Parks '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- gives opportu - nity to express further appreciation of that remark - able work .

		Mr.
Muir	PERSON	has suffered much at the hands of the '' forty mile a day '' tourist , but he still thinks that '' the tendency nowadays to wander in wildernesses is delightful to see . ''

		Certainly his descriptions of the wild parks of the West , from the flower-covered tundras of
Alaska	LOCATION	to the sculptured walls of the
Grand Canon	ORGANIZATION	, will incite a genuine desire to wander in them .

		The Yellowstone Park he would have us know as he does -- mountains , geysers , geology , and all -- even to the climbing of
Electric Peak	ORGANIZATION	in a thunder-storm , when '' every hair of your head will stand up and hum and sing like an enthusiastic congregation . ''

		Of the Yosemite he writes still better , for it is his home and his pride .

		In this '' Paradise that makes even the loss of Eden seem insignificant , '' he knows every rock , the name and habit of every stream and bird and flower .

		From his own experience he can say of the trees : '' To learn how they live and behave in pure wild - ness ... you must love them and live with them , as free from schemes and cares and time as the trees themselves . ''

		Both laughable and pathetic is the story of his disappointment when he failed to persuade
Emerson	PERSON	to spend a night with him under the stars . ''

		The mountains are calling , '' he said ; `` run away ! ''

		But the `` indoor philosophy '' of
Emerson	LOCATION	's friends objected . ''

		Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	might take cold , '' and they consigned him to the hotel .

		u And to think , '' reflects Mr.
Muir	PERSON	, '' of this being a
Boston	LOCATION	choice !

		Sad commentary on culture and
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 461 the glorious transcendentalism ! ''

		Mr.
Muir	PERSON	is the prophet of the American forests , and it is for us to see that he is our Isaiah with regard to them , and not our Jeremiah .

		His closing chapter , on the American forest , ought to be known by every citi - zen .

		The wantonness of destruction , the inadequacy of our laws , and the whole u bad , black business , '' is set forth with clearness and force , but without vituperation .

		This is as near as he comes to unduly strong language : '' God has cared for these trees , saved them from drought , disease , avalanches , and a thousand straining , levelling tempests and floods ; but he can not save them from fools , -- only Uncle
Sam	PERSON	can do that . ''

		In the new edition , maps and tables increase the book 's usefulness , and there are many half-tone illustrations showing forests , moun - tains , the Alpine flora of the
Sierras	LOCATION	, their beautiful trout streams , and a few of the native denizens of the Western wilds .

		Miss
Helen A. Clarke	PERSON	, author of ''
Browning	PERSON	's
Italy	LOCATION	'' and ''
Browning	PERSON	's
England	LOCATION	, '' has proved her interest in the environment of the poets of her own land by a study of ''
Longfellow	PERSON	's Country '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		From the quaintly-colored print of colonial houses and a scarlet-coated goodman on the cover , to the last of the well-printed octavo pages , the book is satisfying both to the eye and the mind .

		The fact that the subjects of many of the numerous half-tones are familiar adds to their interest .

		The subject-matter insures both popularity and apprecia - tion by students ; for not only does
Miss Clarke	LOCATION	do justice to the geographical phase of her subject , describing with especial vividness the beauties of the Acadian country and of old
Cambridge	LOCATION	, but she presents accurately the sources of most of the poems .

		Though '' no Skald in song has told '' the story of • • The Skeleton in Armor , '' the `` Saga of Eric the Red '' is reviewed for possible suggestions and pos - sible references to the
New England	LOCATION	coast , and to the reader 's gratification the legends from which
Hiawatha	LOCATION	grew are repeated in full .

		If Miss
Clarke	PERSON	makes it evident that
Longfellow	PERSON	was not '' slavishly accurate as to the succession of events '' -- or even as to the events themselves -- she gives us all the more reason to credit him with originality .

		It may be disappointing to know that the Acadians did not live as ideal a life as
Longfellow	LOCATION	depicts , that the schooner wrecked on
Norman	PERSON	's Woe was not the Hesperus , and that
Paul Revere	PERSON	did not `` stamp the earth '' of the
Charleston	LOCATION	shore waiting for his signal .

		But on the whole the author adds more to the romance of the poems than she takes away , and the familiarity which results from her study breeds new love and admiration .

		The role of author-illustrator is a difficult one , too often played badly ; but Mr.
Ernest Peixotto	PERSON	is competent for it , as he proves anew by his skilful conduct of his readers M Through the French Pro- vinces '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Sometimes he takes them by motor-boat , sometimes by motor-car , but always in the pleasant company of a traveller alert to discover picturesqueness hidden in out-of-the-way corners , and able to impart his enthusiasms with the pen as well as with the tools of his own craft .

		His literary work is not at all remarkable , -- only the graceful and agreeable relation of personal experiences and impressions , many of which are visualized , naturally with much more force and finish , in the illustrations .

		As an artist , Mr.
Peixotto	PERSON	's first interest in rural
France	LOCATION	seems to be architecture ; for nearly every picture represents a building or a group of buildings .

		Motor-boat excursions down the Seine from
Poissy	LOCATION	to
Rouen	LOCATION	and up the poplar-fringed Oise , trips to gay Parisian suburbs like ''
Robinson	PERSON	'' or to little - known chateaux near
Fontainebleau	LOCATION	, motor journeys through the provinces , with stops at towns like
Limoges	LOCATION	,
Carcassonne	LOCATION	,
Cordes	PERSON	, and
Chinon	ORGANIZATION	, com - prise Mr.
Peixotto	PERSON	's inviting itinerary .

		The material - minded tourist will be glad to know that Mr.
Peixotto	PERSON	is an epicure as well as an artist ; he does not forget to tell which inns are comfortable , as well as which are picturesque .

		Indeed , his strong insist - ence on creature-comforts is a little amusing , though we refer to it here merely to call attention to the diversity of interests covered by his book .

		The county of Worcestershire is the subject of one of those beautiful color-books that English artists and publishers are uniting nowadays to produce in great profusion .

		In this instance , Mr.
Thomas Tyndale	PERSON	is the illustrator , Mr.
A. G. Bradley	PERSON	his literary coadjutor , and
Messrs. Maemillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		There are twenty-five alluring glimpses of English villages and country-sides , which go far to support Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	's theory that Worcestershire deserves more than it gets of the tourist 's attention ; and there is a map to freshen one 's geographical memory and at the same time to suggest feasible trips through the county .

		The text is a conventional resume '' , historical and descriptive in about equal measure .

		As the storm-centre of the
Civil Wars	ORGANIZATION	, Worcestershire has a romantic past affording ample material for the historical survey .

		Topographically , the river Severn and the
Malvern	LOCATION	hills lend it a cer - tain distinction .

		Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	does not deal much in superlatives , which is no doubt one important reason why his descriptions are pleasing .

		Again , he wisely assumes no responsibility for exhaustiveness , particularly where architectural or industrial details are concerned , but follows a leisurely course of his own , along the Severn and the Avon , and traverses more hastily the less picturesque north-east section , loitering in the little villages along the way to point out what he finds significant or characteristic in each of them .

		And in the same spirit of individualism Mr.
Tyndale	PERSON	's pictures are painted .

		A picturesque glimpse of a rarely visited portion of
Northern Africa	LOCATION	, namely , the state of
Tripoli	LOCATION	, is afforded by Mr.
Charles Wellington Furlong	PERSON	's `` The Gateway to the Sahara '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Mr.
Furlong	PERSON	is fortunate in having a very definite object in view , and more fortunate in having achieved it .

		Here is no ill-assorted guide-book miscellanea , no mass of unrelated detail passed on from an author bewildered by his conglomeration of notes , to a 462 THE DIAI , -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, reader certain to be even more bewildered .

		Instead , there is real insight into the unique fascination of the most unspoiled of the Barbary capitals , pictures , full of color and atmosphere , of its life and of the strange peoples who inhabit the oases and plateaus of
Tripoli	LOCATION	* The story of the Greek sponge-divers and of the esparto-pickers is told with vivid detail ; and the same power to vitalize a narrative charac - terizes the account of a journey across the
Sahara	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Furlong	PERSON	has pointed , drawn , and photographed
Tripoli	LOCATION	, besides writing about it ; and he has done all four things well .

		One of the important figures , both in pictures and text , is naturally the camel -- '' dignified , patient , defiant , imperturbable . ''

		Mr.
Furlong	PERSON	understands the camel as he understands many other things oriental , and the chapter on '' Camel Traits '' is one of his cleverest .

		In this , as throughout the book , the transcription of Arab stories and proverbs adds greatly to the effect of local color .

		The cathedral is always the heart of its city -- the magnet that draws and holds the tourist .

		Its charm is too complex to be quickly exhausted .

		Each new angle of vision reveals fresh wonders , wrought by many minds and hands , in many periods .

		Some - what thus does Miss
Esther Singleton	PERSON	justify her choice of subject for the latest addition to a well - known series of compilations edited by her , -- `` Fa - mous Cathedrals as Seen and Described by Great Writers '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It was of course impossible to include in one volume all the notable cathedrals ; so Miss
Singleton	PERSON	has added to those universally agreed upon as the most celebrated , others that will offer to the reader the greatest pos - sible variety of instruction and pleasure .

		A still more varied programme is secured by mingling architectural , descriptive , and historical selections , and including a few impressionistic pictures , like Mr.
Arthur Synions	PERSON	's of Bourges , and
Gautier	PERSON	's of
St. Isaac	LOCATION	.

		Each selection is accompanied by an excellent photograph of the cathedral in question .

		Altogether Miss
Singleton	PERSON	has achieved an excellent handbook , interesting in itself and well adapted to introduce its readers to more detailed and less alluring studies of cathedral lore .

		Book lovers who have an eye for richly-colored pictures , and are the better pleased if the scenes are grand and wonderful , will find their taste abund - antly satisfied by the volume on Kashmir written by Sir
Francis Younghusband	PERSON	, British Resident at
Srinagar	LOCATION	, and illustrated with seventy-five full-color reproductions of paintings by
Major Molyneux	ORGANIZATION	.

		These views of the lofty peaks of the
Himalayas	LOCATION	, with wooded valleys or blue mountain streams or masses of gorgeous flowers in the foreground , are so lavishly and strikingly beautiful that they would be condemned as melodramatic if the text did not bear them out .

		Sir
Francis	PERSON	's writing is much more than a gloss for the pictures , and fully describes the entire region , including its history , government , industries , and resources -- especially its resources in the matter of recreation and sport .

		One can not close the book without exclaiming with
Bernier	PERSON	, '' In truth , the kingdom surpasses in beauty all that my warmest imagination had anticipated . ''

		The volume is a thick octavo , bound in dark red , half gilt , with a border suggestive of the designs of elaborate Indian textiles .

Holiday Editions of Standard Books	ORGANIZATION	.

		Surely no richer tribute could be paid by the artist brotherhood to a poet 's memory than this cen - tennial year has brought to
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	.

		At least five beautiful editions of the Rubstiy ^ t have been published within three months ; two of them ranking among the few most notable illustrated books of the year .

		A gold-and-white cover with fantastic and beautiful symbolic decorations is in harmony with the almost fairy-like beauty of the edition of
Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton	ORGANIZATION	, for which Mr.
Edmund Dulac	PERSON	has made the illustrations .

		The same artist 's pictures for the '' Arabian Nights '' suggest what he will do here ; but in the newer illustrations the element of grotesqueness is mini - mized , and the atmosphere of wonder and enchant - ment , of beauty , mystical , oriental , multi-colored , is enhanced .

		There are twenty pictures , some inter - preting a stanza , some a line or a phrase .

		These are separately mounted on vellum-finished paper within rich gold borders that have the effect of frames .

		The text of the poem is printed in large clear type on pages with more formal decoration .

		In every respect the volume is mechanically worthy of the art which the illustrator has expended to make it a thing of beauty .

		-- The '' FitzGerald Centenary Edition '' -LRB-
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is illustrated and decorated by another master of the craft , Mr.
Willy Pogany	PERSON	.

		His designs , richly im - aginative , very original , and full of oriental imagery and atmosphere , form an interesting contrast with those of Mr.
Dulac	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Pogany	PERSON	has lettered each stanza of the poem in a style suggesting Arabic characters , and made for each a special border in several colors .

		-- The familiar designs of Mr.
Gil	PERSON	- bert
James	PERSON	, with their quaint formality and curious detail , are the distinguishing feature of a third edi - tion of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's masterpiece , published by the Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	.

		The pictures are reproduced in full color , and there are borders and other deco - rations in tint .

		An introduction and notes by Pro- fessor
Reynold Alley ne Nicholson	ORGANIZATION	, lecturer in Persian at
Cambridge University	ORGANIZATION	, gives to this edition scholarly as well as artistic distinction .

		-- A less pretentious edition comes from the Messrs.
J. B. Lippincott Co.	PERSON	, with introduction , notes , and a life of Omar , by Mr.
Joseph Jacobs	PERSON	, and illustrations and borders by Mr.
Frank Brangwyn	PERSON	.

		The deco - rative work is very interesting , but the strong real - ism of the illustrations makes them rather repulsive to at least one reader .

		-- Finally , we have another small edition , with Mr.
Gilbert James	PERSON	's illustrations reproduced in tint , from
Messrs. Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Like all this publisher 's editions , it is attractively printed ; it is on hand-made paper , and the board

		THE DIAL , 463 covers are Japanese in effect , if
Japan	LOCATION	was not actually the source of the material used .

		Of all
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	's decorative work , his drawings for the '' Morte D'Arthur '' are generally conceded to be the finest .

		The original edition containing them was issued some sixteen years ago , in two volumes , and has , of course , long been out of print .

		All the original designs and illustrations are now reproduced in a one-volume edition -LRB-
Dutton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , limited to fifteen hundred copies printed from type .

		At present the popular taste runs to colored illus - tration , which modern processes of color-printing have made possible in such perfection ; but black - and-white has a charm of its own , and
Beardsley	PERSON	's reputation as one of the greatest artists in that me - dium is unquestioned .

		It is unnecessary to speak of his style , but readers unfamiliar with the first edition of the u Morte D'Arthur '' will like to know that the present work contains twenty full-page illustrations , besides numberless chapter headings , page borders , head and tail pieces , and incidental decorations .

		As in the original edition , the text is that of
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	, with modern spelling , and there is an introduction by Professor
Rhys	PERSON	.

		The cover is embellished with a floral design by
Beardsley	PERSON	, printed in gold on green cloth .

		Two illustrated editions of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's '' Tales '' com - memorate the centennial year of the author 's birth .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons issue them in a vol - ume uniform with their illustrated edition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's poems published last
fall	DATE	, and with two dozen half - tones from drawings by the same artist , Mr.
Fred	PERSON	- erick
Simpson Coburn	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Coburn	PERSON	has already shown his ability to interpret
Poe	PERSON	pictorially , and here as elsewhere the spirit of his drawings is in tune with the '' grotesque and arabesque '' humor of the text .

		-- '' Selected Tales of Mystery '' -LRB-
Lippin	PERSON	- cott -RRB- is the title chosen for the other edition , which is a stout royal oct?vo volume , sumptuously printed in large type , and strikingly illustrated in color by Mr.
Byam Shaw	PERSON	.

		The cover design at once strikes the dominant notes of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's work ; it is intense in coloring , intense in realism , subtle in suggestion .

		No half-hearted appreciation of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's genius is pos - sible to the reader of this edition .

		He will shiver and thrill perforce to the horror of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's grewsome inventions .

		He may dislike Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's pictures ; he may decide that they disregard too much the mys - ticism of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	.

		and make the horror of the tales too earthy .

		But he can not fail to get a vivid and vital impression of some sort , that will , in one way or another , vivify and vitalize his impression of
Poe	PERSON	.

		And that is one important mission of the illustrator 's art .

		Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	, author-illustrator , has be - taken himself and his camera to the
Maine	LOCATION	woods , and , following the trail broken by
Thoreau	PERSON	on his three trips to the northern wilderness , has brought back some beautiful photographs of rushing streams , lonely log-camps , forest-bordered lakes , and wood - land glens , with a few of campers and canoemen for variety .

		These , reproduced in half-tone , with a photogravure for frontispiece , comprise the illustra - tive material in a new holiday edition of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's `` The
Maine	LOCATION	Woods '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Nextto `` Walden , '' this is probably
Thoreau	PERSON	's most popular work .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's landscapes make a delightful accompan - iment to the descriptions ; but it seems a trifle pre - sumptuous to people
Thoreau	PERSON	's wilds with figures obviously of to-day , quite unrelated to
Thoreau	PERSON	and his narrative .

		A less heavily begilded cover would also , in our opinion , harmonize better with
Thoreau	PERSON	's style and the taste of his admirers .

		Print and paper are excellent .

		A dainty holiday edition of
Lowell	LOCATION	's famous country idyl , ■ The Courtin ' , '' comes from the press of
Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A note of intro - duction explains how the poem came into being quite by accident , and was finished to meet the demands of its admirers for an end that did not exist .

		The full text of the poem is printed on pages decoratively bordered ; and then follow pic - tures in color by Mr.
Arthur I. Keller	PERSON	, illustrating it line by line .

		Finally , there is the facsimile of an original manuscript of the poem made by the author for a book of autographs .

		End-papers gay with Cupids and a novel cover complete a thoroughly artistic gift-book .

		Mr.
Keller	PERSON	's work is , as usual , full of life and humor , and exquisite in finish and coloring .

		His incidental decorations are particularly clever in conception .

		Quaint pictures , redolent with Christmas fun and frolic , gay in spirit and in coloring , old-time in flavor and very English , are the feature of a new edition of
Washington	LOCATION	Irving 's '' Old Christmas '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , that classic account of an old-fashioned English Yule-tide .

		The stage-coach and its passengers , the village choir , the Christmas balk and the Christmas dinner -- all are depicted by Mr.
Cecil Aldin	PERSON	with wonderful spirit and much humor .

		On the front cover the stage-coach , its Christmas travellers laden with Christmas bundles , puts one immediately in the holiday mood -- the right mood , surely , for enjoying what is to come .

		Even the small decorations are managed in a thoroughly original way .

		Altogether this is the most Christmas-like edition of '' Old Christmas '' that we remember to have seen .

		Illustrated Books of Fiction .

		Prominent among the season 's illustrated novel - ettes is Mrs.
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	's '' Susanna and Sue '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		There are pictures in color by Mrs.
Alice Barber Stephens	PERSON	, and delicately wrought chapter-headings by Mr.
N. C. Wyeth	PERSON	, besides an especially designed cover and the inevitable page - borders .

		But the main thing is the story , which , if it is not one of Mrs.
Wiggin	PERSON	's happiest efforts , is still thoroughly delightful , with its quaint and un - usual setting , -- a Shaker village in
Maine	LOCATION	, -- its charming child heroine , and its simple , straightfor - ward answer to one of the great questions of life .

		Susanna married in haste , and , having long repented at leisure , she suddenly decided to revolt .

		She chose as refuge a Shaker settlement , where she and her 464 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, little girl lived for several months , entering into the wholesome , if drab-colored , life of the community which brought queer questions to the child 's lips , put new thoughts into the mother 's heart , and finally sent her back , at Thanksgiving time , to the husband and son she had abandoned .

		The simple Shakers are drawn with thorough understanding , and little Sue is , like all Mrs.
Wiggin	PERSON	's children , a very real and a very lovable child .

		Mr.
Ralph Henry Barbour	PERSON	has chosen `` The Lilac Girl '' as the title of his annual novelette for
1910	DATE	, and the publishers -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- have bound it in lilac , with lilacs on the end-papers and title - page , besides appropriate marginal drawings and pictures in color .

		The tale , like all Mr.
Barbour	PERSON	's , is unalloyed romance .

		The hero , being engaged in prospecting for gold , gets a fleeting glimpse of the heroine on the rear platform of an overland express , is mistaken by her for a train-robber , tells her that he loves her , inquires her name , promises to come for her , and receives as a pledge of her faith '' a faded spray of purple lilac , '' all within a space of five minutes .

		And after many strange complica - tions and stranger coincidences , he keeps his word , and wins the somewhat capricious heart of the
Lilac Girl	ORGANIZATION	.

		The tale is at once sufficiently brief , improb - able , and cleverly told , to make an hour or so pass pleasantly , and the setting is pretty enough to ensure the book 's being a popular gift '' from Him to Her . '' ''

		Where the Laborers are Few '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- is the title of a delightful new '' Old Chester Tale , '' which , with flowers on the cover , trees , brooks , and corn - fields in the page-margins , and three illustrations by Mrs.
Alice Barber Stephens	PERSON	, makes a decidedly inviting gift-book .

		Dr. Lavender ,
Willy King	PERSON	, and the Jay '' girls '' reappear in the new story , whose chief character is a one-legged ex-trapeze-performer , stranded in Old Chester by an accident to his one remaining '' limb , '' as the Jay girls chastely put it .

		When he appeared poor little Miss
Jane Jay	PERSON	sud - denly discovered that there was more in life than genteel poverty , afghans to knit , and pet cats to love and to mourn .

		What she did when the ex-trapeze - performer limped gayly away from Old Chester is left to the reader 's imagination .

		Pictures in color by Mr.
Stanley M. Arthurs	PERSON	, and a preface '' setting forth how and why the two tales are one , '' comprise the distinctive features of a holi - day reprint of '' Posson Jone ' '' and ''
Pere Raphael	PERSON	, '' both prime favorites among Mr.
George W. Cable	PERSON	's many delightful Creole stories .

		Mr.
Cable	PERSON	explains how he found '' Posson Jone '' practically ready - made one day in Royal Street ,
New Orleans	LOCATION	, and how , after being '' kept many years in the closest companionship of
Jules	PERSON	and the Parson by the flat - tering willingness of public audiences to hear their episode recounted , '' he finally '' accused his blithe hero of having another story , as you might say , con - cealed on his person , '' -- and the sequel ensued .

		Mr.
Arthurs	PERSON	's pictures are spirited , and the cover has the decorative touch that is expected of the artistic gift-book .

		Appropriately adorned with blue blossoms on cover and page-borders , Mrs.
Frances Hodgson Bur	PERSON	- nett 's '' The Land of the Blue Flower '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has the right appearance , as well as the right message , for
Christmas	DATE	.

		For the blue flower is the symbol of peace and good-will ; in the land where it flourished there was no time to be angry or worried or idle or jealous ; no place for gloom or misery .

		The allegory is simply and prettily told , and its symbolism runs quite in the trend of much modern thought .

		Mr.
Sigismond de Ivan	PERSON	- owski furnishes a very beautiful frontispiece . ''

		The Star of Love '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , by Mrs.
Florence Morse Kingsley	PERSON	, is a novel based upon the Biblical story of
Esther	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Arthur E. Becher	PERSON	has made eight paintings to accompany it , which are repro - duced in full color , and chapter headings in black - and-white .

		In outline , the story follows closely the Biblical narrative , which is amplified into an absorb - ing romance by the introduction of much picturesque detail and effective dialogue .

		The author is a close student of sacred history , and her first novel , as well as several succeeding ones , had a Biblical theme ; though she is probably best known for that clever little commentary on the mysterious movings of
Providence	LOCATION	, '' The Transfiguration of Miss Philura . ''

		Under the striking caption , `` The Ruinous Face '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- , Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	retells the familiar tale of
Helen of Troy	ORGANIZATION	as the tragedy of a beautiful woman hungering for spiritual love , which , because of her overwhelming beauty , never came to her .

		Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	brings to this short story all the subtlety , suggestiveness , and finish that make his novels nota - ble .

		Page borders , and reproductions of three fam - ous paintings of the too-fair
Helen	PERSON	, are the decorative features .

		Admirers of the rather obvious humor of ''
Josiah Allen	PERSON	's Wife '' -LRB- Miss
Marietta Holly	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- -- and they are legion -- L will rejoice to hear that , having fol - lowed the fortunes of Samantha at
Saratoga	LOCATION	,
St. Louis	LOCATION	, and around the world , they may now hear • '
Samantha	PERSON	on Children 's Rights . ''

		Samantha 's wit and wisdom on the rearing of the young are displayed in the course of a story full of children and fathers and mothers , whose varied relations are laughable one minute and tragic the next .

		As usual ,
Samantha	PERSON	recounts her experiences in spelling bewilderingly phonetic .

		One more token of a genius come too late into his own is furnished by a beautifully illustrated quarto volume entitled ``
Simeon Solomon	PERSON	, an Appreciation , '' by Mrs.
Julia Ellsworth Ford	PERSON	-LRB-
New York	LOCATION	:
Frederick Fairchild Sherman	PERSON	-RRB- .

		To the average reader , the name of
Simeon Soloman	PERSON	conveys nothing ; yet in his own time
Rossetti	PERSON	and
Swinburne	PERSON	befriended him warmly , and
Burne-Jones	PERSON	spoke of him as '' the rising genius , '' and called his designs '' as imagina - tive as anything he had ever seen . ''

		The wonderful promise of his early work was never fulfilled ; the same vivid imagination that marks his drawings
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 465 became , in his daily life , a restless fancy that led him into all sorts of dissipation , wrecked his friendships , and brought his career to a tragic close .

		Like
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Soloman	PERSON	was a poet-painter .

		His '' Vision of Love Revealed in Sleep '' has lately been twice reprinted , and his exquisite illustrations for `` The Song of Songs '' have appeared in a volume prepared for publication by Mrs.
Ford	ORGANIZATION	.

		Now we have the `` Appreciation , '' with numerous excellent reproduc - tions of
Solomon	ORGANIZATION	's art , -- particularly of the ideal heads in chalk or pencil , of which he was so prolific in his second period , -- and selected passages from the '' Vision , '' with a critical introduction .

		All this indi - cates the awakening of popular interest , which Mrs.
Ford	ORGANIZATION	's quarto will at once stimulate and gratify .

		There are twenty-three full-page reproductions in tint , which fully exhibit the strength and the weak - ness of
Solomon	ORGANIZATION	's achievement .

		Except possibly in a dominant note of sadness , the artist 's marred life does not in any way affect his work , which suggests that of Burne-Jones , at the same time that it is strongly original .

		Both the drawings and the poem will well repay the attention which Mrs.
Ford	PERSON	asks for them , and which her competent criticism and well-proportioned exposition do much to focus .

		Each year
Miss Elisabeth Luther Cary	ORGANIZATION	becomes more widely known as an art critic with a keen appreciation of many types of work , and a sugges - tive and stimulating manner of imparting her ideas and opinions .

		Her latest work , '' Artists Past and Present '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- contains a dozen '' random studies '' of as many artists , from
Jan Steen	PERSON	to Miss
Mary Cassatt	PERSON	.

		Most of them , how - ever , are contemporary , -- the only quality they have in common .

		One of the best sketches is that of
Carl Larsson	PERSON	, the Swedish painter , with its pleasant mingling of biography and criticism .


Alfred Stevens	PERSON	is treated almost entirely with refer - ence to his color-schemes and his emphasis on costume ;
Jacques Callot	PERSON	-- to go back to a seven - teenth century engraver -- is utilized for a study in temperament .

		An essay on '' One Side of Modern German Painting '' deals with its '' resolute indi - vidualism , a determination to express the inner life of the artist , his temperament and predilections and his mood , at whatever cost of technical facility . ''

		That on '' Two Spanish Painters '' harks back to
last winter	DATE	's exhibitions of the work of Sorolla and
Zuloaga	PERSON	.

		All are keen , penetrating , appreciative , aud sensible .

		Three or four illustrations in tint accompany each study , and , with a tasteful cover , make the volume as attractive in appearance as it is stimulating in content .

		`` Christmas in Art '' -LRB-
Duffield	PERSON	-RRB- is the work of Mr.
Frederick Keppel	PERSON	, the well-known connoisseur of prints and engravings .

		The many illustrations are chiefly reproductions of rare prints of the Nativity by fifteenth and sixteenth century artists ; but there are some more familiar pictures .

		Each is accom - panied by a paragraph of comment , skilfully con - trived to bring out its essential quality or especial point of interest .

		The text discusses , in rambling , informal fashion , the pictures and their artists , Christmas music and poetry , and quaint Christmas customs in many lands .

		Illustrated Nature Books . ''

		Dutch Bulbs and Gardens '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with pictures in color by Miss
Mima Nixon	PERSON	and text by the
Misses Una Silberrad	ORGANIZATION	and
Sophie Lyall	PERSON	, is natu - rally a book to delight all lovers of flowers and gardens ; but the story of bulb-growing in
Holland	LOCATION	is entertaining enough to make a much wider appeal , and the authors have taken full advantage of that fact to introduce a variety of interests besides the horticultural one .

		The best time to see the gar - dens , it seems , is in
June	DATE	, when the great mass of the flowering is over , and individual beauties can be noticed , when the tall hedges are green , and the iris , ranunculus , early gladioli , and many lilies , in addition to the
spring	DATE	bulbs , are in bloom .

		And the way to see them is not in a hasty carriage drive , but in a leisurely walk with the bulb-grower through his domains .

		Then you will see not merely im - pressionistic splashes of wonderful blue or pink or yellow ; but also the flowers .

		Of course the authors have visited the bulb-district many times and in different seasons .

		Miss Silberrad writes of the present-day aspects of the subject , while
Miss Lyall	PERSON	tells of the hyacinth and tulip trades in their prime .

		The pictures , in generous number , show us the bulb - gardens in all their glow of multi-colored splendor , -- until we quite forget Miss Silberrad 's stern reminder that the blossoms are a mere incident , to be ruthlessly mown down before their beauty is spent ; for the cul - ture and sale of the ugly brown bulbs is the sole reason for the existence of so much loveliness .

		Did the acquiring of a spade and a garden bring the '' Hermit '' who writes of '' The Garden in the Wilderness '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- facility with the pen ?

		If so , it must be conceded that for literary purposes the spade is more potent than the sword .

		The title of the book is misleading , in respect that the author is a woman , and married , and in respect that the location of her garden is not a wilderness .

		To be literal , the '' Hermit '' and her husband are artists who met over a bowl of nasturtiums in a
New York	LOCATION	studio , who fell in love , wedded , and moved into the country .

		Her stories of Mr.
Schweine	PERSON	- hunden the gardener , Vagrant the dog ,
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	the txirtle , and other country friends , are most entertaining .

		There is plenty of sentiment , too ; but the ground-work of the little volume is garden-lore .

		A dainty green binding with nastur - tium design , and many half-tones , in addition to drawings by the Hermit and ''
Bentley	PERSON	, '' illustrate the beauties of the garden .

		Anthologies and Year-Books .

		Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	, indefatigable maker of antholo - gies , has this year edited a companion volume to '' The Ladies ' Pageant , '' that happy assembling of real and imaginary heroines .

		He calls it '' Some Friends of Mine : A Rally of Men '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		466 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, On the whole , the new book has less of the charac - teristic
Lucas	PERSON	quality than any of those that have preceded it .

		Perhaps Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	does not think playful fancy suitable to the consideration of stern masculinity .

		At any rate the nomenclature of his portrait gallery is straightforward and unadorned , and he has almost entirely excluded fictitious char - acters , going to writers like
Vasari	PERSON	,
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, Mr.
C. J. Apperley	PERSON	, Mr.
S. Baring-Gould	PERSON	,
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	, and Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	, for keen characteri - zations of actual persons .

		A large part of this material will be absolutely new to the average reader , who will find this volume , if the least witty , far from being the least interesting of the
Lucas	PERSON	anthologies .

		From the wide fields of English and American poetry Mr.
Willis Boyd Allen	PERSON	has industriously culled some of the numberless tributes to the modest violet ; and they are gathered in '' The Violet Book '' -LRB-
George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Its pages are strewn with '' pale violets '' and masses of '' deep violets '' adorn its cover .

		It is a pity that so pretty a con - ception should be marred by a tasteless frontispiece -- which also appears on the cover of the volume .

		`` The Book of Christmas , '' published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is an anthology of prose and poetry , attractively grouped and entitled , in the fashion that has recently brought the anthology again into popu - lar favor .

		A graceful introduction by Mr.
Hamilton W. Mabie	PERSON	analyzes the Christmas spirit and suggests what a true '' Book of Christmas '' should stand for .

		Scattered through the little book are a dozen appro - priate reproductions from the Old Masters , and an ornamental title-page for each group of quotations has been drawn by Mr.
George Wharton Edwards	PERSON	.

		Miscellaneous Gift-Books .

		Two beautiful illustrated volumes from the presses of the
Tandy-Thomas Co.	ORGANIZATION	are based , respectively , on the text of '' Thanatopsis '' and the words of our national anthem -- if ''
America	LOCATION	'' is our national anthem .

		For the latter , Mr.
Walter Tittle	PERSON	has designed pages richly illuminated and lettered in the style of an old missal , to contain the title of the volume -- `` My Country '' -- a dedication , and a brief account of the author and the song .

		A col - ored portrait of
Francis Smith	PERSON	follows , and the stanzas of the song in facsimile of the author 's handwriting , framed in illuminated borders .

		For each line of each stanza there is an illustration , or , more accurately , a picture suggested by the words .

		Many of these are faithful treatments of some striking American scene , -- the statue of Liberty in
New York	LOCATION	harbor ,
Niagara Falls	LOCATION	, the Garden of the Gods , the Capitol at
Washington	LOCATION	, -- each set within an illuminated border .

		-- The pages of '' Thanatopsis '' are of Italian handmade paper , in a brown tint .

		On them are mounted thirty etchings , after designs by Mr.
Walworth Stilson	PERSON	.

		Half are illustrations ; the others contain the hand-lettered text of the poem sorrounded by appropriate decora - tions .

		The book is of quarto size , simply bound in brown boards , with parchment back .

		Mr.
Stilson	PERSON	's landscapes are varied and beautiful ; and they are all full of the solemn majesty that is the dominating note of the poem .

		Readers of Miss
Mary Caroline Crawford	PERSON	's ''
St. Botolph	LOCATION	's Town '' published last year , will be glad to know that she has continued the history of old
Boston	LOCATION	-- why should we not say young
Boston	LOCATION	?

		-- from the dawn of the Revolution , where she left it , until the town became a city and thereby entered upon another epoch .

		The new book , therefore , covers the formative period , `` when the peculiar gen - ius of
Boston	LOCATION	was beginning to find itself in art , in politics , and in civic life . ''

		Miss
Crawford	PERSON	does not say much about politics , and the artists rather than the arts are her concern .

		Pursuing much the plan of `` St.
Botolph	PERSON	's Town , '' she has made seventeen related , yet independent , studies of men and move - ments .

		The illustrative material is varied and in - teresting : it includes old prints and engravings , por - traits , and modern photographs or drawings of his - toric sites . ''

		Old Boston Days and Ways '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , as interpreted by
Miss Crawford	PERSON	with accuracy , vivacity , and the novelty due to the use of a considerable body of new material , are cer - tainly not wanting in interest for readers of to-day .

		Several years ago , Mrs.
Anna Benneson McMahan	PERSON	offered to holiday book-buyers a fanciful little volume , telling , with imagined detail , the story of the presentation of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's `` Midsummer Night 's Dream '' at the Christmas revels before Queen
Bess	PERSON	and her court .

		This year , in somewhat similar vein , she relates '' Shakespeare 's Love Story , '' weaving into her idyllic picture of his romantic adventure such of the sonnets as suit her purpose .

		She does not mean , she explains , to propound a new '' theory '' of their origin ; only to show that , read thus in connection with his life , they show him as capable of inspired love making as he was of in - spired poetry .

		The publishers , Messrs.
A. C. Mc	PERSON	-
Clurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, have devised a very pretty setting for the book .

		The illustrations are printed separately in tint on thin paper , and framed , as it were , in tinted borders ; while cover and end-papers carry out the same color scheme .

		Fourteen exquisite volumes comprise the output of Mr.
Thomas B. Mosher	PERSON	for the present holiday season .

		The smaller books include
Milton	PERSON	's '' Ode on the Nativity , ''
Eugene Lee-Hamilton	PERSON	's ''
Mimma Bella	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	's `` Proverbs in
Porce	LOCATION	- lain , ''
Browning	PERSON	's '' Rabbi
Ben Ezra	PERSON	, ''
Baudelaire	PERSON	's `` Poems in Prose , '' Pater 's `` The Child in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' Olive
Schreiner	PERSON	's '' The Lost Joy , ''
Henley	PERSON	's '' Rhymes and Rhythms , '' and '' A Little Book for
John O'Mahony	PERSON	's Friends , '' by Mrs.
Katharine Tynan	PERSON	.

		The five larger books -LRB- none of them incon - veniently large -RRB- are , '' Silhouettes , '' by Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	; '' A Wayside Lute , '' by Miss
Lizette W. Reese	PERSON	; '' Felise : A Book of Lyrics , '' by
A. C. Swin	PERSON	- burne ; '' The Land of Heart 's Desire , '' by Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	; and
Francis Thompson	PERSON	's posthumous essay on Shelley .

		Here is good literary fare indeed , and
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 467 garnished in a way that appeals to the most fastidious taste .

		As we have often said before , these are the ideal books for modest Christmas remembrances .

		Two books of sermons suggested by the life of Christ have been issued in illustrated editions .

		`` Bethlehem to Olivet '' -LRB-
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by that well-known writer on religious themes , Dr.
J. R. Miller	PERSON	, is described in the sub-title as '' The Life of Jesus Christ Illustrated by Modern Painters . ''

		In reality , however , Dr.
Miller	PERSON	has presupposed on his reader 's part a knowledge of the facts of the Bible narrative , and , using them merely as points of departure , brings out the message of each incident for the world of to-day .

		For each chapter there is a suitable illustration from the work of some noted painter .

		-- `` With Christ in Palestine '' -LRB-
R. F. Fenno & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- contains four addresses by Rev. Dr.
A. T. Schofield	PERSON	, of
London	LOCATION	, all suggested by a recent trip through the Holy Land , and illustrated by photo - graphs of the country . ''

		The Seven Ages of Childhood '' -LRB-
Moffat	PERSON	, Yard -RRB- is a book of pictures by Miss
Jessie Willcox Smith	PERSON	, with verses to accompany them from the versatile pen of Miss
Carolyn Wells	PERSON	.

		Miss Wells 's verses are neat and witty , and
Miss Smith	ORGANIZATION	's pictures , which include large pictures in color and many dainty little groups at the top and bottom of the pages , are quite as charming as usual .

		The
Season	ORGANIZATION	's Books for the
Young	ORGANIZATION	.

		The following is a list of all children 's books published during the present season and received at the office of The
Diax	ORGANIZATION	up to the time of going to press with this issue .

		The titles are classified in a general way , and brief descriptions of most of the books are given .

		It is believed that this list will commend itself to
Holiday	ORGANIZATION	purchasers as a convenient and trustworthy guide to the juvenile books of
1909	DATE	.

		The reported serious illness of
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	lends interest to the announcement that his last novel , `` Mary , '' published about two years ago , is now added , in a transla - tion by Miss
Mary Morison	PERSON	, to the English series issued in uniform shape by the

		From
England	LOCATION	comes the announcement that
King Edward	ORGANIZATION	has knighted
Frederick Macmillan	PERSON	, the present head of the English publishing house of
Macmillan & Company	ORGANIZATION	, and a director of
The Macmillan Company of New York	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Macmillan	PERSON	is the son of the original founder ,
Daniel Macmillan	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Rutger B. Jewett	PERSON	, manager of John Lane Com - pany , has lately completed an arrangement with Mr.
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	by which
John Lane Company	ORGANIZATION	will , in future , be Mr.
Phillpotts	PERSON	' publishers in

		The first of Mr.
Phillpotts	PERSON	' novels to be issued under this arrangement was '' The Haven . '' ''

		A College Text-Book of Geology '' is added to the ''
American Science Series '' of Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the authors being Professors
Thomas C. Cham	PERSON	- berlin and
Rollin D. Salisbury	PERSON	.

		It makes a stout volume of nearly a thousand pages , amply illustrated , and maintaining in every respect the high standard of the series to which it belongs .

		Mr.
E. Byrne Hackett	PERSON	, who for the past three years has been in charge of the publishing department of
The Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	, recently severed his con - nection with that firm to take charge of the affairs of the
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	, with offices in
New York City	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
W. B. Parker	PERSON	, who has had a varied pub - lishing experience , will take charge at
The Baker & Taylor Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
J. E. Spingarn	PERSON	's '' Critical Essays of the Seventeenth Century '' is now completed by the publi - cation of a third volume , covering the
last fifteen years 1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 473 of the period , and including examples of ten writers , among them being
Temple	ORGANIZATION	,
Wotton	LOCATION	,
Blackmore	PERSON	, Con - greve , and
Collier	PERSON	.

		There is a bibliography of the sub - ject , and an index to the entire work .

		Mr.

		A volume of '' Reminiscences and Sketches '' by Mr.
Charles Forster Smith	PERSON	, mostly reprinted from periodi - cals , is published by
Messrs. Smith & Lamar	ORGANIZATION	,
Nashville	LOCATION	.

		Its two dozen numbers include papers upon literary and scholastic worthies , on literature and education , and on Southern life and character .

		We note with particular pleasure the essays on Charles
Kendall Adams	PERSON	and Richard
Malcolm Johnston	PERSON	.

		There are a dozen por - trait illustrations .

		The celebrated virtuoso
Herr Eugen d' Albert	PERSON	has been enlisted by the

		The first volume , now published , gives us five of the earlier sonatas and a group of seven '' Bagatelles . ''

		The initial volume in this new venture is to be a story of
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	by
Miss Florence Warden	ORGANIZATION	, with the title '' The Empress of the Andes . ''

Vermont	LOCATION	, issues the following announcement : '' The Xew Physics .

		This book demonstrates that sound is corpuscular .

		The demon - stration is complete in every particular .

		8vo .

		335 pages .

		Price 81.25 . ''

		Possibly some significance may be discovered in the fact that this contribution to sci - ence comes from the
Green Mountains	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	send us the following modern language texts : ''
Deutsche Patrioten	ORGANIZATION	in
Russ	PERSON	- land zur Zeit Napoleons , '' by
E. M. Arndt	PERSON	, edited by Professor
W. A. Colwell	PERSON	; '' Les Maitres de la Critique Litte ` raire au XIX .

		Louise
Delpit	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a volume of '' Exercises in French Composition for Schools and Colleges , '' by Mr.
William Koren	PERSON	.

		The death , on the
19th of Xovember	DATE	, of the Rev - erend
John Bannister Tabb	PERSON	, of
Baltimore	LOCATION	, removes an interesting figure from our literature .

		Father
Tabb	PERSON	had a varied career , beginning active life on a blockade - runner in the Civil War , and ending it a Roman Catholic priest .

		It was during his first attempt to run the blockade that Father
Tabb	PERSON	was captured and imprisoned at
Point Lookout	LOCATION	,
Maryland	LOCATION	, where he made the ac - quaintance of
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	, a fellow prisoner ; this was the beginning of a strong friendship between the two men .

		Like
Lanier	PERSON	, Father
Tabb	PERSON	was passionately fond of music , and was himself a musician .

		As a poet , Father
Tabb	PERSON	confined himself to the shorter forms of lyrical verse .

		Many of the most characteristic of his poems are collected in his volume of '' Later Lyrics , '' published by
John Lane Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		For a year or more before his death , Father
Tabb	PERSON	was totally blind ; and this affliction was the subject of some of his most touching and expressive verses .

		Messrs.
D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish the following English texts : '' The Essays of Elia , '' edited by Mr.
H. E. Coblentz	PERSON	;
Ruskin	PERSON	's '' Sesame and Lilies , '' edited by Dr.
Charles R. Gaston	PERSON	; and
Goldsmith	PERSON	's two famous poems -LRB- with Gray 's '' Elegy '' -RRB- , edited by Miss
Rose M. Barton	PERSON	.

		Other English texts are `` Xarrative and Lyric Poems for Students '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , edited by Professor
S. S. Seward	PERSON	, Jr. ; '' Selections from
Byron	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	,
Keats	PERSON	, and
Browning	PERSON	'' -LRB-
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , edited by Messrs.
C. T. Cope	PERSON	land and
H. M. Rideout	PERSON	; and De Quincey 's '' The Spanish Military Nun '' and '' Revolt of the Tartars '' -LRB- Frowde -RRB- , edited by Mr.
V. H. Collins	PERSON	.

		The richness of illustration which gives '' The Inter - national Studio '' foremost place among present-day art magazines is emphasized anew in the latest bound vol ume of that periodical , just sent us by the
John Lane Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		A more varied and interesting feast for the art-lover than that set forth in these four hundred pages could not easily be found .

		Every page contains one or more half-tone reproductions , and there are twenty-one plates in full color .

		A leaning toward the more bizarre tendencies in modern art has always been apparent in `` The International Studio , '' yet it is not allowed to become predominant .

		We are especially glad to note the increasing attention which American art affairs are now receiving in this notable periodical .

		Mr.
Emerson Venable	PERSON	has compiled , and the
Robert Clarke Co.	ORGANIZATION	has published , a work called '' Poets of
Ohio	LOCATION	, '' containing not only representative selections , but also notes and biographical sketches .

		Ohio has had thirty-three poets deemed worthy of inclusion in this volume , and many of them are of more than local renown , as may be shown by mentioning the names of the Cary sisters , Mr. and Mrs.
Piatt	PERSON	,
T. B. Read	PERSON	,
W. D. Howells	PERSON	, and Miss
Edith M. Thomas	PERSON	.

		Altogether ,
Ohio	LOCATION	makes almost as creditable a showing in poetry as in politics .

		The book is dignified in appearance and in editing , but we must confess that it opens up to the imagination an alarming vista of a future procession of commonwealths exploited in similar fashion . ''

		The Best of the World 's Classics '' is the title given to a ten-volume compilation of extracts from the great writers of the world , now published by
Messrs. Funk & Wagnalls	ORGANIZATION	.

		Senator
Henry Cabot Lodge	ORGANIZATION	figures as the editor of this latest effort to popularize literary culture , with Mr.
Francis W. Halsey	PERSON	as his assistant , which we take to mean that Mr.
Halsey	PERSON	has done the lion 's share of the work .

		The volumes , which are of pocketable size , are devoted one each to
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, two each to the Continent and
America	LOCATION	, and four to
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		There is , of course , no perspective in such an allotment , but we never expect it in compila - tions of this class .

		The entire representation of '' other countries '' of the Continent -LRB- besides
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	-RRB- is provided by
Erasmus	LOCATION	,
Cervantes	PERSON	, Ander - sen , Turge ` nieff ,
Djsen	PERSON	, and Tolstoy -- a queerly - assorted half-dozen .

		The contents of these ten volumes are of course good literature , and as such to be recom - mended ; but they are also for the most part snippets , and as such to be avoided .

		Only prose selections are included .

EDWARD HOWARD GRIGGS	PERSON	12mo .

		50c net ; by mail 55c .

		This new book deals with the problem , so acutely important in our money-mad society , of the right use of things -- the relation of man , both individually and collectively taken , to the tools and equipment of civilization .

		Its central thesis forms a trenchant criticism of the persistent superstition that lavish expenditure in careless luxury benefits society .

		The author shows , both by economic argument and historic example , that all use of the power money represents for what is either useless or harmful , forces some one to work harder somewhere in the social structure , and unchecked is paid for at a terrible price in the end .

		Incidentally , there is an illuminating discussion of the causes of panics -- those `` clearing-houses in which we pay our bad debts . ''

		The style is peculiarly forceful and convincing , and the book is full of wis ^ suggestions for the conduct of life .

		His inquiry , following the lines of the

Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	, and the foreign plots growing out ` of the question of the navigation of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, which led up to it .

		He furnishes new and interesting material with reference to the
Aaron Burr	PERSON	conspir - acy ; the much studied career of Henry Clay ; the conquest of '' the
Northwest Territory	ORGANIZATION	'' by
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	, etc. .

		The famous
Kentucky Resolutions of 1798	ORGANIZATION	.

		the original text from which
Calhoun	PERSON	and his fellow nullifiers claimed to draw their inspiration , are carefully studied in the light of contemporary documents and newspapers ; and a fac - simile of the original , so often misquoted , is presented .

		NOTES LIST OF NEW BOOKS 524 WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTS .

		An exceptionally sane and well-informed article upon the shortcomings of our newspaper press is contributed by '' an independent journal - ist '' to the last issue of the '' American Journal of Sociology . ''

		The writer is fully sensitive to the evils of our current practice , but does not indulge in that wholesale condemnation which weakens the force of so many attacks upon journalistic methods .

		His point of view is stated in the following sentence : '' The same newspaper arouses your enthusiasm at one time , so that you write , or are tempted to write , to the editor warmly thanking him for his noble efforts , and provokes your anger and disgust at another time , so that you are ready to denounce it at the breakfast table as a poisoner of the public mind and an enemy of decency and truth . ''

		It is just as well to see both sides of the shield , and to recognize the indispensable service which even the '' yellowest '' of newspapers may perform for us , as well as to deplore its sensational or vicious tendencies .

		Unless we bestow praise where praise is due , our indictment will be quashed by the common sense of the average reader .

		The plea upon which journalists excuse most of their aberrations from truth and decency is that they are giving the public what it wants , and that not otherwise may they keep their heads above water in the struggle for existence .

		At least , not otherwise may they conduct profit - able business enterprises , and secure the circu - lation in which , even if got by questionable methods , lies all their potentiality for good .

		The plea is a specious one , and is often allowed without very close scrutiny ; our present writer takes the bull by the horns , and asks if the pub - lic really does want the things which are dear to the heart of a great many of our reckless press - men . ''

		Does the public demand fabrication , misrepresentation for the sake of effect , sensa - tionalism in the news columns ? ''

		`` Can it be supposed that readers are attracted by crazy , silly , and grotesque headlines , by headlines that bear no relation to the text , by a ridiculous mis - use of words ? ''

		`` To let correspondents drool , to fill space with empty interviews , to say a thing three times over , is not to give the public what it wants .

		Whatever we may choose to blame 500 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, the public for in the shortcomings of the great newspaper , there is not the least ground for debiting it with a preference for dull verbiage , for inflated egotism in correspondents , for the multiplication of words .

		The notion of some publishers or editors that a paper without bedlamite headlines , without inane and empty 1 despatches , ' with excruciating and misdirected `` humor , ' would lose circulation , is devoid of all foundation in experience . ''

		All these things may attract for the moment , but they soon become a weariness to the sense ; and even the meanest intelligence , although dulled by use , is likely to revolt against them after their novelty has worn off .

		We can not carry credulity so far as to believe that any considerable body of readers will , in the long run , prefer a '' faked '' account to a truthful one , an imaginary to a real interview , a spurious illustration to an authentic one -LRB- or even to none at all -RRB- , or a blotched and unsightly page to one whose contents lend them - selves to continuous reading .

		The truth of the matter seems to be that most of these atrocities have been forced upon an over - acquiescent public , and that the only demand for them is a demand that has been artificially brought into being by insistence and iteration .

		That the appetite for these things grows by what it feeds on , is true only within limits ; that it can prove a lasting appetite , is contrary to the most elementary psychology .

		Taste may be spoiled , and intelligence blighted , by such de - vices ; but they will hardly create a fool 's para - dise of self-satisfaction .

		Our writer 's alterna - tive recommendation for the discredited form - ula is to '' trust the public , '' to '' credit it with sanity and fairness . ''

		There could be no per - manent loss in the substitution of the new motto for the old one , although there might be some sacrifice for the time being . ''

		Temporary loss there might be in a given case , as in rejecting improper advertisements , or in losing the pat - ronage of an industrial Bourbon and arrogant plutocrat .

		But in the end independence , in - telligence , reasonable courage , integrity , and efficiency bring their reward in journalism as in everything else . ''

		The same shallow plea of giving the public what it wants is put forward by our theatrical managers no less plaintively than by our news - paper proprietors .

		The fruition of this policy , as far as the newspaper case is concerned , has been an almost complete loss of public confi - dence in the trustworthiness of news columns and in the sincerity of editorial comment .

		Leader - ship has been abdicated , and journalism is con - ducted with an eye single to the demands of the counting-room .

		In the theatrical case , the process of demoralization has gone still farther , and the '' pocket nerve '' itself shows signs of becoming affected .

		The public has long been given what it wanted , in pursuance of the short - sighted plan of appealing only to its caprices and of artificially stimulating its lower instincts , until now it plainly shows signs of not wanting the fare offered , and of being incapable of digest - ing anything more nutritious .

		The popular stage , long since declared bankrupt of ideas and of morals , now seems to be facing bankruptcy of the material sort that gives pause even to its commercialized managers .

		Its devices pall upon a public that has been sedulously diverted from the permanent things of the drama , and the apathy is loudly bewailed as the basest of in - gratitude toward those who have sought only to please it .

		The drama will again come to its own , we make no doubt ; but its regeneration will not be accomplished in a day .

		The reformation will begin when its sponsors learn to make self - respect , rather than box-office receipts , the pre - vailing motive in their activities .

		The pernicious influence of the attempt to give the public what it wants , instead of giving it what it ought to have , may be seen in other activities than those of journalism and the drama .

		And always we find the same resort to artificial stimulation in unworthy directions .

		As we have said before , taste grows by what it feeds on , within certain limits ; but when fed upon garbage , it ceases to grow at all after a while , then revolts at the offering , but finds that it has lost its appetite for better food .

		The sort of music that is found lying about the piano in the average household of young people , the slangy and silly speech which these young people affect and which is all they have at their command , the false and highly-colored fiction which is the staple of their reading , -- these are all familiar results of the deplorable aim of giv - ing the public what it wants .

		It is an aim shared in by many classes of caterers , and the acquisition of the dollar is the chief apology offered for its pursuit .

		When the public itself becomes the caterer , as in the case of park concerts and free libra - ries and schools , there is no shirking the respon - sibility involved , for the plea that `` one must live '' may not here be urged .

		Democracy becomes an exquisite absurdity if it be taken to mean that in these matters there is to be no guidance , no attempt to uplift the general taste , no function higher than that of supplying an
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 501 untrained demand .

		This is too large a subject for discussion in a single paragraph , and we will merely note our belief that here the public often fails lamentably in its duties .

		This is especially true in the matter of public education , which for so long has yielded to the twofold clamor for the practical and the agreeable that a whole generation has already been weakened in fibre and another generation is at present undergoing the same lax training based upon the same shallow pedagogy .

		A misty philoso - phy , a doctrinaire method , and an infusion of philistine ideals , are everywhere doing their enervating or disintegrating work in our schools .

		The public is getting what it wants , or what it thinks it wants , to its own undoing as far as the real purposes of life are concerned , and the pro- test of sanity is that of a voice crying in the wilderness .

London	LOCATION	`` Times , '' which is prompted thereto by a correspondent who thinks it high time such an institution were estab - lished .

		Advocates of a
British Academy	ORGANIZATION	are wont to point to the French Academy as in itself a suffi - cient argument for a similar society in
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		But the
French Academy	ORGANIZATION	is a natural and spontane - ous growth , starting in
1629	DATE	in a series of informal meetings of eight men of letters in
Paris	LOCATION	, and form - ally recognized and permanently established six years later , by Cardinal
Richelieu	PERSON	, for the control of the French language and the guidance of French lit - erary taste .

		How is such a body to be created in cold blood in
England	LOCATION	?

		And , if created , who would recognize its authority ?

		The French have a genius for organization in art and letters ; they carry their political instinct , or it carries them , into those domains ; but their over-Channel neighbors , with all their genius for organization in governmental matters , and their respect for civil authority , are intolerant of dictation or control in art and letters , as is rather clearly and amusingly illustrated by their fretful chafing under the yoke of a censorship of plays .

		The '' Times '' is inclined to think that a British Academy , like many clubs , would be carried on and controlled by bores and busy idlers , because other men would be too engrossed with their own more pressing affairs to give their time ; and these bores would crown the books of bores , not from cor - rupt motives , but from a natural affinity for boredom and all its works .

		There seems at present little danger that the free scope of individual genius , or even the pyrotechnic tendencies of the most startling eccentricity , will soon be hampered and suppressed by any such arbiter of taste as that immortal Forty so powerful in the French aristocracy of letters .

		The retirement of an independent journal - ist , the reliquishment of his chosen task on the part of Professor
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	, has attracted an amount of attention that would have been highly flattering to a man susceptible to flattery .

		No publicist 's pen has ever earned a better right to honored repose than that of this sturdy octogenarian citizen of the world .

		Characteristic indeed was the inscription he chose for that handsome seat of polished stone which in the early days of
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	he , the former Regius professor of history at
Oxford	LOCATION	, and at that time the honorary professor of history at
Cornell	LOCATION	, caused to be built under a wide-spreading tree on the campus . ''

		Above all nations is humanity '' ran the legend on its back .

		The humanist who devised , 6r selected , that inscription also gave to the infant library of the young college his own collection of ten thousand volumes , sending back to
England	LOCATION	for the books when he discovered the sore need of
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the publicity given to the act by the American press disgusted him , and he complained that he was being made ridiculous in the eyes of
England	LOCATION	, where it would be held as utterly absurd to speak of his modest collection as a '' library . ''

		Like all men with the gift of penetration and a command of language , he has made his enemies ; but one strongly suspects that he prefers the anathemas of the unintelligent to their commendation .

		It is greatly to be hoped that cessation from routine work on
Professor Smith	ORGANIZATION	's part will not mean a total suspension of writing activity .

		The vogue of the colored illustration , which was spoken of by our
London	LOCATION	correspondent , in our last issue , as so marked a feature of this sea - son 's holiday publications in
England	LOCATION	, may perhaps be attributed not entirely to the artistic merits of the pictures , which are often slight , but more correctly to the relief experienced by the eye in passing from the monotonous and trying black-and-white of the printed page and the ordinary illustration to the varied and often restful colors found in Nature .

		Oculists now assure us that the harmful effect of the at present ubiquitous moving-picture show is due , not to the '' flickering '' of the scene , but to the strain caused by too-long contemplation of white light broken only by black lines and surfaces .

		The vibra - tions coming from the illuminated screen are con - stant ; whereas in viewing a landscape , or a football game , or the performance of a play , the optic nerve responds to color-vibrations of great variety of rapid - ity , differing perhaps by hundreds of trillions in a second .

		Therefore , unless the kinetoscope people take a hint from the photographers and illustrators in color , the nervous headaches and the partial paralysis of the organs of vision now complained of by those who have contracted the moving-picture habit will seriously affect the profits of the business .

		But it is likely to be many a day before either the colored illustration or the colored moving film will be artistically unexceptionable , however commend - able from a hygienic point of view .

		502 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, The origin of an old song , the song known to thousands , if not to millions , as '' Old
Grimes	PERSON	, '' is now revealed in Mr.
Dwight C. Kilbourn	PERSON	's '' History of the Bench and Bar of
Litchfield County	LOCATION	, Con - necticut . ''

		Those who have heard the quaint rhymes sung in childhood will recall their comic mingling of Old
Grimes	PERSON	's virtues and the peculiarities of his person or costume , as -- '' He lived in peace with all mankind , In friendship he was true ; His coat had pocket-holes behind , His pantaloons were blue . ''

		The authorship of the song is now traced to a source sufficiently distinguished to excuse , if excuse be needed , this brief paragraph on the subject .

		The Hon.
Albert G. Green	PERSON	, of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	,
United States	LOCATION	senator , and otherwise noted , studied law in his youth at the law school then flourishing in the town of
Litchfield	LOCATION	.

		A fugitive slave from
Virginia	LOCATION	-- who had taken the name of his former master ,
William Grimes	PERSON	-- was the proprietor of a small barber-shop in the same town ; and at the negro 's request that Mr.
Green	PERSON	should make some verses for him , the young man , who was an inveterate rhyme - ster on all sorts of themes , turned out the doggerel known now for nearly a century -LRB- for that was in
1812	DATE	-RRB- as `` Old Grimes . ''

		The runaway slave 's later years were spent in
New Haven	LOCATION	, where he is said to have shaven and shorn the
Yale	ORGANIZATION	students as he formerly had the Litchfield law students .

		He is also said to have published a pamphlet sketch of his life , with a portrait , and to have died at
New Haven	LOCATION	about
1859	DATE	.

		A NEW DEPARTURE IN READING-ROOMS win8 the admiring approval of visitors to the new
Smith College Library	ORGANIZATION	, which , through the generosity of Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	, of alumnae and friends , and of the trustees of the
Rockefeller Education Fund	ORGANIZATION	, now furnishes the students and faculty with the facilities so long conspicuously absent at that institution of learning .

		The reading-room in question is not the general reading-room , and is not the reference room , nor the periodical room ; but it is a far more inviting apartment , designed to attract readers who read for the pure love of good literature , and not because certain books or chapters are '' prescribed . ''

		The atmosphere is that of the private , not of the public , library ; the books on the wall-shelves are standard authors , and will eventually number about twenty - five hundred volumes presented by classes or by friends of the college .

		This quiet sanctum , with its `` still air of delightful studies , '' might well receive a more distinctive , more aptly descriptive name than that of '' Standard Authors Room '' ; but such at present is its designation .

		It was furnished by Mr.
Clifford Gallagher	PERSON	, of
Boston	LOCATION	, in memory of his daughter
Edith	PERSON	, of the class of
1907	DATE	.

		It is not impossible that Mr.
Gallagher	PERSON	's wise generosity may have effected more for the cause of literature at
Smith	ORGANIZATION	than if he had given ten times as much money in founding a professorship for the teaching of those English authors who now make their mute appeal from the shelves of the
Standard Authors Room	ORGANIZATION	.

		A poet as his own parodist is not met with every day in the week .

		A Poe parody on the already much-parodied '' Raven '' has apparently come to light in a
New York	LOCATION	auction-room .

		At
Anderson	ORGANIZATION	's recently there was sold a copy of the first edition of `` The Raven and Other Poems , '' uncut and `` in the original wrappers , '' and having with it a manuscript copy of verses in the same metre and style as '' The Raven . ''

		These verses are thought to be in
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's handwriting and also to be of his own composing .

		They certainly have the Poe swing or '' lilt . ''

		There are eight stanzas , which have now found their way into print , and of which the first may here be reproduced as a sample . ''

		Leave it not so dark , uncertain !

		lift again the fallen cur - tain !

		Let us once again the mysteries of that haunted room explore !

		Hear once more that fiend infernal , that grim visiter -LRB- sic -RRB- nocturnal !

		Earnestly we long to learn all that befalls that bird of yore .

		Oh , then tell us something more . ''

		The despairing '' Nevermore '' of the original poem duly reappears at the end of several of the stanzas of this parody or sequel .

		• • • Father
Tabb	PERSON	, the blind poet , whose death was briefly noted in our last issue , left behind him the memory of a sweet and strong and beautiful person - ality .

		His exquisite bits of verse , always sententious , often whimsical , but touched with true poetic feeling , are known to thousands and have received the tribute of high praise on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Less familiar may be his Lamb-like fondness for the harmless pun .

		Like Lamb , he could make his own misfortunes the subject of a merry jest , but was care - ful never to wound with his wit the sensibilities of others .

		One day , when his sight was failing with alarming rapidity , he told his students -LRB- at
St. Charles 's College	ORGANIZATION	, near
Ellicott City	LOCATION	,
Maryland	LOCATION	-RRB- that he was planning to go to
Baltimore	LOCATION	and intended to take his two weakest pupils with him -- which stirred high hopes in the breasts of the smaller boys .

		But these hopes were disappointed , though the promise was kept , for Father
Tabb	PERSON	went unattended to consult an oculist ... A TROLLEY LIBRARY FOR WORKING PEOPLE is forcibly advocated by Mr.
Henry F. Marx	PERSON	, librarian of the
Easton	LOCATION	-LRB-
Pa.	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library .

		His plan somewhat resembles that already in successful oper - ation in
Washington County	LOCATION	,
Md.	LOCATION	, and more than once approvingly noticed by us .

		Instead of a book - wagon , such as now makes its periodical expeditions from
Hagerstown	LOCATION	, Mr.
Marx	PERSON	would have his wheeled library take the form of an electric car , which , as he believes , could for a small outlay be purchased and equipped with several thousand volumes of
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE D1AJL 503 suitable literature ; and then , in order to give the hard-working tax-payer a proper return for his money , Mr.
Marx	PERSON	would have his electrically pro- pelled library run in on sidings near large depart - ment stores and mills for the noon hour , to meet the convenience and attract the attention of book - hungry employees .


Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, with its
3644	DATE	miles of street railway , he thinks easily able to in - stitute a trolley-car free circulating library system .

		To furnish this service an hour and a half daily to busy mill hands and shop girls , and others similarly occupied , would cost , estimates Mr.
Marx	PERSON	, S557 a year , including mileage of sixty-six miles a week , lighting , heating , wages , and repairs .

		If this esti - mate is correct , and if it includes cost and care of books , one can hardly think of a better use to which library funds could be applied .

		Tax-remission for educational purposes may at first have a strange sound to those who are more familiar with tax-raising for the same praiseworthy ends .

		Professor
David Y. Thomas	PERSON	, of the
University of Arkansas	ORGANIZATION	, pleads forcibly , in the
November	DATE	* ' North American Review , '' for the repayment to the
Southern States	LOCATION	of the
sixty-eight million dollars	MONEY	collected as a cotton tax in 1861-1868 .

		The con - stitutionality of the tax , which varied at different times from one to
three cents	MONEY	a pound on this lead - ing agricultural product of the South , has often been seriously questioned ; and since our government has before now paid back other doubtfully legal tax levies , and since also it would now be difficult if not impossible to hunt up all the cotton-tax payers , or their heirs , the writer urges the Congressional appro - priation of the amount of this tax as a Lincoln Memorial Fund for the
Advancement of Southern Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such a procedure , commendable at any time , would be especially fitting in this
Lincoln	LOCATION	cen - tennial year .


Scotland	LOCATION	's recapture of a rare edition of
Burns	PERSON	's early poems is reported from
Boston	LOCATION	, where , at the auction sale of the library of the late
James Brown	PERSON	, the
Boston	LOCATION	publisher , an octavo vol - ume entitled ''
Robert Burns	PERSON	's Poems , Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect , '' and printed by
John Wilson	PERSON	at
Kilmarnock	ORGANIZATION	in
1786	DATE	, when the poet was twenty - seven years old , was knocked down at SI 025 to Mr.
George Clark	PERSON	of
Kilmarnock	LOCATION	.

		The buyer , recently come from his home in the
Burns	PERSON	country , chanced to hear of the impending sale of this rare and valu - able book , and made haste to secure the treasure for the sake of restoring it to its proper home .

		Of this one item of plunder , at least , wrested from
Europe	LOCATION	by American wealth , our national conscience is now clear .

		The abuses of dialect-writing are touched upon in a short and well-conceived article -LRB- '' Dialect in Fiction , '' by Mr.
W. Harold Thomson	PERSON	-RRB- in a late number of `` The Author . ''

		The excessive strain put upon the plain reader by some ultra-dialecticians is justly deprecated by the writer of the article . ''

		Dialect suggested , '' he well says , '' is in every way more artistic than dialect written phonetically , and I think I am correct when I say that he who writes most broadly is he who knows least about it .

		In - deed , any attempt to reproduce on paper the exact pronunciation and intonation of a man speaking in the vernacular must almost certainly be unsuccess - ful ; and should it be successful no good purpose is served , for the reader is irritated by the difficulty of construing sense from the printed words , and the writer , being the unconscious cause of this irritation , is made to suffer . ''

		How many readers must have been vexed by the persistence of some writers in indulging in dialectic forms that appeal only to the eye !

		Why , for example , is `` vittles '' preferred by them to '' victuals '' ?

		Such senseless practices make their stories look more like the tracts of the
Simpli	PERSON	- fied
Spelling Society	ORGANIZATION	than a contribution to literature .

		The new versus the old in library manage - ment has been pithily expressed by
Chicago	LOCATION	's new librarian , Mr.
Henry E. Legler	PERSON	. ''

		The old-fashioned idea of the duty of a librarian , '' he is reported as saying in a discussion of his own theories , which are , one hopes , soon to be put into practice , '' was to save the books .

		The modern notion is that it is his busi - ness to get the books worn out .

		The books are our capital .

		We can not afford to let this capital lie idle on the shelves .

		We must put it out at interest .

		The three great problems of the modern library are -- first , distribution ; second , distribution ; and third , distribution . ''

		This is excellent , provided only the wearing-out process does not so far outstrip replace - ment that the readers shall be reduced to the neces - sity of seeking intellectual sustenance in the calf - bound volumes of the
U. S. Government	ORGANIZATION	Reports , in the Proceedings of the Society for the Promotion of Pedantry , or in the occasional publications of the
Simplified Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		A NEW PLAY BY
MADAME SARAH BERNHARDT	PERSON	, who has written plays before this , besides trying her hand at painting and sculpture and memoir-writing and tiger-taming and heaven knows what not , is announced for production at the Theatre des Arts in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The play was written in the
summer	DATE	vaca - tion of the wonderful woman who for the preceding eleven months had been acting eight or nine times a week in other people 's plays ; and it has not yet received a name .

		Those who have witnessed her ''
Adrienne Lecouvreur	PERSON	, '' thrown off in a mood of dissatisfaction with the long-established version of that actress 's history , will not doubt that Mme.
Bernhardt	PERSON	's vacation has been spent to good purpose .

		• • • Library methods of handling municipal sta - tistics are coming into vogue among the more wide - awake communities .

		The scientific , if sometimes painfully rigid , classification of all printed matter , the perfecting of the card-catalogue , and the elaboration of the reference and cross-reference system of index - ing , have greatly aided those who would like to be 504 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, able to legislate intelligently and wisely and progres - sively .

		The latest bureau of municipal statistics is to have its abode at
the University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, where Professor
James W. Garner	PERSON	, head of the department of political science and a member of the
Urbana City Council	ORGANIZATION	, has been appointed by a convention of
Illinois	ORGANIZATION	mayors as organizer and director of the new bureau .

		The increasing adoption by governmental bodies of what are virtually modern library methods for keeping themselves informed of what is being done and what it is best to do in matters of civic administration , is an involuntary and a sincere com - pliment to the leaders in library science .

		FROM LIT ERAR Y
LONDON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of The Dial . -RRB-

		Nothing has yet been published , I think , either in the English or American newspapers , concerning Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's literary remains ; although it has been hinted that Mr.
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	will write his life .

		As a matter of fact , I do not believe the book will ever be written .

		Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	has undoubted genius , and would make a beautiful book upon his friend ; but one of his talents is a talent for procrastination .

		He waited years before he pub - lished his charming novel ''
Aylwin	PERSON	. ''

		Any other writer would have sent it into the world years be - fore . ''

		Aylwin '' has been a tremendous success in this country , and I suppose also in
America	LOCATION	.

		I believe I am right in saying that in a series of well - printed shilling books which have sold to the extent of many thousands in
England	LOCATION	, '' Aylwin '' has sold best of all .

		Then Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	promised us another novel , which it was understood at least two years ago was quite ready for publication .

		He ar - ranged with another publisher for a volume to be called by the picturesque title `` The Old Familiar Faces , '' which would have introduced us to many of his old friends whose obituaries he wrote in '' The Athenaeum , '' brilliant little monographs that some of us have taken pains to convey to our scrap-books .

		In view of these facts , it does not seem likely that Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	will ever really carry out his in - tention of writing the biography of his good friend and brother poet .

		Meanwhile I am in a position to state -- and here make , I believe , the first announcement of the fact -- that there will be two volumes of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's essays given to the public at an early date .

		One of these is a volume devoted to some of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's great contemporaries ; for Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's interest in the Elizabethan Dramatists was profound .

		There was no subject upon which he so delighted to con - verse in that pleasant library of his in which it was my privilege to discuss the subject with him .

		His window overlooked the garden of the house at Put - ney , and there were points at which it recalled to me 0 .


W. Holmes	PERSON	's library overlooking the
Charles River	LOCATION	at
Boston	LOCATION	, where also I have been .

		The sec - ond volume of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's writings will consist of a gathering together of his various uncollected papers , including the masterly essay on
Dickens	PERSON	that he wrote for the '' Quarterly Review , '' his first signed contribution in that great periodical .

		Among other
Dickens	PERSON	matter in this volume will be the essay that
Swinburne	PERSON	wrote as an introduction to ''
Oliver Twist	PERSON	, '' for a new edition of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	pub - lished in
New York	LOCATION	.

		This does not exhaust my store of information concerning Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	and his posthumous works .

		Apart from the two volumes that I have referred to , there are to be no less than seven little books which will for the present be privately printed by Mr.
Thomas Wise	PERSON	, the well-known collector of
London	LOCATION	.

		Only a few copies have been printed from type , and I do not suppose that more than two copies have reached
America	LOCATION	.

		The series contains , for example , a prose romance entitled '' The Mar - riage of
Mona Lisa	LOCATION	'' ; there is another , also in prose , entitled '' The Portrait '' ; and a third prose volume is entitled '' The Chronicle of Fredegond . ''

		There are also before me -- I count them of priceless value -- four little pamphlets containing ballads .

		One is entitled `` Margaret '' ; a second , `` Lord Scales '' ; a third , '' Lord Soules '' ; a fourth , `` Border Ballads . ''

		No doubt these seven little books will ultimately be given to the public -- probably in a single volume ; but they are practically unobtainable to-day .

		I think , therefore , that many of
Swinburne	ORGANIZATION	's admirers will be glad to see one of these ballads printed in The Dial , although it is of considerable length .

		It may be remembered that , as a North - umbrian , Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	was brought up in that border-land between
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	which inspired this aspect of his poetry .

		Readers of The Dial will perhaps be interested in seeing the following hitherto unpublished lines by Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, which form a dedication to the faithful friend of years whose full name is Walter
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	.

		Ten copies of this little dedication have been printed by Mr.

May 24th	DATE	; the present King 's Birthday ,
November	DATE	9th ; and the first of
January	DATE	of each year .

		The New Year 's honors , as they are called , are generally understood to be restricted to official persons ; but in
May	DATE	and
November	DATE	we may always look to see well-known names .

		My interest in these is mainly restricted to literature .

		Were it discreet , one could reveal some astonishing facts with regard to people who have not got titles but want them , and others who have been offered titles and have refused them .

		Three of the leading English novelists of our day , for example , have all refused a knighthood .

		Yet it is hardly a secret that there are several novelists flourishing among us who would almost give their ears to be possessed of one .

		The list that has recently been sent out contains one name generally esteemed alike in English literature and English journalism .

		This is Dr.
Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	, now Sir
Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	, or Sir
William Nicoll	PERSON	as he will prefer to be called .

		His title is a recognition of his stalwart defence of Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	's Budget ; but it is as an acute literary critic and scholar that I most admire the new knight .

		His knowledge of nineteenth-century literature is probably greater than that of any living contemporary , and some day we shall see good evidence of this in the successive volumes of his history of that period .

		The first volume will not appear for at least two years , how - ever .

		I do not attach much importance to the subject of the best-selling books ; for the best-selling books , at least in this country , are usually the worst written .

		But it may interest American readers to know of cer - tain books that have been reprinted in this country duringthe past few days .

		They include
Sven Hedin	PERSON	's and
Shackleton	PERSON	's well-known volumes ; also , several of the color books that I named in my last letter , including the
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	of
Dulac	PERSON	.

		There is also a brisk sale for Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	's new novel , the inordinate length of which seems not to have deterred the book-buyer .

		Mr.

Dec. 16	DATE	,

		A Great Mind in the Making .

		* The
Emerson	PERSON	centenary , in
1903	DATE	, was marked in the book world by the publication of a com - plete annotated edition of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's works , and it was intended to supplement his more formal writings with the journals whose daily entries he drew upon for the raw material -- and not seldom , too , for the finished fabric -- of his lectures , which were afterward further elabor - ated for appearance in book form .

		Mr.
James Elliot Cabot	PERSON	, the literary executor of the Con - cord sage , felt himself too old to undertake the editing of these journals , which cover more than half a century , and desired
Emerson	PERSON	's son , Dr.
Edward Waldo Emerson	PERSON	, to assume the task . ''

		Only take time enough , '' he said ; '' do not al - low yourself to be hurried . ''

		The request was complied with , and , assisted by
Emerson	PERSON	's grand - son , Mr.
Waldo Emerson Forbes	PERSON	, the editor has now issued two volumes of generous extracts from the earlier journals , bringing this remark - able autobiography of a mind -LRB- or , rather , of a soul -RRB- down to the end of
1832	DATE	-- the writer 's thirtieth year .

		Emerson 's old friend and schoolmate ,
William H. Furness	PERSON	, has written of him that he never played as other boys play , but that he dwelt apart and sought his recreation in books and self-communing and the sympathetic enjoyment of Nature . ''

		It was as natural for this boy to write , '' says his son and editor , in introducing his copious journals , '' as to another to play ball , or go fishing , or experiment with the tools of a neighbour carpenter , or feel out tunes on a musi - cal instrument . ''

		As was to have been expected , there is frequent self-scrutiny and some self - upbraiding in the young student 's diary ; but intellectual dissipation appears to be the worst offense he has to charge himself with as he con - templates the range and variety of his reading and speculation .

		He also regretted that he found it so difficult to meet his fellow-men on a common ground of sympathy and under - standing .

		The subordinate place that a person of rare endowments united with somewhat over-delicate sensibilities commonly finds him - self obliged to take in general company was far from being the position to which he felt himself entitled .

		his twenty-first year , reveal the writer 's noble discontent . ''

		... I must further say that every comparison of myself with my mates that six or seven , perhaps sixteen or seventeen years have made , has convinced me that there exists a signal defect of character which neutralizes in great part the just influence my talents ought to have .

		Whether that defect be in the address , in the fault of good forms , -- which , Queen
Isabella	PERSON	said , were like perpetual letters commendatory -- or deeper seated in an absence of common sympathies , or even in a levity of the understanding , I caimot tell .

		But its bitter fruits are a sore uneasiness in the company of most men and women , a frigid fear of offending and jealousy of disrespect , an inability to lead and an unwillingness to follow the cur - rent conversation , which contrive to make me second with all those among whom chiefly I wish to be first . ''

		Hence my bearing in the world is the direct oppo - site of that good-humoured independence and self - esteem which should mark the gentleman .

		Be it here remembered that there is a decent pride which is con - spicuous in the perfect model of a Christian man .

		I am unfortunate also , as was
Rienzi	PERSON	, in a propensity to laugh , or rather , snicker .

		I am ill at ease , therefore , among men .

		I criticize with hardness ; I lavishly applaud ; I weakly argue ; and I wonder with a ` foolish face of praise . ' ''

		Intimately revealing and profoundly significant are such fragments of self-examination , and for the sores and bruises of many an aspiring and stumbling young reader there will be found in them a most soothing balm .

		Again , such passages as the following , the utterance of an eighteen-year-old boy , have a wonderful way of striking a responsive chord .

		The same thought is expressed by
George Eliot	PERSON	in the ripeness of her genius , but her words are winged with a force and insight no greater than that com - manded by the youthful Emerson . ''

		Never mistake yourself to be great , or designed for greatness , because you have been visited by an indistinct and shadowy hope that something is reserved for you beyond the common lot .

		It is easier to aspire than to do the deeds .

		The very idleness which leaves you leis - ure to dream of honour is the insurmountable obstacle between you and it .

		Those who are fitly furnished for the weary passage from mediocrity to greatness seldom find time or appetite to indulge that hungry and boister - ous importunity for excitement which weaker intellects are prone to display .

		That which helps them on to emi - nence is in itself sufficient to engross the attention of all their powers , and to occupy the aching void .

		Greatness never comes upon a man by surprise , and without his exertions or consent .

		No , it is another sort of Genii who traverse your path suddenly ; it is Poverty which travels like an armed man ; it is Contempt which meets you in the corners and highways with a hiss , and Anger which treads you down as with the Hghtning .

		Greatness is a property for which no man gets credit too soon ; it must be possessed long before it is acknowledged . ''

		A year later he writes again in the same vein , acknowledging his strong desire to take a high rank '' in the innumerable assembly of men , ''

		THE DIAL 507 but also admitting that '' every young man is prone to be misled by the suggestions of his own ill-founded ambition , which he mistakes for the promptings of a secret Genius . ''

		The arch foe to the realization of greatness this indefatigable youth finds to be '' the demon Indolence . '' '

		Passages utilized by
Emerson	PERSON	in his lecture writing have been , as a rule , omitted in the editing of his journals : but it is impossible to turn the pages without chancing on many a familiar or favorite thought whose more mature expression is to be found in one of the essays or addresses .

		More than once the great law of compensation moves him to reflection .

		At the age of nineteen we find him writing in this strain : • • Thus knowledge is a good ; but it must be acquired in different ways , and there is no single way which com - bines the advantages of all the others .

		The advantages which one man enjoys by access to unusual sources of improvement do , by some necessity , deprive him of admittance to other sources equally rare and rich .

		Is he opulent , and commands the privileges of hbraries and schools ?

		he wants that vigour and eagerness to use them which
Necessity	ORGANIZATION	gives .

		Is he a traveller and borne by the winds to every foreign clime , and does he trans - act affairs amidst the famous ruins of each continent ?

		-- then his taste has been uncultivated and he views them all with indifference .

		Has he wit and industry sufficient to grasp all knowledge ?

		-- poverty shuts up with iron bars every avenue to him . ''

		Eight years later , with his heart vibrating to the iron string of self-reliance , he sets down some admonitions against self-distrust . ''

		I have sometimes wished , '' he confesses , '' I had not some acuteness or minuteness of observation that seemed inconsistent with dignity of char - acter ; but thus to wish seems to me now to be false to one 's - self , to give up a tower in my castle to the enemy which was given me as a bulwark of defence . ''

		And thenceforth he scorns to imitate , scorns to be a secondary man , as he expresses it .

		The editor has closed the record of every year or two with a list of authors or books men - tioned or quoted in the journals of that period .

		In those early years
Milton	PERSON	and Shakespeare were conspicuous favorites , with the Greek poets and philosophers in high esteem .

		In fact , the great thinkers of whatever age or race early claimed his attention .

		His reading was wide , and must have been somewhat desultory ; hence his confession of intellectual dissipation as his '' cardinal vice . '' '

		The charm exerted upon him by so many branches of learning and literature , and also by the fine arts , is thus touched upon in a letter -LRB- copied in his journal of
1827	DATE	-RRB- to his Aunt Mary .

		■ It seems to me lately that we have many capacities which we lack time and occasion to improve .

		If I read the Bride of Lammermoor , a thousand imperfect sugges - tions arise in my mind , to which could I give heed , I should be a novelist .

		When I chance to light on a verse of genuine poetry , it may be in a corner of a newspaper , a forcible sympathy awakens a legion of little goblins in the recesses of the soul , and if I had leisure to attend to the tine tiny rabble , I should straightway become a poet .

		In my day dreams , I so often hunger and thirst to be a painter , beside all the spasmodic attachment I indulge to each of the sciences and each province of letters .

		They all in turn play the coquette with my imagination , and it may be I shall die at the last a for - lorn bachelor jilted of them alL '' That
Emerson	PERSON	had not only some vague long - ing to be a painter , but also some skill as a draughtsman , is one of the pleasant revelations of his early journals , which are occasionally adorned with human heads in pen-and-ink , sometimes from living models , and sometimes probably from fancy .

		A few of these essays in art are reproduced in the published volumes , and though hastily executed they are by no means the scrawls of a wholly ungifted hand .

		The passion for poetry is evinced not only in quotations and allusions , but more interestingly in frequent bits of metrical composition from the writers own pen .

		Some of these early verses have been polished and preserved in the published '' Poems , '' but the greater part were allowed to serve their purpose merely as exer - cises in poetic expression .

		These specimens of draughtsmanship and of versification make one inclined to dispute what his old schoolmate , already mentioned , says of him in the
Cabot	LOCATION	biog - raphy .

		* '
Ralph	PERSON	and I used to sit together , '' writes Mr.
Furness	PERSON	. ''

		I can see him now , at his copy-book ; quite a laborious operation it appeared , as his tongue worked up and down with his pen .

		But then , thank Heaven !

		he never had any talent for anything , -- nothing but pure genius , which talents would have over - laid . ''

		Rather it was the genius and not any one of the talents that soon got the upper hand and gave to the world genuine Emersonian es - says and poems , instead of characterless por - traits or novels or other productions of mere talent .

		The high esteem in which
Mary Moody Emerson	ORGANIZATION	stood with her nephew is abundantly proved by the care and thought bestowed upon his letters to her , letters which he often copies into his journal together with her letters to him .

		She had , as
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	expressed it , '' the fatal gift of penetration , '' and promptly made herself hated by many of those whom she met , because she could see through them at once , and prob - 508 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, ably scrupled not to make them aware of their transparency .

		The value to her nephew of her example and admonitions becomes increasingly evident as we study the letters that passed between them .

		The originality and force re - vealed in her epistolary style are in every way admirable .

		The family portraits and other illustrations included in these first two volumes are wisely chosen and of decided interest .

		That the later volumes , covering the years from
1833	DATE	, when
Emerson	PERSON	first visited
Europe	LOCATION	, down to the time of his full maturity , will contain more that is of literary excellence , is what may be confidently expected ; yet the freshness and young hope and eager acquisitiveness that so agreeably meet one in the earlier journals have a charm that must necessarily be wanting in the later .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		The Charm oe
Paris	LOCATION	.

		* When one comes regretfully to the last page of Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	's latest book , `` A Wan - derer in
Paris	LOCATION	, '' an invitation to him takes form in one 's mind : '' The readers of The Dial re - quest the pleasure of Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's presence in
New York	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	, for the purpose of ren - dering such pen-pictures as he has given us of
Paris	LOCATION	and
London	LOCATION	, and of the picturesque cities of
Holland	LOCATION	.

		R.S.V.P. '' Our invitation should include Mr.
Walter Dexter	PERSON	, whose paintings , reproduced in color , add greatly to the charm of the volume .

		They have the exquisite carelessness acquired by infinitely careful workmanship .

		To grasp and retain the very essence of the charm of the places he visits , and to convey an intimate sense of that quality to his readers , -- this is the difficult task Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	accomplishes .

		His books are not for the specialist , though the specialist should enjoy them ; nor for the tour - ist 's valise , though they are in a sense guide - books , idealized guide-books .

		The catholic in - terests of their author embrace the diverse tastes of a multitude of readers .

		Each fancies that his own
Paris	LOCATION	or his own
London	LOCATION	is that phase of which Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	is especially the partisan .

		The only class of readers who might quarrel with Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	are butchers and sewer-contractors ; for he insists that the tourist 's partiality for visit - * AWandekebinParis .

		ing the abattoirs and the sewers of
Paris	LOCATION	is a joy - less one .

		But then , probably , few butchers and sewer-contractors read Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	.

		His risk of unpopularity is , after all , slight .

		For the rest of us , little is wanting .

		Descrip - tions of pictures and statuary often fail to carry their message ; but in this book we are planted squarely in front of them , spectacles on nose , and if we do n't see them the faidt is our own , not Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's .

		The boulevards and bridges - -- those wonderful bridges of
Paris	LOCATION	-- are not seen from a distance , dimly ; we cross and recros * them , arm in arm with our delightful guide .

		The public buildings are historic monuments , but they have vitality also ; we are told what happened in them yesterday , and what is going on to-day .

		The quays are full of delight to us , whether we are looking on while
Charles Nodier	PERSON	slips a book into those capacious pockets , `` quarto size , '' or whether we watch the gamin of to-day dive into the Seine .

		We fairly feel the thrill of the bargain-hunter in the shops .

		And as for the cafes , -- well , one may be envious of dinners long since eaten ; the sinfulness of envy is confined to its present and future tense .

		Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	has the gift of discrimination among words .

		Notre Dame , says he , is '' to - ward evening , in the gloom , mysterious and a little sinister '' ; the old districts offer '' alluring prospects of narrow streets and high and ancient houses ; -- over all , that sense of thorough insan - itation which so often accompanies architectural charm in
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	and which seems to matter so little to Latin people . ''

		And here Mr.
Dexter	PERSON	's work supplements that of Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	with insight and sympathy .

		Alluring indeed are the streets in which he has set up his easel .

		His buildings are faithful because they are suggestive , leaving something to the reader 's - imagination or his memory .

		The Parisiennes who cross his boulevards are dainty and viva - cious -- and half an inch in height .

		Unpretentious , Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	never seeks to im - prove the ultimate expression ; he often culls from
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and on occasion from others .

		Pater and
Lowell	PERSON	present us to
Monna Lisa	PERSON	.

		As to the
Venus of Milo	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	speaks for himself : '' You see her before you all the way along her cor - ridor : she stands quietly and glirmneringly beckoning at the very end of it , alone , before her dark red back - ground .

		Why the
Venus of Milo	ORGANIZATION	is so radiantly satis - fying , so almost terribly beautiful , one can not explain • but there it is .

		It is a cold beauty , but it is magical too ; it dominates , controls .

		And with it there is peace .

		The strangest thing of all is that one never misses the arms .

		It is as though arms were a defect in a perfect woman . ''


1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 509 And of the Winged Victory : '' It is on the first landing of the
Escalier Daru	PERSON	, at the end of the Galerie Denon , that one of the most splendid things in the world is to he found : it has been before us all the way along the
Galerie Denon	PERSON	, that avenue of noble bronzes , the first thing that caught the eye .

		Everyone has seen photographs or models of this majestic and exquisite figure , but it must be studied here if one is to form a true estimate of the magical mastery of the sculptor .

		The Victory is headless and armless and much mutilated ; but that matters little .

		She stands on the prow of a trireme , and for every one who sees her with any imagination must for all time be the symbol of triumphant and splendid onset .

		The figure no doubt weighs more than a ton -- and is as light as air .

		The • Meteor ' in a strong breeze with all her sails set does not convey a more exciting idea of com - manding and buoyant progress .

		But that comparison wholly omits the element of conquest -- for this is essential Victory as well . ''

		As we wander through the
Louvre	LOCATION	, or in the streets , with Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	, he arrests us with odd unexpected bits of information , recalled by chance encounters .

		We pass a group of copyists in one of the galleries , and he tells us that the authorities of the
Louvre	LOCATION	have five hundred unfinished copies in their hands abandoned by their authors so thoroughly as
Dever	PERSON	to be in - quired for again .

		In all Parisian streets where signs are hung , the golden key is prominent .

		Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	therefore invites us to reflect for a moment on the proportion of locksmiths to the population of
Paris	LOCATION	; since their pretty symbol is seen everywhere . ''

		The reason of their numbers is not very mysterious , when we recollect that practically everyone that one meets in this city , and certainly all the people of the middling and working classes , live in fiats , and all want keys .

		The streets and streets of small houses with which
East London	LOCATION	is covered are unknown in
Paris	LOCATION	, where every facade is but the mask which hides vast tenements packed with families .

		No wonder , then , that the serrurier is so busy . ''

		Another sign which probably puzzles many English people is that of the stoppeur .

		Bellows 's dictionary does not recognize the word .

		What is a stoppeur , and what does he stop ?

		I discovered the answer in the most practical way possible ; for a Frenchman , in a crowd , helped me to it by pushing his lighted cigar into my back and burning a hole in it , right in the middle of the coat , where a patch would necessarily show .

		I was in despair , until the femme de chambre reassured me .

		It was nothing , she said : all that was needed was a stop - peur .

		She would take the coat herself .

		It seems that the stoppeur 's craft is that of mending holes so deftly that you would not know there had been any .

		He ascertains the pattern by means of a magnifying glass , and then extracts threads from some part of the garment that does not show and weaves them in .

		I paid three francs , and have been looking for the injured spot ever since , but can not find it .

		It is a modern miracle . ''

		Mr.
Pater	PERSON	or Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	would have described the Venus of
Milo	PERSON	or the Winged Victory as well as Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	.

		But would they have discovered the function of a stoppeur f Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	, visiting the Mint , coins a word ; '' mintners '' he calls the employees .

		With one of them this pleasant conversation is reported : '' An Englishman 's perhaps indiscreet questions as to what precautions were taken to prevent leakage amused the guide beyond all reason . '

		It is impossible , ' he said ; 1 the coins are weighed .

		They must correspond to the prescribed weight . '

		• But who , ' my countryman went on , in the relentless English way , ` checks the weigher ? ' '

		Another , ' said the guide . '

		But a time must come , ' con - tinued the Briton , ' when there is no one left to check -- when the last man of all is officiating : how then ?

		7 Our guide laughed very happily , and repeated that there were no thieves there ; and I daresay he is right . '

		Per - haps , ' I said to the English inquisitor , ' perhaps , like assistants in sweet-shops , they are allowed at first to help themselves so much that they acquire a disgust for money . '

		He looked at me with eyes of stone .

		I think he had Scotch blood . '

		Perhaps , ' he said at last . ''

		If the present reviewer has chosen to quote Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	at his lightest , rather than at his best , the reviewer and not Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	should be accused of trifling .

		His serious and eloquent periods are more frequent than his contagious - humor ; and he often shows himself a sharp critic .

		On the whole , it may be as well for us if he postpones his visit to
America	LOCATION	.

		There are still
Rome	LOCATION	and
Florence	LOCATION	for his wanderings .

		*
Virginia	LOCATION	: surely the name is one to conjure with .

		Around the name of what other
State of the Union	LOCATION	cling so many romantic associations ; so many memories of dramatic achievement ; such an atmosphere of chivalry and gentlemanly leisure -- all the more seductive because so very far removed from the atmosphere of this twen - tieth century .

		Most of us , if the truth were told , would not exchange the twentieth for the eighteenth century ; but an occasional visit has all the charm of a vacation in some beautiful secluded valley .

		Therefore we owe a debt of gratitude to Mrs.
Sale	PERSON	, and to her publishers , for the glimpses they have given us into the homes and lives of the men and women of the

		510 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, that is gone , to be moulded some day # by the master mind , into a history of the period .

		An English reviewer has described those who per - form this useful service as the hod-carriers of history .

		The characterization is apt , though it sounds a little ungracious .

		The true historian is born but once in a great while ; and most of us must be content to toil upward with the bricks that he may some day call for .

		If the bricks are judged worthy , that should be a sufficient reward .

		As historic bricks , one can find nothing but praise for Mrs.
Sale	PERSON	's records , -- though it would be idle to anticipate the judgment of the master-builder .

		The only regret one feels is that she did not crowd more of them into her hod .

		It is tantalizing , for instance , to be told that
Colonel Landon Carter	PERSON	, of
Sabine Hall	ORGANIZATION	, was on terms of intimacy with the most dis - tinguished men of his time , and that his corre - spondence , which has been carefully preserved , is interwoven with the names of
Washington	LOCATION	,
Lafayette	LOCATION	, Lee , and
Randolph	PERSON	, -- and yet be given no glimpse into this most interesting cor - respondence .

		The author of this entertaining book writes with an enthusiasm which betrays her into some faults of style .

		The reader is carried along on a sea of superlatives that sometimes leaves him breathless .

		One may forgive '' this superb old Commonwealth '' and `` this God-gifted region in which every loyal American proudly feels a personal share , '' but it strains one 's powers of appreciation to be told of '' a surpassingly lovely wooded roadway , '' with '' exquisite glimpses of the river '' leading to an '' incomparable green - sward '' ; of a mansion that '' graces superbly one of the choicest river sites , '' and of the '' incomparable ceiling decorations '' of another .

		But in spite of such defects the reader will find many things to repay him in the perusal of Mrs.
Sale	PERSON	's book , -- even though he should be a native of
Virginia	LOCATION	and think that he already knows a good deal of the history of his
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nothing could be more charming than the homes of
Virginia	LOCATION	-- except their gracious inhabitants .

		Virginian hospitality is something more than a tradition , and those who have not been privileged to enjoy it to-day may at least gather from these pages what it meant in the time of our grand - fathers .

		These stately halls echoed the voices of men and women whose names stood for all that was most worthy in the commonwealth .

		They were gentlemen and gentlewomen in the truest sense of the term .

		Their hospitality was as boundless as it was sincere ; and it was exer - cised in an environment that was peculiarly their own .

		These were homes indeed .

		One is helped to a keener appreciation of the character and quality of the manors of
Colonial Virginia	LOCATION	by the many well-chosen and admir - ably reproduced illustrations with which this book is equipped .

		For these , and for the gen - eral make-up of the volume , the publishers are deserving of much praise .

Napoleon	PERSON	asked his secretary , Las Cases , when they were starting for
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	, '' What can we do in that out-of - the - world place ? ''

		What he actually did do , the degree of influ - ence that he still exerted , from his island prison , on the fortunes of
France	LOCATION	, and so to some ex - tent of
Europe	LOCATION	, is told in sufficient detail , and with constant reference to published and man - uscript sources of information , by
M. Philippe Gonnard	PERSON	in his profusely illustrated volume entitled '' The Exile of
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		But the purpose of the book goes further than this : what the author has primarily tried to do is to deter - mine the share
Napoleon	PERSON	had in generating the so-called `` Napoleonic legend , '' -- that is , the legend that he was the disinterested advocate of the principles of
1789	DATE	; that , himself a Liberal , he became Dictator only from sheer necessity ; that , wishing for peace , he was repeatedly forced into war by the European coalition ; that he supported and proclaimed the law of nations , and so on .

		This '' Napoleonic legend , '' so at variance with many historic facts , the author thinks may be traced to its source in the writ - ings and reported sayings of the
St. Helena	LOCATION	exile . ''

		THE DIAL 511 takes he had made , and , as far as it was in his power , he endeavoured to make up for them . ''

		The argument is well handled , and the book may be read with profit and pleasure in connec - tion with Lord
Rosebery	PERSON	's work , ''
Napoleon	PERSON	: the Last Phase , '' which the French author fre - quently cites .

		M.
Gonnard	ORGANIZATION	's competent trans - lator is unnamed , but deserves at least a closing word of praise .

		A decadent kingdom tottering to its
fall	DATE	, and hurried over the precipice by a brilliant but irre - sponsible and morally worthless ruler , is the subject of the late
R. Xisbet Bain	PERSON	's readable and scholarly volume on '' The Last King of
Poland	LOCATION	, and his Contemporaries . ''

		It is a department of eastern European history made familiar to the author by his previous studies and writings , and he , better than almost any other English scholar , was fitted to undertake the reading and critical study of the numerous Polish , Russian , and other authorities on the deeds and misdeeds of
Stanislaus Poniatowski	PERSON	.

		Of course it is no picture of puritanic virtues and austere living that we are called upon to contemplate ; the con - spicuous position that
Catherine II	PERSON	.

		occupies in the canvas is a sufficient assurance of that .

		Among the episodes -LRB- more amusing and perhaps more instructive than the main events -RRB- which en - liven the narrative is one in which the sorrows of an underpaid royal librarian ,
Reverdil	PERSON	, are serio-comically narrated by the librarian-author .

		Insufficient shelving , no charging system , no classification , poor lighting , and extreme exi - guity of income , were among the ills afflicting this royal library : while its custodian was obliged to marry two of the
King	LOCATION	's cast-off mis - tresses -LRB- but not simultaneously -RRB- in order to retain his unenviable position .

		Portraits of Stanislaus , the '' Prince Charming '' of the story , and of celebrated contemporaries , are liberally supplied .

		Sir
Horace Rumbold	PERSON	's late diplomatic experi - ence , as British Ambassador to the Emperor of
Austria	LOCATION	, has qualified him to write understand - ingly of that monarch and his court . ''

		Francis
Joseph	PERSON	and his Times '' is the title of a beauti - fully printed , well illustrated , and agreeably written volume from Sir
Horace	PERSON	's pen .

		The public and the private life of the Emperor are passed in review , his entrance on the scene being prepared for by five chapters of historical matter from the close of the eighteenth to the middle of the nineteenth century .

		In dealing with royalties , as with women , the natural impulse is to be to their virtues very kind and to their faults a little blind ; and this amiable impulse the author has indulged .

		But the aged ruler is surely a majestic figure .

		One wishes that Sir
Horace	PERSON	might have thrown some light on the tragic fate of Crown Prince
Rudolf	PERSON	, but the sad event of now twenty years ago is only briefly touched upon .

		The ties of politics and race uniting the Austrians and the Germans are regarded by the author as a '' baneful bond , '' and he views with not unnatural English appre - hension a possible welding together of all central
Europe	LOCATION	'' under the hard , unscrupulous lead of the most aspiring of Powers . ''

		The German bogy dies hard . ''

		The Iron Cardinal , '' by Mr.
Joseph MeCabe	PERSON	, modestly disclaims any pretensions to complete - ness as a biography , but , as indicated by its sub-title , '' The Romance of Richelieu , '' contents itself with examining the authenticity of certain romantic legends that have become associated with
Richelieu	ORGANIZATION	's name .

		In other words , this hero of the elder
Dumas	PERSON	and of
G. P. R. James	PERSON	is dragged with all his trappings of romance about him into the search-light of history ; and the result is the representation of a Richelieu rather less darkly repellant and ruthlessly ambi - tious than is the common conception of him .

		He has suffered , pleads the author , from two unfor - tunate circumstances : '' He was born into an age of national lawlessness , and it took a gener - ation to destroy it '' ; and his deeds and char - acter have been made the fruitful subject of many memoirs from the hands of his enemies , while those who knew him best and were not prejudiced against him have left no written tri - bute to his memory .

		The complete life of this wonderful man remains to be written , is in fact even now in process of writing by the French historian M. Hanotaux .

		Meanwhile this less serious and far less voluminous study of his character , with its many portraits and other attractive features , is welcome .

		Petrarch 's fame , as
Miss Maud F. Jerrold	ORGANIZATION	remarks in the preface to her ''
Francesco Pe	PERSON	- trarca , Poet and Humanist , '' was long that of a poet , his claims to consideration as a humanist being obscured by the beauties of his lyric verse .

		The purpose of her book is to do equal justice to the author of those Latin studies which are now attracting increasing attention , and to the composer of the exquisite sonnets whose modern imitators have , by their exaggeration of Pe - trarch 's faults of taste , thrown some shadow of disfavor upon their model .

		Accordingly , in a dozen narrative and critical chapters she tells 512 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, the story of his life and work , drawing freely for illustration on his vernacular verse and Latin prose , but condescending to the reader 's possible unfamiliarity with those tongues by supplying translations , apparently her own in most in - stances .

		The influence of Petrarch on English poetry , with the old argument from the Prologue of the '' Canterbury Tales '' to demonstrate the probability of a personal meeting between
Chaucer	PERSON	and his Italian contemporary , is treated in a chapter on ''
Petrarca	PERSON	's School . '

		The secret of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's charm as a man , the author finds in the fact that his character shows '' a total lack of the obvious and the consistent , and this it is , perhaps , which makes him so perennially inter - esting .

		There is nothing flatter in life than the people who are so like themselves , of whom we can predict what they will say and do on all occa - sions , and the line of conduct they are sure to pursue . ''

		A more careful avoidance of the tau - tology illustrated by the last sentence would have made still more excellent this scholarly treat - ment of an interesting theme .

		The appended bibliography , alphabetically arranged , is to be commended .

		One needs only to look upon the portrait of
Corot	LOCATION	to feel the charm of his naturalness and unaffected goodness .

		In Mr.
Everard Meynell	PERSON	's ''
Corot	LOCATION	and his Friends '' this endearing quality of the man is emphasized , and the reader is spared the jargon of the studio and the technical criticism of the expert .

		To Robaut 's voluminous work on
Corot	LOCATION	and to the intimate reminiscences of MM .

		Dumesnil and Silvestre the author acknowledges his large indebtedness .

		In the compass of three hundred openly printed pages he has brought together all that the desultory student of art history needs to know of this French painter , and the text is illustrated with a good number of half-tone prints from his masterpieces .

		These mechanical reproductions do but scant justice to the peculiar excellences of the originals , but they may at least spur on the reader to make the acquaintance of those originals .

		Some of
Corot	LOCATION	's attributes as artist and man are reflected in a friend 's account of him : '' He is simple , good , and altogether free from the vices of genius .

		He is so sweet and gentle that he hesitates to awake a dozing model .

		He is extremely gallant towards women , ex - tremely good-natured with children ... He has often said to me , ' When I find myself in one of Nature 's beautiful places , I grow angry with my pictures . '

		Perhaps the trials of his youth , the long contest made against his genius , had left some bitterness in his spirit . ''

		Books about Famous Womex .

		* The lives of actors , and perhaps even more of actresses , are likely to be full of interesting and often racy adventures and experiences , and their biographies have always made good read - ing .

		In her copious octavo on '' The
Incom	LOCATION	- parable Siddons '' Mrs.
Clement Parsons	PERSON	has got together a great amount of entertaining matter relating to the English stage of a century and more ago , the histrionically gifted
Kemble	PERSON	family , and the brightly shining light of that family , Mrs.
Sarah Kemble Siddons	PERSON	.

		To be sure , there are no scandals to lend their wicked allurement to the pages of such a life as Mrs.
Siddons	PERSON	's , -- and , indeed , one of her earlier biog - raphers ,
Thomas Campbell	PERSON	, has complained that from a memoir-writer 's point of view his subject was all '' piety and purity , '' and had , like the happy nation , no history . ''

		Dear good Mrs.
Siddons	PERSON	! ''

		he exclaimed ; '' she was a very angel , but devils make better stuff for biography . ''

		Almost as much as Queen
Victoria	PERSON	, says Mrs.
Parsons	PERSON	, she evoked the plain man 's respect for a good and great woman .

		The author 's studies for her `` Garrick and his Circle '' have paved the way to this second contribution to stage history , and the lack of any recent and detailed work on her chosen subject makes her book timely and acceptable .

		The long list of works consulted , and the footnotes , appendices , and index , are evidences of thoroughness and care on the writer 's part .

		Eight portraits of Mrs.
Siddons	PERSON	, with other illustrations , are provided for the adornment of the volume .

		A literary puzzle , fascinating to not a few students of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, has been the guessing of the original of '' Blumine '' in ''
Sartor Resartus	PERSON	. ''


Jane Welsh	PERSON	,
Kitty Kirkpatrick	PERSON	, and
Margaret Gordon	PERSON	have all been suggested .

		THE DIAL , 513 or two to a composite ' • Blumine '' ; but Mr.
Raymond Clare Archibald	PERSON	, in his exhaustive researches on the subject , now published in a book entitled ''
Carlyle	PERSON	's First Love , '' throws out
Kitty Kirkpatrick	PERSON	altogether , as never hav - ing inspired a tender sentiment in
Carlyle	LOCATION	's breast , and makes '' Blumine '' a compound of the other two , of whom he proceeds to set forth all that is known or knowable about the fair Margaret .

		In addition to printed and manu - script sources of information , the author has for several years been gathering scraps of knowl - edge from persons dwelling in various quarters of the globe ; and if we have not now the real
Margaret Gordon	PERSON	before us , it is hopeless to expect that we ever shall have .

		Interesting and full of character she must have been to attract the young
Kirkcaldy	LOCATION	schoolmaster ; and her extant and already published letters to him further demonstrate her possession of uncommon attri - butes .

		A frontispiece portrait , done in colors from a miniature , pictures her physical charms at the age of twenty-five ; and other illustrations are inserted in the body of the book .

		For a second time within a few years , the pathetic fate of the young and fair and innocent Lady
Jane Grey	PERSON	has been made the subject of careful historical study . ''

		The Nine Days ' Queen / ' by Mr.
Richard Davey	PERSON	, is written with studious regard to the philosophy of history , the causal connection of earlier with later events .

		It was by reason of a remarkable chain of con - spiracies that poor Httle Lady
Jane	PERSON	, sorely against her will , found herself exalted , at six - teen years of age , to the perilous height of Queen of
England	LOCATION	-- for nine days .

		AVhat these conspiracies were , and how they resulted in the tragedy of an innocent girl 's execution , is duly set forth by Mr.
Davey	PERSON	.

		The volume has two portraits of Lady
Jane	PERSON	, strangely un - like each other , with portraits of contemporary celebrities .

		It is only necessary to look at
Hayter	PERSON	's por - trait of Mrs.
Norton	PERSON	to understand why she has been an object of unusual interest both to con - temporaries and to posterity .

		In '' The Life of the Honourable Mrs.
Norton	PERSON	, '' by Miss
Jane Gray Perkins	PERSON	, her vehement personality is again presented , portrayed largely by herself in the many letters , some of them never before pub - lished .

		which her grandson has placed at the author 's disposal .

		It is to do her the justice which Miss
Perkins	PERSON	believes she has never before received , that this fresh narration of her wrongs and of her vigorous protest against them is added to the already existing accounts of her eventful life .

		The generous space allowed her to tell her own story in the form of intimate letters is a striking and admirable feature of the book .

		A glimpse of her also through the eyes of
John Van Buren	PERSON	-LRB- son of Martin -RRB- is thus afforded : '' She was very gracious to him and he admired her conversation , but her beauty was so unlike the fragile loveliness of his own country - women that he was not entirely pleased with ' that superb lump of flesh , ' as
Sidney Smith	PERSON	once jokingly called her . ''

		A
Ust	ORGANIZATION	, two pages long , of her novels , poems , songs , and miscel - lanies , is appended .

		Seven portraits of this famous granddaughter of the famous
Sheridan	PERSON	are provided , to complete the reader 's conception of her .

		Varied and sometimes uncommon have been the experiences on two continents of Lady
St. Helier	LOCATION	, as related in her '' Memories of Fifty Years . ''

		Born in
Munich	LOCATION	, of Scotch parents , reared in the far North of
Scotland	LOCATION	, married first to the second son of
Lord Stanley of Alderley	ORGANIZATION	, and after his death to Sir
Francis Jeune	PERSON	-LRB- afterward
Baron St. Helier	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , she gained a knowledge of the world ranging from a rough
Nevada	LOCATION	mining camp which she was the first woman to visit , to the brilliant society that fre - quented her drawing-rooms in Harley Street .

		She calls her delightfully readable book her '' first literary effort , '' and confesses that she has published it `` with the greatest diffidence , '' bespeaking her readers ' charitable indulgence for what she fears is `` a very rash attempt to provide them with a little amusement . ''

		Not - abilities without number are encountered in her pages , always making their entrance without flourish of trumpets , and generally adding much to the interest of the scene .

		She speaks , in pass '' ing , of her first meeting Motley -- `` at my Aunt Louisa 's -LRB- Lady Ashburton -RRB- one evening at dinner , and as he came into the room it seemed almost as if the most magnificent Van - dyck you could imagine had stepped out of its frame . ''

		A few portraits , including the author 's , and some sketches by Mr.
Harry Furniss	PERSON	and Sir
Frank Lockwood	PERSON	, add to the interest of this unassuming but very attractive volume .

		Convenient length and a readable style are the chief merits of Mr.
C. C. Dyson	PERSON	's '' Madame de Maintenon . ''

		The excuse for adding one more to the almost countless volumes inspired by that remarkable woman is thus given : `` For the benefit of those who have neither the money to buy nor the time to study such voluminous records of life at
the Court of Louis the Great	ORGANIZATION	, the author , having weighed the evidence for 514 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, and against disputed points , has extracted from the mass of superfluous matter the leading traits of her character and the most interesting epi - sodes of her life , and put them together in a concise form , hoping to give a clear conception of Mme. de
Maintenon	PERSON	and her career to the present generation , who for the most part have but an indistinct idea of her personality , and still more so of the scope of her great work
St. Cyr	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		In the weighing of evidence , the scales tip in favor of Mme. de
Maintenon	LOCATION	, the book being warmly eulogistic from beginning to end .

		Frequent portraits help to sustain the interest , a list of twenty-six leading French authorities precedes the narrative , and a short index is appended .

		Some

		* A family flight by motor-car through
Dalmatia	LOCATION	,
Montenegro	LOCATION	,
Herzegovina	LOCATION	, and
Bosnia	LOCATION	is briskly de - scribed and copiously illustrated in Mrs.
Frances Kinsley Hutchinson	PERSON	's '' Motoring in the
Balkans	LOCATION	. ''

		Something of the breathless speed of the petroleum chariot is felt in the exhilarating style of the narra - tive , `` which whirls the reader from
Trieste	LOCATION	down along the coast of the

		The Leader , the Cautious One , the Enthusiast , the Gentle Lady , and

		pages are free from the eye-wearying gloss that mars so many process-illustrated books .

		Mrs.
Hutchinson	PERSON	is already favorably known through her earlier work , `` Our Country Home . ''

		In a handsome volume entitled '' Travels in
Spain	LOCATION	'' Mr.
Philip Sanford Marden	PERSON	tells the story of a springtime journey from
Gibraltar	LOCATION	, or really from
Tangier	LOCATION	on the African side of the strait , across the Spanish Peninsula and ending at
Monserrat	LOCATION	.

		It is encouraging to intending travellers to be assured at the outset that no rancor is harbored in the Span - iard 's bosom against the victors in the unfortunate passage-at-arms of eleven years ago .

		The announce - ment that one is an American is almost always taken to mean South American ; but when the error is rectified no resentment is manifested .

		Mr.
Marden	PERSON	believes his book will meet a felt want on the part of visitors to
Spain	LOCATION	; and it does possess qualities not found in
Murray	LOCATION	or
Baedeker	LOCATION	.

		In regard to the numerous pictures he says they are all but two of his own making .

		They were , however , made with the help of a camera , and therefore call for no comment on the illustrator 's skill as an artist .

		To the stay - at-home traveller , no less than to him of more adven - turous mood , the book may be commended .

		The last book -LRB- or next to the last , if we may hope for his still unpublished Autobiography -RRB- we shall have from the pen of the late
Jeremiah Curtin	PERSON	, learned mythologist and wonderfully gifted linguist , has appeared under the title , '' A Journey in

		Not less interesting than the narrative itself is the prefatory account of the author from the pen of his one-time instructor in mathe - matics at
Harvard	LOCATION	, ex-President Eliot .

		Leaving the book to speak chiefly for itself , we are tempted to call attention here to one of
Curtin	ORGANIZATION	's earliest feats in language-learning .

		Seven months and a half before he entered

1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 515 forms us on the authority of the manuscript Auto - biography .

		That such a linguist -LRB- he knew more than sixty languages , and spoke all the tongues of
Europe	LOCATION	and some of those of
Asia	LOCATION	-RRB- was the right man to make the most of a journey among the Mongol tribes , is indisputable .

		His book is one that probably no other person could have produced with equal facility .

		The illustrations are many , and a map .

		with notes and two indices , is supplied .

		Described with the pen of an enthusiast , the • •
Rome	LOCATION	'' of Edward
Hutton	PERSON	should appeal to those who are quick to feel the charm of any spot that is old in story and romance .

		Adorned with sixteen colored pictures from the brush of Mr.
Maxwell Armfield	PERSON	, and with twelve uncolored half-tones , the volume , as published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, forms a handy and attractive pocket companion for the traveller , and also offers pleasant reading to the armchair tourist at his own fireside .

		It is no unsentimental journey that one makes in Mr. Hut - ton 's company .

		u I feel , '' he declares , '' the eternity of
Rome	LOCATION	as I feel the brief sweetness of every passing moment there : she seems to me as eternal and persistent as life , as strangely various , as mys - teriously secret .

		In her name is married domina - tion and love .

		ROMA-AMOR , which none may ever divide or separate . ''

		Strength rather than domination is etymologically suggested by the Eter - nal City 's name ; but that matters little .

		The book is evidently the mature fruit of a long and loving acquaintance with that whereof it treats .

		`` Round the World in a Motor-Car '' -LRB-
Kennerly	PERSON	-RRB- describes the eight-months tour of the globe made by
Signor Antonio Scarfoglio	PERSON	and two companions , from
Paris	LOCATION	westward to
Paris	LOCATION	again .

		The author is a young man , apparently in the early twenties -LRB- to judge by the frontispiece portrait -RRB- , and he writes with the young man 's fresh interest in everything visible , audible , tangible , or otherwise perceptible .

		There is , too , a juvenile proneness to remarks evi - dently intended to show smartness , but really show - ing immaturity and crudeness .

		The publication of the book in this country would seem to be rendered somewhat superfluous by passages like this : '' I do not like the Americans as a whole , just as I do not like the cheesemonger whom a prize in a lottery or a sudden rise in the price of potatoes has made wealthy .

		There is still too much of the herdsman about them , and their clothes are still permeated by the smell of the soil . ''

		This is much as though we should judge the people of
Italy	LOCATION	from the peregrinating organ - grinder or peanut-vender that adorn our city streets .

		The book is translated by Mr.
J. Parker Heyes	PERSON	, and has seventy half-tone illustrations on inserted leaves , but no map and no index .

		The antique and the modern coexist , side by side , in the wonderful land of
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		The automobile , the electric street-car and the arc-light have come ; but the aboriginal Mexican with his burro , the car - gador with his burden , and the old-time village priest , have remained .

		• *
Mexico	LOCATION	, the Wonderland of the South . ''

		contains Mr.
W. E. Carson	PERSON	's account of his travels from the
Rio Grande	LOCATION	on the north to the
Gulf of Tehuantepec	ORGANIZATION	in the south ; there being no lack of strange things and persons and events to describe on the way .

		Among the things to smile at is a Mexican restaurant-keeper 's attempt to nat - uralize the breakfast foods of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It can well be imagined that some of our fearful and wonderful names for various cereal products strained the Spanish language to the breaking point .

		The promise of profit from the development of tropical
Mexico	LOCATION	's exceedingly fertile lands will cheer those readers who have invested their money in any of the numerous agricultural or lumber or rubber - producing enterprises that have already drawn
millions of dollars	MONEY	to that land of amazing commer - cial possibilities -LRB- and some actualities -RRB- .

		Pictures abound in the book , and it is in every way as divert - ing as such a narrative could well be .

		Miss
Agnes Deans Cameron	PERSON	, who frankly de - scribes herself as a school-teacher of twenty-five years ' experience , has varied the rigors of the schoolroom with a
summer	DATE	's jaunt across
British America	LOCATION	, from
Winnipeg	LOCATION	-LRB- the journey really began at
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- to the mouth of the
Mackenzie River	LOCATION	.

		`` The New North '' is the name she gives to her account of the expedition .

		It was an arduous under - taking for a woman , but her full-length portrait shows her to be no weakling , and the vigorous style of her narrative is further proof of her abundant vitality .

		She is a loyal Canadian and delights to sing the praises of her native land ; but in claiming for
Winnipeg	LOCATION	a '' phenomenal growth '' unequalled by any city on the continent in the last thirty-three years , she goes a little too far .

		Our great West and
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	can show even more surprising examples of rapid growth --
Seattle	LOCATION	, for instance .

		Through - out her travels ,
Miss Cameron	PERSON	used her camera to as good purpose as her eyes ; and she has adorned her book with more than two hundred interesting views and portraits .

		Though heavy to the hand , the volume is by no means heavy reading .

		Dr.
Wilfred T. Grenf ell	PERSON	, ever busy with head and hands in improving the condition of his chosen people of chilly Labrador , has collaborated with eleven other interested investigators and students in the prepara - tion of a substantial volume entitled ; t Labrador : the Country and the People . ''

		The burden of the work has , almost inevitably , been shouldered by Dr.
Gren	PERSON	- f ell ; while chapters on the history , geology , fauna , flora , and other belongings or characteristics of the country , have been contributed by Mr.
W.S.Wallace	PERSON	, Dr.
Reginald A. Daly	PERSON	, Mr.
Charles W. Johnson	PERSON	, Mr.
Outram Bangs	PERSON	, Miss
Mary J. Rathbun	PERSON	, and others .

		The missionary-doctor 's faith in the rich future of this sub-arctic region is fairly touching . ''

		Surely it will come to pass , '' he confidently affirms , '' that one day another
Atlantic City	LOCATION	will rise amidst these unexplored but invigorating wilds to lure men and women tired of heat and exhausted by the nerve stress of overcrowded centres . ''

		Perhaps so ; but not , we fancy , until the terrible mosquito of the short and fierce Canadian
summer	DATE	has been exterminated .

		The 516 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, book has , among other merits , that of dealing with a subject not yet written to death by earlier authors .

		The numerous pictures are an important feature of the work .

		Mr.
Norman Duncan	PERSON	and Mr.
Lawren Harris	PERSON	journeyed together from
Jerusalem	LOCATION	down into
Egypt	LOCATION	, pursuing much the same route as that fol - lowed by Joseph in
Bible	LOCATION	days ; and they have put their noteworthy experiences into book form , Mr.
Duncan	PERSON	supplying the narrative and his companion the illustrations . ''

		Going Down from
Jerusalem	LOCATION	'' succeeds in surrounding itself with the right atmos - phere without tiring the reader with landscape descriptions .

		The modest compass of the volume is mostly filled with the human element , and many types of the desert and the vineyard and the silent hills are skilfully presented .

		Among these the '' desert detective '' is not the least interesting .

		It is indeed a marvellous thing , as the author says , that a man should be able to tell whence a camel or a wanderer comes -- whether from city or moun - tain , sandy desert , or hard-bottomed waste -- by the mere imprint of his feet .

		Even further than that , we are assured that he can determine , from this footprint , the weight of a camel 's load , the tribe to which a man belongs , the manner of his passing , whether by stealth or openly , and much more be - sides .

		The many quaint conversations and anec - dotes recorded make the book diverting , and the pictures contribute much in the way of '' local color , '' though executed in black and white .

		The people and the places of old Brittany have been visited , partly by automobile , incongruous though that may appear , by Mrs.
Frances M. Gostling	PERSON	, who records her pleasant outing in `` The Bretons at Home . ''

		By following her itinerary she feels assured that travellers will gain a better knowl - edge of the Province than by spending their time at the ordinary tourist resorts , which have ceased to be distinctively Breton .

		A seven-page introduction in French by M. Anatole Le
Braz	PERSON	commends the book to the reader 's confidence , and numerous pictures , in color and in half-tone , stimulate the interest .

		It is surely a quaint country , unspoiled by modernity , where the natives still repair to the graveyard and seek the silent companionship of the dead when they wish to have a comfortable smoke , to make love , or to gossip .

		The unhackneyed and the unartificial are found in Mrs. Gostling 's pages .

		The curiosities , antiquities , legends , ruins , natu - ral beauties , and other attractions of Northumber - land have received sympathetic and rather detailed treatment at the hands of Mr.
A. G. Bradley	PERSON	in a compactly printed octavo entitled '' The Romance of
Northumberland	LOCATION	. ''

		The first chapter is physio - graphical and historical , the last is devoted to an account of the battle of
Flodden Field	ORGANIZATION	, and the fourteen intermediate ones take up the chief points of interest , one after another .

		A map precedes , an index follows , and sixteen colored and twelve uncol - ored illustrations are interspersed .

		The brightness of the colored pictures hardly accords with pre - conceptions of the grayness , approaching sombreness , of the too-often fog-enveloped regions described ; but doubtless even
Northumberland	LOCATION	has its
summer	DATE	days of serenity .

		As a guide book or travel narra - tive of the intensive sort , the work bears evidence of diligence and care and minute research .

		An odd whim prompted Mr.
Henry Festing Jones	PERSON	to dedicated his little book of `` Diversions in
Sicily	LOCATION	'' to a certain unborn
Enrico Pampalone	PERSON	, to whom he is to stand godfather as soon as the birth is an ac - complished fact .

		The whimsical dedication , which covers three pages , is followed by other things whimsical or otherwise diverting in the nineteen short chapters of the book .

		A good deal about marionette theatres and the plays there presented is entertainingly chronicled , and many Sicilian oddities of other sorts are also encountered .

		Although the writer speaks of his sketching in the course of his wanderings , he has furnished no specimen of his artistic skill , the book being innocent of pictorial embellishment .

		The recent cataclysm and other horrors in
Sicily	LOCATION	are light-heartedly ignored ; in fact , a part of the volume appears to have been written before iEtna 's late outburst , and is here republished after appearance elsewhere .

		The hunting parson is more common in
England	LOCATION	than in this country ; but we have at least one Nim - rod of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and a lion-hunter at that .

		The Rev. Dr.
W. S. Rainsford	PERSON	, the well-known former rector of
St. George	ORGANIZATION	's , in
New York	LOCATION	, recently spent thirteen months in
East Africa	LOCATION	, hunting big game , and his book , '' The Land of the Lion , '' describes in detail , and with many pictures from photographs , the things he did and saw and heard about in that huntsman 's paradise .

		Keen on the scent for game though Dr.
Rainsford	PERSON	is , it is not the mere butchery that engrosses him .

		Among the divers excursory speculations and reflections that the book contains is a little homily on the degeneration of the rhinoceros under the too-easy conditions of his modern life -- '' surely , '' concludes the preacher-hunter , '' a striking illustration , in the animal world , of that universal truth we are so prone to forget : that easy times do not always make for real usefulness or greatness . ''

		The literature of African hunting , already abundant , is increasing in these days ; but a more variously in - teresting book for the stay-at-home general reader than Dr.
Rainsford	PERSON	's will not soon make its appearance .

		The reviewer seldom has an easier or a pleasanter task than that of unfolding the merits of Miss
Anne Macdonnell	PERSON	's '' In the
Abruzzi	LOCATION	'' ; for he need do little besides quoting a few words from the text , and recommending that the twelve illustrations after water-color drawings by Miss
Amy Atkinson	PERSON	be seen .

Rome	LOCATION	in mileage , incalculably distant in everything else '' -- especially in having no present-day art . ''

		THE DIAL 517 But u the picturesque is everywhere , and to an ex - travagant degree . ''

		After relieving the traveller 's mind by assuring him that the mountains are much saf er than
London	LOCATION	, since brigandage has ceased and there are only occasional wolves , and informing him of religion , folk-lore , and ancient art ,
Miss Mac	ORGANIZATION	- donnell conducts him from one beautiful spot to another , each with its own '' flaunting defiance of the ordinary , '' and many of them unknown because '' the guide-books dare not star anything so inconveniently placed . ''

		The people from whom sprang
Ovid	LOCATION	,
Michetti	PERSON	, the
Rosettis	PERSON	, and d'Annunzio -LRB- who '' has maladies of the spirit which his people have not '' -RRB- , are u an old race , and by no means simple .

		They have long and unquiet memories ; and out of the past there are survivals and dreams that to-day does not readily understand . ''

		The volume is a thick octavo , modestly bound , and interesting from begin - ning to end .

		In the form of newspaper letters , and afterward in the shape of a book , Mr.
Franklin Matthews	PERSON	has already told the story of the
Atlantic Fleet	ORGANIZATION	's cruise from
Hampton Roads	LOCATION	to
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		The account of the remainder of the voyage , from
San Francisco	LOCATION	westward to the original starting-point , has now been republished from the
New York	LOCATION	'' Sun , '' with added matter , in a companion volume entitled '' Back to
Hampton Roads	LOCATION	. ''

		Forty-six thousand knots , or nearly twice the circumference of the earth , were steamed by the participating war-ships , and enough important points were visited to furnish the accompanying journalist with material for varied and interesting letters home .

		Life on shipboard , too , is made to appear not at all monotonous by the resourceful pen of Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	.

		His style in this volume is as brisk and jaunty as in its predecessor .

		The book , with its occasional pictures , is all that one could ask for in its sort .

		Holiday Publications .

		ii .

		Illustrated Editions of
Standard Literature	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two additions are made this year to the Shake - spearian dramas that may be had in beautifully illustrated quarto volumes .

		The latest plays to be given pictorial settings are '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' and '' As You Like It , '' both published , in daintily bound large print volumes , by
Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton	ORGANIZATION	.

		For `` The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' Sir
James D. Linton	PERSON	has made nearly forty pictures .

		They are richly colored ; costuming and accessories are carefully studied ; and as decoration , or as suggestions for staging the play , they are very successful .

		As interpretations of the spirit of the comedy , they fail ; for they are lacking in poetic imagination .

		Mr.
Hugh Thomson	PERSON	's delightful pic - tures , -- daintily colored , elusive in suggestion , playful , full of romantic imagination as well as of humor , -- are all that Sir
James Linton	PERSON	's are not , and not all that his are .

		The stage manager would find them too slight and simple to be of practical value .

		Indeed , they have nothing to do with a matter so artificial as the stage .

		Pretty
Rosalind	PERSON	asleep on a bank with woodland elves peering at her beauty ;
Rosalind	PERSON	with
Celia	PERSON	and Touchstone wearily leaning against a sturdy
Arden	PERSON	oak ;
Phebe	PERSON	imploring Rosa - lind to love her , while the neglected sheep stare stupidly from the nearest hill-side , -- no scenes like these were ever played outside the magic bounds of
Arden	PERSON	and men 's minds .

		It is natural to compare Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	's work in color with
Dulac	PERSON	's and
Rackham	PERSON	's .

		We miss in it the Oriental richness of coloring and detail that characterizes the one , and the wonderful densely peopled fairy world that the other evokes ; but upon turning back to '' As You Like It '' we perceive a certain suggestiveness and lightness of touch , veiled humor and subtlety , which , if perhaps not so compelling as the qualities of the younger artists , are very charming , and mark this volume as a distinct achievement for its illustrator , and as one of the choicest gift books of the year .

		A new ''
Rackham	PERSON	book '' has come to be an annual event of exceptional interest .

		This year Mr.
Arthur Rackham	PERSON	has several illustrated volumes to his credit , but all except one are new adaptations of old work .

		The completely new work is to be found in a reprint of De la Motte Fouque '' 's `` Undine '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the text adapted from the German by Mr.
W. L. Courtney	PERSON	, with fifteen full-page pictures in color and many decorative bits in black-and-white by Mr.
Rackham	PERSON	.

		The M fearsome forest '' by the fisherman 's cottage , and the '' crystal vault '' of waters to which Undine ever returned , the weird beauty of Undine herself , and her strange adventures with the knight Huld - brand , afford Mr.
Rackham	PERSON	exactly the right motives .

		He strikes no new note , and he offers less material , in bulk , than usual ; which means that the '' Undine '' is slighter but no less charming than the other
Rackham	PERSON	books .

		Robert
Browning	PERSON	's `` Dramatis Personse '' and '' Dramatic Romances and Lyrics '' have been illus - trated in color by Miss Eleanor
Fortescue Brickdale	PERSON	, and are published by
Messrs. J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		in a companion volume to `` Pippa Passes '' and `` Men and Women , '' also illustrated by Miss Brickdale .

		The text generally follows that of the first editions ; but the first version of '' Saul '' is omitted , since that poem is included in full in the other volume .

		The illustrations , which are beautifully reproduced , just as the text is beautifully printed , emphasize the pictorial and sensuous elements of
Browning	PERSON	's poetry , rather than its deeper significance .

		The binding is of gray buckram , with gold lettering and decorations .

		As `` The Water-Babies '' is certainly a fairy tale for children of all ages , it would indeed be bad logic to consider
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	's new quarto edition with illus - trations in color by Mr.
Warwick Goble	PERSON	as exclu - sively or chiefly a book for the very young .

		Mr.
Goble	PERSON	's style is more like
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's than
Dulac	PERSON	's or
Rackham	PERSON	's , -- quaint , simple , suggestive , occa - sionally a little crude in its attempt to be expressive 518 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, without effort .

		On the whole , it is very well suited to depicting water babies , good fairies , '' great fish , '' the caves of the sea , and other matters discussed by
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	.

		The text is in large , clear print , and the plates are separately mounted on tinted sheets .

		`` Friendship Framed in Flowers , '' the Misses Cowles might have called the reprint of
Cicero	PERSON	's '' De Amicitia '' and
Emerson	PERSON	's essay on Friendship , for which they have decorated the margins , if they had chosen to be both explicit and alliterative ; but they use only the modest title '' Friendship , '' and allow the reader to learn for himself what they have added .

		The editors have provided for each left-hand page a quotation on Friendship , from someone who had a good saying about it -- though they have missed some of the best .

		But in this case the decorations are the book .

		Each page is framed in a flower border , one of pansies , the next of ragged robins , the next of anemones , etc. .

		They are the perfection of conventionalized naturalness , some on gold with line borders , some without background .

		George
Eliot	PERSON	's poem of '' Two Lovers '' is issued in holiday dress by Messrs.
Moffat	PERSON	,
Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, with illustrations in color by Mr.
Howard Chandler Christy	PERSON	.

		Poet and illustrator do not , at first thought , seem happily matched ; but as '' Two Lovers '' is not particularly characteristic of
George Eliot	PERSON	, the choice of artist becomes more or less an arbitrary matter .

		Mr.
Christy	PERSON	's pictures are in his familiar style of showing pretty well-dressed women admired by handsome well-groomed men .

		Of additions to well-known gift-book series , we have the usual quota .

		There are three new ''
Chis	PERSON	- wick Calendars '' -LRB-
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , described more accurately as year-books , with daily quota - tions from some classic writer , and a portrait fron - tispiece in photogravure by way of ornament .

Annie Russell Marble	PERSON	, the '' `` Wordsworth Calendar '' by
A. E. Sims	PERSON	, and the '' Stevenson Calendar '' by Miss

Christmas Carol	PERSON	. ''

		-- The new volume in Messrs.
H. M. Caldwell Co.	PERSON	's '' Great Galleries of
Europe	LOCATION	'' is devoted to the
Wallace	PERSON	collection .

		It consists , like the rest of the series , of about sixty half-tone plates , each accompanied by a few lines of descrip - tion .

		-- The Sesame Booklets '' boast a long list of additional volumes : '' Great Thoughts from Rus - kin , '' '' Wayside Thoughts from Shakespeare , '' '' The King of the Golden River , '' `` Goblin Mar - ket , '' ''
Gabriel Gent	PERSON	, '' '' Christmas at
Dingley Dell	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` Bardell vs. Pickwick , '' `` The Pied Piper , '' `` The Nut-Brown Maid , '' and '' Little Essays Abbreviated from

		-- From the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	come four volumes in the '' Oxford Moment Series . ''

		One is bound in vellum , one in flowered silk , one in plain limp leather , and one in leather embossed with a graceful design ; and all may be had in any of the four styles thus illustrated .

Omar Khayyam	PERSON	, '' '' Moments with

		Illustrated Art Books .

		The three volumes in prettily flowered cloth binding which are dedicated to the '' Modes and Manners of the Nineteenth Century '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , and are translated with revisions by
M. Edwardes	PERSON	, from the text of Dr.
Oscar Fischel	PERSON	and
Max V. Boehm	PERSON	, bring forward the awesome subject of clothes in a way not to be ignored .

		The paradox of ugly gar - ments shown in lovely prints is constantly achieved by these plates from English , French , and German predecessors of ''
Godey	ORGANIZATION	's Lady 's Book . ''

		The folly of fashions could not have more charming exposition .

		Besides numerous color prints , there are hundreds of half-tones , some of them from the paintings of
David	PERSON	,
Ingres	ORGANIZATION	, or
Goya	ORGANIZATION	.

		The text is not to be ignored , either , with its comments , often incisive , on history , politics , art , and religion , from
1780	DATE	to
1870	DATE	.

		But all subjects , as the
Sartor	PERSON	himself has told us , lead to clothes ; and the way is pointed by slight but daring signs of philosophy .

		`` We knew that the Empire costume was the natural outgrowth of the teaching of
Rousseau	PERSON	; but had we considered that the infinitude of flounces which followed was '' the fitting accompaniment for the medley of chivalry , romance , `` Weltschmerz , medievalism , mes - merism , and God knows what else , which in
1830	DATE	were all in turn the chief subjects of interest '' ?

		This sartorial philosophy is not pessimistic , for after seeing how much worse the hats of
1810	DATE	were than those of to-day the reader is encouraged to hope that the world is growing more sensible -- even though slowly .

		He might like to suggest that where the mass of material is so great , an index for both illustrations and text would be an improvement , did he not perhaps feel that these volumes , like some of the women pictured in them , are too pretty to find fault with .

		One of the notable art volumes of the year , com - bining in unusual degree beauty of illustration with brilliancy of authorship , is Mr.
Haldane Macfall	PERSON	's `` The French Pastellists '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , edited by Mr.
T. Leman Hare	PERSON	.

		The book is quarto size , so that the beautifully colored illustrations , which are all separately mounted , are large enough to produce their full effect .

		They are fifty-two in number , more than half of them exhibiting the work of the master in pastels , La Tour .

		Rosalba ,
Boucher	PERSON	,
Chardin	LOCATION	,
Perronneau	LOCATION	,
Boze	PERSON	, and le
Brun	PERSON	are among the other artists represented .

		If the plates whet one 's appe - tite for information , the quality of the text gives it yet a keener edge .

		Mr.
Macfall	PERSON	writes of the lives of the pastellists , the times that moulded their work and gave it vogue , characterizes their art and esti - mates their significance .

		His phrasing is epigram - matic , suggestive , at times studied to the point of
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 519 affectation , but always significant .

		He has caught characteristic anecdotes , names characteristic quali - ties , pictures vividly the charm of the age and the men of whom he writes .

		His work is much too profound and scholarly to be summed up in any brief notice such as this , which can only aim at super - ficial description for the guidance of holiday buyers .

		Some of these will remember with pleasure the • • Eighteenth Century French Prints '' of last year , to which the new study is intended as a companion volume .

		Part of the satisfaction derived from such a sump - tuous folio as Mr.
Francis Lenygon	PERSON	's '' The
Decora	ORGANIZATION	- tions and Furniture of English Mansions during the XVII .

		and XVIII .

		Centuries '' -LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is that we ourselves need not live under such masses of mag - nificence .

		Still , most of us have enough love of splendor -- atavistic , perhaps -- to enjoy seeing the pictured presentment of the elaborately worked ceil - ings and stairways of
Inigo Jones	PERSON	and Sir
Christo	PERSON	- pher ``
Wren	PERSON	, the impossibly heavy and ornate tables and chairs of
William Kent	PERSON	, the chimney-pieces of
Grinling Gibbons	PERSON	, with their * ' fruitages , herbages , gumms .

		beasts , fowls , etc. , exceeding natural all round , '' and even the screens and paintings in ' * Chinese style '' for which the wealthy used to spend their substance .

		These striking objects are here set before us in full-page photographs tastefully mounted on gray paper , or in page after page of admirable half-tones .

		The text imparts no small knowledge of the decorative work of the great architects whose genius for these lesser things is often overlooked , and also of the manufacture of tapestries , carpets , lacquer , mirrors , and other accessories .

		Many of the things are very beautiful , especially the walls in natural wood ; but many of them would be much more beauti - ful if they were more simple .

		History .


St. Paul 's Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	, like its neighbor `` Westminster Abbey , has furnished materials for many books ; and it has been supposed that Dean
Milman	PERSON	's u Annals '' would have precluded any attempt at another comprehensive history of the great cathedral .

		But the Rev.
William McDonald Sinclair	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	,
Archdeacon	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	,
Canon of St Paul	ORGANIZATION	's , and Honorary Chaplain to the
King	LOCATION	, finds a raison d'etre for his '' Memorials of St.
Paul	PERSON	's Cathedral '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- in the fact that
Milman	PERSON	's u Annals '' were published in
1868	DATE	, and since that year many changes have taken place in the great cathedral , and many reforms have been instituted in the religious life which centres therein ; so that the '' Annals '' can no longer be accepted as an accurate description of the
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	's that now is .

		Many of the reforms were due to the energy of the present Dean , Doctor
Gregory	PERSON	, for whom the author has great veneration , expressed not only in the dedication of the book to him , but in many ways throughout the volume .

		For the early history of the cathedral the author has drawn chiefly upon
Milman	PERSON	's u Annals , '' but with - out neglecting other valuable books on
St. Paul 's	ORGANIZATION	and its famous architect .

		For the later period , embracing the
last half-century	DATE	, he has been priv - ileged to have access to the diaries of the late
Robert Green	ORGANIZATION	, Dean 's
Verger	PERSON	, extending over forty-eight years of service at
St. Paul 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Three chapters of the book are devoted to extracts from these diaries , with additions and explanatory notes by the author .

		The book is both a history and a guide-book , and contains many valuable biographical notes of the Bishops of
London	LOCATION	,
Deans	PERSON	, organists , and others associated with the life of the great Cathedral .

		The numerous illustrations , by
Louis Weirter	PERSON	, include ground-plans of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	's so arranged as to com - pare its size with St
Peter	PERSON	's ,
Rome	LOCATION	, and with the old St.
Paul	PERSON	's ; and various details of Sir
Christopher Wren	PERSON	's masterpiece of architecture .

		The substantial look of Mr.
H. B. Wheatley	PERSON	's ``
Hogarth	PERSON	's
London	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dutton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with its sensible binding , will remind many of us of our first sets of
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	; and not inappropriately , since
Hogarth	PERSON	did for
London	LOCATION	with his engravings what the novelists did later with their stories .

		Mr.
Wheatley	PERSON	has not attempted to supersede in any way Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	's authoritative work on
Hogarth	PERSON	, but has only elaborated a sub-topic .

		In the thirty years since he first considered the subject , he has learned much of the life of eighteenth-century Lon - don in mansion and tavern , church and court-room , theatre and hospital ; and he divides what he has to say , apropos of the pictures , under these heads .

		The pictures given in the very excellent reproductions are wisely selected , partly from well-known engrav - ings and paintings , and partly from rare ones .

		The interpretations are in many cases quoted from Ire - land 's ''
Hogarth	PERSON	Illustrated . ''

		Mr.
Wheatley	PERSON	does not despise the absorbing question , '' Who was this meant for ? ''

		but traces many of the caricatures to their originals , often with great detail of time and circumstance .

		But after all the detail the reality which haunts the reader when he closes the book is not that of
London	LOCATION	, but of
Hogarth	PERSON	himself , the • • unrelenting , uncompromising , uncompassionate '' moralist who showed
London	LOCATION	to itself in '' one of the worst-mannered periods of our history . ''

		The vein of tenderness in the artist , which has been too little emphasized by commentators , is brought out by his pictures of the '' Shrimp Girl '' and of his own six servants .

		The
France	LOCATION	, or rather the
Paris	LOCATION	, of a bygone age is capable of reconstruction out of the innumerable memoirs and diaries of contemporary French cele - brities , more readily and more accurately than the same sort of rehabilitation can be effected for almost any other country or capital of either hemisphere . '

		• The Days of the Directoire , '' compiled from many and trustworthy sources of information , with occa - sional calls upon secondary authorities of less un - doubted reliability , is the product of the diligent pen of Mr.
Alfred Allinson	PERSON	, and is published in a sub - stantial octavo by the
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among the half-hundred illustrations occur some curious costume plates , selected by Mr.
John Colby Abbott	PERSON	.

		A para 520 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, graph , chosen at random , affords a glimpse of
Paris	LOCATION	life under conditions so difficult for us now to realize . ''

		The theatres , '' we read , '' were in full swing .

		Strange as it may seem , it is nevertheless a fact that a certain number of houses had never closed their doors , not even in the worst days of the Terror , and now , in safer circumstances and under more favour - able conditions , a score or so were giving regular or occasional performances .

		Never had the play been more popular , or audiences more numerous and enthusiastic . ''

		Wit and Humor .

		The bead necessarily escapes somewhat from wit pressed into a book , but Mr.
William Harvey	PERSON	has at least preserved a good Hibernian flavor in his '' Irish Life and Humour '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The life is not described except by Mr.
Erskine Nicol	PERSON	's paintings , which are reproduced in full color , and show a dozen or more of the sons of
Erin	PERSON	and one or two of the daughters making themselves happy in various char - acteristic ways .

		These homely mobile faces supply the impression of actuality needed in a five-hundred - page recital of jokes .

		Not but that the stories are good , for they are ; they will even satisfy the person who u thinks they will be better than he expects . ''

		Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	does well not to over-introduce them , and not to pad them , but to give them '' straight , '' with only such explanation as is necessary to their understanding .

		The jokes and stories are not all new , and most of them are from books ; but who could make a representative collection of which this would not be true ?

		It is enough that they are well told , diverting , and convincingly true to life .

		Among the humorous booklets of the season , one of the wittiest is '' The New Golfer 's Almanac for the Year 1910 '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , compiled by Mr.
W. L. Stoddard	PERSON	and sympathetically illustrated by Mr.
A. W. Bartlett	PERSON	.

		The aim of the book is to do for the golfer -LRB- `` a large and necessary class '' -RRB- what the '' Farmer 's Almanac '' does for the agriculturist , viz. : to present him with a grist of useful information , and entertaining and instructive reading , assembled , in this instance , from the choicest prose and poetry to be found in golfing literature .

		-- '' Fore !

		The Call of the Links '' -LRB-
H. M. Caldwell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a collection of humorous verse about golfers and some other people , by Mr.
W. Hastings Webling	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Webling	PERSON	compares golf to life in that '' it produces inspiration , and inspiration begets poetry . ''

		There are many illustrations in tint .

		-- Another `` large and necessary class '' is provided for by Mr.
Arnold Haultain	PERSON	, who once wrote about golf , and now writes '' Hints for Lovers '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a collection of wise , witty , cynical , and suggestive sayings about girls , men , women , love , and love-making , beauty , kisses , en - gagements , marriage , and other allied subjects .

		A charming pink-and-silver binding is , happily , the only decoration .

		-- '' Foolish Questions '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
R. Goldberg	PERSON	, is a book for everybody who has ever been asked a foolish ques - tion .

		It may also be consulted with profit and pleasure by those who have the foolish question habit .

		It suggests many apt and conclusive answers to the queries of the '' Bromides '' whose idea of startling conversation is the Inquiry Obvious ; and there are illustrations which further elucidate the subject .

		-- Mr.
Harry Graham	PERSON	's '' Deportmental Ditties '' -LRB-
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- explain , in flowing verse , the correct and remunerative behavior for every sit - uation in life .

		Whether one is choosing a profession , making or receiving a proposal , dancing , is at sea or at table , Mr.
Graham	PERSON	has entertaining sugges - tions to offer .

		-- Mother Goose parodies on the humors of bridge , bridge rules in rhyme , limericks exploiting the bridge fiend , the novice , the bad loser , and other familiar types , make up Miss
Mabel Allen Avery	PERSON	's `` Mother Goose on Bridge '' -LRB-
Syracuse	LOCATION	,
N.Y.	LOCATION	,
Lyman Brothers	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		For the confirmed bridge player , provided he has also a sense of humor , no better gift could be devised .

		-- '' The Thin Santa Claus : The Christmas Yard that was a Christmas - Stocking '' is the inviting if somewhat cryptic title of Mr.
Ellis Parker Butler	PERSON	's latest story .

		A re - minder that Mr.
Butler	PERSON	is the author of '' Pigs is Pigs '' and '' That Pup '' will perhaps stand in lieu of any further account of his latest effort .

		-- '' Wags '' -LRB-
A. Wessels	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Morgan Shepard	PERSON	, is further described on the title-page as '' The Philosophy of a Peaceful Pup . ''

		The Pup is optimistic as well as peaceful , and his theories of life will cheer and amuse all '' under-dogs '' who read them ; and who is not sometimes in the position of `` under-dog '' ?

		-- '' Lays of a Lazy Dog '' -LRB-
Luce & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are '' interpre - ted '' by Mr.
D. K. Stevens	PERSON	and illustrated by Miss
Katherine Maynadier Browne	PERSON	.

		The '' Lazy Dog '' is a pampered
Boston	LOCATION	bull ; not so pampered , how - ever , that he has not had many interesting expe - riences .

		-- '' A Night Out '' -LRB- Moffat -RRB- , by Mr.
Edward Peple	PERSON	, is the tale of a Persian cat , also pampered , who spent one '' night out '' in plebeian company , and came back `` the morning after '' damaged but happy .

		-- Parents and other relatives of brilliant children will enjoy the late Rear Admiral
Preble	PERSON	's collection of children 's bright remarks , called '' Did Your Child Say This ? ''

		-LRB-
John W. Luce & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Occasional blank pages headed '' What Did Your Child Say ? ''

		gives aforesaid parents and relatives an opportunity to make choice additions to the printed collection .

		-- Finally , '' The Airship Alma - nac , a Little Light Literature on High Life '' tells with vivid illustrations , how to get off the earth and how to get on again , including much excellent advice on how and when to fall , complete list of official hospitals of the
Agro Club	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		The author is Mr.
Lewis Allen	PERSON	, '' Master of Starts , Doctor of Gravity . ''

		-LRB-
John W. Luce & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Holiday Fiction .

		The elaborately wrought cover , and the richly - colored prints from paintings by Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	, draw immediate attention to Mr.
James Branch Cabell	PERSON	's collection of romances which appears under the rather inadequate title `` Chivalry '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- .

		These ten stories are said to be adapted from '' The
1909	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 521 Dizain of
Queens	LOCATION	, of that noble maker in the French tongue ,
Messire Nicolas de Caen	PERSON	, '' dedicated to Isabella of
Portugal	LOCATION	in
1470	DATE	.

		Inasmuch as indexes of Romance literature know no such person , Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	is likely to receive credit for inventing both stories and author ; but that is probably the more credit , since it is well done .

		The stories have to do with kings and queens of
England	LOCATION	, and tell how Eleanor of
Provence	LOCATION	, wife of
Henry III.	PERSON	, repented her of her bloody deeds when a loyal knight gave his life for her ; how Edward I. tempestuously wooed Elinor of
Castile	LOCATION	; how even Isabelle the Cruel , wife of Edward II. , had enough of chivalry in her heart to forgive the lover who abandoned her ; how
Henry V. met Katherine	PERSON	of
France	LOCATION	'' all in a garden fair , '' and won her love before history spied upon them ; and how many other brave events came about .

		There are tense and tragic situations in plenty , and each brings out some heroic sacrifice .

		The tales are told with a fervor which , however much it may have characterized the people of the time , has not crept into the manner of their chroni - cles .

		But partly for this reason the tales will be accepted as breathing the very spirit of '' the bleak , florid age . ''

		The troubadour 's part is justly repre - sented by many flowing , ardent songs .

		A romance of a few days of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's life , written by
Louise Beecher	PERSON	Chancellor and called '' The Players of
London	LOCATION	, '' brings '' the dark lady '' to life in rather a pretty and ingenious way .

		Shake - speare has written '' Romeo and Juliet '' for the Lord
Chamberlain	PERSON	's Company to play before the Queen , but at the last moment
Philip Condell	ORGANIZATION	, on whose beauty and grace in the part of Juliet the success of the drama depends , is desperately ill .

		Resolved not to fail ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Burbage	PERSON	carry their Juliet to
Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	, where by accident Shakespeare dis - covers that the slender actor is not Philip but his sister PhyUis .

		He keeps the secret , and
Phyllis	PERSON	carries off the play better than her brother could have done .

		But
Shakespeare	PERSON	, and later
Southamp	PERSON	- ton , fall in love with
Phyllis	PERSON	, and from the resulting complication the imaginary heroine emerges with rather more dignity than either of her lovers .

		If the reader is willing that this should be so , he will like the story ; if not , he will at least grow wise from the careful study of historic background , and will gather a possible explanation of some of the sonnets .

		The book is a large octavo , bound in violet cloth , the shade of which is repeated in Mr.
Harry B. Mathews	PERSON	's page decorations .

		A compilation , by
Mary Minerva Barrows	PERSON	, of prose and verse quotations on `` The Value of
Happi	LOCATION	- ness '' -LRB-
H. M. Caldwell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- shows a commendably catholic taste .

		A person ought to get a full view of the subject when he has before him the sentiments of the wise , from

Horace	PERSON	, on the same page .

		On the whole , the ex - tracts lean to the safe and serious , -- the name of
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	and even of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	being notice - ably absent .

		The critic might venture the thought that such a compilation would be more valuable if the proportion of famous names were greater , and those not known or little known were fewer ; but that would prove that he had not reached that mea - sure of contentment which the book is well fitted to give .

		Such contentment , however , is sure to come to him from the tinted decorations which enclose the text .

		In Mr.
Lionel Strachey	PERSON	's selection of '' Love Letters of Famous Royalties and Commanders '' -LRB-
John McBride Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- the little god of the bow and arrows takes up the harp of life and smites on all the chords with considerable force .

		Among the '' royalties , '' Henry the Eighth of

		Each month has a verse and a picture , into which is deftly introduced the necessary calendar , the excuse for all this admir - able fooling .

		-- Serious-minded readers will like Mr.
John T. McFarland	PERSON	's calendar '' A Year with the Master . ''

		There is a sheet , printed in two colors , for each week of the year , giving the Sunday-school lesson , daily Bible readings , and an extract chosen from Dr.
McFarland	PERSON	's book `` Etchings of the Master . ''

		`` The Calendar of the Fellowship for
1910	DATE	'' -LRB- Boston :
Bacon & Brown	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , compiled by Miss
Harriet Mason Kilburn	PERSON	, is a year-book with a page for notes for each week and a corresponding page of selected quotations .

		Miss
Kilburn	PERSON	has worked upon the theory that the spirit of fellowship is the dominating note of the time ; and the quotations that interpret this spirit have been drawn from the writers of all ages , with a series from
Morris	PERSON	's '' Dream of John Ball '' as a thread of connection among them . ''

		The Sense and Sentiment of Thackeray '' -LRB- Har - per -RRB- has been culled by Mrs.
Charles Mason Fairbanks	PERSON	from the novels and correspondence .

		Thackeray , as Mrs.

		522 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, A new anthology for the man who smokes has heen arranged hy Mr.
Joseph Knight	PERSON	, and is pub - lished in a small volume with photogravure frontis - piece by
Messrs. H. M. Caldwell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is entitled `` A Smoker 's Reveries , '' and contains verses new and old , including many written especially for this volume .

		Miscellaneous Holiday Books .

		Hunters who care for the history of their sport and have not already possessed themselves of the Messrs.
Baillie-Grobman	PERSON	's folio edition of '' The Master of Game '' will grow both wise and happy over the attractive smaller edition which the same editors have prepared of this work -LRB-
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This is the oldest English book on hunting ; for the original manuscript was written in
1387	DATE	, and though it was by
Gaston de Foix	PERSON	and in French , it was translated twenty years afterward , with additions , by
Edward	ORGANIZATION	, second
Duke of York	ORGANIZATION	, in the leisure of his imprisonment for unamiable designs on
Henry IV	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	supplies the foreword to this reprint .

		The prologue argues that through the virtues of their sport hunters escape the seven deadly sins , and develope '' great gentleness and nobleness of heart . ''

		The editors have shown wis - dom in their modification of Chaucerian English ; for the text is intelligible , and still spicy with strange words .

		Although many of the points about boar , fox , otter , etc. , have not been dreamed of in the natural philosophy of Agassiz , -- for instance , that '' harts sing in their language '' and have '' a bone within the heart which hath great medicine , '' -- there are a few modernly accurate characterizations , such as this : '' If any beast hath the devil 's spirit in him , without doubt it is the cat , both the wild and the tame . ''

		The remaining pages of the two hundred are taken up with directions for '' finding the hare , '' '' moving the hart , '' making the assembly '' that men call gathering , '' and training hounds and mastiffs .

		An elaborate appendix supplies information for both antiquarian and hunter .

		The twenty-four fas - cinating illustrations in black-and-white are taken from the illuminations of a French manuscript of the fifteenth century , which is one of the treasures of the
Bibliotheque Nationale	ORGANIZATION	in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The holiday gift-seeker in search of unique and out-of-the-way volumes may find what he wants in '' Angelus Silesius , '' a selection from the rhymes of the seventeenth century German mystic , translated in the original metres by Dr.
Paul Cams	PERSON	-LRB-
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		An interesting preface introduces the reader to
Johannes Scheffler	PERSON	, better known as Angelus Silesius .

		The original version of the rhymes is given with the translations .

		A quaint frontispiece reproduced from the first edition , rubricated rulings on every page , and an artistic cover , together with handy size , are the embellish - ments of the volume .

		From the same publishers , in equally attractive form , comes another odd vol - ume , '' Edward 's Dream : The Philosophy of a Humorist , '' translated from the German of
Wilhelm Busch	PERSON	and edited by Dr.
Paul Carus	PERSON	.

		Readers of ''
Fliegenden Blatter	PERSON	'' may be familiar with
Busch	PERSON	's comic verses and drawings .

		Even such will enjoy Dr.
Carus	PERSON	's account of
Busch	PERSON	, his discussion of the significance of humor , and his '' appreciation '' of
Busch	PERSON	's light yet meaningful solution of some of the problems of life and philosophy .

		Several books of recipes in attractive form suggest themselves as suitable gifts for the perplexed house - wife , always searching for some new and attractive dish . '' '

		Dame Curtsey 's ' Book of Recipes '' -LRB-
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is , like the rest of the same popular series , at once practical and comprehensive .

		There are recipes galore , both standard and novel , together with much other practical information , supplemented by a generous supply of pertinent and attractive illus - trations .

		Handy size and odd binding are the book 's additional recommendations to those in search of a gift .

		-- '' The Up-to-date Sandwich Book '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , compiled by Miss
Eva Greene Fuller	PERSON	, suggests won - derful possibilities for varying luncheon and after - noon tea menus , for
Miss Fuller	ORGANIZATION	has discovered four hundred different ways of making a sandwich .

		The recipes are attractively printed on tinted paper , with borders in color ; and the cover , gay in hues , is adorned by a Parisian young person with a huge picnic basket on her arm .

		-- Miss
Helen S. Wright	PERSON	has turned her attention to reviving a lost art . ''

		Old-Time Recipes for
Home-Made Wines	ORGANIZATION	, Cor - dials , and Liqueurs '' -LRB-
Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- tells how to make awonderful variety ofdelicious old-fashioned beverages from tried and treasured formulas .

		Mar - ginal drawings in color and a decorated cover bring this book also into the category of gift volumes .

		Mrs.
Fanny Purdy Palmer	PERSON	's little volume of sonnets -LRB-
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is artistically printed on hand-made paper , with especially designed initials .

		There are two groups of verses , '' Sonnets of
California	LOCATION	'' and '' Post Meridian , '' each contain - ing fourteen numbers .

		-- A new edition of Mrs.
Agness Greene Foster	PERSON	's `` You and Some Others , '' from the same publishers , contains a number of new poems , and all the verses have been rearranged under appropriate headings .

		The decorations of Mr.
Will Jenkins	PERSON	, and the special typography and paper of the first edition , have been retained .

		Another of
Wagner	PERSON	's music-dramas , '' The Val - kyrie , '' has been retold by Dr.
Oliver Huckel	PERSON	in blank verse , -- a , narrative paraphrase of the drama 's action , dialogue , and setting that avoids the rawness of the usual libretto and at the same time conveys more information .

		Rubricated headings , frontis - piece , and decorated binding are the holiday fea - tures .

		-LRB-
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ''
Dame Curtsey	PERSON	's Book of Etiquette '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , by

		It gives all the latest decrees of Dame Fashion by calls , cards , invitations , parties of all sorts , and many allied subjects , simply told and conveniently arranged for reference .

		THE DIAL 523 Some four years ago the
Chappie Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		began to collect the favorite songs of the American people . ''

		Heart Songs , '' a five hundred page vol - ume , is the result .

		It contains hymns , rag-time tunes , operatic selections , college songs , love-songs , sea-songs , lullabies , -- in short , songs of all conceiv - able kinds , arranged , apparently , in a hit-or-miss fashion , to emphasize their wide variety .

		As some twenty-five thousand suggestions were considered in compiling the volume , it may fairly be supposed to contain at least a few of every one 's favorite melodies .

		Miss
Marguerite Merington	PERSON	, through whose good offices ''
Cranford	LOCATION	'' has been delightfully drama - tized , has now made '' The Vicar of Wakefield '' into a play .

		A Text-Book of the History of Architecture , '' by Professor
A. D. F. Hamlin	PERSON	, is now republished in an eighth edition by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The revisions incorporated into this new text are few and of minor importance .

		The '' First Folio ''

Clarke	PERSON	, is enlarged by the publication of three new volumes -- '' Titus Andronicus , '' ''
Tymon	PERSON	of

Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by President
Richard C. Maclaurin	PERSON	, gives the substance of a course of lectures delivered a year ago at the
American Museum of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	upon the
Jessup Founda	ORGANIZATION	- tion .

		They are popular in their mode of presentation and at the same time abreast of the latest developments in the science of optics .

		The
John Mc Bride Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a condensed and modernized version of ``
Bradford	PERSON	's History of the
Plymouth	LOCATION	Settlement , '' edited by Mrs.
Valerian Paget	PERSON	.

		Aii introduction gives the history of this '' the most precious manuscript on earth , '' as Senator
Hoar	PERSON	called it , preceding the statement of fact by a rhetorical flour - ish that is not particularly profitable .

		We have grave doubts concerning the advisability of such a modified 524 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, text as this , but it will prove its excuse for being if it really attracts a company of new readers to this foundation-document of American history .

		Mr.
W. Dawson Johnston	PERSON	, Librarian of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, is preparing for the
United States Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	a report on Special Collections in Libraries in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It is planned to make the publi - cation a record of all special collections in public lib - raries which are of extraordinary value either because of their completeness or because of the rarity of their contents .

		In ''
Harper	PERSON	's Library of Living Thought '' we have the following new volumes : '' Christianity and the New Idealism , '' by Professor
Eucken	PERSON	; `` Revelation and In - spiration , '' by Dr.
Reinhold Seeberg	PERSON	, and ''
Paul	PERSON	and Jesus , '' by Professor
Johannes Weiss	PERSON	.

		This '' Library '' seems to be running mainly to theological discussion , although literature and science have not been altogether neglected .

		Three exceptionally interesting reprints of English literature are now published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		One is a reproduction of the
1768	DATE	edition of Gray 's poems , with a few later pieces .

		Another is an exact reprint of the
Keats	PERSON	of
1820	DATE	, including `` Lamia , '' '' Isabella , '' '' Hyperion , '' the great '' Odes , '' and other poems .

		The third is ''
Peacock	PERSON	's Memoirs of Shelley with
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's Letters to
Peacock	LOCATION	, '' now edited by Mr.
H. F. B. Brett-Smith	PERSON	.


Adolph Growoll	PERSON	, long and favorably known for his bibliographical and historical work , and for many years past the managing editor of the '' Publishers ' Weekly '' in
New York	LOCATION	, died in that city on the seventh of this month , aged fifty-nine years .

		He was the author of '' The Booksellers ' Library and How to Use it , '' '' The Profession of Bookselling , '' '' American Book Clubs , '' ''
Booktrade Bibliography	ORGANIZATION	in the
United States	LOCATION	, '' and a number of other useful works .

		A `` mature treatment of history combined with simplicity of language and diction '' is offered in Pro- fessor
V. A. Renouf	PERSON	's '' Outlines of General History '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- as edited , with a few changes of minor importance , for American students by Professor
William Starr Myers	PERSON	.

		The work has maps and illustrations , and provides , by differences of type , for a shorter and a longer course .

		Originally prepared for Chinese schools , the book seems well fitted for general use .

		General
A. W. Greeley	PERSON	's '' Handbook of Polar Dis - coveries , '' first published about fifteen years ago , now reappears in a fourth -LRB- revised -RRB- edition .

		The author 's comment upon the subject just now of lively interest is as follows : `` Phenomenal as was the success of
Cook	ORGANIZATION	, and unsurpassed as were the final marches of
Peary	PERSON	, the writer from his personal knowledge of the
Smith Sound	ORGANIZATION	environment , and of both explorers , finds himself constrained to give full credit to their reports , though
Cook	PERSON	's are bitterly contested . ''

		Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish this work .

		We have frequently commented upon the amazing industry of Dr.
Paul Carus	PERSON	, in his capacity as a writer of philosophical books and editor of two philosophical periodicals .

		His industry is impressed upon us anew by the little book called `` Philosophy as a Science , '' which has just been issued by him through the
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This volume , after an introduc - tion in which the author sets forth the leading ideas of the monistic doctrine which he represents , gives us brief summaries of all his published writings , which amount to no less than 48 books and 959 editorial articles .

		All of these writings are carefully indexed , which makes it possible to find out readily just what Dr.
Carus	PERSON	thinks about any given subject , and his ideas are apt to be both well-considered and weighty .

		The introductory essay is to be particularly commended , because it gives suc - cinctly what has been said over-diffusely in many thou - sands of pages .

		Three-quarters of a century is a long time , in our rapidly shifting American cities , for a business house to remain in one location ; yet this is the period during which Messrs. Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	have had their quarters at 254
Washington	LOCATION	street ,
Boston	LOCATION	, from whence they have lately '' gone up higher '' -- to
Beacon Hill	LOCATION	, with its fine flavor of aristocracy and its genuine
Boston	LOCATION	east winds .

		The old Cabot mansion , at the corner of Beacon and Joy streets , now handsomely and commo - diously houses this historic publishing company , which , as the successor to the firm of
Hilliard , Gray & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and as the more recent purchaser of the business and literary property of
Roberts Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, has enjoyed an increasingly prosperous existence of a century and a quarter , being in fact lineally descended from the first publishing house established in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		More than twelve hundred titles are to be counted in the general catalogue of the firm , and many a name illustrious in our literature graces its pages .

		We hope the house will long continue to prosper and to uphold the best tradi - tions of the .

		American publishing trade .
